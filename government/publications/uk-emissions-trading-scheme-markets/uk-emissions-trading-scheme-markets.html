<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The UK Emissions Trading Scheme (<abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>) went live on 1 January 2021, replacing the UK’s participation in the <abbr title="European Emissions Trading System">EU ETS</abbr>. Under the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol, electricity generators in Northern Ireland remained within the <abbr title="European Emissions Trading System">EU ETS</abbr>.</p>

<p>The 4 administrations of the UK – the members of the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority – have established the scheme to increase the climate ambition of the UK’s carbon pricing policy, while mitigating the risk of carbon leakage through free allowances. The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> will promote cost-effective decarbonisation, allowing businesses to cut carbon emissions where it is cheapest to do so.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/participating-in-the-uk-ets/participating-in-the-uk-ets">Read further guidance on participating in the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> markets</h2>

<p>This page explains the supply of allowances in the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> in the early years of the scheme. It sets out background information on the functioning of the auctions and secondary market, free allocation, and the market stability mechanisms that the ETS Authority has in place to support smooth market operation. It also signals that the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority will monitor the market closely as it develops and will actively consider at the earliest opportunity actions to support smooth market operation.</p>

<p>Should excessive market instability compromise the scheme, the Authority may consider further interventions beyond the cost containment mechanism (<abbr title="cost containment mechanism">CCM</abbr>) aimed at calming instability, without affecting the integrity of the scheme. These could include putting in place rules to require participants to manage or limit their UK allowance holdings and limiting the size of auction bids.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Auctions</h2>

<p><abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> auctions began on 19 May 2021 and are hosted by <abbr title="Intercontinental Exchange">ICE</abbr> Futures Europe (<abbr title="Intercontinental Exchange">ICE</abbr>). Auctions are held every 2 weeks, as set out in the <abbr title="Intercontinental Exchange">ICE</abbr> auction calendar. The total number of allowances available for auction in 2022, as set out in the auction calendar, is around 81 million.</p>

<p>The 2022 auction calendar was first published on 3 November 2021. <abbr title="Intercontinental Exchange">ICE</abbr> published an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.theice.com/publicdocs/circulars/22128.pdf" rel="external">updated 2022 auction calendar</a> on 6 September 2022. This is to take account of the updated figure for aviation free allocation, with 803,500 surplus allowances set aside but not required for 2022 aviation free allocation. In line with the legislated rules of the scheme, these allowances which are not needed for free allocation should instead be brought to the market via auctions. These additional allowances will be spread across auctions to the end of the year from and including the 21 September 2022 auction.</p>

<h2>Determining the Auction Clearing Price</h2>

<p>Auction clearing price rules determine the prices paid by participants in <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> auctions.</p>

<p>Regulation 7 of the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Auctioning Regulations 2021 No 484 sets out how the auction clearing price is calculated by the auction platform.</p>

<p>a) The auction clearing price is the price of the bid at which the sum of the volumes bid matches or exceeds the volume of allowances auctioned.</p>

<p>b) Where the price calculated through this methodology would be significantly below the price on the secondary market prevailing during and immediately before the bidding window, the auction clearing price becomes the price of the lowest bid that is not significantly below the prevailing secondary market price (this process is illustrated visually in Figure 1).</p>

<p>c) Before the auction starts, the auction platform must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>decide on the methodology for determining whether the clearing price is significantly below the prevailing secondary market price</li>
  <li>determine what the prevailing price in the secondary market is</li>
  <li>consult the auctioneer (<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>) and notify the FCA about this methodology. The methodology used by the auction platform is not public information</li>
</ul>

<p>d) There is also an auction reserve price, currently set at £22, below which bids will not be accepted.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6 October </span> 2021 auction</h3>

<p>An auction of 5,187,500 allowances was held by <abbr title="Intercontinental Exchange">ICE</abbr> on 6 October 2021. The auction partially cleared, with 4,149,000 allowances being successfully sold at the auction clearing price of £60.00. This is the first time that a <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> auction has partially cleared, with 10 previous <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> auctions having fully cleared.</p>

<p>Bids that were below £60.00 were determined, according to the methodology employed by <abbr title="Intercontinental Exchange">ICE</abbr>, to be significantly below the prevailing secondary market price. £60.00 therefore became the auction clearing price and bids below this level were unsuccessful, resulting in 1,038,500 allowances remaining unsold.</p>

<p>In line with the scheme legislation, these 1,038,500 allowances have been allocated across the next four auctions on 20 October, 3 November, 17 November and 1 December.</p>

<p><abbr title="Intercontinental Exchange">ICE</abbr> published an updated auction calendar reflecting the partially cleared 6 October auction on 8 October.  However, the auction calendar was further revised following the addition of surplus aviation free allocation allowances and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.theice.com/publicdocs/circulars/21166.pdf" rel="external">published by <abbr title="Intercontinental Exchange">ICE</abbr></a> on 19 October.</p>

<p>Auctioning these allowances will help to support the liquidity of the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> and enable operators to build allowance positions ahead of the compliance deadline of 30 April 2022.</p>

<h2>The secondary market</h2>

<p>The first trade date of the UK Allowance Futures Contract will coincide with the launch of the first auction on Wednesday 19 May 2021, with the UK Allowance Daily Futures following on Friday 21 May 2021. These products allow market participants to trade contracts for the delivery of allowances on specified dates in the future.</p>

<h2>Supply of allowances</h2>

<p>Total emissions from the UK’s <abbr title="European Emissions Trading System">EU ETS</abbr> participants in 2019 were just under 130 million tonnes of <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> equivalent (down from 236 <abbr title="metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent">MtCO2e</abbr> in 2013 at the start of the <abbr title="European Emissions Trading System">EU ETS</abbr> Phase III). The <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>-19 pandemic has affected activity in 2020 and continues to do so in 2021. Provisional UK traded sector verified emissions in 2020 were just under 105 million tonnes of <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> equivalent.</p>

<p>The cap sets the limit on allowances that can be created each year: as set out in Chapter 2 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2020/9780348209761/contents" rel="external">The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Order 2020</a>, this is 155,671,581 in 2021. We expect an adequate supply of allowances in the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> over the course of 2021 and 2022, based on the cap set out in the legislation. The impact assessment published alongside the design of the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> in June 2020 shows the analysis underpinning this expectation.</p>

<h3>Net zero consistent cap review</h3>

<p>The UK government and devolved administrations have committed to reviewing and consulting on the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>’s cap and setting a trajectory for it that is consistent with our emissions reduction commitments.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority will consult in the coming months on the trajectory for the scheme’s cap. We acknowledge both the updated advice of the Climate Change Committee, issued in June, and the UK government’s Net Zero Strategy. We are analysing options and will bring forward proposals as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Changes to the cap will be implemented in 2023, or 2024 at the latest, and we will communicate the specifics of policy changes to market participants well in advance of implementation.</p>

<p>As part of the consultation, to ensure we consider changes in a rounded way, we also intend to continue our review of free allocation in the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>, which we started with a call for evidence in spring 2021.</p>

<h3>Free allocation</h3>

<p>A portion of allowances is issued for free. The Allocation Table, which sets out stationary installations’ entitlement to free allowances for scheme years 2021-2025, is expected to be published by Wednesday 12 May. There will be approximately 40 million allowances allocated for free to stationary installations in 2021. The Aviation Allocation Table will be published in June and will detail free allocation entitlements for the 2021-2025 period, for eligible operators who submitted an application. The deadline for aviation operators to submit an application was 31 March 2021 and these applications are currently being processed. Allowances for aviation Free Allocation and the New Entrants’ Reserve are also part of the overall cap. Allocations will be issued to Operator and Aviation Operator Holding Accounts in the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Registry as soon as possible after the respective allocation tables have been published.</p>

<p>Free allocations for 2022 will be issued by 28 February 2022 for stationary installations and aircraft operators – well ahead of the 2021 compliance deadline.</p>

<p>As per the current legislation, with allocated free allowances beneath the industry cap, these additional allowances that were not allocated to operators are currently intended to be held to mitigate potential future application of a cross-sectoral correction factor in the 2026-2030 allocation period. The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority is considering options for these allowances being brought to market and will provide additional information on GOV.UK in due course.</p>

<h2>Market stability mechanisms</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority will monitor all <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> markets closely, working with our regulatory and operational partners to ensure we have a complete picture of their operation. This will include tracking of registry holdings, auction outcomes, secondary market reporting, and any impact of <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> on other markets.</p>

<p>In the event of excessive market instability , including persistently high price levels or volatility, the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority will actively consider at the earliest opportunity actions in response to how the markets are functioning.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> has important design features to guard against instability in the early years of the market including an Auction Reserve Price (<abbr title="Auction Reserve Price">ARP</abbr>) and the <abbr title="cost containment mechanism">CCM</abbr>. The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> auction regulations set the <abbr title="Auction Reserve Price">ARP</abbr> (the minimum price for bids in <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> auctions) at £22. At the other end of the scale, the <abbr title="cost containment mechanism">CCM</abbr> is intended to mitigate sustained high prices.</p>

<h2>Cost Containment Mechanism</h2>

<p>The operation of the <abbr title="cost containment mechanism">CCM</abbr> is set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2021/9780348220049/memorandum/contents" rel="external">explanatory memorandum to the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> auctioning regulations</a>. The <abbr title="cost containment mechanism">CCM</abbr> is more responsive than its equivalent in the <abbr title="European Emissions Trading System">EU ETS</abbr>, providing a powerful tool for the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority to intervene if prices are elevated for a sustained period. In 2021, the <abbr title="cost containment mechanism">CCM</abbr> will be triggered if the average allowance price on the secondary futures market is double the average price for the preceding 2-year period, for 3 consecutive months.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority will update the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/participating-in-the-uk-ets/participating-in-the-uk-ets"><abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> guidance page</a> on a monthly basis with the price at which the <abbr title="cost containment mechanism">CCM</abbr> would be triggered.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="cost containment mechanism">CCM</abbr> is triggered, the Authority will consider the most appropriate interventions given the market context and will implement them in a timely manner. The interventions the Authority may take in this instance are changing distribution of allowances to be auctioned within the year or increasing the number of allowances to be auctioned within the year by bringing forward allowances from future years, releasing allowances from the New Entrants’ Reserve or releasing allowances from the market stability mechanism account. As indicated above, the Authority may also consider additional interventions should the circumstances warrant further or earlier action.</p>
