<p>This  annex is a summary of UK Health Security Agency analysis presented to the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.</p>

<h2>Introduction and methods</h2>

<p>This analysis is to estimate the difference in the prevented number of hospital or intensive care unit (<abbr title="intensive care unit">ICU</abbr>) admissions from use of a variant vaccine compared to wild-type vaccine over the autumn and winter of 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p>The benefits of using a matched booster will depend on the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The hospital or <abbr title="intensive care unit">ICU</abbr> admission rate in the absence of boosting. This can be estimated from rates seen in SARI-Watch (reference 1) over the past 6 months assuming this is related to a waned state in many. We assume a constant risk over autumn and winter 2022 to 2023 as we do not know when a wave may occur.</li>
  <li>The waned vaccine effectiveness (<abbr title="vaccine effectiveness">VE</abbr>) of 3 doses and increase in effectiveness from using a wild type and a variant vaccine. This can be estimated from data on the waned <abbr title="vaccine effectiveness">VE</abbr> of dose 3 and an assumption that a further dose would restore effectiveness to the post dose 3 level (reference 2). For the variant vaccine, to estimate increase in <abbr title="vaccine effectiveness">VE</abbr>, the fold difference in neutralising titres for this vaccine compared to wild type (taken to be about 2) (references 3 and 4) is used and the increase estimated based on the paper of Cromer and others (reference 5).</li>
  <li>The delay to the start of vaccination from using a variant vaccine assuming it would not be available for all those eligible at the start of the programme. It is assumed it may be delayed so that September vaccinations are delayed to 1/3 being given in October, 1/3 in November, and 1/3 in December (1/3, 1/3, 1/3).</li>
  <li>The length of period we make the comparison for. Taken to be 7 months (September to March) on the assumption we are interested in the winter. Note that an October to April scenario would give the same results.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>Figure 1 gives an example of applying the parameters to the hospitalisation incidence in the 50 to 64 age group where there is a delay for the variant vaccine and where the variant vaccine has effectiveness at 92% compared to wild type at 85% for no booster at and 60%. To get the whole winter incidence the incidence each month is summed.</p>

<h4>Figure 1: modelled monthly hospitalisation incidence with no booster (dashed line), with a wild-type vaccine given all in September (dotted line) and with a variant vaccine given with delay (solid line)</h4>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/159579/fig-1-modelled-monthly-hospitalisation-incidence.png"></div></figure>

<h4>Text description of Figure 1</h4>

<p>The figure shows 3 possible scenarios for the upcoming incidence of hospitalisations in 50 to 64 year olds from September 2022 to March 2023.</p>

<p>The first is where no autumn booster is given. This shows a constant monthly incidence of 40 hospitalisations per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The second scenario is where a wild-type vaccine is introduced in September to all of this age group and shows in those vaccinated the incidence drops to 12 per 100,000 until November and then gradually increases to 28 per 100,00 by March as the vaccine protection wanes.</p>

<p>The final scenario shows a projection for when a variant vaccine is introduced with a delay, and this shows incidence falling from 10 per 100,000 in September to 6.4 per 100,000 in December and then an increase with waning of protection to 14.4 per 100,00 by March 2023.</p>

<p>Comments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if there are delays, they may negate benefits of variant vaccines within the winter period (but some benefit may remain beyond winter)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>age 65 to 74 years potential benefits of up to approximately 78 per 100,000 vaccinations (1 from 1,280 doses)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>age 75+ years potential benefits of up to 235 hospitalisations per 100,000 vaccinations (1 from 425 doses)</p>
