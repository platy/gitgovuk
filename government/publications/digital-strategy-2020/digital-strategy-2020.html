<h2>Why we need a digital strategy for the UK</h2>

<p>The digital sector is vital to the way that we live and work in the UK, and its continued growth is of strategic importance to our wealth, wellbeing and security.</p>

<p>Digital technology and the data that drives it have provided a lifeline for our economy and society during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, while some parts of the digital sector have seen record growth, others have been severely affected by the pandemic. Some parts of the sector will recover and thrive without government action. Nevertheless, government has an important role to play in supporting continued growth in those parts of the sector that need it, as well as setting the conditions for new parts of the sector to succeed.</p>

<p>After this crisis we intend to build back better. This means that we need to ensure that growth in the digital sector is spread across all of the UK, and that it supports the other key national priorities we have committed to, including our ambitions to achieve Net Zero by 2050, to provide inclusive opportunities for people of all backgrounds, and to take full advantage of the benefits associated with leaving the EU.</p>

<h2>Our vision</h2>

<p>We want:</p>

<div class="example">
<p>a thriving, fast-growing digital sector, which is an engine of economic growth and employment opportunity, and a pillar of both our prosperity and security</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p>growth in the digital sector to be aligned with our broader vision for the UK, including our commitment to produce net zero greenhouse gasses by 2050, and create an inclusive economy with equal opportunities for everyone, regardless of background</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p>this growth in the digital sector to promote levelling up opportunities across all of the UK. We want to enable entrepreneurs, business and employees in the digital sector to stay in and enhance their own communities, develop regional expertise and advantages, and while exporting our digital products and services to the world</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p>the digital sector to be underpinned by public trust, which will be enabled by increased stability and clarity, and a positive role for the digital sector in society.  secure public trust</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p>to ensure that the UK is at the cutting edge of digital innovation. We will support the development of flourishing digital sub-sectors that will provide a strong basis for future growth, enhance our security and improve our international competitive advantage</p>
</div>

<h2>The digital landscape</h2>

<p>The digital sector is critical for the prosperity and security of the United Kingdom. The sector is already a significant part of the economy - in 2018 it contributed £149bn to the economy, which accounts for 7.7% of Gross Value Added (GVA). It is also one of the country’s fastest growing sectors - on average it grew at a rate one-and-a-half times faster than the UK economy since 2010.</p>

<p>More than being just an engine of our economy, innovation in the digital sector is also playing a key role in helping the UK deal with serious challenges. During the pandemic, digital businesses helped us stay connected to our colleagues and enabled us to work from home. The sector is also improving our resilience by creating better digital options for individuals to access essential services, and helping us to achieve our net zero targets by driving innovation in sustainability and decarbonisation.</p>

<p>The UK also already has a strong ecosystem to support innovation, from incubators and accelerators to the attractive investment environment fostered by venture capital, big tech companies and institutional investors. In fact, the UK is third in the world for producing successful digital companies - behind only the US and China - and outperforms its European peers in both the number of start-ups with $1 billion dollar valuations (so called Unicorns) and the scale of VC investment.</p>

<p>Generally, the UK’s business environment is viewed positively by companies. We have an effective pro-competitive system, a clear tax regime, open, stable, predicable regulation and a transparent UK legal system, especially compared to the complex USA system of federal, state and local requirements.</p>

<p>However, a combination of existing challenges and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic mean that there is a clear case for government measures to support the sector. An increased demand for goods and services in the digital sector, as well as the relative ease with which workers in the sector have been able to switch to working from home, have meant that some parts of the sector have grown rapidly. Nevertheless, this is not the whole story. Average revenues in the sector have dropped by 38%, and, early-stage start-ups in particular have been affected by a reduction in available investments. To achieve our vision for a productive, inclusive and sustainable recovery from the pandemic, as well as long-term growth in the digital sector, we need to address the following challenges:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>The overall digital investment and innovation environment</strong></p>

<p>High risk aversion and uncertainty about potential returns is leading to record amounts of ‘dry powder’ in Venture Capital, cash reserves held by big tech companies and forgone opportunities for FDI and commercialisation of R&amp;D. This creates access to finance and innovation challenges for start-ups, scale-ups and businesses at all stages of the investment cycle, and affects the type of innovation start-ups engage in, focussing on sectors with track records of success, investment and acquisition. This creates real limitations in the sector’s ability to advance substantial technological change.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Regional digital investment and innovation</strong></p>

<p>Agglomeration benefits and track records of past success have led to a concentration of the digital sector in London and the South East, while innovation opportunities in other regions of the country have been neglected. A significant proportion of the tech and cyber sectors’ success is heavily biased to London vs. the rest of the country, with 50% of digital sector GVA generated in London; companies in London received 76% of tech VC investment in 2018, and 55% of high value scale-ups are based here. The effects of the pandemic have also caused severe challenges for regional innovation ecosystems.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Digital innovation and investment in new sub-sectors</strong></p>

<p>In any circumstances, it can be difficult for very new digital sub-sectors to take off and establish the track record of value-creation and return on investment needed to attract funding and other types of institutional support. During COVID-19, this is especially hard. That’s why in some cases, the Government needs to take measures to set the right conditions for innovative digital sub-sectors to grow, especially when they are important for our strategic objective, including trust and security, sustainability and inclusion, and innovation itself.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Changing international environment</strong></p>

<p>The digital sector, innovation and emerging technologies are becoming increasingly important on the international stage. The UKs vision for international engagement and collaboration, as set out in the Integrated Review, depends on an openness to international trade, investment and the exchange of ideas. This is especially important for the digital sector. However, we also need to recognise the role of the digital sector in our national security, and the risks that may be associated with that openness.  In order to drive growth in our digital sector, we need to continue to provide the best opportunities for inward investment and international exports, while strengthening global collaboration and mitigating against key risks.</p>
</div>

<p>The combination of these problems is leading to lower levels of investment and activity in the productivity-enhancing and value-creating innovation that we need to realise the potential of the digital revolution for the UK’s economy and society. They create a clear case for government support to create the right environment for the digital sector to innovate and grow, while ensuring that digital growth is inclusive, sustainable and a powerhouse for the UK economy in the future.</p>
