<p>We know we need to do more to recover nature and increase the benefits it provides to our people and our economy.</p>

<p>Defra and Natural England are bringing together partners, legislation, and funding to create the Nature Recovery Network (<abbr title="Nature Recovery Network">NRN</abbr>). Together, we will deliver the Network by restoring and enhancing England’s wildlife-rich places.</p>

<h2>Creating a national network</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Nature Recovery Network">NRN</abbr> will be a national network of wildlife-rich places. Our aim is to expand, improve and connect these places across our cities, towns, countryside and coast.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Nature Recovery Network">NRN</abbr> is a major commitment in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/25-year-environment-plan">government’s 25 Year Environment Plan</a> and enacted by the Environment Act 2021.</p>

<h2>What the <abbr title="Nature Recovery Network">NRN</abbr> will achieve</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Nature Recovery Network">NRN</abbr> will help us deal with 3 of the biggest challenges we face: biodiversity loss, climate change and wellbeing.</p>

<p>Establishing the <abbr title="Nature Recovery Network">NRN</abbr> will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enhance sites designated for nature conservation and other wildlife-rich places - newly created and restored wildlife-rich habitats, corridors and stepping-stones will help wildlife populations to grow and move</li>
  <li>improve the landscape’s resilience to climate change, providing natural solutions to reduce carbon and manage flood risk, and sustaining vital ecosystems such as improved soil, clean water and clean air</li>
  <li>reinforce the natural, geological and cultural diversity of our landscapes, and protect our historic natural environment</li>
  <li>enable us to enjoy and connect with nature where we live, work and play - benefiting our health and wellbeing</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<abbr title="Nature Recovery Network">NRN</abbr> objectives</h3>

<p>Through our work to create the <abbr title="Nature Recovery Network">NRN</abbr>, by 2042 we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>restore 75% of protected sites on land (including freshwaters) to favourable condition so nature can thrive</li>
  <li>create or restore 500,000 hectares of additional wildlife-rich habitat outside of protected sites</li>
  <li>recover threatened and iconic animal and plant species by providing more, diverse and better-connected habitats</li>
  <li>support work to increase woodland cover</li>
  <li>achieve a range of environmental, economic and social benefits, such as carbon capture, flood management, clean water, pollination and recreation</li>
</ul>

<h2>How we will set up the <abbr title="Nature Recovery Network">NRN</abbr>
</h2>

<p>To set up and achieve our objectives for the <abbr title="Nature Recovery Network">NRN</abbr> we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use mapping and data - especially Local Nature Recovery Strategies (<abbr title="Local Nature Recovery Strategies">LNRS</abbr>) to effectively target action and investment in nature</li>
  <li>integrate - our goals for nature with funding streams, policy and statutory duties that will incentivise the restoration and creation of habitats and help deliver the <abbr title="Nature Recovery Network">NRN</abbr>
</li>
  <li>collaborate - develop supporting partnerships to use these tools to deliver action for nature</li>
</ul>

<h3>Use mapping and data</h3>

<p>Local Nature Recovery Strategies (<abbr title="Local Nature Recovery Strategies">LNRS</abbr>) are a new mandatory system of spatial strategies for nature established by the Environment Act 2021. They are designed as tools to encourage more coordinated practical and focused action and investment in nature.</p>

<p>There are expected to be around 50 county-based <abbr title="Local Nature Recovery Strategies">LNRS</abbr> which will cover the whole of England. These strategies will help us to map the <abbr title="Nature Recovery Network">NRN</abbr> locally and nationally.</p>

<h3>Integrate goals for nature with funding streams, policy and statutory duties</h3>

<p>We are establishing a range of funding and duties to underpin the <abbr title="Nature Recovery Network">NRN</abbr>. This includes Countryside Stewardship and 3 future schemes that will reward <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-land-management-schemes-overview">environmental land management</a>.</p>

<p>The government has announced a range of funding opportunities for nature. Central to this is the £640 million Nature for Climate Fund. The fund supports:</p>

<ul>
  <li>creation, restoration and management of woodland and peatland habitats</li>
  <li>a tripling of afforestation rates across England</li>
  <li>restoration of 35,000 hectares of peatland by 2025</li>
</ul>

<p>The £80 million Green Recovery Challenge Fund is creating a pipeline of nature-based projects to restore nature, tackle climate change and connect people with the natural environment. It is helping to address environmental renewal and sustain and build capacity in the environment sector.</p>

<p>We are also broadening the funding base for the <abbr title="Nature Recovery Network">NRN</abbr>, for example by encouraging private and third sector businesses to invest in the natural environment. In particular, we are incentivising action for businesses in the development sector by mandating biodiversity net gain.</p>

<h3>Create partnerships</h3>

<p>Working together, using a range of tools and incentives, is essential to delivering the <abbr title="Nature Recovery Network">NRN</abbr>. We are working in partnership with organisations and across sectors, sharing skills, knowledge and resources, to help achieve the objectives of the <abbr title="Nature Recovery Network">NRN</abbr>.</p>

<p>This partnership working includes government, landowners and managers, businesses, local communities and conservation groups.</p>

<p>We have set up the cross-sectoral national <a class="govuk-link" href="#nrn-delivery-partnership"><abbr title="Nature Recovery Network">NRN</abbr> Delivery Partnership</a> to support partnership working.</p>

<h3>Legislation to support the <abbr title="Nature Recovery Network">NRN</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The Environment Act 2021 underpins the government’s approach to establishing the <abbr title="Nature Recovery Network">NRN</abbr>. The act:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sets the framework for at least one legally binding biodiversity target</li>
  <li>establishes spatial mapping and planning tools to identify existing and potential habitat for wildlife and agrees local priorities for enhancing biodiversity in every area of England (<abbr title="Local Nature Recovery Strategies">LNRS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>creates duties and incentives, including mandatory biodiversity net gain</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<abbr title="Nature Recovery Network">NRN</abbr> Delivery Partnership</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Nature Recovery Network">NRN</abbr> Delivery Partnership is a broad network of cross-sectoral organisations who work together to carry out action for nature. They are supported by the <a class="govuk-link" href="#partnership-management-group">partnership management group</a>.</p>

<p>Organisations within any sector who are willing to commit to nature’s recovery can join this partnership. This includes private business, charities and the government sector.</p>

<p>Natural England will encourage partners to pledge support to achieve the objectives of the <abbr title="Nature Recovery Network">NRN</abbr>. These pledges will vary depending on the organisation. Examples include providing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>land for nature recovery</li>
  <li>financial investment</li>
  <li>advice, time or expertise</li>
</ul>

<p>Partners will have networking opportunities, including a regular <abbr title="Nature Recovery Network">NRN</abbr> conference, workshops and meetings.</p>
