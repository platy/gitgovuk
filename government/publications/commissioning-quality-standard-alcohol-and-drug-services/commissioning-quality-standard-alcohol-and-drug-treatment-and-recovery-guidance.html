<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-drugs-phase-two-report">Dame Carol Black’s review of drugs (part 2)</a> recommended that the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) should develop a national commissioning quality standard (<abbr title="commissioning quality standards">CQS</abbr>) for local authorities. The <abbr title="commissioning quality standards">CQS</abbr> would clarify the commissioning process that local authorities should follow and specify the treatment services that should be available in each local area, based on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/drug-misuse-and-dependence-uk-guidelines-on-clinical-management">UK clinical guidelines on drug treatment</a>.</p>

<p>This <abbr title="commissioning quality standards">CQS</abbr> was developed by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (<abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>) with the help of an expert advisory group of external stakeholders. We have designed the <abbr title="commissioning quality standards">CQS</abbr> to guide processes, partnerships and systems for effective commissioning of alcohol and drug treatment services. It will also help to improve treatment access, outcomes and quality for people affected by problem alcohol and drug use.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="commissioning quality standards">CQS</abbr> is a high-level framework and we will support its implementation with more products on some of the topics and issues it covers. You should also use the <abbr title="commissioning quality standards">CQS</abbr> with other products that support implementation of the government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/from-harm-to-hope-a-10-year-drugs-plan-to-cut-crime-and-save-lives">drug strategy</a>. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/drugs-strategy-guidance-for-local-delivery-partners">Drugs strategy guidance for local delivery partners</a>
</li>
  <li>any alcohol and drug workforce strategies and supporting products developed by <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> and Health Education England</li>
  <li>plans to improve integrated care for people with co-occurring mental or physical health problems</li>
</ul>

<p>There is support across government for the strategy and the <abbr title="commissioning quality standards">CQS</abbr>, which should ensure that all relevant local stakeholders are willing and able to join in commissioning partnerships.</p>

<h3>Aim of the commissioning standard</h3>

<p>The aim of the drug strategy is to have accessible, high quality, effective, person-centred alcohol and drug treatment and recovery systems throughout England.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="commissioning quality standards">CQS</abbr> provides a framework to enable this to happen and will help to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>encourage partnership approaches to effective commissioning</li>
  <li>improve the transparency of local alcohol and drug treatment</li>
  <li>increase accountability between local system partners, national and local government, and local councils and the communities they serve</li>
  <li>enable local partners to assess their commissioning practices</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="commissioning quality standards">CQS</abbr> also aims to improve the transparency of alcohol and drug treatment commissioning locally. It will increase the accountability between local system partners, national and local government, and local councils and the communities they serve. It will also enable local partners to assess their commissioning practices.</p>

<p>We do not expect that all local areas will immediately fully meet the <abbr title="commissioning quality standards">CQS</abbr>. It sets out an ambitious standard for commissioning systems, against which you can measure progress. To help this measurement, we have included an auditable self-assessment tool in addition to this text version.</p>

<h3>Self-assessment tool and other supporting documents</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="commissioning quality standards">CQS</abbr> is accompanied by supporting documents (or links to them) that set out in more detail how its ambition might be achieved. But this is just a first iteration of the <abbr title="commissioning quality standards">CQS</abbr>. It will be regularly reviewed and it (and its supporting documents) is expected to grow and evolve in response to feedback and the needs of local areas.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Partnerships and governance</h2>

<p>You should have an active multi-agency partnership in your area and include all partners in the planning and delivery of harm reduction, treatment and recovery interventions for people affected by problem alcohol and drug use.</p>

<h3>Standard 3.3: enabling recovery-oriented systems of care</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The partnership actively enables and promotes recovery-oriented systems of care so that there is a hope and ambition for every person who enters treatment to recover and live a life independent of services.</p>
</div>

<h4>Criteria</h4>

<p>You will know you are achieving this standard if you meet the following criteria.</p>

<p>1. The partnership actively promotes support that makes recovery more visible and increases opportunities for people to recover, such as recovery communities. Local systems also support people in different stages of recovery, including through abstinence-based recovery and medically-assisted recovery.</p>

<p>2. Recovery-oriented systems of care integrate recovery and harm reduction approaches so that they are not mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>3. People affected by problem alcohol and drug use can see other people in recovery and visible recovery is a strong focus for treatment services. Service support people to identify their post-treatment support needs as early as possible from their initial contact with treatment.</p>

<p>4. At a minimum, recovery planning includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>housing</li>
  <li>learning and employment</li>
  <li>people’s social connections (friends, family, peers, colleagues)</li>
  <li>meaningful activity and connections with people in recovery, and recovery networks</li>
</ul>

<p>5. The intensity of support after treatment is tailored to each person and recovery planning incorporates the needs of their families, carers and dependants.</p>

<p>6. The treatment system is part of a wider recovery-oriented system of care and the partnership explores opportunities to align, integrate or co-commission treatment and other recovery focused services.</p>

<p>7. Organisations that provide care to people with alcohol and drug problems (such as prisons hospitals and mental health facilities) engage treatment and recovery providers to ensure that people are supported to build and maintain their recovery capital.</p>

<p>8. The recovery-oriented system of care ensures rapid and supported re-entry into treatment for people who have relapsed.</p>

<h2>Glossary</h2>

<h3>Commissioning</h3>

<p>Commissioning is a continual process of assessing needs, and planning, agreeing, procuring and monitoring services to meet those needs. Integrated commissioning is incorporating more than one service within one contract and co-commissioning refers to more than one organisation aligning resources to commission together.</p>

<h3>Commissioning plan and delivery plan</h3>

<p>Commissioning and delivery plans are produced as part of the short, medium and long term planning of partnership activity to reduce alcohol and drug related harm. Commissioning plans should outline the aim and objectives of planned activity, and detail the activity, timelines and resources required. Delivery plans should be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and timely.</p>

<h3>Effective interventions</h3>

<p>These are interventions that are evidence-based, recommended by guidelines, or innovative and being evaluated.</p>

<h3>People affected by problem drug or alcohol use</h3>

<p>People affected by their own or other people’s drug or alcohol use, including children, families, carers, friends and communities.</p>

<h3>People with lived experience</h3>

<p>This term includes people with current or previous experience of drug or alcohol dependence, and families and carers of people experiencing problem drug or drug use. Engagement of people with lived experience should be done in a way which reflects the demographics of local populations.</p>

<h3>Protected characteristics</h3>

<p>It is against the law to discriminate against anyone because of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>age</li>
  <li>gender reassignment</li>
  <li>being married or in a civil partnership</li>
  <li>being&nbsp;pregnant&nbsp;or on maternity leave</li>
  <li>disability</li>
  <li>race including colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin</li>
  <li>religion or belief</li>
  <li>sex</li>
  <li>sexual orientation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Quality standard</h3>

<p>Sets out priority areas for quality improvement, highlighting issues with variations in current practice. The standard includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>statements to help improve quality</li>
  <li>a guide to what resources can be used to show and measure progress</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recovery-oriented system of care</h3>

<p>A co-ordinated network of community-based services, support groups and activities that are person-centred and build on strengths and resilience of individuals, families and communities. It has many pathways to recovery and offers choice by providing a range of services and support that are tailored to individual needs.</p>

<h3>Treatment</h3>

<p>Incorporates the full range of pharmacological, psychosocial and recovery interventions provided by (or through) specialist services (including GPs and primary care practices that are competent in alcohol and drug treatment).</p>

<h3>Needs assessment</h3>

<p>Needs assessment is the process where a partnership ensures it has a comprehensive understanding of local alcohol and drugs needs, and any gaps in local responses. The partnership should use the needs assessment to determine its priorities and how they allocate resources.</p>

<h3>Primary, secondary and tertiary prevention</h3>

<p>Primary prevention aims to prevent alcohol and drug use, or the negative effects of problematic use.</p>

<p>Secondary prevention is the early identification of problematic use and an intervention for someone who has developed it.</p>

<p>Tertiary prevention is to reduce harm associated with problem alcohol or drug use.</p>

<h3>Recovery capital</h3>

<p>Recovery capital is the range of resources that help a person start recovery and maintain it. Recovery capital is often categorised as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>personal, which are things like having safe and secure accommodation, physical and mental health and wellbeing and meaningful activity</li>
  <li>social, which is having things like peer support and supportive friends and family</li>
  <li>community, which includes activities and transport, being part of recovery communities, and attitudes to recovery</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mutual aid</h3>

<p>Mutual aid describes the social, emotional and information support provided to each other by members of a group recovering from drug or alcohol dependence. Some groups support families, children and friends affected by substance misuse. You can find more information about mutual aid in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mutual-aid-toolkit-for-alcohol-and-drug-misuse-treatment">Mutual aid toolkit for alcohol and drug misuse treatment</a>.</p>
