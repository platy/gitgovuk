<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p>These Codes detail standards and norms of practice and should be adhered to by all forensic science practitioners, irrespective of the sector in which they are employed and whether their work has been commissioned by prosecution or defence. Some have equated the current lack of statutory enforcement powers for the Regulator with an assumption that compliance is voluntary. That is not the case and any non-compliance with the Code of Conduct must be declared in statements.</p>

<p>This is the final version of the Codes that I will issue as Regulator. There are several reasons why this update is required, in particular:</p>

<p>1.To include provisions in relation to data security, which were recommended by the National Cybersecurity Centre and were published in Regulatory Notice 02/2020.</p>

<p>2.To respond to the increasing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the timescales for achieving compliance with the required quality standards.</p>

<p>It is important that the time extensions set out in the Statement of Standards and Accreditation Requirements are used wisely, to improve the implementation of quality systems and the readiness for assessment. This will ensure that when they restart, as many initial assessments as possible are successful without the need for further visits.</p>

<p>Each organisation should seek to implement the quality standards in a way that actively helps to promote improvement in practice; every practitioner and every leader has a role to play in bringing about improvement. As ever, I urge you all to adapt and improve your quality management system over time, to increase its effectiveness and efficiency. In general, accreditation is the mechanism by which compliance with the requirements needs to be demonstrated, but it is not an end in itself: quality improvement is always the goal.</p>

<h2>Code of Conduct for Forensic Science Practitioners</h2>

<p>The Forensic Science Regulator (the Regulator) sets out for all practitioners, whether instructed by the prosecution or defence, the values and ideals the profession stands for. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">9</a> This Code of Conduct provides a clear statement to customers and the public of what they have a right to expect.</p>

<p>As a practitioner you shall:</p>

<p>1.Recognise your overriding duty is to the court and to the administration of justice.</p>

<p>2.Act with honesty, integrity, objectivity and impartiality.</p>

<p>3.Comply with the legal obligations imposed on practitioners (and specifically expert witnesses) in the jurisdiction(s) in which you practice.</p>

<p>4.Declare, at the earliest opportunity, any personal, business, financial and/or other interest that could be perceived as a potential conflict of interest.</p>

<p>5.Act, and in particular provide expert advice and evidence, only within the limits of your professional competence.</p>

<p>6.Take all reasonable steps to maintain and develop your professional competence, taking account of material research and developments within the relevant field.</p>

<p>7.Inform those instructing you, in writing, of any information which may reasonably be considered to undermine your credibility as a practitioner or the reliability of the material you produce and include this information with/within any written report provided to those instructing you.</p>

<p>8.Establish the integrity and continuity of items as they come into your possession and ensure these are maintained whilst in your possession.</p>

<p>9.Seek access to exhibits/productions/information that may have a significant impact on the output from your work <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">10</a> and record both the request for material and the result of that request.</p>

<p>10.Conduct casework using methods of demonstrable validity and comply with the quality standards set by the Regulator <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">11</a> relevant to the area in which you work.</p>

<p>11.Be prepared to review any casework if any new information or developments are identified that would significantly impact on the output from your work. 9</p>

<p>12.Ensure that the relevant instructing party is informed where you have good grounds for believing a situation may result in a miscarriage of justice, either by (a) invoking the appropriate organisational processes for addressing potential miscarriages of justice or (where you do not operate as part of an organisation or the organisation does not have appropriate procedures) (b) by informing the party directly.</p>

<p>13.Preserve confidentiality unless the law obliges, a court/tribunal orders, or a customer explicitly authorises disclosure.</p>

<h2>Code of Practice for Forensic Units Providing Forensic Science Services</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>1.1.1 The Code of Practice is aimed at all those providing forensic science services to the Criminal Justice System (CJS), whether individual practitioners, academics, public or private sector forensic science providers, and refers to all as forensic units in line with the terminology used in ILAC-G19:08/2014. These can be small teams in larger organisations, sole practitioners or large providers and can be instructed by the prosecution or the defence.</p>

<p>1.1.2 The Code of Practice is not intended to be a substitute for the complete version of the international standards (e.g. BS EN ISO/IEC 17025:2017 and BS EN ISO/IEC 17020:2012 <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">12</a>). Section <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark195">32</a> of this Code of Practice cross references to some of the key clauses that appear in the normative references and other clauses may also be relevant. Forensic units applying for accreditation to one of the international standards remain responsible for ensuring they are aware of all relevant requirements.</p>

<p>1.1.3 The Code of Practice specifies the requirements for a management system for forensic units providing forensic science services to demonstrate their ability to deliver products and services that consistently meet the requirements of their customers in the CJS.</p>

<p>1.1.4 The United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS ®) <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">13</a> will assess forensic units providing forensic science services against ISO 17025 <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">14</a> utilising any of the relevant UKAS laboratory publications [24], ILAC-G19 and the supplementary requirements of this Code of Practice, and will include</p>

<p>compliance with this Code of Practice in the Schedule of Accreditation. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">15</a> UKAS can assess forensic units providing forensic science services at scenes of incidents <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">16</a> against ISO 17020, ILAC-G19, ILAC-P15:07/2016, this Code of Practice, and the inspection recommendation and guidance publication UKAS- RG 201:2015.</p>

<p>1.1.5 Forensic units required to be assessed by an accreditation body as detailed in the preface to this document the Statement of Standards and Accreditation Requirements, shall sign a confidentiality disclosure waiver to allow the accreditation body (e.g. UKAS) to disclose significant quality-related issues to the Regulator.</p>

<p>1.1.6 The word ‘shall’ has been used in this document where the clause is a requirement; the word ‘should’ has been used to indicate the clause is a recommendation based on generally accepted practice in the forensic science profession.</p>

<p>1.1.7 Appendices <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">17</a> complementary to the Code are included in the index of this document and when they come into effect are to be read as part of the Code, expanding and interpreting it, where necessary, for specific activities, processes or evidence types. In between issues of the Code, Regulatory Notices may be issued and may either signal the intention to add provisions to the Code or include clarifications intended for the next issue.</p>

<p>1.1.8 Although not part of the Code, the Regulator may issue Lessons Learnt documents which should be considered, for instance, when reviewing the operation of quality assurance measures.</p>

<p>1.1.9 The Code of Practice also incorporates, where applicable, any specific requirements determined by the CJS in England and Wales. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">18</a></p>

<p>1.1.10 Compliance with this Code of Practice is intended to provide the CJS and the public with confidence in the reliability of forensic science and to enhance customer satisfaction through the effective application of the management system.</p>

<p>1.1.11 Accreditation to BS EN ISO 15189 is a suitable alternative to ISO 17025 for the provision of certain medical laboratory services, provided that Forensic Testing/Analysis is clearly indicated in the scope of accreditation; this means that the laboratory has been assessed in accordance with ISO15189 taking into account ILAC-G19.</p>

<p>1.1.12 Other standards used for certification of organisations that provide scientific services – e.g. Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) [25] regulations and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) [26] are not alternatives to ISO 17025, although they do overlap to some extent and provide compatible guidance on good practice.</p>

<p>1.1.13 The Code and any subsequent appendices will be updated to reflect relevant changes in the requirements of ISO 17025, ISO 17020, ISO 15189, ILAC-G19, ILAC-P15 and the CJS. The updated version will be made available to all interested parties.</p>

<p>1.1.14 All practitioners shall comply with the principles contained in the Code of Conduct at the beginning of this document and shall declare this compliance (or otherwise) as set out in section <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark169">28.2</a>.</p>

<p>1.1.15 The Code of Conduct, the Code of Practice and Statement of Standards and Accreditation Requirements for all forensic units providing forensic science services are referred to collectively from this point forward as the Codes.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Modification</h2>

<p>2.1.1 This is the seventh issue of the Codes; it is issued to reinstate section 23.4 omitted in error from issue six. It is effective from 22nd March 2021 and replaces all previously issued versions. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">19</a></p>

<p>2.1.2 Significant changes from the last issue are highlighted in grey, significant deletions are marked as “[deleted text]”. Where sections are inserted, moved or renumbered, the subsequent renumbering of sections that follow is not generally marked. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">20</a></p>

<p>2.1.3 The Regulator uses an identification system for all documents. In the normal sequence of documents this identifier is of the form ‘FSR-#-###’ where (a) the ‘#’ indicates a letter to describe the type or document and (b) ‘###’ indicates a numerical, or alphanumerical, code to identify the document. For example, the Codes are FSR-C-100. Combined with the issue number this ensures each document is uniquely identified.</p>

<p>2.1.4 In some cases it may be necessary to publish a modified version of a document (e.g. a version in a different language). In such cases the modified version will have an additional letter at the end of the unique identifier. The identifier thus becoming FSR-#-####.</p>

<p>2.1.5 In all cases the normal document, bearing the identifier FSR-#-###, is to be taken as the definitive version of the document. In the event of any discrepancy between the normal version and a modified version the text of the normal version shall prevail.</p>

<p>2.1.6 This document is subject to review at regular intervals. If you have any comments please send them to the address or email set out at: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/forensic-science-regulator">www.gov.uk/government/organisations/forensic-science-regulator</a>.</p>

<p>Footnotes are marked up as changed: 20, 95.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Scope</h2>

<p>3.1.1 The Codes are for all forensic units supplying forensic science services to the CJS. Forensic science is taken to include the sciences performed by the police service, the fire and rescue services, the public and private sector forensic units and, to a lesser extent, academia. They are intended to be able to cover sciences with scene and/or laboratory-based elements and are not intended for disciplines such as forensic accountancy or psychiatry. The Codes have been extended to cover forensic medicine in so far as it applies to the examination of complainants of alleged sexual assault, by issuance of an appendix. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">21</a> The Codes currently cover forensic units that include the:</p>

<p>a. Initial examination of complainants or forensic science activity at the incident scene;</p>

<p>b. Strategy for the examination of complainants, suspects or incident scenes;</p>

<p>c. Recovery, preservation, transport and storage of exhibits;</p>

<p>d. Screening tests for use in the field;</p>

<p>e. Assessment, selection, examination, sampling, testing and/or analysis of exhibits;</p>

<p>f. Testing activities using laboratory-based methods;</p>

<p>g. Recording of actions taken;</p>

<p>h. Assessment/review of examination and test results;</p>

<p>i. Reporting and presentation of results; and</p>

<p>j. Interpretations and opinions. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">22</a></p>

<p>3.1.2 The Codes initially specify the general requirements for competence for laboratory activities including sampling, laboratory examinations and tests and the provision of expert testimony. Where relevant, appropriate legal, regulatory and information security is included.</p>

<p>3.1.3 All forensic units <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">23</a> offering forensic science services to the CJS are bound by these Codes. The method of demonstrating compliance with the Codes for most of the scientific disciplines, with only a few explicit exceptions <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">24</a>, is through accreditation to ISO 17025, ISO 17020 or ISO 15189.</p>

<p>3.1.4 It is recognised a new method may require a period of time from introduction to obtain suitable data to demonstrate the operation of the process or procedure satisfactorily for an accreditation body to include this method within the forensic unit’s schedule of accreditation. Forensic units intending to introduce such methods should consider the applicability of the provisions around infrequently used methods set out in section <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark108">21.2.45</a> and/or discuss options with the accreditation body. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">25</a></p>

<p>3.1.5 Where accreditation is required, and exigent circumstances mean that a method other than that as detailed in the schedule of accreditation needs to be used and there is no legal impediment, <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">26</a> this should be made clear to the instructing party and the fact that accreditation should apply and was not held should be declared in any statements or reports. Section <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark169">28.2</a> Declarations of Compliance and Non-Compliance with Required Standards details some options for declarations. The expectation is that, where any required standard is not met fully, in addition to the declaration a separate annex <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">27</a> to the statement or report is also produced which details how the risk is mitigated.</p>

<p>3.1.6 It is also recognised that experts from other professions will be called to give evidence from time to time. The customer shall ensure that such experts are bound by the Code of Conduct and should make them aware of:</p>

<p>a. The general obligations of expert witnesses including the requirements of the Criminal Justice System as contained in the Criminal Procedure Rules</p>

<p>[27] (and Criminal Practice Directions V, in particular 19A.5 and 19B);</p>

<p>b. The requirements for contents of reports <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">28</a>, including but not limited to, those prescribed in the Criminal Procedure Rules 19.4 and Criminal Practice Directions V 19B;</p>

<p>c. Retention, recording, revelation and prosecution disclosure obligations;</p>

<p>d. The requirements pertaining to the use of reference collections and databases should they rely on them;</p>

<p>e. The requirement to use validated methods or procedures based on sound scientific principles and methodology;</p>

<p>f. The need to demonstrate competence in using these methods or procedures, and evaluating the results obtained objectively and impartially, and according to established scientific and statistical methodology; and</p>

<p>g. The need to consider the impact that confirmation/cognitive bias can have at different stages and consider the use of avoidance strategies.</p>

<p>h. The declaration required in the Criminal Practice Directions V 19B and the Regulator’s requirement for the positive declaration to be in the following terms: <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">29</a></p>

<p>“I confirm that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, I have acted in accordance with the Code of Conduct published by the Forensic Science Regulator [insert issue] as it pertains to experts from other professions. Annex [x] details the steps taken to comply with the specific requirements set for experts from other professions.”</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Business Continuity</h2>

<p>7.1.1 The forensic unit shall develop procedures to be implemented following interruption to, or failure of, business critical processes, to maintain or restore operations and ensure continuous availability, confidentiality and integrity of information. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">30</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">31</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">32</a> See also section <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark121">23</a>. Control of Data (e.g. Backups, Recovery and Business Continuity).</p>

<p>7.1.2 Forensic units should ensure that their business continuity plans include provision to preserve and/or recover any material transferred to a subcontractor’s facility should that subcontractor go out of business with no legal successor (e.g. through stipulation in a contract with the subcontractor to assist receivership disputes).</p>

<p>7.1.3 Business continuity plans shall be tested on an annual basis and the results documented. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">33</a> Any identified need for action to modify the plans shall be implemented and the plans re-tested.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Independence, Impartiality and Integrity</h2>

<p>8.1.1 The forensic unit shall ensure that all of its practitioners are made aware of, and adhere to, the Code of Conduct in respect of their independence, impartiality and integrity, and that the organisational structure, policies and procedures support this rather than hinder it.</p>

<p>8.1.2 Conflicts of interest, perceived or otherwise, and threats to impartiality may include a practitioner:</p>

<p>a. Being coerced or having the perception of being coerced, openly or secretively;</p>

<p>b. Being asked to disregard critical findings that support/undermine either the prosecution’s or the defence’s position;</p>

<p>c. Being the sole reviewer of their critical findings;</p>

<p>d. Being involved with activities that could be perceived as witness coaching or being coached, rather than training or familiarisation;</p>

<p>e. Being over-familiar with, or trusting, another person instead of relying on objective evidence;</p>

<p>f. Having organisational and management structures that could be perceived to reward, encourage or support bias;</p>

<p>g. Having a close/significant personal or financial relationship with a party likely to be affected by the outcome;</p>

<p>h. Having a close/significant personal or financial relationship with any person acting as an expert witness in the case; or</p>

<p>8.1.3 It is possible for a conflict of interest to arise as a result of information held by a practitioner. This could be information, perhaps obtained from other parties to the case or previous dealings with some of the parties, making it difficult for the practitioner to adhere to their obligations to the CJS or their client.</p>

<p>8.1.4 Experts should consider relevant hypotheses for their findings prior to presenting their findings in the case.</p>

<p>8.1.5 The required policies and procedures shall not only prevent internal and external influence on the results of their examinations and tests, but also cover the corrective action (such as formal disclosure) to be taken if there is a possibility of a practitioner’s judgement having been, or perceived to have been, compromised.</p>

<p>16.3.2 The forensic unit shall have a procedure for carrying out checks on critical findings and designate competent individuals authorised to carry out such checks. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">48</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">49</a> Where checks on critical findings are carried out, the records shall indicate that each critical finding has been checked and whether it was agreed, or not and by whom and when the checks were performed. The procedure should include a process for resolving any non-conforming results or findings.</p>

<p>16.3.3 Where the forensic unit has deemed <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">50</a> the procedure requires an independent check, the organisation should define this level of independence <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">51</a> and records should be kept to demonstrate this.</p>

<p>16.3.4 The forensic unit shall have documented policies and procedures and authorised staff for the review of case records, including reports and statements. The review shall establish from the case notes and discussion with the practitioner that the work carried out is:</p>

<p>a. Appropriate to the requirements of the case;</p>

<p>b. Fully documented in the case notes, with appropriate checks on critical findings, calculations and data transfers;</p>

<p>c. In compliance with the forensic unit’s documented policies and procedures; and</p>

<p>d. Consistent with the contents of the report or statement.</p>

<p>16.3.5 In all reviews, the case record shall indicate that the review has been carried out, by whom and when.</p>

<p>16.3.6 The checks and reviews shall be recorded as entries against each finding or on a summary of findings or on a report, as appropriate. If the checker/reviewer</p>

<p>disagrees on any point and the matter cannot be resolved, the reason(s) for the disagreement and any action taken as a result shall be recorded.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">21. </span> Test Methods and Method Validation</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">21.1 </span> Selection of Methods</h2>

<p>21.1.1 The general requirement is that all technical methods and procedures used by a forensic unit shall be validated. This section details the principles of the requirement for validated methods, the next section, <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark97">21.2</a> Validation of Methods, details the required processes.</p>

<p>21.1.2 Forensic units with methods already <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">60</a> within the schedule of accreditation will normally only be required to collate the existing validation paperwork to form as comparable a validation library as possible, and produce the short statement of validation completion as detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark114">21.2.57</a>. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">61</a></p>

<p>21.1.3 Even where a method is considered standard and is in widespread use, scientific validity will still need to be demonstrated. The topic of verification of the validation of adopted methods is discussed below although many of the other validation steps are likely also to apply. If a method is being newly included in the forensic unit’s scope of accreditation and validation has not been conducted at the laboratory site where it is to be implemented, the forensic unit will have to follow the adopted methods procedure, which ends in the production of a validation library and statement of completion as well as demonstrating the method works in their hands.</p>

<p>21.1.4 If a method is required to use portable equipment for any reason, the validation study shall include testing any additional controls as well as assessing any additional aspects that may impact on the tests. For ISO 17020 applications, see UKAS-RG 201:2015 section Process Requirements 7.1.1 (including but not limited to temperature, humidity, surfaces, cross reactivity, lighting, cross contamination control, handling controls).</p>

<p>21.1.5 For novel <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">62</a> techniques, non-routine or infrequently used activities the forensic unit should have validated the method, product or service in accordance with the requirements of these Codes and/or should ensure that the status of the validation, product, method or service is clearly understood by the customer prior to commissioning any such work. If these activities are to become part of the routine activities of the forensic unit, accreditation should always be sought.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">21.2 </span> Validation of Methods</h2>

<p>21.2.1 Validation should be conducted prior to implementation of the method. This may be performed by the forensic unit, manufacturer or another forensic unit, but the forensic unit implementing the method will need to review the validation data to determine if the validation is adequate, reliable and relevant to the purpose it intends for the method.</p>

<p>21.2.2 Except where the method has been validated for incident scene use (see UKAS-RG 201:2015), if the validation has not been conducted at the site that will be using the method the forensic unit must still verify the scope of the validation with the required steps in <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark99">21.2.5</a>. This may be scaled up or down according to the adequacy and relevance of the available existing validation study. In such cases, following review of validation data to determine if the validation is adequate, the forensic unit’s own competent staff shall demonstrate such adopted methods perform reliably at the given location following the validation process. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">63</a> [29] [39] [40]</p>

<p>21.2.3 The validation policy or procedure shall set out roles and responsibilities of staff involved in conducting validation, authorisation of key stages and reviewing outcomes.</p>

<p>21.2.4 To ensure validation studies are conducted on the final method, there should be a clear boundary between development and validation. This should include consideration of how to prevent inadvertent re-entering of the development process once validation has started.</p>

<p>21.2.5 The validation procedure shall include where relevant, but is not limited to:</p>

<p>a. Determining the end-user’s requirements;</p>

<p>b. Determining the specification;</p>

<p>c. Risk assessment of the method;</p>

<p>d. A review of the end-user’s requirements and specification;</p>

<p>e. Setting the acceptance criteria;</p>

<p>f. The validation plan;</p>

<p>g. The outcomes of the validation exercise;</p>

<p>h. Assessment of acceptance criteria compliance;</p>

<p>i. Validation report;</p>

<p>j. Statement of validation completion; and</p>

<p>k. Implementation plan.</p>

<p>21.2.6 In certain circumstances implemented methods will require revalidation, e.g. when:</p>

<p>a. Quality control indicates that an established method is changing with time;</p>

<p>b. Equipment that was not validated to be mobile or portable is moved to a new location;</p>

<p>c. Deficiencies have become apparent after the method has been implemented; or</p>

<p>d. The end-user identifies a change in requirement.</p>

<h3>Determining the End-User’s Requirements</h3>

<p>21.2.7 The process of innovation ending in the implementation of a validated method is more likely to be instigated by the forensic unit than the end-user. However, to meet the needs of the CJS, which is the end-user, the requirements of all intermediate users of a method through to the expectations of the court (e.g. Criminal Practice Directions V 19A.5, relevant case law) need to be determined.</p>

<p>21.2.8 The amount of direct input from the CJS end-user should be determined by the forensic unit, based on the type of innovation; certain requirements may be generic and form a set of core requirements to the casework type.</p>

<p>21.2.9 The Criminal Practice Directions V (e.g. 19A.5) that supplement Part 19 of the Criminal Procedure Rules should be considered as providing an insight as to the expectations of the CJS end-user. [27]</p>

<p>21.2.10 The end-user’s requirement shall take account of, as appropriate:</p>

<p>a. Who will operate or use the new method, product or service post-delivery, and in what environment;</p>

<p>b. What the new method or product is intended to deliver for the end-user;</p>

<p>c. What statutory and regulatory requirements related to development and use of the method or product apply;</p>

<p>d. Whether there are any compatibility issues to be considered, e.g. data output formats;</p>

<p>e. What level of quality performance is expected; and</p>

<p>f. By what date the new method, product or service is required for implementation.</p>

<p>21.2.11 End-user requirements should conform to the following rules:</p>

<p>a. Each requirement is a single statement;</p>

<p>b. Each requirement is testable;</p>

<p>c. Each requirement specifies something that the solution will do, not how it will do it;</p>

<p>d. Each requirement specifies in its wording whether it is mandatory or desirable; and</p>

<p>e. Each requirement is written in a language that can be understood by the non-technical stakeholders.</p>

<p>21.2.12 Where the method is part of a service to be provided to a specified customer, the forensic unit shall also ensure their formal agreement of the method selection.</p>

<h3>Determining the Specification</h3>

<p>21.2.13 A detailed specification shall be written for the method, product or service, and shall include the technical quality standards. It may be an extension of the end- user requirement document or a separate document.</p>

<p>21.2.14 The specification adds detail to the requirements captured in end-user requirement from the range of users (e.g. analysts, reporting officers) as well as drawing in other technical requirements and is ultimately what is to be tested, encapsulating what this method is to do, the configuration, and what the method can and cannot be used for.</p>

<p>21.2.15 At this stage the list contained in the ILAC-G19:08/2014 (3.10) should be considered, even if the points listed were not explicitly raised in the end-user requirement capture exercise. The specification may also draw on technical details from a review of the scientific literature.</p>

<h3>Risk Assessment of the Method</h3>

<p>21.2.16 Once the method has been designed or determined, there shall be an assessment to identify any risks, or potential risks, to the CJS related to the use of the method or amendment to the method, including ad hoc methods. The process shall include, but not be limited to:</p>

<p>a. Identifying, on the basis of the use to which the results may be put, the possible impact on the CJS of any errors in the results, associated materials or procedures; and</p>

<p>b. Identifying areas where the operation of the method, or interpretation of the results, requires specialist skills or knowledge to prevent ambiguous or misleading outputs or outcomes.</p>

<p>21.2.17 Where the method relies on a scientific model or theory the risk assessment should address the following in a forensic science context:</p>

<p>a. The validity of the theory/model;</p>

<p>b. Any assumptions incorporated within the theory/model; and</p>

<p>c. Limits on the application of the theory/model.</p>

<p>21.2.18 In light of the assessment there shall be recommendations for modification of the specification, specific studies to be included in the validation exercise or additional procedures and/or safeguards that should be implemented. Examples would include, but not be limited to:</p>

<p>a. Caveats about the use of the method;</p>

<p>b. Circumstances in which the use of the method would be inadvisable; and</p>

<p>c. Additional work that should be undertaken in combination with the method.</p>

<p>21.2.19 Where exhibits provided by an end-user, or data derived from these, are required for the development work or validation, the forensic unit shall obtain prior permission for their use and include their use in the risk assessment. [41]</p>

<p>21.2.20 The risk assessment shall be subject to version control and should feed into the statement of validation completion.</p>

<h3>Review of the End-Users’ Requirements</h3>

<p>21.2.21 The forensic unit shall review the end-user’s requirement to ensure that requirements considered essential/mandatory have been translated correctly into the specification and the specification is fit for purpose. Where appropriate, the end-user specifying the requirement (e.g. analysts, reporting officers) may be involved in this review process.</p>

<p>21.2.22 When a review identifies that there are risks, compatibility, legality or ethical issues, the forensic unit shall produce a revised end-user’s requirements and/or specification.</p>

<p>21.2.23 Any subsequent changes to the specification shall then be made formally and only following further review and acceptance of the impact of the changes by the intended end-user.</p>

<p>21.2.24 The forensic unit shall ensure that all staff involved in the development and validation/verification of the method are informed of any agreed changes to the end-user’s requirements or specification.</p>

<h3>The Acceptance Criteria</h3>

<p>21.2.25 The acceptance criteria should be clearly stated, based upon the specification, the risk analysis and any control strategies put in place to control identified risks.</p>

<p>21.2.26 The acceptance criteria shall be used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and control strategy within measurable and set tolerances.</p>

<h3>The Validation Plan</h3>

<p>21.2.27 The validation shall be carried out according to a documented validation plan. The validation plan shall identify and define the functional and performance requirements, the relevant parameters and characteristics to be studied and the acceptance criteria for the results obtained to confirm that the specified requirements for the method, product or service have been met.</p>

<p>21.2.28 Where appropriate, the validation plan shall also include a requirement to check the relevant parameters and characteristics of the procedures for sampling, handling and transportation. The same level of confidence in the results obtained shall be required whether the method is to be used routinely or infrequently.</p>

<p>21.2.29 The validation shall be carried out using simulated casework material in the first instance and subsequently, where possible, permitted and appropriate, with actual casework material to confirm its robustness. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">64</a></p>

<p>21.2.30 The validation plan should be tailored depending on whether it is intended for the:</p>

<p>a. Validation of measurement-based methods;</p>

<p>b. Validation of interpretive methods;</p>

<p>c. Verification of the validation of adopted methods; and/or</p>

<p>d. Verification of the impact of minor changes to methods.</p>

<p>21.2.31 The validation plan should be signed off by a suitably competent individual who was independent from the development of the method and has sufficient knowledge of the relevant field under study.</p>

<p>21.2.32 Particularly where this is a plan for the validation of a new method rather than an adopted method (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark101">21.2.7</a>), it is accepted additional individuals may be needed to provide the breadth of technical knowledge to evaluate the plan. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">65</a> In such cases these individuals shall be listed and their role in supporting the person responsible for sign-off should be recorded.</p>

<h3>Validation of Measurement-Based Methods</h3>

<p>21.2.33 The validation plan should ensure the required parameters and characteristics are studied:</p>

<p>a. Using an analyst or examiner competent in the field of work under study, who has sufficient knowledge of the work to be able to make appropriate decisions from the observations made as the study progresses; and</p>

<p>b. Using equipment that is within specification, working correctly and, where appropriate, calibrated.</p>

<p>21.2.34 The functional and performance requirements, and the relevant parameters and characteristics for measurement-based methods <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">66</a> that shall be considered include the:</p>

<p>a. Competence requirements of the analyst/user;</p>

<p>b. Environmental constraints;</p>

<p>c. Exhibit/sample size;</p>

<p>d. Exhibit/sample handling;</p>

<p>e. Exhibit/sample homogeneity;</p>

<p>f. Ability of the sampling process to provide a representative sample of the exhibit;</p>

<p>g. Efficiency of recovery of the substance(s) to be identified/measured (i.e. Analyte) during sample preparation for analysis;</p>

<p>h. Presence or absence of the analyte(s) of interest in the sample analysed;</p>

<p>i. Minimum quantity of each analyte that can be reliably detected;</p>

<p>j. Minimum amount of each analyte that can be accurately quantified;</p>

<p>k. Identification/measurement relates to the analyte(s) alone, and is not compromised by the presence of some matrix or substrate effect or interfering substance;</p>

<p>l. Results are consistent, reliable, accurate, robust and with an uncertainty measurement;</p>

<p>m. Compatibility of results obtained by other analysts using different equipment and different methods; and</p>

<p>n. Limitations of applicability.</p>

<h3>Validation of Interpretive Methods <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">67</a>
</h3>

<p>21.2.35 The functional and performance requirements for interpretive methods are less prescriptive than for measurement-based methods although should include testing against representative ground truth data. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">68</a> They concentrate on the competence requirements for the staff involved and how the staff shall demonstrate that they can provide consistent, reproducible, valid and reliable results that are compatible with the results of other competent staff. This may be achieved by a combination of:</p>

<p>a. Independent confirmation of results/opinions by another competent examiner (i.e. without prior knowledge of the first result/opinion provided);</p>

<p>b. Participating in inter-laboratory comparisons (collaborative exercises or proficiency tests);</p>

<p>c. External recognition with a recognised and relevant professional body; and</p>

<p>d. Designing frequent in-house assessment into the process using positive and negative competence tests.</p>

<p>21.2.36 An interpretive method shall require only the relevant subset of the parameters and characteristics for measurement-based methods to be determined.</p>

<h3>Verification of the Validation of Adopted Methods</h3>

<p>21.2.37 Verification is defined as confirmation, through the assessment of existing objective evidence or through experiment that a method, process or device is fit (or remains fit) for the specific purpose intended.</p>

<p>21.2.38 Where the validation has not been conducted at the site <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">69</a> that will be using the method, the forensic unit must verify the scope of the validation with the study</p>

<p>scaled up or down according to the adequacy and relevance of the available existing validation study.</p>

<p>21.2.39 The amount of work required to be carried out in verification exercises when introducing methods developed and validated elsewhere, shall take account of the adequacy of the available existing validation data and the familiarity and experience of the forensic unit’s staff with the techniques, equipment and facilities involved.</p>

<p>21.2.40 The forensic unit shall check its performance against the specification for the method it is required to produce rather than simply against existing published data, as the requirements may differ.</p>

<p>21.2.41 The assessment to identify any risks, or potential risks, to the CJS related to the use of the method or amendment to the method should not be overlooked.</p>

<p>21.2.42 The ‘validation’ report shall have as a minimum a summary of the experimental work/review, results, staff training/competence requirement and assessment plans. The required validation library and statement of validation completion shall be produced.</p>

<h3>Minor Changes in Methods</h3>

<p>21.2.43 Replacing like-for-like equipment <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">70</a> or minor changes to methods used by the forensic unit may not always require a full revalidation exercise. The impact of the change shall be risk assessed, verified against the original validation and authorised in line with other validation studies.</p>

<p>21.2.44 A revalidation exercise should be carried out when changes are assessed to have the potential to influence the results obtained.</p>

<h3>Infrequently Used Methods</h3>

<p>21.2.45 Infrequently used methods may be maintained on the forensic unit’s schedule of accreditation through regular use of mock casework, competence assessments and any other measures agreed with the accreditation body, or if not included</p>

<p>on the schedule of accreditation re-verified in accordance with the requirements of these Codes prior to each use in casework. [42] If these activities are to become part of the routine activities of the forensic unit, accreditation should always be sought.</p>

<p>21.2.46 All methods the forensic unit intends using, including infrequently used methods, shall have been validated in line with these Codes and the forensic unit shall demonstrate competence to perform the method. The validation, verification or re-verification shall include the steps in <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark99">21.2.5</a>, and as with all methods, a validation library is required. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">71</a></p>

<p>21.2.47 Forensic units shall have a procedure to identify infrequently performed examinations/tests and their maintenance or use including:</p>

<p>a. How staff competence will be maintained or is demonstrated;</p>

<p>b. The definition of infrequently performed examinations/test;</p>

<p>c. Responsibility for the validation or verification;</p>

<p>d. The sign-off procedure for use in the case including justification of method choice; and</p>

<p>e. How the status of the method will be reported in statements or reports.</p>

<h3>Validation Outcomes</h3>

<p>21.2.48 A summary of the outcome of the validation exercise shall be included in the validation report, which shall normally be retained for 30 years after the last use of the method. A full record of the validation exercise will normally be retained by the forensic unit for a similar period, but as a minimum shall be maintained for the functional life of the method and shall include:</p>

<p>a. The authorised validation plan and any subsequent changes to the plan, with justifications and authorisations for the changes;</p>

<p>b. All experimental results from the validation exercise;</p>

<p>c. A detailed comparison of the experimental results with the specified requirements;</p>

<p>d. Independent evaluation of the extent to which the results obtained conform or otherwise to the specified requirements;</p>

<p>e. Any corrective actions identified; and</p>

<p>f. Independent approval of the validation. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">72</a></p>

<h3>Assessment of Acceptance Criteria Compliance</h3>

<p>21.2.49 The independent evaluation of compliance of the experimental results with specified requirements shall be carried out by a person (or persons) not involved in the development of the method or conducting the validation process.</p>

<p>21.2.50 The person(s) shall have demonstrated they have sufficient knowledge of the issues involved to be able to identify and assess the significance of any deficiencies. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">73</a></p>

<p>21.2.51 The independent authorisation shall typically establish whether:</p>

<p>a. The validation work is adequate and has fully demonstrated compliance of the method with the acceptance criteria for the agreed specification; and</p>

<p>b. The method is fit for its intended use.</p>

<p>21.2.52 Should the forensic unit plan to implement methods rated as high risk and/or likely to attract challenge once implemented, the Regulator should be consulted as to the need for any wider review and/or publication prior to implementation.</p>

<h3>Validation Report <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">74</a>
</h3>

<p>21.2.53 The forensic unit shall produce a validation report in sufficient detail to allow independent assessment of the adequacy of the work carried out in demonstrating that the method, product or service conforms to the specification and is fit for purpose. It need not contain all the experimental data, but a summary of this data shall be provided and the raw data shall be available for inspection if required.</p>

<p>21.2.54 The content of the validation report shall depend on the type and extent of validation carried out, but as a general guide it should include, as applicable:</p>

<p>a. A title and unique identifier;</p>

<p>b. A description of the purpose of the method, product or service;</p>

<p>c. The specification;</p>

<p>d. The name, version number and manufacturer of any equipment used;</p>

<p>k. Conformity with the acceptance criteria (expected compared with actual results and any pass/fail criteria);</p>

<p>l. Any limitations/constraints applicable;</p>

<p>m. Any related published papers and similar methods in use by the forensic unit;</p>

<p>n. Any recommendations relating to the implementation of the method, product or service; and</p>

<p>o. The date of the report.</p>

<p>21.2.55 The forensic unit shall submit the validation report for review by persons suitably qualified and independent of the validation process; any issues arising should be dealt with expeditiously.</p>

<p>21.2.56 All the required records relating to the development and validation of the method, product or service shall be archived, together with the means of accessing the records, which will normally be kept for 30 years following its last use in casework. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">75</a></p>

<h3>A Statement of Validation Completion</h3>

<p>21.2.57 The aim of this statement is to provide those making decisions on the use of the results a short executive summary of the validation steps performed, and key issues surrounding the validation. The intention is that the statement will be no more than two sides of A4 paper in plain language. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">76</a></p>

<p>21.2.58 The approval by the forensic unit on the scope of the validation must be clear.</p>

<p>21.2.59 The forensic unit should provide any further information that would be useful to the CJS. Examples would include, but not be limited to:</p>

<p>a. Caveats about the use of the method;</p>

<p>b. The approved uses of the method, which could be by case type or exhibit type;</p>

<p>c. Circumstances in which the use of the method would be inadvisable; and</p>

<p>d. Additional work that should be undertaken in combination with the result.</p>

<h3>Validation Library</h3>

<p>21.2.60 The forensic unit shall have available a library of documents relevant to the authorisation of the new method through validation or verification. Where the following are not already distinct sections in the validation report, the content of this library shall include, but not be limited to:</p>

<p>a. The specification for the method approved (see earlier sub-section Determining the specification);</p>

<p>b. Any associated supporting material, such as academic papers or technical reports that were used to support or provide evidence on the applicability of the method; <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">77</a></p>

<p>c. The risk assessment for the method approved;</p>

<p>d. The validation plan for the method approved;</p>

<p>e. The validation report;</p>

<p>21.2.62 Where the method relies on reference collections or databases, the nature, access and their availability should be described.</p>

<p>21.2.63 The information in the library shall be disclosable <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">78</a> and should be prepared with that requirement in mind.</p>

<h3>Implementation Plan and Any Constraints</h3>

<p>21.2.64 The forensic unit shall have a plan for implementation of methods, products or services new to the forensic unit. This plan shall address, where relevant:</p>

<p>a. Whether revisiting old cases should be explored, where the revised or new method offers new analytical opportunities and, if relevant, the benefits or risks communicated to the customer;</p>

<p>b. The standard operating procedure (including the process for assessment/interpretation/reporting of results) or instructions for use;</p>

<span class="number">22. </span> Estimation of Uncertainty</h2>

<p>22.1.1 Guidance on the estimation of uncertainty of measurement is contained in Appendix N of the UKAS M 3003 publication ‘The Expression of Uncertainty and Confidence in Measurement’.</p>

<p>22.1.2 A forensic unit performing testing <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">79</a> is required to evaluate measurement uncertainty, even where the test method precludes rigorous evaluation of measurement such as a test that is qualitative in nature. UKAS M 3003 states “there will be uncertainties associated with the underlying test conditions and these should be subject to the same type of evaluation as is required for quantitative test results”. [43]</p>

<p>22.1.3 The impact uncertainty may have on the findings shall be included in both factual and evaluative reports to the CJS where it is relevant.</p>

<p>22.1.4 When a procedure is modified, in addition to any validation or verification, forensic units should also review the measurement uncertainty.</p>

<p>22.1.5 The Criminal Practice Directions V (19A.5c) that supplements Part 19 of the Criminal Procedure Rules include several factors which ought to be considered. However, the following direction that the court may take into account in accessing admissibility is particularly relevant:</p>

<p>19A.5c “if the expert’s opinion relies on the results of the use of any method (for instance, a test, measurement or survey), whether the opinion takes proper account of matters, such as the degree of precision or margin of uncertainty, affecting the accuracy or reliability of those results.”</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">23. </span> Control of Data</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">23.1 </span> General</h2>

<p>23.1.1 The forensic unit shall have procedures within its management system to ensure that all necessary information is recorded accurately, maintained so that its authenticity and integrity is not compromised, and is retained and destroyed in accordance with the forensic unit’s retention and destruction policy. [44] [45] [46]</p>

<p>23.1.2 The unit shall identify key data and critical control points (i.e. places where data is entered, transferred, stored or processed in a manner where it may be vulnerable to corruption, errors, unauthorised manipulation etc.). <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">80</a></p>

<p>23.1.3 The unit shall identify protection steps to:</p>

<p>a. Minimise the risk of data loss;</p>

<p>b. Minimise the risk of data corruption (deliberate, degraded, actual or suspected);</p>

<p>c. Demonstrate that the results are reliable and analytically sound; and</p>

<p>d. Maintain continuity and prevent unauthorised access to and/or amendment of all electronic records identified by assessment of the critical control points of key data.</p>

<p>23.1.4 Protection steps shall be tested by sampling of key data. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">81</a></p>

</h2>

<p>23.2.1 The forensic unit shall establish procedures for the capture and retrieval of electronic information appropriate for the process or method to ensure that all the necessary information is captured without change, and that any information lost as a result of the capture process is at an acceptable level. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">83</a></p>

<p>23.2.2 Where scanning technology is used, the forensic unit shall establish procedures and quality control for the scanning of documents in paper form, microforms and other forms of information, as appropriate, to ensure that any potential information loss as a result of the scanning is within acceptable limits. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">84</a></p>

<p>23.2.3 Appropriate to the associated method or process, the procedure and policies should ensure that where key information is extracted from image files the original images are retained and linked with the captured information, including metadata.</p>

<p>23.2.4 Where a document has, for example embedded files or hyperlinks, all elements of the document shall be stored in line with the forensic unit’s retention policy along with their content.</p>

<p>23.2.5 Critical information should be accessible throughout its period of retention.</p>

<p>23.2.6 When information is migrated to alternative storage media, the forensic unit shall establish procedures to ensure that all digital objects <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">85</a> have been successfully migrated and the digital object and file format of the migrated digital objects have not changed, or that the changes are known, have been audited, and meet requirements.</p>

<p>23.2.7 If replacement software (e.g. an operating system or application software) is implemented, the forensic unit shall ensure that procedures are established to retain access to the data.</p>

<p>23.2.8 Where information is compressed during the storage and transfer processes (e.g. in order to reduce stored file size), the compression method used shall not affect the authenticity and integrity.</p>

<p>23.2.9 Information shall be retained in audit trails, or using other appropriate processes, which record the disposal of information as specified by the retention and disposal policy.</p>

<span class="number">23.3 </span> Electronic Information Security [47]</h2>

<p>23.3.1 The forensic unit shall have an information security policy which explains how the unit meets its responsibilities outlined in section <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark123">23.1.1</a>. [48] [49] [50] The information security policy shall describe the procedures, based on assessed business and security requirements, for the management of electronic information. The forensic unit shall ensure procedures are subject to regular testing, audit and review. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">86</a></p>

<p>23.3.2 The forensic unit’s information security policy shall have processes for the following.</p>

<h3>Access Control to Electronic Information</h3>

<p>23.3.3 The access control procedures shall include the identification, authentication, and authorisation of users. Users shall have defined privileges which limit, as far as practical, access to only the information needed and the key operational services they require to perform their roles.</p>

<p>23.3.4 Access shall be removed when users leave their role or the organisation. Reviews should take place at least every 6 months to ensure access rights are still needed - if access rights are no longer needed, they shall be removed.</p>

<p>23.3.5 Users with administrative rights shall be authenticated using a second factor <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">87</a></p>

<p>where this is technically possible.</p>

<p>23.3.6 Accounts with administrative rights shall only be used to perform administrative duties <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">88</a> and shall not be used to access e-mail or the Internet - separate accounts shall be provided for this.</p>

<p>23.3.7 Authentication failures should be throttled to 10 attempts in 5 minutes or locked out where this is practically possible as per industry norms. Access control mechanisms shall be protected to prevent unauthorised system-wide access. [51] [52]</p>

<p>a. Users should use machine-generated passwords and have appropriate facilities to store them.</p>

<p>b. Password managers [53] for the secure storage of passwords should be used where appropriate. Alternatively, users should adopt the ‘three random words’ [54] technique for generating suitably complex and memorable passphrases.</p>

<p>c. Passwords shall be a minimum of 8 characters and have no maximum length. Regular password expiry should not be enforced, users shall change their password when it is known (or suspected) that it has been compromised.</p>

<p>d. Users should be educated to not use the same passwords for personal and work accounts.</p>

<p>e. Passwords shall not be reused for accounts with administrative rights.</p>

<p>f. Users should be prevented from selecting easily guessed or commonly used passwords. [55]</p>

<p>g. Password should be protected in transit and at rest using appropriate encryption and hashing techniques. [52] [56] [57]</p>

<p>h. All default administrative passwords for applications, network equipment and computers shall be changed [52], and meet the requirements identified above.</p>

<h3>Protection Against Malware</h3>

<p>23.3.9 With the exception of evidence handling where the detection or removal of malware may have an actual or potential impact on the results of examinations or analysis, the procedures for the protection against malware shall include detection and removal of malware using anti-malware software.</p>

<p>23.3.10 Anti-malware software shall be updated when new definitions become available. Anti-malware updates should be included in the forensic unit’s change procedures to manage any potential impact to the forensic examination process.</p>

<p>23.3.11 Anti-malware software shall be installed on all compatible computers and hardware, unless specified operational requirements dictate otherwise. The forensic unit should implement additional anti-malware procedures such as application/executable allow listing. [58]</p>

<p>23.3.12 The forensic unit shall have, or ensure that its IT provider has, procedures in place to protect from website and email-borne malware, caused by drive-by download and phishing attacks.</p>

<p>23.3.13 The forensic unit shall access the Internet via a proxy service which blocks malware. The forensic unit shall have procedures for filtering or blocking phishing emails or messages, before they reach users.</p>

<p>23.3.14 The forensic unit shall have procedures to update (patch) software and firmware in a timely manner and included in the forensic unit’s change procedures to manage any potential impact to the forensic examination process.</p>

<p>23.3.15 Software and firmware that is no longer supported by vendors, should be replaced unless there is a technical or CJS justification for its continued use</p>

<p>recorded in the procedure. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">89</a> ‘Critical’ and ‘High’ severity patches for Internet- enabled systems shall be installed promptly. Where this is not possible, then other mitigations (such as physical or logical separation) shall be applied.</p>

<p>23.3.16 All removable storage media shall be scanned using anti-malware software before use.</p>

<p>23.3.17 The forensic unit should securely configure computers by following the End User Device security principles. [59]</p>

<h3>The Segregation of Forensic Networks</h3>

<p>23.3.22 The forensic unit shall have procedures for the segregation of systems used for forensic science work from other networks. Systems and data that do not need to communicate or interact with each other should be separated into different network segments, and only allow users to access a segment where needed.<a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">92</a> Segregation can be achieved physically or ‘logically’. Logical separation can include access control lists, network and computer virtualisation, firewalling, and network encryption such as Internet Protocol Security (IPSec). [64] [65]</p>

<h3>Backups, Recovery and Business Continuity</h3>

<p>23.3.23 The forensic unit shall have procedures for business continuity with an incident management plan including backup and retrieval of data, to recover from incidents such as ransomware, theft or hardware failure, whilst ensuring the business can continue to function.</p>

<p>23.3.24 Where digital data is the evidence, the procedure should be risk-based, balancing consideration of the time between creation of the extracted material, retention of the evidential device and any identified off-site back-up requirement.</p>

<p>23.3.25 The forensic unit shall identify what electronic information is essential to keeping operations running and make regular backup copies, or where that infrastructure is provided by the larger organisation (e.g. police force) seek assurance the backup is adequate.</p>

<p>23.3.26 The forensic unit shall identify its critical systems and have redundancy arrangements in place. The forensic unit shall test that backups are working to ensure it can restore the electronic information from them in the event of an incident. Offline backups shall be created and stored for as long as necessary to meet the requirements of the Criminal Justice System.</p>

<p>23.3.27 Offline backups should be stored at a separate and secure location. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">93</a> [66] [67] The forensic unit may use appropriate cloud services for this back-up of electronic information; ‘offline’ here means digitally disconnected when not in use and designed to remain unaffected should any incident impact the live environment. [68]</p>

<p>23.3.28 The forensic unit shall have an incident management plan <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">94</a> which helps staff identify, respond to, and recover from, incidents as well as continue to run the business. The incident management plan should include a communication strategy, roles and responsibilities of staff and third parties such as service providers and authorities, as well as contact details for those involved.</p>

<p>23.3.29 The forensic unit shall periodically test the incident management plan to ensure that its electronic information and critical systems can be recovered in the event of an incident, whilst ensuring that the business can continue to operate. Revisions to the incident management plan should include lessons learnt to ensure the same event cannot occur in the same way again. [51] [63] [69]</p>

<p>23.3.30 The network security and mobile working procedures shall include the management of the network perimeter by using firewalls to create a ‘buffer zone’ between the Internet (and other untrusted networks) and the networks used by the business.</p>

<p>23.3.31 The forensic unit shall have procedures to protect its internal networks by ensuring there is no direct routing between internal and external networks (especially the Internet). The forensic unit shall have procedures for securing wireless access to its networks. All wireless access points shall be secured using Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) or WPA3, and only allow known devices to connect to corporate Wi-Fi services.</p>

<p>23.3.32 Where mobile working is required, the forensic unit shall have procedures for ensuring that connections are identified, authenticated (preferably using multiple factors) and authorised. All electronic information which transits the Internet (and other untrusted networks) shall be protected from eavesdropping and alteration using appropriate encryption such as IPSec and Transport Layer Security (TLS). [56] [57]</p>

<p>23.3.33 All mobile devices shall only have the necessary applications and electronic information to fulfil the business activity that is being delivered outside the normal office environment. If the mobile device supports it, data shall be encrypted at rest. The forensic unit should ensure there are adequate procedures for monitoring network traffic for unusual incoming and outgoing activity that could be indicative of an attack. The forensic unit shall have procedures for testing the security of its networks. [51]</p>

<h3>The Use of Cloud-Based Services</h3>

<p>23.3.34 The process for the use of cloud-based services shall include procedures to:</p>

<p>a. Determine the business need and end-user requirements;</p>

<p>b. Identify what data and information will be transported, stored and processed, and understand the associated risks;</p>

<p>c. Evaluate the security of the offering; and</p>

<p>d. Understand the residual risks and how these will be managed.</p>

<p>23.3.35 The forensic unit should use cloud providers which meet the NCSC’s cloud security principles. [68] The storage and processing of evidential data and information using cloud-based services should only be performed from data centres physically located in the UK. The forensic unit should periodically review whether the cloud-based services still meet their business and security needs.</p>

<h3>Security Monitoring and Situational Awareness</h3>

<p>23.3.36 The forensic unit’s security monitoring and situational awareness procedures shall include the generation, capture, retention, storage and analysis of logs from its computers and network equipment. The forensic unit’s security monitoring procedures shall:</p>

<p>a. Provide visibility of communication between their network and other networks (i.e. the Internet or 3rd party suppliers);</p>

<p>b. Capture authentication and access attempts; and</p>

<p>c. Provide asset and configuration information. All logs shall be stored securely so they are safe from tampering and unauthorised access. All logs should be stored for a minimum of 6 months so that they can be used to support incident management. [70] [71]</p>

<span class="number">28.2 </span> Declarations of Compliance and Non-Compliance with Required Standards <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">110</a> [74] [75]</h2>

<p>28.2.1 All practitioners shall disclose in statements/reports intended for use as evidence, their compliance, or non-compliance, with the Code of Conduct. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">111</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">112</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">113</a> The Code of Conduct requires compliance with the quality standards set out by the Regulator in the Statement of Standards and Accreditation Requirements.</p>

<p>28.2.2 The Code of Conduct cross references to the Statement of Standards and Accreditation Requirements so a practitioner will be compliant with the Code of Conduct only if they also comply with requirements for their discipline set out in the Statement of Standards and Accreditation Requirements (e.g. accreditation to ISO 17025 and the Codes or to a standalone code of practice). <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">114</a></p>

<p>28.2.3 All practitioners shall declare/disclose in statements/reports intended for use as evidence in the following terms, or in terms substantially the same: 110</p>

<p>a. ‘I confirm that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, I have acted in accordance with the Code of Conduct published by the Forensic Science Regulator [insert issue]’; <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">115</a> or W.L.R. 619 and Kumar v. General Medical Council [2012] EWHC 2688 (Admin), or to the prosecution (see Criminal Practice Directions V 19B (1) 13 and Criminal Procedure Rules 19.3 (3)(c)). Similar requirements are in place in other UK jurisdictions e.g. Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010.</p>

<p>b. ‘I confirm that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, I have acted in accordance with the Code of Conduct published by the Forensic Science Regulator [insert issue] for infrequently used methods or new methods. As this method is not within the schedule of accreditation, annex [x] details the steps taken to comply with the specific requirements to control risk’; or</p>

<p>c. ‘I confirm that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, I have acted in accordance with the Code of Conduct published by the Forensic Science Regulator [insert issue] in all aspects that relate to my personal conduct.

<h2>
<span class="number">28.3 </span> Types of Report in the CJS <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">116</a>
</h2>

<p>28.3.1 Forensic units can be required to supply technical or expert advice to support the investigative process and factual or expert evidence to support the judicial process which are all covered by the requirements in the Code including the provision of the following.</p>

<p>a. Interim progress reports <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">117</a> to support investigations. These are initial forensic investigation reports used for an assessment of the forensic exhibits that may help an enquiry, interview or strategy. This report is non-</p>

<p>evidential but may be disclosable as unused material and does not require a statement of compliance with the Code of Conduct (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark169">28.2</a> Declarations of Compliance and Non-Compliance with Required Standards).</p>

<p>b. Streamlined Forensic Reports (SFR) [76]. These have been introduced for certain evidence types for use in the case management process to establish the level of agreement between the defence and the prosecution.</p>

<p>i. The SFR1 is a summary of the evidence served to determine whether there is any agreement of the evidence, or to ascertain whether there are any issues in dispute. It is deliberately not presented in an admissible format as it is not intended to be presented at trial other than as agreed fact and it does not need to comply with Criminal Procedure Rules 19.4 or Criminal Practice Directions V 19B. It does however require a statement of whether the results are from a method which requires accreditation and if so, if the method is within the forensic unit’s schedule of accreditation. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">118</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">119</a></p>

<p>ii. The SFR2 is produced to answer the issue(s) raised by the defence in response to the SFR1, it is intended to be presented in evidence, unless a full evaluative report is required instead. Therefore an SFR2 does require a statement of compliance with the Code of Conduct (see section <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark169">28.2</a>) and if it is providing expert opinion it requires an expert’s declaration under Criminal Procedure Rules 19.4.</p>

<p>c. Reports (a statement is a type of report) for use in court proceedings.</p>

<p>i. Factual reports require a statement of compliance with the Code of Conduct.</p>

<p>ii. Expert reports require a declaration under Criminal Procedure Rules 19.4(j) and 19B of the Criminal Practice Directions V which should include a statement of compliance with the Code of Conduct (see section <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark169">28.2</a>) as part of the declaration required by 19B of the Criminal Practice Directions V.</p>

<p>d. Certificates (e.g. issued under provisions of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988).</p>

<p>e. The content of a certificate must comply with the provisions of the statute which created the right to use the certificate and should include statement of compliance with the Code of Conduct.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">28.4 </span> Reporting Competencies</h2>

<p>28.4.1 Forensic units shall ensure that all staff who provide factual evidence based on scientific methodology are additionally able to demonstrate, if required:</p>

<p>a. Whether there is a body of specialised literature relating to the field;</p>

<p>b. That the principles, techniques and assumptions they have relied on are valid;</p>

<p>c. That assumptions they have relied upon are reasonable; and</p>

<p>d. The impact that the uncertainty of measurement associated with the application of a given method could have on any conclusion.</p>

<p>28.4.2 Forensic units shall ensure that all staff who provide expert evidence have a sufficient level of experience, knowledge, standing in the peer group and, where appropriate, qualifications, relevant to the type of evidence being adduced, to give credibility to the reliability of the work undertaken and the conclusions drawn. They shall also ensure that they are able to explain their methodology and reasoning, both in writing and orally, concisely in a way that is comprehensible to a lay person and not misleading.</p>

<p>28.4.3 Forensic units shall ensure that all staff who provide expert evidence based on their practical experience and/or their professional knowledge are additionally able to provide: <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">120</a></p>

<p>a. An explanation of their methodology and reasoning;</p>

<p>b. Reference to a body of up to date specialised literature relating to the field of expertise and the extent to which this supports or undermines their methodology and reasoning;</p>

<p>c. An assessment that any database they have relied on is sufficient in size and quality to justify the nature and breadth of inferences drawn from it, that the inferences are logically sound and that alternative hypotheses in the investigative mode and alternative propositions in the evaluative mode have been properly considered;</p>

<p>d. A demonstration that their methodology, assumptions and reasoning have been considered by other scientists and are regarded as sound, or where challenged, the concerns have been satisfactorily addressed;</p>

<p>e. An assessment of the extent to which their methodology and reasoning are accepted by their peers, together with details of any outstanding concerns;</p>

<p>f. Relevant information to support claims of expertise, as well as anything that may adversely affect credibility or competence (e.g. adverse judicial findings); [35] <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">121</a> and</p>

<p>g. The statement of understanding and truth in expert reports for the CJS in England and Wales, as required in Criminal Practice Directions V 19b (see</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark170">28.2.3</a> and Criminal Practice Directions v 19b.1.13).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">28.5 </span> Retention, Recording, Revelation and Prosecution Disclosure</h2>

<p>28.5.1 If a practitioner has carried out a test, or if such a test has been carried out at their laboratory, which casts doubt on a particular proposition they must bring this to the attention of those instructing them.</p>

<p>28.5.2 Forensic units instructed by the prosecution must support the disclosure process and provide access to the defence to material identified as relevant by the prosecution. [35]</p>

<p>28.5.3 All documents, exhibits and evidential material recovered from exhibits that are retained by forensic units shall be archived in secure storage, in conditions to prevent damage or deterioration, and indexed so as to facilitate orderly storage and retrieval. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">122</a></p>

<p>28.5.4 Only personnel authorised by management shall have access to the archives. Movement of material in and out of the archives shall be properly recorded.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">28.6 </span> Defence Examinations</h2>

<p>28.6.1 The forensic unit instructed by the defence shall ensure that any tests or examinations they conduct, or are conducted on their behalf by someone other than the original forensic unit, are carried out in accordance with the requirements set out in these Codes, and that they also comply with any conditions attached by the prosecutor to the release of the exhibits, or parts of exhibits, or evidential material recovered from them.</p>

<p>28.6.2 The forensic unit appointed by the prosecution shall have defined policies and procedures to facilitate access by defence examiners to carry out a review of work already completed by the forensic unit, which is deemed by the prosecutor or court to be relevant, in the case.</p>

<p>28.6.3 The policies and procedures shall be based on appropriate guidance.</p>

<p>28.6.4 The policies and procedures shall ensure the security and integrity of the exhibits and records requested for review, but must also ensure the</p>

<p>confidentiality of other work in progress or previously undertaken by the forensic unit instructed by the prosecution, to which access has not been granted.</p>

<p>28.6.5 A forensic unit appointed by the defence seeking pre-trial access to any case material shall first obtain approval for access to these from the prosecutor (or coroner if the prosecuting authority is not involved at that stage).</p>

<p>28.6.6 The forensic unit appointed by the prosecution shall make available to the defence’s forensic unit only what has been deemed by the prosecutor or court to be relevant. Copies of such case file records, documents and supporting information, etc. that have been reasonably requested by the forensic unit appointed by the defence and been deemed relevant may then be provided in hard copy or secure electronic form <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">123</a> and be taken into their possession for examination away from the premises of the forensic unit appointed by the prosecution.</p>

<p>28.6.7 The defence forensic unit must use material supplied by the prosecution forensic unit only for the specific case(s) for which the material was provided. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">124</a> Material supplied by the prosecution is subject to the Data Protection Act 2018 and may be subject to Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 as amended by the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 (e.g. fingerprints, DNA). <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnotes">125</a> The defence’s forensic unit shall retain the notes and records it has created in line with these Codes.</p>

<p>28.6.8 The forensic unit appointed by the prosecution shall only release exhibits (or evidential material recovered from them) to the defence for examination or testing away from the premises of the forensic unit appointed by the prosecution on receipt of written instructions from the prosecutor and/or the court. Where the examinations or testing might affect their condition, the forensic unit appointed by the prosecution shall ensure that the prosecutor and/or the court is made aware of this before they are released and that this is recorded.</p>

<p>28.6.9 The forensic unit appointed by the prosecution shall ensure that all examinations and tests carried out on the forensic unit’s premises by the defence are adequately supervised, to ensure that they are carried out in accordance with the instructions given by the prosecutor and that nothing is altered, damaged or destroyed without the prior permission of the prosecutor.</p>

<p>28.6.10 The forensic unit shall ensure that all exhibits (or parts of exhibits, or evidential material recovered from them) that are to be released to the defence are recorded, securely packaged, labelled and any conditions that apply to handling and retention are made in writing (e.g. from the court, prosecution, customer). The forensic unit appointed by the prosecution shall also retain a signed record of the transfers for continuity purposes.</p>

<p>28.6.11 The forensic unit appointed by the prosecution shall check the integrity and continuity records of the returned exhibits, or parts of exhibits, or evidential material for compliance with any conditions of release. Any deficiency in these respects shall be communicated immediately to the prosecutor and the customer, e.g. the police.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">28.7 </span> Opinions and Interpretations</h2>

<p>28.7.1 Where this is to be included in a forensic unit’s schedule of accreditation, the forensic unit will need to ensure that they are in compliance with the UKAS publication LAB 13 and ILAC-G19:08/2014 section 4.9.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">31. </span> Glossary</h2>

<h3>Accreditation</h3>

<p>Third-party attestation related to a conformity assessment body conveying formal demonstration of its competence to carry out specific conformity assessment tasks. In the UK the sole national accreditation body recognised by the Government to assess UK organisations that provide certification, testing, inspection and calibration services is UKAS.</p>

<h3>Accuracy</h3>

<p>The closeness of agreement between the mean of a set of results or an individual result and the value that is accepted as the true or correct value for the quantity measured.</p>

<h3>Analyte</h3>

<p>Substance to be identified or measured; in digital forensic science it may be taken to include data as the focus of the analysis.</p>

<h3>Audit</h3>

<p>A systematic, independent and documented process for obtaining evidence and evaluating it objectively to determine the extent to which specified criteria are fulfilled.</p>

<p>Internal audit:</p>

<p>sometimes called a first-party audit, conducted by, or on behalf of, the organisation itself for internal purposes.</p>

<p>External audit:</p>

<p>includes what are generally termed a ‘second-’ or ‘third-party’ audit. Second-party audits are conducted by parties having an interest in the organisation, such as customers, or by other persons on their behalf. Third-party audits are conducted by external independent organisations. Such organisations provide certification or registration of conformity with requirements such as those of ISO 9001.</p>

<h3>Blank</h3>

<p>A sample containing none of the analyte of interest, used in analysis for detecting the background level of the analyte in the matrix or contamination.</p>

<h3>Calibration</h3>

<p>The set of operations that establish, under specified conditions, the relationship between values indicated by a measuring instrument or measuring system, or values represented by a material measure, and the corresponding known values of a measurand.</p>

<h3>Collaborative exercise</h3>

<p>An inter-laboratory exercise to determine the performance characteristics of a method or procedure, to establish the effectiveness and comparability of new tests or measurement methods, or to assign values to reference materials and assess their suitability for use in specific test or measurement procedures.</p>

<p>Collaborative exercises do not require known expected outcomes.</p>

<h3>Competence</h3>

<p>The skills, knowledge and understanding required to carry out a role, evidenced consistently over time through performance in the workplace.</p>

<h3>Complainant</h3>

<p>A person who makes a complaint or allegation of having been the victim of a criminal offence or in relation to whom such an allegation is made.</p>

<h3>Contamination</h3>

<p>The undesirable introduction of substances or trace materials.</p>

<h3>Control sample</h3>

<p>A matrix-matched standard used to determine the linearity and stability of a quantitative test or determination over time, prepared from a reference material (weighed or measured separately from the calibrators), purchased or obtained from a pool of previously analysed samples.</p>

<p>A positive control contains the analyte at a concentration above a specified limit.</p>

<p>A negative control contains the analyte at a concentration below a specified limit.</p>

<p>The term is used in the forensic science context to refer to a sample obtained from a known source against which material from an unknown source (recovered sample) is to be compared to consider the strength of the evidence in support of a common origin.</p>

<h3>Critical findings</h3>

<p>Typically observations or results that meet one or more of the following criteria:</p>

<p>a. They have a significant impact on the conclusion reached and the interpretation and opinion provided;</p>

<p>b. They cannot be repeated or checked in the absence of the exhibit or sample;</p>

<p>c. They could be interpreted differently.</p>

<h3>Customer</h3>

<p>Whether internal or external, it is the organisation or a person that receives a product or service (e.g. the consumer, end-user, retailer, beneficiary or purchaser).</p>

<h3>Databases</h3>

<p>Collections of information designed to provide information rather than for archive, which are stored systematically in hard copy or electronic format and are, e.g. used for:</p>

<p>a. Providing information on the possible origin of objects or substances found in casework; and/or</p>

<p>b. Providing statistical information.</p>

<p>Also see the “Reference collection” entry.</p>

<h3>End user</h3>

<p>The end-user of forensic science is the Criminal Justice System, essentially the courts. A method or tool may not be directly used by the courts, but it is assumed the results will need to be.</p>

<h3>Expert (witness)</h3>

<p>An appropriately qualified and/or experienced person familiar with the testing, evaluation and interpretation of test or examination results and recognised by the court to provide live testimony to the court in the form of admissible hearsay evidence.</p>

<h3>Firmware</h3>

<p>A term sometimes used to denote the mainly fixed, usually rather small, programs that internally control various electronic devices (e.g. mobile phones, digital cameras, calculators, hard disks, keyboards, memory cards). There are no strict, or well defined, boundaries between firmware and software, but firmware is typically involved with very basic low-level operations in a device, without which the device would be completely non-functional.</p>

<h3>Forensic Unit</h3>

<p>A term used in ILAC-G19 to mean “a legal entity or a defined part of a legal entity that performs any part of the forensic science process”. It is interchangeable with provider. However, it is used in this document as these are small teams or sole practitioners that for accreditation purposes may be considered separate legal entities in larger organisations, forensic science providers and police forces.</p>

<h3>Infrequently Used Methods</h3>

<p>Methods that are not routinely performed in a particular forensic unit, these require to be validated and usually require specific procedures to ensure the forensic unit remains competent to perform them.</p>

<h3>Integrity: Data/Results</h3>

<p>The maintenance of, and the assurance of the accuracy, consistency and completeness of, data over its entire life-cycle. This applies to electronic and manual records.</p>

<h3>Integrity: Personal</h3>

<p>The quality of being honest and having strong moral principles.</p>

<h3>Investigating body</h3>

<p>A relevant law-enforcement body as defined in s63A(1A) and (1B) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, as amended.</p>

<h3>Logical (Data Capture)</h3>

<p>The capture of extant files, records, and returned values from a communication with a digital storage device. See for contrast the entry for Physical (Data Capture).</p>

<h3>Measurand</h3>

<p>A physical quantity, property, or condition quantity that is being determined by measurement.</p>

<h3>Method</h3>

<p>A logical sequence of operations, described generically for analysis (e.g. for the identification and/or quantification of drugs or explosives, or the determination of a DNA profile) or for comparison of items to establish their origin or authenticity (e.g. fingerprint/footwear mark/toolmark examination; microscopic identifications).</p>

<h3>Non-conformity</h3>

<p>The non-fulfilment of a requirement, either within the organisation’s policies, procedures or in the specification of the customer.</p>

<h3>Organisation</h3>

<p>A group of people and facilities with an arrangement of responsibilities, authorities and relationships (e.g. a company, corporation, firm, enterprise, institution, charity, sole trader, association, or parts or combination thereof).</p>

<h3>Physical (data capture)</h3>

<p>The production of a bit for bit copy of the targeted digital data. See for contrast the entry for “Logical (Data Capture)”.</p>

<h3>Practitioner</h3>

<p>An individual providing a forensic science service at any level or stage in the criminal investigation and trial process.</p>

<h3>Product</h3>

<p>A product is a discrete manufactured item used in the application of a method (e.g. a sampling kit or a piece of software). Its contents and performance will have defined characteristics, normally provided as a product specification.</p>

<h3>Proficiency tests</h3>

<p>Exercise to evaluate the competence of analysts and the quality performance of a laboratory.</p>

<p>Open or declared proficiency test:</p>

<p>a test in which the analysts are aware that they are being tested.</p>

<p>Blind or undeclared proficiency test:</p>

<p>a test in which the analysts are not aware that they are being tested.</p>

<p>External proficiency test:</p>

<p>a test conducted by an agency independent of the analysts or laboratory being tested.</p>

<h3>Precision</h3>

<p>Precision is synonymous with reproducibility or repeatability, whereas accuracy is about obtaining the true or correct value for the quantity measured. An incorrectly calibrated device may be capable of giving reproducibly precise readings even though data generated are not accurate.</p>

<h3>Provider</h3>

<p>The term is used to include all providers of forensic science, whether commercial, public sector or internal to the police service (e.g. scenes of crime, fingerprint bureau).</p>

<h3>Quality</h3>

<p>The totality of features and characteristics of a product or service that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs.</p>

<h3>Quality manual</h3>

<p>A document specifying the management system of an organisation.</p>

<h3>Recovered sample</h3>

<p>A term used in the forensic science context to refer to a sample obtained from an unknown source against which material from a known source (control sample) is to be compared to consider the strength of the evidence in support of a common origin.</p>

<h3>Reference collection</h3>

<p>A collection maintained for the purpose of study and authentication, also see database.</p>

<h3>Reference material</h3>

<p>9 Developed from work by the Council for the Registration of Forensic Practitioners.</p>

<p>10 Particularly conclusions reported in any report or in testimony.</p>

<p>11 As set out in the Statement of Standards and Accreditation within the Forensic Science Regulator’s Codes of Practice and Conduct.</p>

<p>12 Standards will be referred to in full the first time they appear in the body of this document and then, with the exception of the <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark38">4.</a> Normative References section, in a shortened form (e.g. ISO 17025, ISO 17020) from that point onwards unless specific cross references to clauses in that year’s version are made.</p>

<p>13 UKAS is a registered trademark of the United Kingdom Accreditation Service which is the national accreditation body for the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>14 Where accreditation is the requirement in the Statement of Standards and Accreditation Requirements.</p>

<p>15 The Regulator has a Memorandum of Understanding with the national accreditation body UKAS, agreements with other national accreditation bodies may be entered into if required.</p>

<p>16 The term scenes of incident, includes scenes prior to establishing whether a criminal or illegal action has taken place and relevant locations, for example where a body is found.</p>

<p>17 Appendices to these Codes (included in the index) are available from: <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/collections/forensic-science-providers-codes-of-practice-and-conduct">www.gov.uk/government/collections/forensic-science-providers-codes-of-practice-and-conduct</a> [Accessed 25/02/2021].</p>

<p>18 The Codes can be extended or adopted by other jurisdictions with approval of the appropriate Ministers, governing bodies and prosecuting authorities.</p>

<p>19 Organisations are expected to phase in changes into their quality management systems within 3 months of publication.</p>

<p>20 Due to the regulations for accessibility for web publishing, significant changes are also listed here and include: 2.1.1, 23.4 (whole section – reinstated from Issue 5)</p>

<p>21 The Codes and associated appendices may be used to provide guidance on certain suspect and victim sampling activities, however, when issued, the Forensic Medical Examination Standard FSR-C- 116, will set the standards required for the forensic medical examination of complainants of alleged sexual assault.</p>

<p>22 Where this is to be included in a provider’s schedule of accreditation, they will need to ensure that they are in compliance with the UKAS publication LAB 13. [94]</p>

<p>23 See glossary definition, this includes all providers of forensic science services to the CJS including sole practitioners, whether instructed by the prosecution or defence.</p>

<p>24 Exceptions are included in the Statement of Standards and Accreditation Requirements.</p>

<p>25 Certain parallel or duplication of processing may be used within the same organisation to satisfy this requirement, provided splitting casework does not render the sample suboptimal or introduce significant limitations.</p>

<p>26 See also The Accreditation of Forensic Service Providers Regulations 2018, The Accreditation of Forensic Service Providers (Amendment) Regulations 2019 and European Union (Future Relationship) Act 2020.</p>

<p>27 Producing an annex dealing with issues arising from partial or non-compliance allows the complex issue to be dealt with in the statement/report and could allow forensic units to produce standard lines to take for certain methods. Further detail on the content of the annex is available in the Regulator’s publications on reports and statements. [74]</p>

<p>28 A statement is one form of a report. It is formatted to comply with the provisions of s9 Criminal Justice Act 1967.</p>

<p>29 Experts will need to produce a different declaration if there are other non-compliances, whether inability to comply with specific clauses in the Codes of Conduct, or that accreditation is required.</p>

<p>30 Further guidance if required can be obtained from ISO 22313:2020 Security and resilience — Business continuity management systems — Guidance on the use of ISO 22301. [77]</p>

<p>31 Customers should ensure that their own business continuity plans have addressed the risk that a provider goes out of business with no legal successor, to ensure retained material, case files and associated paperwork is available (e.g. continuity and access records, validation records, competency records, calibration and maintenance records). Ideally this should be through stipulation in a contract, clarifying that copies of certain information need to be supplied with the case files.</p>

<p>32 The Regulator expects all forensic units to consider what additional supporting information would be required to support case files in such a circumstance (e.g. validation reports, calibration records) and make provisions for an appropriate body to retain access to it should it be required.</p>

<p>33 This should be scaled based upon risk, in some circumstances a desk-top exercise may be justifiable.</p>

<p>34 Some documents, such as standard operating procedures or validation reports, may be required for the life of the techniques and a blanket 30 years is often applicable from the last time the technique they refer to was used and/or reported.</p>

<p>35 Forensic units conducting activities which require accreditation to ISO 17025:2017 should note that although there is overlap with the standard’s clause 6.6 Externally Provided Products and Services, the standard has wider requirements which also apply.</p>

<p>36 Including relevant data, reports and records.</p>

<p>37 The National DNA Database is a registered trademark of the Secretary of State for the Home Department.</p>

<p>38 This can be demonstrated by consumable manufacturers and kit assemblers meeting the requirements set out in the Publicly Available Specification (PAS) 377:2012 Specification for consumables used in the collection, preservation and processing of material for forensic analysis - Requirements for product, manufacturing and forensic kit assembly [93] and/or BS ISO 18385:2016</p>

<p>39 A commonly accepted definition is any expression of negative feedback.</p>

<p>40 This may include where it has been identified there was a wrongful acquittal or a failure to detect the offender.</p>

<p>41 The Regulator wishes to be informed at the earliest opportunity once an issue has been confirmed as a quality failure rather than after a potentially prolonged investigation. Basic information on the incident and likely timescale for the investigation is often all that is needed at the notification stage.</p>

<p>42 Technical records are accumulations of data and information that result from carrying out tests, which should contain sufficient information to establish an audit trail and enable the repetition of the activity under conditions as close to the original as possible.</p>

<p>43 A system, for example, with timed and dated electronic-signatures could achieve this aim.</p>

<p>44 Changes to critical data are expected to be traceable, however it is accepted that systems may not always readily assist this, and any residual risks should be recorded and managed accordingly. It is expected that forensic units strive to implement systems which increase traceability of all technical records.</p>

<p>45 See ILAC-G19 section 3.5, however assurance of adequate control of electronic records will also need to be demonstrated.</p>

<p>46 Items should have an identifier which is unique within the organisation rather than simply within the case. Initials and number and/or date is not considered unique and although would not devalue or invalidate the exhibit if properly handled, it does add a risk which should be avoided.</p>

<p>47 Including those embedded in spreadsheets.</p>

<p>48 The forensic unit may identify individuals external to the unit to conduct critical findings checks.</p>

<p>49 The forensic unit shall demonstrate the competence of persons conducting critical findings checks (e.g. inclusion in the forensic unit’s proficiency trials), this includes persons external to the unit if they perform this role.</p>

<p>50 For instance, this determination may be at the identification of end-user requirements in the validation study.</p>

<p>51 Note ILAC-G19 section 4.7.5 requires this check to be conducted without knowledge of the original result where the critical findings check is the only quality control.</p>

<p>52 The frequency of audits should take account of the length of time (and stability of) the quality managements system has been in place, the size of the organisation, the complexity of the work being audited, the frequency of use of specific technical methods or procedures, and the potential consequences of noncompliance with the requirements. The value of occasional unannounced audits should also be considered.</p>

<p>53 The required level of clearance for prolonged or unsupervised access to case material is normally Security Check (SC) or Non-Police Personnel Vetting (NPPV) level 3, or equivalent. The clearance level required may however be varied in writing by the controller of the data or exhibit.</p>

<p>54 The confidentiality agreements should cover the intellectual property of the forensic unit and all information relating to casework, and shall not conflict with any disclosure requirements.</p>

<p>55 This may include records of Continuous Professional Development.</p>

<p>56 This may be a locally or nationally devised framework.</p>

<p>57 This is taken to be methods introduced or put forward for accreditation from October 2016.</p>

<p>58 With new methods involving data or digital media, steps in establishing procedures relevant to data contamination control in shall include a, b, e and g, although if exhibits are likely to also require trace evidence analysis this should be conducted first, or all these issues may still apply.</p>

<p>59 The same examiner should not examine the complainant and a suspect in relation to the same alleged incident.</p>

<p>60 This is taken to be methods introduced or put forward for accreditation prior to October 2016. However, at least one example of a validation compliant with the Codes will be required for assessment to include the Codes in the schedule of accreditation.</p>

<p>61 Subsequent releases of these Codes may extend the requirement to existing methods. However, updates in technology, reviews of existing methods and the need for continuous improvement are expected to prompt validation studies.</p>

<p>62 Major breakthroughs, novel uses of existing science, or significant changes might warrant wider stakeholder consultations. In these cases, it would be useful to inform the Regulator, who may advise on the most expedient method of ensuring that the CJS requirements are understood.</p>

<p>63 See ILAC-G19:08/2014 (3.10): “When a method has been validated in another organization the forensic unit shall review validation records to ensure that the validation performed was fit for purpose. It is then possible for the forensic unit to only undertake verification for the method to demonstrate that the unit is competent to perform the test/examination.” The Codes expect the review to be against the end-user’s requirements with the production of the statement of validation completion see section <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark114">21.2.57.</a></p>

<p>64 Legal advice may be required for the use of casework material where the exemption in relevant legislation ‘for law enforcement purposes’ may not apply. Validation studies on casework material generates disclosure requirements and a protocol with guidance on the issue of handling differences between results obtained with existing and the new methods. [41]</p>

<p>65 Good experimental design ensures the study tests the features required and can reduce the overall experimental effort.</p>

<p>66 The applicability of the parameter should be considered against the aim and the nature of the test. Determining a limit of quantification (j) may be evaluated as not applicable in an entirely qualitative test, but there may still be a requirement to estimate the uncertainty (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark119">22.</a> Estimation of Uncertainty).</p>

<p>67 Examples of interpretive methods may include the comparison of marks, handwriting or microscopic comparisons.</p>

<p>68 Examples of data where the truth is known (not inferred) include datasets created from known donors of samples or call data records created by staged calls at specific coordinates.</p>

<p>69 See UKAS RG 201 for methods intended for incident scene use. [2]</p>

<p>70 Replacing the same make and model may still need some assessment as minor modifications, including software and firmware, might affect the operation.</p>

<p>71 As with all validations the study should be scaled according to user requirement and case circumstances the adequacy and relevance of the available existing validation study, however the forensic unit must still verify the scope of the validation with the required steps in <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark99">21.2.5,</a> even if these are brief.</p>

<p>72 The same person may carry out both the independent evaluation and the independent authorisation, if competent to do so.</p>

<p>73 The person(s) may be employed by the forensic unit, contracted by the forensic unit to carry out the evaluation, or be wholly independent of the forensic unit. If employed by the forensic unit, the evaluator/authoriser would need to be able to demonstrate the appropriate level of independence.</p>

<p>74 Forensic units with methods already within the schedule of accreditation will often only be required to compile the validation library, which contains a validation report in its original format and the comparable information that the end-user requirement and/or specification would contain (i.e. what the method was intended to be able to do). It is good practice to review the completeness of the validation at this stage and take any further steps to ensure that the method can be said to be valid on the basis of the records held.</p>

<p>75 The blanket retention period is an alternative to tracking a method’s use in casework and applying the correct retention period in accordance with the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996, as amended.</p>

<p>76 See also the CPS Core Foundation Principles for Forensic Science Providers [78] and the list of questions in direction 19A.5 contained in the Criminal Practice Directions. [27]</p>

<p>77 The literature review also ensures the body of knowledge requirement as outlined in R v. Bonython [1984] 38 SASR 45 can be demonstrated as well as supporting the application of direction 19A.5d of the Criminal Practice Directions V.</p>

<p>78 Commercial-in-confidence does not override the disclosure requirements of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 as amended and may prevent methods, products or services being used.</p>

<p>79 The forensic unit may undertake testing as part of incident scene investigation. ILAC-G19 includes, but does not limit such testing to, quantitative measurements and presumptive or screening tests. Inspection activity that contains testing is expected to meet the relevant requirements of ISO 17025, this includes but is not limited to estimation of uncertainty of measurement (see also ILAC-G27 [79]).</p>

<p>80 This critical control point approach is advocated in guidance issued by the Regulator for assessing the risk of cognitive bias as a result of information flow as well as for assessing contamination and therefore the process mapping may be used for assessment of these and other risks in the process.</p>

<p>81 Assessment of what is key data should be risk based, and process mapping to look at data flow through each process and identify critical control points would be an appropriate assessment of what stages in the process require specific protection steps to prevent loss, corruption and unauthorised access.</p>

<p>82 Further information and guidance can be found in BS 10008:2014, Evidential weight and legal admissibility of electronic information – Specification. [80]</p>

<p>83 Acceptable may be defined in the method’s end-user requirements or specifications.</p>

<p>84 Further information and guidance can be found in ISO 12653-1:2000, Electronic imaging - Test target for the black-and-white scanning of office documents - Part 1: Characteristics. [81]</p>

<p>85 A digital object is a discrete digital structure that contains meaningful data (e.g. a text file, call record or image), metadata (e.g. details of the data format, ownership or relationship to other data) and a unique identifier.</p>

<p>86 The testing may be conducted by the forensic unit’s IT provider, however the responsibility to ensure it occurs and provide evidence of the testing resides with the forensic unit.</p>

<p>87 Second factor authentication or two-factor authentication (often shortened to 2FA) is something that the user (and only the user) can access, such as a code that is sent by text message, or that is created by an application or dongle. [82]</p>

<p>88 With the exception of evidence handling software applications which require administrative rights for normal operation.</p>

<p>89 For example, legacy software is sometimes required to access old media or for revisiting the analysis of old cases.</p>

<p>90 This procedure is for the general transfer of electronic information, it does not relate to exhibit and evidence handling.</p>

<p>91 Memory cards used for cameras are excluded from encryption.</p>

<p>92 Systems used for different forensic science work may need segregation from each other; for example, internet intelligence and investigation workstations and systems from other digital forensics activities.</p>

<p>93 Separate location means a separate building not merely a separate room. Exceptions to this requirement will be rare, but may include forensic units with specific high security requirements. Back- ups also need to be secured from potential malware or ransomware attacks so offline backup is expected. Sole traders may enter into reciprocal storage agreements if they choose to.</p>

<p>94 This may be part of the overall business continuity and disaster recovery plan or a separate IT incident management plan.</p>

<p>95 This subsection was omitted in error from Issue 6, Issue 7 corrects this omission.</p>

<p>96 Older versions of software may be needed for compatibility with work being undertaken related to older products, or to maintain the validated systems’ configuration.</p>

<p>97 This should include procedures for checking and booking in items, that consider the risk of opening sealed containers without obtaining an immediate inventory i.e. particularly important for cases involving controlled substances/items, but relevant in any area where exhibit loss could be a consideration.</p>

<p>98 Customers should consider having a procedure for receipt of cases and checking exhibits being returned from the forensic unit.</p>

<p>99 For example, when handling hypodermic syringe needles or blood samples.</p>

<p>100 For example, firearms, bulk drugs seizures or explosives, where the forensic unit also carries out gunshot residue analysis or trace drugs or explosives analysis, unless separate reception arrangements and accommodation are provided for these.</p>

<p>101 For example, cases involving human tissues, drugs, firearms or explosives, for which there may be specific health and safety legislation requirements or specific licensing required.</p>

<p>102 Any specific clauses or controls stipulated shall be communicated to any subcontractors or external providers who are authorised to handle the exhibits.</p>

<p>103 In England and Wales and Northern Ireland see the Human Tissue Act 2004 or in Scotland the Human Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006.</p>

<p>104 See HOC 40/73: Handling and disposal of blood samples in criminal cases (other than those brought under the Road Traffic Act 1972) [83] this recommends to Chief Police Officers that on completion of examination the sample should be retained at the laboratory and the defence notified that it will be destroyed after 21 days unless they request otherwise. However, if the sample is exhibited, it should not be destroyed without the permission of the committing court. HOC 41/73 [84] provides similar recommendations to HOC 40/73, but to the courts. HOC 125/76 [85] extends the arrangements of HOC 40/73 and 41/73 to the handling and disposal of saliva samples. HOC 74/82 [86]: Disposal of blood samples, saliva samples and swabs stained with body fluid: handling of exhibits: extends the arrangements of HOCs 40/73 41/73 and 125/76 to the disposal of swabs stained with body fluid. HOC 25/87 [87] extends the provisions of HOC 74/82 to cover the disposal of urine and any other body samples not previously covered.</p>

<p>105 Forensic units may refer to the [88] or the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI)</p>

<p>106 BS EN ISO/IEC 17025:2017 requires laboratories to ensure only suitable externally provided products and services that affect laboratory activities are used. This includes proficiency testing services. ISO/IEC 17043:2010 [23] contains recommendations and guidance on the requirements for the operation of PT schemes. These documents should be used as a basis for such an evaluation.</p>

<p>107 UKAS accredits PT providers to ISO/IEC 17043:2010; a list of accredited schemes/providers is available; UKAS recommends the use of an accredited scheme where one exists. [90]</p>

<p>108 See Criminal Procedure Rules 19.2 – (1)(b)(ii) where warning the court of any significant failure to act as required by a direction includes warning of any substantial delay in the preparation of a report.</p>

<p>109 Documentation of work underpinning reports and statements may be kept separate where it is traceable to the correct reports and statements.</p>

<p>110 Non-compliance is considered to be information that could significantly detract from the credibility of a witness and may have a bearing on reliability. In England and Wales, disclosure of such matters is not restricted to experts (see the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996, R v. Ward [1993] 1</p>

<p>111 This does not apply to a Streamlined Forensic Report 1 (SFR1) as that is not intended to be used as evidence. However, a SFR1 does require a declaration about accreditation; see sub-section Types of report in the CJS.</p>

<p>112 See Criminal Practice Directions V 19B (1) 13 “I confirm that I have acted in accordance with the code of practice or conduct for experts of my discipline, namely [identify the code]”.</p>

<p>113 In England and Wales.</p>

<p>114 If the set requirement is accreditation to ISO 17025 and the Codes, but the practitioner’s forensic unit only holds accreditation to ISO 17025 without including the Codes then they are not fully compliant and must declare so. If no firm requirement has been set for an area of work (e.g. case review), then the requirement is for practitioners to be compliant with the Code of Conduct, but not the entirety of the Codes or any specific accreditation.</p>

<p>115 This will be the issue of the Code of Conduct that was in force on the date of the statement. If the analytical work was conducted to the standards required at the time it was performed, it will be deemed to be compliant, even if the statement is produced later when a future Code of Conduct applies. Should the practitioner feel the that time gap between the analytical work and the statement might mislead, they may wish to add “and the standards required at the time of the analytical work” to this declaration.</p>

<p>116 For England and Wales.</p>

<p>117 ILAC G19 section 4.9 includes oral reports, including the requirement to record the information conveyed.</p>

<p>118 The Crown Prosecution Service has stated that, in England and Wales, “Statements and Streamlined Forensic Reports (SFR1 and SFR2) should state whether the organisation or laboratory concerned is accredited, whether the forensic evidence relates to DNA and fingerprint evidence or other forensic disciplines.”</p>

<p>119 In cases where those preparing the SFR1 are aware of further information that might meet the test for common-law disclosure set out above, that information should be communicated to the investigator and by the investigator to the prosecutor using form MG6 (or its equivalent).</p>

<p>120 Also see the list included in the Criminal Practice Directions V (19A.5c).</p>

<p>121 Note the Criminal Procedure Rules 19.3-(3c) requires experts to provide “notice of anything of which the party serving it is aware which might reasonably be thought capable of detracting substantially from the credibility of that expert.” This provision applies to experts providing reports for either the defence or prosecution team.</p>

<p>122 The cost of archiving documents relating to the forensic unit’s testing and examinations is a business cost to be borne by the forensic unit. Reimbursement of the costs for archiving exhibits and evidential material recovered from exhibits is a business matter to be agreed between the forensic unit instructed by the prosecution and the customer (e.g. police).</p>

<p>123 The Legal Aid Agency’s position on charges levied upon the defence by prosecution forensic science laboratories is available in their publication ‘Guidance on forensic science laboratory charges in criminal matters’. [91]</p>

<p>124 The forensic unit appointed by the prosecution may require, if it chooses to, that supporting supplementary material (e.g. manuals, SOPs) is returned by the defence’s forensic unit or that the supplied copies are destroyed, as appropriate, once the case is concluded.</p>

<p>125 The Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 modified the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to have specific controls for the destruction, retention and use of biometric data which means certain requirements may be stipulated as a condition of access to any third party which is authorised to handle material.</p>

<p>126 Cross references some of the key clauses that appear in the normative references, clauses in other documents may also be relevant (e.g. ILAC-P15).</p>
