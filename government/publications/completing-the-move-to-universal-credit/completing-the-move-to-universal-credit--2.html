<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Since first being introduced in 2013, Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) has streamlined and simplified the benefits system to better support those in work on low incomes, as well as those who are unemployed or who cannot work. By improving work incentives and support, <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> helped deliver the highest ever level of employment seen in this country just before COVID hit. A dynamic benefit that reflects people’s needs from month to month, <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> successfully supported millions of people and processed a ten-fold surge in claims during the pandemic, when legacy systems would have collapsed.</p>

<p>In March 2020, work was paused on moving those claiming legacy benefits<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>  (“legacy claimants”) to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> - known as managed migration - to focus on our response to the pandemic. Informed by learnings from our initial pilot and throughout the pandemic, the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) will resume the roll out and complete the implementation of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> by 2024.</p>

<p>We will complete the implementation of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> with a three-track approach – natural migration, voluntary migration (“choose to move”) and managed migration.</p>

<p>Natural migration has been in place since the introduction of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>. If claimants experience a change in circumstances while on legacy benefits which previously required a new claim to another legacy benefit replaced by <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>, they will need to make a claim to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>. They would then naturally migrate to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and any legacy claim will be closed.  Legacy claimants can also choose to move by making a claim for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> (and by default closing their legacy claim) but should only do this if they think they will be better off on <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>.</p>

<p>We want to encourage people who could be better off financially to consider moving to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>.  We estimate more than half of current claimants will be better off.  In this document, we set out our modelled analysis on estimated benefit entitlements and employment outcomes between <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and legacy benefits, including the types and numbers of claimants who could benefit financially by moving to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>.</p>

<p>We set out examples of claimants’ circumstances for those likely to have lower or higher <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> entitlements than they receive now with illustrative case studies. With work at the heart of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>, we also include some case studies showing how claimants can increase their disposable income by entering or extending work.  We are mindful that working tax credit recipients would no longer be constrained by the 16-hour cliff edge.</p>

<p>To further support claimants in making an informed choice about moving to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> a range of information is available. This includes factual information on the ‘Understanding Universal Credit’ homepage, impartial advice from independent organisations, and independent benefit calculators which allow claimants to get an indicative estimate of what their <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> award might be. At a minimum, claimants should consider the following before choosing to move to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check that you are eligible to claim Universal Credit; Search ‘Universal Credit eligibility gov.uk’ to find out more.</li>
  <li>Check your savings. Anyone with over £16,000 in savings or capital is not eligible for Universal Credit and should not apply. If you or your partner have over £6,000 in savings or capital, your <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> payments will be lower.</li>
  <li>Check how <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> recovers any outstanding debts you may have. Search ‘debt and deductions gov.uk’ to find out more.</li>
  <li>Use one of the independent benefit calculators to see if your entitlement to Universal Credit could be higher than the money the government pays you now. Search, ‘benefit calculator gov.uk’ to find out more.</li>
</ul>

<p>For those claimants who do not choose to move and have not migrated naturally following a change of circumstance, we will need to manage their migration to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>. Managed migration is a significant undertaking and requires the department to design and build an end to end service that safely supports claimants to make the Move to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>. This includes being able to confidently identify and contact eligible claimants, appropriately support claimants through their claim and accurately calculate transitional protection for eligible claimants, to ensure their entitlement on <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> at the point of managed transition is not below that of legacy benefits.</p>

<h2>Our Move to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> journey so far</h2>

<p>Before the pandemic, the department was running a Move to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> pilot, based in Harrogate. The purpose of the pilot was to test and evaluate the products and processes required to enable the department to move claimants from legacy benefits to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>. The pilot was paused in 2020 as the department prioritised the handling of a significant increase in new claims for Universal Credit in response to the Covid pandemic.</p>

<p>Before it was paused, the pilot service had engaged with a number of claimants known to the Harrogate job centre and had explored:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how claimants respond to a notice to migrate to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>;</li>
  <li>the processes and tools required by staff to calculate transitional protection; and</li>
  <li>an early observation that a small number of claimants may be willing and able to take the step to self serve and make a claim to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> but that most claimants will need support in order to achieve this.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of the demand the pandemic generated in new claims to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>, we now know more about our ability to scale processes to handle claims.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2022-24 </span> Move to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Strategy</h2>

<p>Learning from how <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> has operated during the pandemic and from key insights in the Harrogate pilot, we have revised our strategy for the migration of approximately 2.6 million households from legacy benefits and tax credits to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> by 2024.  We still need to finalise our approach, particularly for managed migration, and will undertake further work in some parts of the country, learning what support different claimants are likely to need in order to make a successful claim for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Our strategy has three “tracks” of migration – natural, voluntary and managed.</p>

<h3>Natural migration</h3>

<p>As has been the case since the start of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> rollout, when a legacy claimant experiences a change in circumstances (for example, a change in employment status or family situation), they need to make a new claim for a benefit that <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> has replaced and they will “naturally” migrate to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>. Covid-related easements that were in place for working tax credit recipients have now been removed and we expect natural migration to continue at a steady rate going forward.</p>

<h3>Voluntary migration</h3>

<p>Legacy claimants can choose themselves to voluntarily move across to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>.  Our modelled estimates suggest that around 1.4 million households could be better off by moving to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> straightaway. We set out later our methodology and assumptions on how we have developed these estimates.</p>

<p>The complexity of the legacy benefits system means it can be difficult for people to see and compare their overall entitlements. We want to help claimants make an informed choice themselves about whether to move voluntarily. This includes looking at different ways to provide information to legacy benefit claimants. For example, by signposting them to independent benefit calculators, independent welfare advice and through a communications campaign to raise awareness and tackle misperceptions.</p>

<p>This approach is about making sure that those who stand to see a higher entitlement have the opportunity to move sooner rather than later, while simultaneously making sure those who may have a lower <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> award wait for managed migration when they may be eligible for transitional protection so they retain the same entitlement at the point they move. People who choose to move voluntarily are not entitled to transitional protection which is why it is important that claimants have confidence they are making an informed choice. Once an application is made to move to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>, there is no reverting to previous benefits.</p>

<h3>Managed migration</h3>

<p>For those claimants who do not choose to migrate voluntarily nor have migrated naturally, we will need to manage their migration to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Underpinning managed migration is our commitment to <strong>transitional financial protection</strong> to ensure that eligible households we move to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> do not have a lower award on <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> at the point we move them if their <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> entitlement is lower than their entitlement on legacy benefits.</p>

<p>We recognise that claimants’ confidence, experience and trust in the benefit system will vary. That is why the managed migration track will also be underpinned by a customer-focused approach with effective processes and systems to move people across safely.</p>

<p>There are several key tasks to focus on to start managed migration:</p>

<p>i.	gathering data on the different circumstances of legacy benefits’ claimants;</p>

<p>ii.	designing the processes and tools to calculate both <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> entitlement and transitional protection (where applicable), then paying the correct award;</p>

<p>iii.	assessing and providing the different levels of support required to make a successful claim;</p>

<p>iv.	considering how best to notify claimants about their move; and,</p>

<p>v.	understanding the different challenges claimants may face after making their claim to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and the support they need.</p>

<p>Work to design the managed migration process resumed this January. We will soon start moving small numbers of legacy claimants on to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>, with a focus on refining the processes and systems for doing so to support our claimants as effectively as possible.</p>

<p>Optimising our support for claimants in moving to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> will be a critical part of the managed migration process.  The department will work closely with our stakeholder groups throughout this work to monitor and understand what support is required and what works bests for claimants. We expect that finalising our approach will take several months before we start scaling the managed migration process in earnest, to be completed by 2024.</p>

<h2>Transitional Protection</h2>

<p>Parliament legislated to introduce <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and for the end of legacy benefits, including tax credits. When passing this legislation, Parliament also committed to providing transitional financial protection for those who are moved onto <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> through the managed migration process. Transitional protection does not apply to those who naturally or voluntarily migrate.</p>

<p>This means those eligible households with a lower calculated award in <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> than their legacy benefits awards will see no difference in their entitlement at the point they are moved to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>, provided there is no change in their circumstances during the migration process.  The transitional protection element will erode over time with increases in <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> elements - excluding the childcare costs element - and will stop with certain changes of circumstances.</p>

<p>The Government has also provided additional protection for those who had a change in circumstance and have been receiving Severe Disability Premium.</p>

<p>In addition, all new claimants and those migrating from tax credits who are gainfully self-employed will be eligible for a 12-month start-up grace period before the Minimum Income Floor applies, to help them grow their business.</p>

<h2>Will I have a higher or lower <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> entitlement than I receive now?</h2>

<p>Types of claimant that might see a higher entitlement under <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>) Support Group <strong>who are not in receipt</strong> of the Severe Disability Premium;</li>
  <li>In-work households receiving Housing Benefit only or Working Tax Credit and Housing Benefit (likely to have higher entitlements under <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> as the earnings taper rules are more generous);</li>
  <li>People who do not work enough hours to receive Working Tax Credit; and</li>
  <li>Households who are not currently claiming all the legacy benefits they are entitled to.</li>
</ul>

<p>Types of claimant that might see a lower entitlement under <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> (and therefore likely to be eligible for transitional protection if they are moved through the managed migration process) include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Households in receipt of Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>) who are in receipt of the Severe Disability Premium and Enhanced Disability Premium</li>
  <li>Households with the lower disabled child addition on legacy benefits;</li>
  <li>Self-employed households who are subject to the Minimum Income Floor, after the 12 month grace period has ended.</li>
  <li>In-work households that worked a specific number of hours (for example, lone parent working 16 hours claiming Working Tax Credits), which discouraged progression in the labour market. This was not good for employees, but it also caused problems for employers, limiting their scope to design jobs to fit their business rather than the incentives created by the welfare system; and</li>
  <li>Households receiving tax credits with savings of more than £6,000 (and up to £16,000) - <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> entitlement is reduced in a different calculation to tax credits (households with savings of more than £16,000 are not normally eligible for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Case Studies 1 to 10 in the Annex provide examples of such households.</p>

<h3>Further information to support decision on voluntary migration to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>
</h3>

<p>A range of information is available to inform decisions about whether to make a voluntary move to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>. This includes the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.understandinguniversalcredit.gov.uk/" rel="external">Understanding Universal Credit webpage</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that once a new claim to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> is made, households cannot go back to their previous benefits. If an individual’s circumstances would mean their Universal Credit payments would be less than what they currently receive in benefits, they should wait to be moved by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. This is because transitional protection is only available through managed migration, as outlined above.</p>

<h2>Estimating entitlement analysis<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>
</h2>

<p>Of the 2.6 million households remaining on legacy benefits in April 2022, should they choose to claim <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> today, we estimate around 1.4 million (55%) would have a higher entitlement on <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>, 300,000 would see no change and approximately 900,000 households (35%) would have a lower entitlement.</p>

<p>Of the 900,000 with a lower entitlement, we estimate (in <strong>Table 2</strong> below) that approximately 600,000 households will receive transitional protection through managed migration, while others will either leave benefits, migrate naturally before <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> asks them to move or receive a severe disability transitional payment.</p>

<p>In Table 3 below, we have considered how Universal Credit as a whole compares to what households would have been entitled to if all claimants had remained on legacy benefits or tax credits. This ‘steady state’ analysis was originally produced in 2012 and this analysis is an update of that work incorporating the various policy changes which have been made.</p>

<p>We estimate 3.8 million households (53%) have a higher notional entitlement on <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>, 1.2 million (17%) have no change and around 2.2 million (30%) are estimated to have a lower notional entitlement before any protections are applied. This is a notable increase in the proportion of households with higher notional entitlement since 2012.</p>

<p>It is important to highlight that the majority of individual households on <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> are unlikely to have had the same underlying circumstances that they had when under the legacy benefits or tax credits system and the analysis does not take account of any protections received for those moving from legacy benefits. Therefore, while this ‘steady state’ analysis is important in comparing the two systems at an aggregate level, for individual households these are likely to be theoretical or ‘notional’ changes in entitlement rather than a direct cash gain or loss.</p>

<p>Also, the fundamental change to the system means there are a range of impacts on notional household entitlements. Eligible households with a lower calculated award in <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> than their legacy benefits will be eligible for Transitional Protection if moved to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> under the managed migration track, so they would see no difference in their entitlement at the point they move to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>.</p>

<h3>How <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> helps people move into work and progress, by keeping more of what you earn</h3>

<p>Following changes to the way that <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> works people can now keep more of what they earn, as they increase their wages thanks to an eight percentage point cut to the earnings taper rate and a £500 a year increase in the work allowance (the amount eligible claimants can earn before the taper is applied). As a result of the reduction in the taper rate and increase in the work allowance, we estimate nearly two million working households will, on average, be around £1,000 a year better off. Being on Universal Credit also opens up tailored support from work coaches to help get into and progress in work, using the full toolkit of Plan for Jobs.</p>

<p>Case Studies 11 to 13 set out in the Annex below show how certain claimants might utilise the improved work incentives to enter and progress in work and increase their disposable incomes.</p>

<p>Out of work claimants are more likely to move into work on <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> compared to <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>. Having previously published three studies showing that <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> gets people into work quicker compared to the legacy system, our fourth analysis of the final cohort drawn from 2018 as <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> new claims rollout completed shows <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> again out-performing the legacy system in terms of employment outcomes (summary set out in table 4).</p>

<h2>Annex 1: Case Studies</h2>

<p>Illustrative Case Studies on awards (A) and examples of how <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> supports people to increase their income through work (B)</p>

<h3>A. Illustrative Case Studies on awards</h3>
<p>Households may have a higher or lower entitlement under Universal Credit compared to legacy benefits. Case studies 1 to 10 provide some illustrative examples based on a number of assumptions around the characteristics of the household. Any hours of childcare required are assumed to be provided free of charge through <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> offers or by family/friends (unless stated). Amounts are rounded to nearest £10 per month and therefore totals may not sum.</p>

<p>Case studies 1 to 5 provide examples of households who could be better off on <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> now. Case studies 6 to 10 illustrate households who could benefit from waiting to move to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> via managed migration. In those examples where the household has a lower entitlement, transitional protection would be applied if a household moved through the managed migration process, but not if the household made a voluntary move or naturally migrates as a result of a change of circumstance.</p>

<h2>Annex 2:  Detail on the methodology used in the document</h2>

<p>This annex sets out some additional detail on how the estimates in the main publication were produced.</p>

<h3>Tables 1-3 – Entitlement Analysis</h3>

<p>The method for deriving notional higher and notional lower entitlements presented in Tables 1-3 compares Universal Credit (in line with current policy design and legislation) with the legacy system it replaces (in line with current policy design and legislation).</p>

<p>In addition, some households in the legacy system do not take-up all of the benefit they are entitled, to where they are entitled to more than one means-tested benefit. The integrated nature of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> may reasonably be assumed to increase take up and these effects are included here.</p>

<p>Tables 1 and 2 are based on a subset of the population who are currently in receipt of legacy benefits. The assessment of entitlement is made using the Department’s Policy Simulation Model (<abbr title="Policy Simulation Model">PSM</abbr>) which is based on the 2019/20 Family Resources Survey (<abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr>) and aligned to the Spring 2022 legacy and Universal Credit caseload forecasts. More detail on the Department’s forecast methodology is outlined in the Welfare Trends Report – March 2021<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>. In addition to present estimates in April 2022 we align to the Department’s monthly Legacy Rundown forecast Model.</p>

<p>The calculation is made based on current household circumstances on legacy benefits and whether their <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> entitlement would be higher or lower if they claimed <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> under their current circumstances. However, many of these households will have change of circumstances which mean they claim <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>. As in the legacy system they might receive a different amount of benefit due to the change in their circumstances.</p>

<p>Table 3 is based on a steady state comparison of the two systems when <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> is fully rolled out, comparing those who would have been eligible for benefits under legacy, <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> or both.</p>

<p>As a fundamental reform of the existing benefit system, we estimate that <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>, in steady state, will result in around 600,000 households that were not entitled to a legacy benefit becoming newly eligible for benefits. These fall under the ‘notionally higher entitlement’ in the main publication. Similarly, we estimate there will be around 400,000 households who were able to claim some combination of legacy benefits but will not be entitled to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>. These are reflected in the ‘notionally lower entitlement’ categories. Taken together, the steady state analysis looks at the impact of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> on around 7.2 million households as detailed below.</p>

<p>A slightly older version of the <abbr title="Policy Simulation Model">PSM</abbr>, (Spring Budget 2020 – based on <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> 2017/18) was used for steady state because it was the last time the Department’s forecasting models were aligned to counterfactual<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup> legacy benefit forecasts, so it was the most robust way to estimate steady state impacts.</p>

<p>As with Tables 1 and 2 estimates of change in entitlements in Table 3 are all notional. So, for example an individual who became eligible for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> in 2023 but had never claimed legacy benefits would be included, although they do not see a cash change in their entitlement.</p>

<p>The numbers presented are rounded to the nearest 100,000 and the percentages to the nearest 1 percent.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>The analysis is based on elements of the change to the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> system that can be reasonably assessed using the 2019/20 <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr>. It does not include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Debt, deductions, advances and Passported Benefits</strong> – these estimates set out legacy system and <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> entitlement without any deductions that are made from awards for debts, deductions and advances or any changes to receipt of Passported Benefits such as Free School Meals. The <abbr title="Policy Simulation Model">PSM</abbr> estimates annual entitlements so does not include differences from month to month from claimants taking an advance and then paying it back or claimants paying back debts. The Department does not have a database or model that brings together all legacy household’s actual legacy benefit receipts and debts to be able to calculate and include these which is why we use the <abbr title="Policy Simulation Model">PSM</abbr>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Fraud, error or overpayments</strong> and any differences in these between <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and the legacy system. This is reasonable because we compare what claimants should receive on legacy and what they should receive on <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the analysis includes forecasts of demographic change. If these forecasts and forecasts of underlying household characteristics change it would change the number of those with higher and lower entitlements. Although the <abbr title="Policy Simulation Model">PSM</abbr> is aligned to published <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and legacy benefit caseload forecasts many of the underlying characteristics of the households are based on the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> sample. The <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> is a sample of 20,000 households which is scaled up to the UK population. So, some of the household characteristics will be subject to sampling error as with any sample. To reflect this uncertainty, we have rounded estimates to the nearest 100,000.</p>

<h3>Definitions and terminology</h3>

<p>The analysis is consistent with the Department’s published forecasts, but it is presented differently.  The analysis is presented in a legacy benefit hierarchy which allows a view of the total caseload without overlaps.</p>

<p>The first three benefits shown are <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>, <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>, and <abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr>, followed by Tax Credits with or without Housing Benefit, and finally Housing Benefit only. This is best demonstrated in the table below.</p>

</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tax Credits (<abbr title="Tax Credits">TC</abbr>)</td>
      <td>

    <tr>

</table>

<p><abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> and <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> households are included if they are (i) income based claimants, or (ii) contributory and income based. If <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> contributory claimants are also on Housing Benefit or Child Tax Credit they would show in Tax Credits or Housing Benefit groups. This is because <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> and <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> new style benefits remain for contributory and credits only claimants but if a household claim Tax Credits as well, that support will move to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>.</p>

<p>For the analysis in Tables 1 and 2 the classification above relates to what benefit households actually take-up, so if someone is eligible for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> and Tax Credits but only take-up their Tax Credits, we class them as a Tax Credit claimant. This is because we only include people who are claiming legacy benefits and not those who are eligible, but do not actually take them up. For the steady state analysis in Table 3 we classify them based on what they are entitled to. This only impacts the group they are included in rather than the overall estimates of those with a higher or lower entitlement.</p>

<h3>Table 4 - Labour Market Impacts</h3>

<p>Table 4 is based on a similar methodology to that seen in previous assessments of the labour market impact of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>, which received considerable independent peer review<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>. The main changes are this analysis considers the employment impact of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Full Service (rather than Live Service), has a larger sample size and is based on Jobcentres across the whole of Great Britain. It compares new claims to <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> and <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> between January and April 2018, this allows the fairest comparison of impacts and the results are robust to several sensitivity checks.</p>
