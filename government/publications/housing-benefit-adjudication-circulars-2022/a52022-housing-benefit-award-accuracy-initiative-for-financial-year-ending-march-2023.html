<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>1. The Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) will continue to work with local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) to tackle fraud and error through the Housing Benefit Award Accuracy (<abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr>) Initiative from 4 April 2022 onwards and has secured funding of approximately £11.4 million for the financial year ending (<abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr>) March 2023.</p>

<p>2. This circular sets out all the details of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> Initiative for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023. The funding is designed to support <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> undertaking the prescribed activities to proactively identify unreported changes and make sure the right amount of benefit is paid to the right person at the right time.</p>

<p>3. In consultation with <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> representatives on the Practitioners’ Operational Group (<abbr title="Practitioners’ Operational Group">POG</abbr>), the Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery (<abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr>) division has agreed that participation should be in line with the Verify Earnings and Pensions (<abbr title="Verify Earnings and Pensions">VEP</abbr>) service. In other words, we shall assume that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will participate unless they provide exceptional reasons not to.</p>

<p>4. Examples of exceptional circumstances could include a cyber-attack, loss of IT or building.</p>

<p>5. An all <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> call was held on 10 March 2022 at 11am. A recording of this call can be found on Glasscubes (posted on 17 March 2022).</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>6. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> were advised in March 2020 about the launch of the new <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> Initiative with effect from April 2020 via circular <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> A5/2020. However shortly after, following consultation with <abbr title="Practitioners’ Operational Group">POG</abbr> and the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> Welfare Steering Group, <abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr> made the decision to pause the Initiative in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>7. We then wrote to <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> Revenues and Benefits managers and Chief Finance Officers on 4 August 2020 about relaunching the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> Initiative from 5 October 2020, (see circular <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> A9/2020 for further details).</p>

<p>8.	A further two start dates were also offered to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> of 2 November and 30 November 2020.</p>

<p>9. The <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> Initiative was successfully relaunched and, despite the pandemic, 267 <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> opted to take part for the remainder of the <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2021 (year one).</p>

<p>10. Participation in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> Initiative for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2022 (year two) remained voluntary with the option of three opt in dates (6 April, 5 July and 4 October). There was also the option to opt out for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2022.</p>

<p>11. 239 <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> opted to take part for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2022, despite the additional pressures brought about by the pandemic, (see circular <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> A6/2021 for further details.)</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> Initiative funding for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023</h2>

<p>12. A launch letter for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023 (year three) was sent to all <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> on 16 February 2022, providing details of DWPs plans to continue focusing on improving award accuracy for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> with effect from 4 April 2022.</p>

<p>13. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> participating in the <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023 will receive additional funding to enable them to undertake the following activities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Full Case Reviews (<abbr title="Full Case Reviews">FCRs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Matching Service (<abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr>) referrals, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Self-employed Earnings Reviews (<abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Reviews">SERs</abbr>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the correct recording of cases and the return of management information (<abbr title="management information">MI</abbr>) to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, including:
    <ul>
      <li>the correct recording of case outcomes on <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> IT systems to inform <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> (Single Housing Benefit Extract)</li>
      <li>the return of clerical <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> for <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> case outcomes for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2022 (year two) in line with June 2022 planned return dates (up to 1 July 2022)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are still required to continue to return clerical spreadsheets for all <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> referrals received up to and including February 2022, until all referrals have had an outcome notified to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. This is to ensure <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> remains accurate; albeit outcomes notified after planned June 2022 returns will not count towards year two <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> performance. (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should refer to paragraphs 66–75 for more detail).</p>

<p>14. The frequently asked questions (<abbr title="frequently asked questions">FAQs</abbr>) on the Initiative have been shared with <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and version 2 is available on Glasscubes in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> Initiative folder. This will be updated regularly.</p>

<p>15. Funding for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023 was secured in the 2020 Spending Review. The settlement from HM Treasury included funding up to <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2025. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has assured HM Treasury the funding will be used to pay for additional staff or to backfill for existing staff.</p>

<p>16. However, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are allowed some flexibility to spend the funding on relevant activities carried out in connection with administering the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> Initiative. This could include the purchase of software that will make the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> Initiative review process more effective. Any use of robotics solutions must be in line with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> policy. Please refer to the letters from Paul Selby sent by email to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> on 15 February and 3 June 2021.</p>

<p>17. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> who choose to use part of the funding to purchase software should notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.frauderrordebt@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.frauderrordebt@dwp.gov.uk</a> as soon as possible with details of what has been purchased and the amount and/or percentage of funding used. This information is required to form a complete picture of <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> performance and potentially to help identify and share process efficiencies.</p>

<p>18. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should note that if the option is taken to use funding for non-staffing solutions, full performance will need to be maintained.</p>

<h3>Volumes and maximum funding amount payable to each participating <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>19. The volumes and funding amount payable to each <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> is attached at <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-d">Annex D</a>. These amounts are confirmed in circular <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> S7/2022 and a single payment paid into <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> bank accounts in April 2022.</p>

<p>20. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are asked to complete activities monthly leading to 100% completion of their funded activities by the end of the 12 months.</p>

<p>21. Funding continues to be based on the same unit costs as previous years, so individual <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> allocations should be broadly similar to <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2022 volumes and funding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> £21.43</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Reviews">SERs</abbr> £31.16</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> £13.26</li>
</ul>

<p>22. Do note that these unit costs are averages and we acknowledge that the complexities of some cases will mean that more time is needed to complete some reviews.</p>

<p>23. The <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023 national funding figure for <abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> is relatively similar to the <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2022 figure. This contrasts with the <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> and <abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Review">SER</abbr> funding figures which decreased by 13% and 15% respectively from the year before.</p>

<p>24. This decrease in funding is driven by the reduction in <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseloads. The <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> and SE caseloads decrease every year, but <abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> caseloads stay constant as we select the top 400,000.</p>

<h3>Performance management approach</h3>

<p>25. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is conducting analysis of the performance for year one of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> Initiative. The return-on-investment assessment looked at estimates of four savings components common to all three parts of the Initiatives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>historic overpayments</li>
  <li>future overpayments prevented</li>
  <li>overpayments detected and recovered anyway, and</li>
  <li>underpayments</li>
</ul>

<p>26. The findings are that, although there was a variation across the <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> participating, overall, the scheme had delivered as intended. We plan to build on this further by engaging with individual <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> over the course of the <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023 to explore good practice.</p>

<p>27. <abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr>s Performance Development Team (<abbr title="Performance Development Team">PDT</abbr>) will receive regular   performance information on the Initiative’s activities. <abbr title="Performance Development Team">PDT</abbr> will monitor this information as it comes through and engage directly with <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> where performance does not appear to be in line with funding expectations.</p>

<p>28. It is for individual <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to profile completion of activities over the duration of the Initiative. However, for performance management purposes the assumption will be that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will complete 100% of their funded activities, consistently month on month, over the 12-month duration of the Initiative.</p>

<p>29. <abbr title="Performance Development Team">PDTs</abbr> Performance Relationship Managers (<abbr title="Performance Relationship Managers">PRMs</abbr>) continue to undertake their routine regular calls with <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> service managers within each <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should use this opportunity to discuss the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> Initiative and to provide details of their delivery plans.</p>

<p>30.	Many <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will also be aware that <abbr title="Performance Development Team">PDT</abbr> offer a free professional consultancy support. If any <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> wish to work with them on this, or any aspect of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> service delivery, they will assign someone to provide this support. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> can contact <abbr title="Performance Development Team">PDT</abbr> at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.pdt@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.pdt@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h3>Recovery of funds</h3>

<p>31. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may have to seek the recovery of some or all the funding where after working with an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> over a period, performance improvement has not been realised or sufficient evidence of exceptional circumstances has not been provided. Examples of exceptional circumstances have been given in paragraph 4 of this circular.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> Indicator scores</h3>

<p>32. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has temporarily paused the issue of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> Indicator scores to allow <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to concentrate on the Initiative. <abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr> will let <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> know when this will be resumed.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> activity</h2>

<h3>Definition of the <abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> activity</h3>

<p>33.	An <abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> requires the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> to look at and consider all the current claim details and evidence associated with the claim, as well as any other fresher information or evidence they can source for the weekly <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> award to be reviewed.</p>

<p>34. We are not prescribing how <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> undertake these reviews. The key elements are that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>review and validate whether the current information associated with the claim remains correct</li>
  <li>seek evidence from the claimant and or their representative, either face to face, over the phone, digitally or by post</li>
  <li>use all available data including digital (where appropriate), with the aim of identifying any changes of circumstances and recalculating a claimant’s <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> award accordingly</li>
</ul>

<h3>Targeted <abbr title="Full Case Reviews">FCRs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>35. From 4 April 2022, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will need to undertake <abbr title="Full Case Reviews">FCRs</abbr> on their share of the top 400,000 <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> cases identified nationally by the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> risk score.</p>

<p>36. The risk model predicts the probability of a <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> case having a change of circumstance and is a good predictor of the likelihood that a case has an unreported change of circumstances and that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will get the greatest return on investment by reviewing high risk cases.</p>

<h3>Data description</h3>

<p>37.	In January 2020 the ‘Risk Based’ caseload data <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> historically received with their <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> referrals was decommissioned, whilst a new methodology was developed and tested.</p>

<p>38.	From March 2022, all <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will receive their Caseload Risk Data as part of their monthly <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> files delivered via Transfer Your Files. Each ‘live’ <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim, informed by each <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> latest Single Housing Benefit Extract (<abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr>) return, is assigned a ‘risk’ score, with claims ranked from highest risk to lowest risk in the report.</p>

<p>39. The top 400,000 cases attracting the highest risk scores are identified separately at a national level, apportioned, and then marked accordingly within each <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>’s monthly data.</p>

<p>40. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are asked to undertake an <abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> on at least the volume of cases funded, starting with those with the highest risk scores. Where the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> has already undertaken an <abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> within the previous 12 months, the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> will need to determine the value of undertaking a further review on a case by case basis. If the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> chooses not to review the case again, they should move onto the next suitable case on their risk score list for consideration (see paragraphs 52 to 58 ‘Skipping’ cases and deletion of non high-risk cases)</p>

<p>41.	Where volumes of separately identified high risk cases are lower than expected (in other words, based on the resource funded to undertake <abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> activity) then the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> should consider undertaking additional <abbr title="Full Case Reviews">FCRs</abbr> based on the next suitable case on their risk score list.</p>

<p>42.	The Caseload Risk Data will be refreshed monthly. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are likely to see fluctuations in those cases marked as high risk due to a number of factors, such as changes in the live caseload, changes to <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claimants’ circumstances or seasonal factors built into the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> risk model, which allocates the risk score.</p>

<p>43.	<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should note there is no expectation to action all cases scored as a high risk within the month the data is received. <abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> case volumes should be profiled to be conducted over the operational year (end of <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023). Refreshed data will see changes each month to the volumes communicated.</p>

<h3>Data delivery</h3>

<p>44.	<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will recognise the Caseload Risk Data through the following file name AOBWR627_LAID_RISK.csv.</p>

<p>45.	<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will be expected to identify volumes of cases from the file each month and upload into their IT Systems to commence <abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> intervention activity. <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> IT software supplier guidance is available to support <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> in the uploading of cases in a format acceptable to your IT System.</p>

<p>46.	The first download of data (<abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> File) in scope of <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023 activities was issued to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> between the week commencing 7 March 2022 and the week commencing 28 March 2022 (weeks one to four of the <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> data sharing cycle).</p>

<p>47. The final download of data (<abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> File) in scope of <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023 activities will be issued to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> between week commencing 6 February 2023 and week commencing 27 February 2023 (weeks one to four of the <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> data sharing cycle).</p>

<h2>Supported accommodation (Specified exempt) and temporary accommodation <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> Initiative guidance</h2>

<p>48. The <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> risk model predicts that supported accommodation and temporary accommodation cases are of a higher risk than the average <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> case and are, therefore, more likely to have a change in a 12-month period.</p>

<p>49. <abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr> has listened to feedback from <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> who believe that the way in which they manage supported accommodation and temporary accommodation cases assists in identifying changes as they happen. Research confirms that although these types of cases are classified as high-risk, they may have low impact on benefit recalculation.</p>

<p>50. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> do not need to default to supported accommodation and temporary accommodation cases for <abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> purposes and can select from lower risk cases provided that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are assured that the relationships with the supported accommodation and temporary accommodation providers are robust and that they share all necessary changes timeously</li>
  <li>have other processes in place to manage and capture all changes in relation to supported accommodation and temporary accommodation caseloads</li>
  <li>consider carrying out an <abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> on individual supported accommodation and temporary accommodation cases where it would be appropriate to do so</li>
</ul>

<p>51. If an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> decides that they will not carry out <abbr title="Full Case Reviews">FCRs</abbr> on supported accommodation and temporary accommodation cases due to reasons listed above, we strongly recommend that a small sample of cases are chosen regularly to ensure systems and processes are effective in capturing changes.</p>

<h2>‘Skipping’ cases and deletion of non high-risk cases</h2>

<p>52. The risk model selects cases where there is a likelihood of a change occurring and not of an overpayment occurring.</p>

<p>53. See paragraph 33 for the <abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> definition. Those <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> who participated in the Initiative for years one and two may have already reviewed some of the cases marked with a ‘Y’ as high risk.</p>

<p>54. If the same cases appear as high risk that have already been recently reviewed, in other words within past 12 months, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> may move to these cases further down the list. Where these are not marked with a ‘Y’ <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should use local knowledge of their caseload to then select the most appropriate cases for review.</p>

<p>55. For <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> who are new to <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr>, the risk model should be followed to review the cases marked as high risk. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> can then start skipping cases as described above when they are sure the cases marked as high risk have already been reviewed.</p>

<p>56. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> do not necessarily have to delete all the cases without the ‘Y’ indicator (for high risk cases) as per IT software supplier risk file loading instructions. As an example, if an IT software supplier loading instruction states:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Column N - You may want to remove records that do not have column N - top 400k equal to Y from the csv file. That way <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> can concentrate on these records. Then delete this column.”</li>
</ul>

<h3>Filtering toolkit</h3>

<p>57. Some <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> IT software suppliers may already have provided functionality that assists <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> filtering cases where recent <abbr title="Full Case Reviews">FCRs</abbr> have been undertaken.</p>

<p>58. However, for <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> who need additional functionality filtering their cases, a bespoke excel spreadsheet with user instructions has been provided by an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and uploaded to Glasscubes for the benefit of all <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>. This can be found within each of the IT software supplier areas and in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> folder in the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> Data Share (All <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) area.</p>

<p>The documents are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Primary spreadsheet for <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> reviews (Excel document)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> high risk spreadsheet – filtering procedure (Word document)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> in preparation for April 2022</h2>

<p>59. Accurate <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> recording is a vitally important part of the Initiative for all component parts (after actioning the <abbr title="Full Case Reviews">FCRs</abbr>, <abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Reviews">SERs</abbr> and <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> cases). See circular <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> A5/2020 for further details.</p>

<p>60. To support performance monitoring, it is important that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> who receive funding for the <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023, fully and accurately record information in line with guidance on their IT systems, to enable capture of <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> through <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> for <abbr title="Full Case Reviews">FCRs</abbr>, <abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Reviews">SERs</abbr> and <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> referrals.</p>

<h3>Setting the intervention</h3>

<p>61. Set an intervention on your systems for all <abbr title="Full Case Reviews">FCRs</abbr> and <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr>/<abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Review">SER</abbr> referrals. This will ensure the recording of an R Record (Fraud Intervention Record) within <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> and the accurate collation of <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> for the total <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> case volumes undertaken by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>62. <abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> interventions should be identified by selecting ‘High Risk Score Case Referral from <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr>’ from the drop-down menu.</p>

<p>63. <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr>/<abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Review">SER</abbr> interventions should be identified by selecting ‘<abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> Data Match Referral’ from the drop-down menu.</p>

<h3>Recording the outcome</h3>

<p>64. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should follow the guidance and use the new change source codes to record outcomes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should be using <abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> (<abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> code 21) from the dropdown and not LAINTREV [<abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> code 8]</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should also be using <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> (<abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> code 20) from the drop-down menu for <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> referrals</li>
</ul>

<p>65. More details on the process for setting and recording outcomes within <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> IT systems for all <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> interventions is included within <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> process guides, held within IT software supplier areas on Glasscubes.</p>

<h3>Transitioning from year two (<abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2022) to year three (<abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023)</h3>

<h3><abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr></h3>

<p>66. For those <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> who participated in <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> year two, the last date for input of a <abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> intervention start date on <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> IT systems to count towards year two performance will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> Week one <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> – March <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> extract date or Friday 4 March 2022 whichever is the earlier (Week commencing 7 March <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> year three data received)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> Week two <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> – March <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> extract date or Friday 11 March 2022 whichever is the earlier (Week commencing 14 March <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> year three data received)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> Week three <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> – March <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> extract date or Friday 18 March 2022 whichever is the earlier (Week commencing 21 March <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> year three data received)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> Week four <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> – March <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> extract date or Friday 25 March 2022 whichever is the earlier (Week commencing 28 March <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> year three data received)</li>
</ul>

<p>67. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should continue to follow-up and record outcomes for all interventions set up on their IT systems on or prior to the dates listed above.</p>

<h3><abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr></h3>

<p>68. Due to the length of time it can take to complete a review, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should continue to complete clerical <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> spreadsheets received up to and including February 2022, until such time that all referrals have had an outcome notified to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>69. Note: Any outcomes recorded up to the date of your June <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> extract date on your IT systems for <abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> interventions started up to 25 March 2022 (see the four-week <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> cycle above) or on <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> clerical <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> spreadsheets up to February 2022 referrals submitted to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in line with June returns, will be captured and included as part of <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> year two end of year reporting.</p>

<p>70. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> can monitor their own performance for year two by using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> clerical <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> returns (to February 2022) regarding <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr>/<abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Review">SER</abbr> referrals submitted with updated outcomes and/or data extraction from <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> for <abbr title="Full Case Reviews">FCRs</abbr> up to June <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> extract date for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2022 – see Annex A for the full list of <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> codes</li>
</ul>

<p>71. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> can monitor their own performance for year three by using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> Returns which provide intervention volumes and outcomes for both <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr>/<abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Review">SER</abbr> and <abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr>. Noting that only interventions commenced after the 7, 14, 21 and 28 March 2022 linked to the <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> cycle will count towards year three performance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Accurate <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> recording – <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> year three</h2>

<p>72. Transition to Automated <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> recording through <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023 means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>downloading the new <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> software (delivered between December 2020 and March 2021)</li>
  <li>installing that software</li>
  <li>using that software to record case outcomes</li>
  <li>reading the IT software supplier guidance to ensure the right codes are being used in the right outcome circumstances – noting that <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr>/<abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Review">SER</abbr> interventions must be set from the <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> referral and not as stand-alone interventions</li>
  <li>ensuring all staff actioning cases are familiar with the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> Initiative process guidance, adjudication circular and are compliant with the standards set</li>
</ul>

<h3>General advice</h3>

<p>73. All <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have confirmed to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> that they have downloaded and deployed the Automated <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> software made available between December 2020 and 2021. However, many <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are still to evidence and provide assurance that they are complying with the correct processes to enable the accurate recording of <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr>/<abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Review">SER</abbr> <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr>.</p>

<p>74. For these <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>, the process guides are available on Glasscubes. DWPs Performance Relationship Managers and <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> IT software suppliers are also available to help any <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> struggling with the accurate recording of <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr>/<abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Review">SER</abbr> activity on their ‘front end’ IT systems and <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr>.</p>

<p>75. This is important as the risks of inaccurate <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> can result in understated performance and the clawing back of funds. Taking action now is vital for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023 <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> recording, due to the <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> reporting time lags.</p>

<h3><abbr title="management information">MI</abbr></h3>

<p>76. <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> activity associated with <abbr title="Full Case Reviews">FCRs</abbr> and <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr>/<abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Review">SER</abbr> undertaken will be monitored by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> through <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr>. Specifically, we will be extracting data from the fraud and error detection activities, change and error Records.</p>

<p>77.	We have introduced functionality to enable the capture of <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> via <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> and will be assessing <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> compliance in recording <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr>/<abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Review">SER</abbr> accurately on their IT Systems during <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023.</p>

<p>78.	The current clerical process has been decommissioned for all <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr>/<abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Review">SER</abbr> referrals received by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> from March 2022 onwards, albeit clerical returns should continue to be made for all referrals received up to and including February 2022 until such time all outcomes have been notified to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>79.	A list of the actual <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> fields <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will be monitoring is included below:</p>

<p>80. It is imperative that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are compliant with their IT supplier guidance in recording information both fully and accurately on the front-end IT Systems for activity relating to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fraud and error detection</li>
  <li>change</li>
  <li>error</li>
</ul>

<p>81. These data fields will feed the <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> fields against which <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will extract <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> as detailed above.</p>

<p>82.	It is essential that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> put processes in place to ensure compliance in the accurate recording of <abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> and <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr>/<abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Review">SER</abbr> information on front end IT Systems, which in turn is captured via <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> to inform <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> reports. Failure to comply will impact both <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>’s and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s ability to effectively monitor performance and result in potentially unproductive engagement with your <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> by <abbr title="Performance Development Team">PDT</abbr>.</p>

<p>83.	<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should engage with their <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> IT supplier where they have any queries about their <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> IT supplier guidance to make sure they are recording all required <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> correctly.</p>

<p>84.	Specifically, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> ‘Reason for Fraud and Error Detection Activity’ is captured as ‘Code 1 – High risk score referral from <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr>’ (<abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> Field 173)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr>/<abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Review">SER</abbr> Reason for Fraud and Error Activity is captured as ‘Code 2 - <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> Data Match Referral’ (<abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> Field 173)</li>
</ul>

<p>85.	<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> must not use ‘Code 1 = High risk score referral from <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr>’ to identify the setting up of any other fraud detection activity, not directly attributed with the new Caseload Risk Data or Code 2 = <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> Data Match Referral to identify the setting up of fraud detection activity, not directly attributed with <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr>/<abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Review">SER</abbr> referrals. This is to avoid the corruption of data extracted by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> from <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> to monitor <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> performance.</p>

<p>86.	Similarly, when recording the source of a Full Case Review’s change in circumstances (Field 254) <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should identify via Code 21 Full Case Review. This is a new option on the dropdown menu and supersedes the setting of Code 8 <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> Intervention Review. When recording of the source of a <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr>/<abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Review">SER</abbr> change in circumstances (Field 254) <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should identify via Code 20 <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr>.</p>

<p>87.	 The <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> timetable of returns for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023 is provided at Annex C.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> referrals, including <abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Reviews">SERs</abbr>
</h2>

<h3>Data description</h3>

<p>88. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> already receive <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> referrals monthly. All <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> referrals issued to participating <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> need to be actioned. In addition to the self-assessment income business rules, there are 21 rules in total. A list of the rules can be found at Annex B. Additional information on the rules can also be found by accessing the <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> Rules Guide, which is available on Glasscubes.</p>

<p>89. The self-employment data consists of four <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> business rules, as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HBSA002: a separate business rule which identifies non declared self – employed earnings under £10,000</li>
  <li>HBSA003: highlighting potential discrepancies between earnings declared by the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claimant/partner to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> IT Systems (potential overpayments)</li>
  <li>HBSA004: highlighting potential discrepancies between earnings declared by the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claimant/partner to HMRC and <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> IT Systems (potential underpayments)</li>
  <li>HBHB405: a rule that replicates the self-employment review data issued to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> in <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> 2019, identifying where no change has been made to self-employed earnings notified to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> within the last 12 months. This was re-launched week commencing 7 September 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>91. It should be noted that cases of non-declared earnings that exceed £10,000 are identified and submitted direct to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Fraud Investigations for considered action. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> do not receive these referrals.</p>

<p>92. In April 2022, HBSA002, HBSA003 and HBSA004 rules will be updated to match data against the tax year 2020 to 2021. Details of this change will be notified to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> via the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> Welfare Direct bulletin.</p>

<h3>Data description</h3>

<p>93. During <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023, each <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> will continue to receive the <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> referrals (including <abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Reviews">SERs</abbr>) as part of their monthly <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> suite of rules.</p>

<p>94. The first download of data in scope of <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023 activities was issued to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> between week commencing 7 March 2022 (Week 1 of <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> data sharing cycle) to week commencing 28 March 2022 (Week 4 of <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> data sharing cycle).</p>

<p>95. The final download of data in scope for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023 activities will be issued to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> between week commencing 6 February 2023 (Week 1 of <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> data sharing cycle) and week commencing 27 February 2023 (Week 4 of <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> data sharing cycle).</p>

<p>96. This will constitute 12 monthly downloads of data and will form the baseline referral volumes against which <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> activity will be monitored.</p>

<h2>Additional <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> fraud intervention <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr>
</h2>

<p>97. There are also additional <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> fraud intervention requirements supported and captured by front end IT Systems, which populate the following <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> Fields:</p>

<p>98. Fraud and Error detection activities record:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Field 316 – If activity resolves an <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> referral provide the RMS number</li>
  <li>Field 317 – <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> Rule ID</li>
  <li>Field 318 – Date of <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> Match</li>
  <li>Field 319 – If resolution of <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> referral does not result in a financial adjustment, please indicate the reason why</li>
</ul>

<p>99. Again it is essential that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> familiarise themselves with ‘front end’ IT fields that require completion, to ensure this information is correctly recorded and captured for reporting purposes.</p>

<p>100. A key aspect of the initiative linked to receipt of funding is that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> comply with the correct recording of cases and the return of <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>101. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should refer to the <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> Rules Guide available on Glasscubes, which has been revised to better support the accurate completion and submission of <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> spreadsheet returns.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> Initiative funding allocations methodology and estimated volumes</h2>

<h3>
<abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> allocation methodology</h3>

<p>102. There will be around 400,000 <abbr title="Full Case Reviews">FCRs</abbr> conducted over an annual period, nationwide. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has secured funding on this basis, using a unit cost of £21.43 per review. Each <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> has been allocated funding based on the average number of their caseload that appears in the top 400,000 cases nationally in the period January to December 2021.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> volumes and funding</h3>

<p>103. Funding was calculated for each <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> separately and is based on an expected volume of <abbr title="Full Case Reviews">FCRs</abbr>. These can be scheduled throughout the financial year. However, it is expected that they should be as evenly spread as possible throughout the year.</p>

<p>104. The national number of high-risk <abbr title="Full Case Reviews">FCRs</abbr> we are asking <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to conduct in <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023 (year three) is approximately 400,000; this is the same number as in <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2022.  However, please note that there may be differences for individual <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>’ annual allocation of <abbr title="Full Case Reviews">FCRs</abbr> between <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2022 and <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023.  This will be as a result of any changes in an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>’s caseload composition over the last year that we observed on <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr>.</p>

<p>105. Please also note that the national number of <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> and self-employed review (<abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Review">SER</abbr>) matches in <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023 will decrease by 13% and 15% respectively compared with the year before. This decrease is driven by the reduction in <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseloads.  And as with <abbr title="Full Case Reviews">FCRs</abbr>, please note that changes in any specific <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>’s <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> and <abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Reviews">SERs</abbr> allocation will depend on local changes in each <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>’s caseload mix.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> unit costs calculation</h3>

<p>106. The unit cost of £21.43 is based on an <abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> taking 57 minutes. This average was derived from the <abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr> pilot involving 16 <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> taking part reported an average duration of 24 minutes as the time taken to conduct an <abbr title="Full Case Review">FCR</abbr>. However, there was a lot of variation depending on the complexity of the case. <abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr> consulted with a number of <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and agreed to increase the unit cost to £21.43 (57 minutes) to account for complex cases and the cost of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> debt collection, appeals and any supporting clerical administration.</p>

<p>107. The risk model used to calculate the risk associated with a <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> case has a seasonal element and as such there will be some months when you have a much higher or lower number of cases in the top 400,000. We encourage <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to spread the full case review work over the course of the year and not allow cases to build up towards the end of the year.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> referrals allocation methodology</h3>

<p>108. The total funding for completion of all <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> referrals (not including <abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Reviews">SERs</abbr> – see below for separate detail) was determined by calculating the cost of actioning all referrals issued in <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2019, and adjusting this, using forecasts for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2022.</p>

<p>109. The funding allocation for each <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> has been determined by calculating the percentage of the national caseload their caseload accounts for (as at October 2021) and applying this percentage to the total funding pot.</p>

<p>110. It has been calculated on this basis so that those <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> who already manage the accuracy of their <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload are not losing out.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Review">SER</abbr> allocation methodology and funding</h3>

<p>111. As opposed to the other <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> referrals, the total funding for the <abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Reviews">SERs</abbr> was based on the forecasted self-employed caseload for April 2022, using a unit cost per review of £31.16.</p>

<p>112. The funding allocation for each <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> has been determined by calculating the percentage of the national self-employed caseload that their self-employed caseload accounts for (as at October 2021) and applying this percentage to the total funding pot.</p>

<p>113. It has been calculated on this basis so that those <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> who are already proactive in reviewing their self-employed caseload do not lose out.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Review">SER</abbr> volumes</h3>

<p>114. The volume of <abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Review">SER</abbr> referrals is expected to reduce throughout <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023 as cases move to Universal Credit or have a change of circumstances.</p>

<p>115. If an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> believes that the volume of <abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Review">SER</abbr> referrals (Annex D) is not an accurate reflection of the volume of self-employed cases for their authority, they will need to ensure that all self-employed cases are accurately recorded on their <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> IT system and ultimately <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr>, so that funding can be more accurately allocated in future years.</p>

<p>116. The total funding allocation is lower than that issued in 2021 as it is based on the forecasted self-employed caseload for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023.</p>

<p>117. The unit cost of £31.16 is based on a review length of 82 minutes. This is the same amount as previously provided for the <abbr title="Self-employed Earnings Review">SER</abbr> in 2019 and includes an element for overpayment recovery action and accounts for the complexity of the work and any supporting clerical administration.</p>

<h2>Other fraud and error activities</h2>

<p>118. Other business as usual Fraud and Error activity should continue as normal.</p>

<h2>Annex A: <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> codes</h2>

<p>This following list should be used to decide which result code should be selected for a <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> referral outcome where it has identified there has been no under or over payment made to the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim.</p>

<p>The purpose of these <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> result codes are for <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> only and using the codes does not influence the generation of <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> referrals.</p>

<p>It is impossible for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to devise a code to cover every single activity that could be carried out during a live claim. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are advised to select the code that best describes the circumstances.</p>
