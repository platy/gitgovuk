<h2>Who should read</h2>

<p>All Housing Benefit staff</p>

<h2>Action</h2>

<p>For information</p>

<h2>Subject</h2>

<p>Changes to supported housing and temporary accommodation Single Housing Benefit Extract management information</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>1.	This circular covers IT changes to local authorities’ (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) front-end systems which will improve data collection for supported housing and temporary accommodation claims. Making these important improvements is vital to ensuring better outcomes for citizens and to support future investment decisions in the sector.</p>

<p>2.	Associated with the IT changes to your front-end fields will be new requirements in providing data for supported housing claims.</p>

<p>3.	<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will be expected to action the following changes (as detailed further in paragraphs 15 and 25):</p>

<ul>
  <li>download, test and deploy the new IT functionality</li>
  <li>populate their property register (see further details below)</li>
  <li>obtain the information on ineligible service charges for new claims</li>
  <li>to further specify the types of accommodations that meet the specified accommodation category</li>
  <li>manage the cases on the exception report and populate the missing data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>4.	The government made an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/732692/Supported_Housing_Funding_Consultation_Response.pdf" rel="external">announcement</a> on the future funding of supported housing in August 2018. This included keeping all supported housing within the Welfare System and committing to develop a new oversight regime to ensure quality and value for money.</p>

<p>5.	As part of the Department for Work and Pensions’ (DWPs) effort to improve quality and value for money on supported housing, it is essential we understand more about the Housing Benefit (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>) expenditure to inform policy development and to ensure cases are accurately recorded.</p>

<p>6.	As set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/la-welfare-direct-bulletins-2021/la-welfare-direct-122021">LAWD12/2021</a> bulletin, we have also been reviewing the available data for specified accommodation claims and identified a significant undercount of such claims across <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> as a whole. Along with the significant undercount, we have also identified various discrepancies in the use of markers.</p>

<p>7.	We have engaged extensively with <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> representatives and <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> IT software suppliers to explore and develop new functionality on all <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> IT systems to improve the quality of data when recording supported housing and temporary accommodation claims.</p>

<p>8.	As a result, we will be implementing minor changes to <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> IT systems to improve the collection of supported housing/temporary accommodation <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> management information (MI). This will reorganise and simplify existing supported housing and temporary accommodation fields into a more intuitive process for all new claims.</p>

<p>9.	We will use the Single Housing Benefit Extract (SHBE) data to analyse and track <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> expenditure and supported housing caseloads for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> purposes. Therefore, it is essential that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> comply with the new changes to improve the quality of the data. 
IT changes for <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr></p>

<p>10.	From April 2022, changes will be introduced to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>’ IT systems to support the more accurate recording of information for supported housing. This might result in changes to the appearance of some <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> front-end fields.</p>

<p>11.	Where <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> do not already have the necessary fields on their IT system, new fields will be added to capture ineligible service charges (see paragraph 34 for more information) and to further specify the types of accommodations that meet the specified accommodation category (see paragraphs 25-26 for more information).</p>

<p>12.	<abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> IT software suppliers have developed a ‘property register’ for each <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> which will support the automated population of front-end IT systems. It is strongly recommended that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> use this available functionality as it is considered the most efficient solution.</p>

<p>13.	It is important that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> action the changes outlined in this circular and as further detailed in your IT software supplier guidance, to allow for future policy improvements in the delivery of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> through supported housing.</p>

<p>14.	<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should refer to the existing <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/housing-benefit-and-council-tax-benefit-manual">Housing Benefit Manual</a> until further notice. However, a new <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> guidance for supported housing claims will be published this year to further support <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> in their accurate decision-making. 
Actions required by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr></p>

<p>15.	<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> must undertake the following key actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download, test and deploy IT release functionality supplied by your IT software once released. For most <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> this will happen in April 2022 and we will contact <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to seek assurance on completion of this key activity.</li>
  <li>Populate the property register to support increased automated population of your IT system’s ‘front end’ fields to improve accuracy and consistency of recorded information.</li>
  <li>Take action to correct existing <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims where supported housing and temporary accommodation markers held on <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> IT software systems are incompatible. An exceptions file report to support <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> in identifying these cases will form part of the IT release.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure the amount of ineligible service charges for new claims are recorded. These are the charges which will be deducted from the claimant’s contractual rent to determine the eligible rent figure for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> purposes. The ineligible service charges should be recorded as two types:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the charges to pay for the cost of providing care, support, or supervision services to the claimant, and</li>
      <li>a total of all other ineligible service charges.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Read and comply with the IT software supplier release note guidance (these will be available on your IT software supplier’s Customer Portal. Note, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should ensure they always download the latest version of the release note guidance and the supported housing/temporary accommodation process guides once available on Glasscubes).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key feature release of the ‘property register’</h2>

<p>16.	IT software suppliers and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> identified a property register as an efficient way to collate data on how many properties in each <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> areas are classed as supported housing.</p>

<p>17.	The register will hold details of supported housing/temporary accommodation properties and will collate information to auto-populate front-end IT fields at an individual claim level, as well as making additional data available to support those <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> who currently maintain local registers. This should improve the processing of new <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims, including the reduction of clerical input.</p>

<p>18.	Where the property register is not used or properties are not included in the register, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will still be able to clerically populate their IT system’s front-end fields with the required information at an individual claim level.</p>

<p>19.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will not have access to the property register held by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>. We will only use the data which has been derived from the SHBE fields for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> related purposes.</p>

<p>New IT changes and requirements for processing supported housing and temporary accommodation new claims</p>

<p>20.	<abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> IT systems have been amended to ensure only accommodation provided to discharge a statutory homelessness function, or to prevent homelessness, sourced by an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> or provided by a Registered Housing Association, are included under the description of ‘temporary’.</p>

<p>21.	Do note, the wording for tenancy types 8 and 10 has changed (see Annex A for full list of tenancy types as listed in the SHBE specification which, if not held by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>, can be found on Glasscubes):</p>

<ul>
  <li>8 - Temporary Accommodation where the landlord is the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> – provided to discharge a statutory homelessness function or to prevent homelessness – <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> is payable as Rent rebate and the claim is subject to the LHA-based subsidy rules.</li>
  <li>10 - Temporary Accommodation where the landlord is a Registered Housing Association – provided to enable an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> to discharge a statutory homelessness function or to prevent homelessness – <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> is payable as Rent allowance and the claim is subject to the LHA-based subsidy rules.</li>
</ul>

<p>22.	Validation, where not already present, will be introduced to ensure that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> set the appropriate markers for all supported housing and temporary accommodation cases to avoid duplication, or incompatible markers being set, on new claims going forward. Therefore, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will be required to set a claim as either ‘temporary accommodation’, ‘supported housing (including sheltered and extra care accommodation)’ or ‘none’.</p>

<p>23.	For new claims, we would only expect the ‘none’ category to be selected for Pension age claims where the pensioner isn’t housed in either temporary accommodation or supported housing (including sheltered and sheltered with extra care).</p>

<p>24.	When selecting supported housing (including sheltered and extra care accommodation), <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> must specify the type of the accommodation.</p>

<p>25.	<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will be required to complete a new field to indicate whether the claimant is assessed as living in one of the categories of specified accommodation. The inclusion of this indicator is essential to allow both the critical identification and analysis of specified accommodation cases to support policy development.</p>

<p>26.	The definitions have not changed and are reiterated at Annex B of this circular and will be detailed further in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> guidance for supported housing claims.</p>

<p>27.	The recording of each case should reflect which rules the claim has been assessed under. This is because exempt accommodation claims are assessed under different rules than the other three categories (managed properties, refuges, and <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> hostels) of specified accommodation.</p>

<p>28.	The legal definition for specified accommodation categories can be found in the Housing Benefit and Universal Credit (Supported Accommodation) (Amendment) Regulations 2014.</p>

<p>29.	Cases should be recorded against the first applicable category in the list. For example, a case can only be marked as a ‘refuge’ if it does not meet any of the previous categories.</p>

<h2>Exception files</h2>

<p>30.	We know that there are cases within the current stock whereby markers are set which are incompatible with the new changes, for example we’ve introduced validation, where this doesn’t already exist, that would not allow a case to be marked up as both supported housing and temporary accommodation.</p>

<p>31.	The new IT release will provide <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> with an ‘exceptions report’ which can be run locally to highlight all the cases with such incompatibilities. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are asked to act on all the cases within the ‘exceptions report’ to correct the markers at the earliest opportunity.
Recording ineligible service charges for supported housing</p>

<p>32.	In line with the Housing Benefits 2006 Regulations, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are required to identify ineligible service charges such as ‘personal care or general support/counselling services’ when calculating the eligible rent.</p>

<p>33.	When deducting ineligible charges, if the charge amount is specified, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should deduct the whole amount of the charge. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>  However, if the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> considers the amount to be unreasonably low for the service provided, they should use their own valuation of the cost of providing the service when making the deduction. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup></p>

<p>34.	If the charge amount is unspecified, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should apportion an appropriate amount from the core rent or other service charges which represents a fair amount for that service. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>   <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should consider the cost of comparable services. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should deduct the full cost, even where the claimant does not fully use the service. This also applies where an ineligible service is provided but included in the rent amount. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup></p>

<p>35.	To help inform future policy development, from April 2022, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will be required to capture on their IT systems the amount of ineligible charges which have been deducted from the claimant’s contractual rent to pay for the cost of providing care, support or supervision services to the claimant.</p>

<p>36.	The remaining ineligible charges not for care, support or supervision should be recorded as ‘Other ineligible charges’. ‘Other ineligible charges’ covers the amount of ineligible charges (excluding those for care, support, and supervision), which have been deducted from the claimant’s contractual rent. For example, ineligible charges for meals or personal utilities would be recorded in this field.</p>

<p>37.	<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should make every effort to complete this field with the required information. From engagement with a small number of <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>, feedback has indicated that this information is not always routinely available/gathered. We will continue to review this situation. However, in the meantime, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> who are consistently unable to provide the required information for this field should contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:housing.policyenquiries@dwp.gov.uk">housing.policyenquiries@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Recording eligible service charges for supported housing</h2>

<p>38.	<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should request a rent breakdown from the landlord which sets out all the charges included in the rent and service charges when a new claim or rent increase is submitted. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should then consider whether there are any charges included in the rent which should be treated as an eligible service.
39.	<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are encouraged to record the amount of eligible service charges included in the rent when this is information readily available. However, as <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> feedback has indicated this information is not always routinely available/gathered, this field will remain optional.</p>

<h2>Process for <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> recording ‘types’ of supported housing</h2>

<p>40.	When recording supported housing cases and selecting the appropriate markers, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> must specify whether the claim is transitional/short-term supported accommodation, long-term supported accommodation, sheltered accommodation/sheltered accommodation with extra care accommodation using the following meanings and descriptions listed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Transitional/short-term supported accommodation for those in crisis, such as, domestic abuse, care leavers, those recovering from drug/alcohol dependence, those at risk of homelessness and prison leavers, etc.</li>
  <li>Long-term supported accommodation for people with long-term physical disabilities, learning difficulties or a mental health condition.</li>
  <li>Sheltered accommodation for over-55s with care and/or support needs (including sheltered accommodation with extra care)</li>
</ul>

<p>41.	Short-term supported housing is typically accommodation not intended as permanent settlement where care, support and supervision is provided. It should be noted that there can be a crossover between these categories, for example short-term housing for people with learning disabilities.</p>

<p>42.	In most cases, the aim for the claimants in this type of accommodation is to move them into sustainable settled accommodation within two years. This excludes general needs accommodation and claims assessed as temporary accommodation.</p>

<p>43.	Although sheltered and extra care housing is not specifically defined in <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> regulations, it is a well-established entity within the supported housing sector and we are keen to utilise the existing fields to maximise the available data within this area.

<h2>Annex B</h2>

<h3>Definitions as extracted from circular <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> A8/2014</h3>

<h4>Supported “exempt accommodation”</h4>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Ministers announced in 2012 that, as a short term measure, help with housing costs for those living in “exempt accommodation” would be provided outside their Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) award through Housing Benefit (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>) and that <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> in respect of that accommodation would be excluded when applying the benefit cap. Regulations to provide for help with housing costs through <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> came into effect from 28 October 2013<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In April 2013, Lord Freud, the Minister for Welfare Reform, wrote to the sector undertaking to extend this protection to other supported housing that, although not materially different to that which falls within the current definition, is subject to the Welfare Reforms.</p>

<p>Since October 2013, <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> claimants have been able to claim help with their housing costs through <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> where they live in “exempt accommodation”. Local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) continue to determine whether a person’s home is “exempt accommodation”, consider which costs are eligible for help and assess the level to which costs should be met. They also retain the discretion to make managed payment of rent direct to landlords. Additionally, these payments of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> are excluded from the benefit cap calculation.</p>

<p>Supported housing that is not materially different to those in the current definition includes supported housing where care, support or supervision is not provided by the landlord, or on their behalf, and <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> provision. We have since been working with those close to the sector to fill in the gaps in our knowledge of its makeup and the extent of its dependency on benefit provision.</p>

<p>These regulations extend that short term protection to a new class of supported accommodation, termed “specified accommodation”.</p>

<p>We had also been asked to exempt supported housing from the Removal of the Spare Room Subsidy (<abbr title="Removal of the Spare Room Subsidy">RSRS</abbr>) provisions. Those subject to <abbr title="Removal of the Spare Room Subsidy">RSRS</abbr> will not be affected by these changes.</p>

<h5>Outline of the changes</h5>

<p>It is important to be clear that no change has been made to the definition of “exempt accommodation” in the Housing Benefit Consequential Provisions where it is used to determine that the eligible rent is calculated using the pre 1996 rules.</p>

<p>The amendments are intended primarily to protect those in supported housing who are not already covered by the definition of “exempt accommodation” (and therefore do not benefit from the current exemptions) and are most likely to be affected by the welfare reforms.</p>

<p>The amendments simply provide a gateway for the housing costs of supported housing that satisfy the definition of “specified accommodation”, from being assessed as the housing cost element within <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> to <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>. There are no changes to the way that the eligible rent is calculated for individual cases within <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>.</p>

<h5>
<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> and the benefit cap</h5>

<p>There are now four categories of supported housing that are included in the new definition of “specified accommodation” being introduced.</p>

<h6>Exempt accommodation</h6>

<p>The existing exclusion in <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> of “exempt accommodation” from the benefit cap is retained as one of the categories in the new definition. This relies on the definition of “exempt accommodation” found in paragraph 4(10) of Schedule 3 to the Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit (Consequential Provisions) Regulations 2006.</p>

<p>“Exempt accommodation’ is defined as being either: a resettlement place; or accommodation which is provided by a county council, housing association, registered charity or voluntary organisation where that body, or person acting on their behalf, provides the claimant with care, support or supervision.</p>

<h6>Managed properties</h6>

<p>The second category in the draft regulations is designed to cover those cases which fall out of the current “exempt accommodation” definition solely because the care isn’t provided by the landlord or on their behalf. This is often due to the nature of the funding/care structures put in place.</p>

<p>This category relies, as now, on the property being provided by one of the specified social and third sector organisations and on the claimant being admitted to the dwelling to receive the care, support or supervision being provided. This looks to retain the conditionality of receiving support with occupying the home.</p>

<p>It would be expected that the admission process should include the need for care, support or supervision being identified by someone that the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> is satisfied is in a position to undertake it. Linking the person’s admission to supported housing with there being an identifiable need, requires that their occupying the home has been made knowledgeably either by a professional or someone with experience in the care/support sector, which could well be the landlord.</p>

<p>Receiving public funding for the care, support or supervision would be a reasonable indicator that it is both needed and being provided. However, support can still be provided even without public funding. Expert advice should be sought where necessary, such as from statutory authorities or recognised bodies, to confirm whether support should be accepted as provided or not and whether the dwelling is “specified accommodation”.</p>

<p>Much supported housing could be identified by it being commissioned by, or either designed or designated as such by local government or other statutory bodies. However, these can only be factors among others in the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> deciding whether the property is “specified accommodation”. As ever, the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> must make a decision on the facts.</p>

<p>The underlying assumption is that places in supported housing are in such short supply that someone with no need of their services would not be admitted. Certainly, where it comes to light that a person with no need of care, support or supervision is living in supported housing they cannot be treated as being in “specified accommodation”.</p>

<p>We have also added this conditionality to ensure that the legislation doesn’t cover cases of floating support where the property is standard social or third sector housing where the care, support or supervision being provided is not connected with living in the home.</p>

<p>In such cases, where the property has not been specially designed, acquired, adapted or designated to be supported housing, and whether or not the landlord is involved in providing care, support or supervision, we would not expect the rent being charged to be higher than ordinary social or third sector housing and therefore not in need of protection.</p>

<h6>Refuges</h6>

<p>The third category looks to protect the rents of both third and social sector refuges. This is again achieved through identifying the provider type as well as the reason why the person is living in the property (i.e. that they are fleeing domestic violence) and that this is a temporary arrangement.</p>

<p>The definition for domestic violence we are using is the same as the cross-government definition, with the exception that we do not include the reference to age because <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> is available only to those aged 16 or over. The exclusion of the reference to partnership or familial relationships broadens the definition to include other types of violence that may occur in a domestic setting (for example, violence by a neighbour or landlord). This will ensure that the new definition provides protection for as wide a range of provision as possible.</p>

<p>The legislation refers to having “left the home as a result of domestic violence”. As a clarification, in this context the meaning is the home where the claimant usually lives and from where they initially fled, rather than any intermediate accommodation, which may well have been another refuge in some cases. All that is required is that there is a causal connection between the claimant being in the refuge and their having left their home as a result of domestic violence.</p>

<p>It has been estimated by stakeholders that around half of refuges currently available are protected because they are “exempt accommodation”. The rest are said to be outside the definition because the refuges only manage the properties they use, often for social sector landlords.</p>

<p>Many refuges are likely to already be covered by the first and second categories as this category includes the same types of providers already covered through the first two. However, it also includes <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> refuges.</p>

<h5>Hostels</h5>

<p>The fourth category covers <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> hostels that provide care, support or supervision. This relies on the existing definition of “hostel” in Housing Benefit Regulation 2(1) which is currently only used for rent allowance cases. This relies on the property not being self-contained. The existing definition of “hostel” identifies properties specialising in the higher need individuals most likely to need the care, support, or supervision often available in “hostels”.</p>

<p>While other hostels providing care, support or supervision will be covered by the first or second categories, this provision extends coverage to include <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> hostels, but only where care support or supervision is provided. This is intended to cover the most intensive of provision where claimants are most likely to need protection from the benefit cap and certain aspects of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>.</p>

<h5>Benefit cap</h5>

<p>Housing costs paid for those in “specified accommodation” will be excluded from the benefit cap within <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>.</p>
