<h2>Requirements for Digital Functional Skills</h2>

<h3>Assessment strategy requirements</h3>

<p>Conditions DFS3.1(a) requires an awarding organisation to establish and maintain an assessment strategy for each digital functional skills qualification which it makes available or proposes to make available. Condition DFS3.2 requires an awarding organisation to ensure that the assessment strategy for a digital functional skills qualification sets out how the awarding organisation intends to secure, on an ongoing basis, compliance with its Conditions of Recognition in respect of the assessments for that qualification. Condition DFS3.1(b) requires an awarding organisation to have regard to any requirements in relation to assessment strategies published by Ofqual. We set out our requirements for the purposes of Condition DFS3.1(b) below.</p>

<h3>General requirements</h3>

<p>An assessment strategy for a digital functional skills qualification must provide a comprehensive picture of the steps and approach an awarding organisation will take to secure compliance with its Conditions of Recognition in relation to the design, delivery and marking of assessments for, and the award of, that qualification. An assessment strategy must present a logical and coherent narrative that includes clear and concise evidence demonstrating how an awarding organisation will seek to ensure that the qualification, and the assessments for it, are fit for purpose. In particular, it must include information and evidence to show how the awarding organisation promotes and acts on feedback between the different stages of the qualification development cycle so as to continuously improve the assessments for that qualification.</p>

<h3>Detailed requirements</h3>

<p>We set out below our detailed requirements on the specific information and evidence an awarding organisation must include in its assessment strategy. The amount of information and evidence that can be included may vary across the areas identified, depending on the relevant point in the qualification development cycle to which a particular item pertains and the extent to which Ofqual has determined the regulatory approach in relation to a particular issue.</p>

<p>These detailed requirements are intended to indicate the minimum items that an assessment strategy must include. They are not intended to provide a template specifying the form that it must take, since the optimal structure and content of an assessment strategy will depend on the approach that is being proposed by the awarding organisation.</p>

<h3>Section 1: Design</h3>

<h4>Coverage of subject content</h4>

<p>Approach to the coverage of the subject content, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sampling a representative amount and range in each assessment or set of assessments</li>
  <li>covering the whole subject content in as few iterations of assessments as reasonably practicable</li>
  <li>assessing the subject content in accordance with any specific Ofqual requirements (for example, in relation to the amount of knowledge and skills assessed)</li>
</ul>

<p>Example of relevant conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Condition DFS1.1</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Condition DFS7.1</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Condition D1</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Condition E4.2</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Condition G1</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Qualification structure</h4>

<p>Details of how the qualification and assessments will be structured and a rationale for the approach, for example in terms of covering the subject content effectively, and balancing reliability and manageability, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>number and weighting of assessments</li>
  <li>approach to content coverage across assessments (if more than one)</li>
</ul>

<p>Example of relevant conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Condition D1</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Condition G1</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Assessment time</h4>

<p>Assessment time overall, and for each individual assessment, and a rationale for this, for example in terms of covering the subject content effectively, and balancing reliability and manageability.</p>

<p>Example of relevant conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Condition D1</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Condition E4.2</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Condition G1</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conditions G9.1 – G9.2</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Number of marks</h4>

<p>Number of marks overall, and for each individual assessment, and a rationale for this, for example in terms of covering the subject content effectively, and balancing reliability and manageability.</p>

<p>Example of relevant conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Condition D1</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Condition E4.2</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Condition G1</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Availability of assessments</h4>

<p>Approach to availability of assessments, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>number of assessments to be available</li>
  <li>type of assessments (having regard to the guidance on assessments, for example</li>
  <li>onscreen and online, or paper-based materials by exception)</li>
  <li>nature of opportunities (for example on-demand or sessional)</li>
  <li>duration for which assessments will be available</li>
  <li>approach to Learners taking an assessment again</li>
</ul>

<p>In light of the approach to assessment availability, and having regard to the guidance on assessments, any specific risks that have been identified, how these will be mitigated, and how particular challenges will be addressed, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensuring comparability of assessments</li>
  <li>minimising predictability of assessments</li>
  <li>ensuring security of assessments</li>
</ul>

<p>Example of relevant conditions:</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Condition H2</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Condition H3</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Task type and mark scheme</h4>

<p>For each assessment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>details of the range and balance of task types to be used (for example, multiple-choice, short answer, extended response) and how these will support valid assessment of the Content Document</li>
  <li>approach to mark scheme design, including for different task types, and an explanation of how resulting mark schemes will support reliable application by assessors</li>
  <li>a sample of example tasks and associated mark schemes, representing the range to be used in assessments – these may or may not be taken from any sample assessment materials</li>
  <li>commentaries explaining the approaches taken in the sample of example tasks and mark schemes</li>

<h3>Assessment requirements</h3>
<p>Condition DFS7.1 allows us to specify requirements and guidance in relation to the assessment of digital functional skills qualifications.</p>

<p>We set out our requirements for the purposes of Condition DFS7.1 below.</p>

<p>The subject content for digital functional skills qualifications is set out in the Secretary of State’s Digital Functional Skills qualifications: subject content, as set out at Annex 1 (the ‘Content Document’).</p>

<h3>Single Component</h3>
<p>Each digital functional skills qualification must be made up of a single Component.</p>

<h3>Number of assessments</h3>

<p>An awarding organisation must ensure that –</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a) a Learner is not required to take more than 2 assessments for a digital functional skills qualification, and</li>
  <li>(b) the number of assessments that each Learner is required to take is the minimum necessary to assess the subject content in line with our requirements below.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Assessment design</h3>
<p>An awarding organisation must ensure that the marking of all assessments requires the allocation of numerical marks based on the level of attainment that each Learner has demonstrated.</p>

<p>In designing and setting the assessment(s) for a digital functional skills qualification which it makes available, or proposes to make available, an awarding organisation must ensure that of the total marks available a minimum of 70% are allocated to questions or tasks which assess practical skills requiring the use of digital devices. The remainder of marks should be allocated to questions or tasks which assess knowledge.</p>

<p>In its assessment strategy, an awarding organisation must explain its approach to the interpretation of statements in the Content Document as either knowledge-based or skills-based, as well as the weighting of marks as between those 2 categories.</p>

<h4>Coverage of, and alignment with, the subject content</h4>
<p>In respect of each of entry level 3 and Level 1, the Content Document is divided into 5 skills areas, with a set of numbered content statements under each area. Many of the content statements then include elaborations of the broad area covered by the main statement presented in brackets as ‘(including…)’ or ‘(such as…)’.</p>

<p>An awarding organisation must design its assessment(s) for a digital functional skills qualification which it makes available, or proposes to make available, so that all of the content statements and bracketed content are liable for assessment in any given assessment or assessment series. There must be no content which is not capable of assessment by the assessments set by the awarding organisation.</p>

<p>However, it is not a requirement that all of the content statements or bracketed content have to be assessed in each assessment or set of assessments taken by a Learner.</p>

<p>When designing assessments, an awarding organisation must ensure that all content statements and bracketed content within a content statement are covered over time, and that the approach to sampling mitigates predictability of assessments.</p>

<p>An awarding organisation must ensure that each assessment or set of assessments taken by a Learner is designed to –</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a) sample as many content statements and as much bracketed content as possible, and</li>
  <li>(b) contain questions and tasks which are weighted to strike a reasonable balance between each of the 5 skills areas.</li>
</ol>

<p>An awarding organisation must explain its approach to the coverage of content statements in its assessment strategy.</p>

<h3>Overall assessment time</h3>
<p>An awarding organisation must design and set the assessment(s) for a digital functional skills qualification on the basis that the total amount of time spent by each Learner in taking the assessment(s) shall be –</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a) no less than an hour and 30 minutes, and</li>
  <li>(b) no more than 2 hours.</li>
</ol>

<p>An awarding organisation must explain in its assessment strategy how the overall assessment time is appropriate in light of the design and delivery features of the qualification.</p>

<h3>Setting assessments</h3>
<p>An awarding organisation must set all assessments for a Digital Functional Skills Qualification that it makes available.</p>

<h3>Adaptation of contexts at entry level 3</h3>
<p>An awarding organisation may permit a Centre to adapt the context for questions or tasks in assessments at entry level 3 for the purpose of making those assessments more accessible to Learners.</p>

<p>Where an awarding organisation permits a Centre to adapt questions or tasks, such adaptations must relate only to the context presented by that question or task. An awarding organisation must not permit a Centre to amend –</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a) the knowledge, skills or understanding that a Learner is required to demonstrate in the question or task,</li>
  <li>(b) the Level of Demand of the question or task, or</li>
  <li>(c) any specified conditions under which the assessment must be completed, including in particular the time within which the assessment must be completed (unless any such amendment is part of a Reasonable Adjustment or for the purposes of Special Consideration).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Marking of assessments</h3>

<h4>Level 1</h4>
<p>Evidence generated by a Learner in an assessment at Level 1 must be marked by the awarding organisation or a person connected to the awarding organisation.</p>

<h4>Entry level 3</h4>
<p>Evidence generated by a Learner in an assessment at entry level 3 may be marked –</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>
    <p>(a) by the awarding organisation or a person connected to the awarding organisation,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(b) by a Centre, or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(c) through a combination of (a) and (b).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In any event, the awarding organisation must demonstrate to Ofqual’s satisfaction in its assessment strategy that –</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a) it has taken all reasonable steps to identify the risk of any Adverse Effect which may result from its approach to marking assessments (and to Moderation where appropriate), and</li>
  <li>(b) where such a risk is identified, it has taken all reasonable steps to prevent that Adverse Effect or, where it cannot be prevented, to mitigate that Adverse Effect.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Guidance for Centres</h3>
<p>Under Condition G9.2(a), an awarding organisation must ensure that every assessment for a qualification which it makes available is fit for purpose on delivery.</p>

<p>Under Condition C2.5, an awarding organisation must provide effective guidance to a Centre in respect of the parts of the delivery of a qualification that the Centre undertakes.</p>

<p>Under Condition H1.1, an awarding organisation must ensure that the criteria against which Learners’ performance will be differentiated are applied accurately and consistently by all Assessors.</p>

<p>Taking these obligations together, and without prejudice to any other action that they might require, an awarding organisation must provide effective guidance to Centres in respect of the adaptation, delivery and marking by Centres, as relevant, of assessments for a digital functional skills qualification which it makes available, or proposes to make available.</p>

<h3>Standard setting requirements</h3>
<p>Condition DFS8.1 allows us to specify requirements and guidance in relation to the specified levels of attainment that must be used for digital functional skills qualifications.</p>

<p>Condition DFS8.2(b) allows us to specify requirements and guidance in relation to how those specified levels of attainment are set.</p>

<p>We set out our requirements for the purposes of Conditions DFS8.1 and DFS8.2(b) below.</p>

<h3>Specified level of attainment in digital functional skills qualifications</h3>
<p>In relation to each digital functional skills qualification, an awarding organisation must ensure that there shall be a single specified level of attainment – ‘Pass’.</p>

<h3>Setting the specified level of attainment</h3>
<p>An awarding organisation must set a single boundary mark for a Pass for each version of the Component that it permits a Learner to take.</p>

<p>This means that, where the Component comprises 2 assessments, an awarding organisation –</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>
    <p>(a) must set a single boundary mark which is then applied to a Learner’s combined mark from both assessments,</p>
  </li>
  <li>(b) must set such a boundary mark for each combination of different versions of the assessments that it permits a Learner to take; and</li>
  <li>(c) must not set a boundary mark for either of the individual assessments.</li>
</ol>

<p>An awarding organisation must set boundary marks for the Component in such a way as to secure suitable qualification level standards. Where a number of alternative versions of the Component are used simultaneously, this includes securing the maintenance of standards across those alternative versions.</p>

<h3>Issuing results</h3>
<p>In relation to each digital functional skills qualification, an awarding organisation must ensure that a Learner is issued a result of ‘Fail’ where he or she does not meet the criteria to be awarded a Pass.</p>
