<p>The NHS will let you know when it is your turn to get the <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccination.</p>

<p>You have a choice of ways to get vaccinated. The information provided here is about how you can book vaccination appointments at a vaccination centre or community pharmacy.</p>

<p>Please do not book using the details below if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you already have an appointment booked to have your vaccine – there is nothing you need to do except turn up to your scheduled appointment</li>
  <li>you’ve had your first vaccine dose already – the NHS will contact you when it’s time for your second dose</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to book your appointments</h2>

<p>When it is your turn to book your vaccination, visit <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/">NHS.UK</a></p>

<p>When you book, you will be asked for information including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your name and date of birth</li>
  <li>your NHS number – this is a 10 digit number you can find on any letter the NHS has sent you, for example, 485 777 3546</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not know your NHS number you can still book.</p>

<p>Please ensure that you book your appointments for both your first and second dose and press the save button to confirm.</p>

<p>Please use the NHS website first. If you cannot use the NHS website, you can phone 119 free of charge. You can ask someone else to do this for you if you prefer.</p>

<p>At times, the phone line might get very busy and this may mean waiting to speak to someone. The phone line is open from 7am to 11pm, 7 days a week. You may choose to ring later in the day when it is less busy. Interpreters will be available on request.</p>

<p>If you are able to use the vaccination centre and community pharmacy options, please do. Where the distance to travel makes this difficult for you, you will be able to have the vaccine at your local <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> vaccination service. Please wait for your <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> to contact you to make an appointment, if they haven’t already.</p>

<p>If you have difficulties communicating or hearing, or are a British Sign Language (<abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr>) user you can go <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/" rel="external">online</a>, use textphone 18001 119 or the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://interpreternow.co.uk/nhs119">NHS <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> interpreter service</a>.</p>

<p>If you are housebound or are not able to travel to a vaccination centre, your local NHS services will be in touch to make arrangements.</p>

<p>The place that you choose to have your vaccine will keep you safe from <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> through a range of measures including cleaning and disinfecting and having social distancing in waiting areas. Please also wear a face covering to your appointment.</p>

<h2>About the coronavirus vaccine</h2>
<p>You need 2 doses of the vaccine to get the best protection from the virus. Your second dose will be given around 11 to 12 weeks after your first. When you book your first appointment, you will also need to book your second appointment.</p>

<p>Some people may not be able to get this vaccine at the moment. If you have had bad allergic reactions in the past, it is important that you read all the guidance. You can also ask about it when you book, or discuss it with a health professional when you attend your appointment.</p>

<p>If you are pregnant, or think you might be pregnant, you should speak to your healthcare professional before booking a vaccine appointment.</p>
