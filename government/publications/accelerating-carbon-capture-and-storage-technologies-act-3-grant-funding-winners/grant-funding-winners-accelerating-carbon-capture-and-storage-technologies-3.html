<h3>University College London</h3>
<p>Received £297,634.21 as the project partner for the <abbr title="Accelerating Carbon Capture and Storage Technologies">ACT</abbr> 3 project NEXTCCUS.</p>

<p>NEXTCCUS aims to contributing towards a sustainable energy technology with negative carbon footprint by producing methanol as a clean and secure alternative renewable fuel from CO2 capture, direct conversion and storage as liquid fuel using sustainable electrochemical system.</p>

<h3>Net Zero Technology Centre</h3>
<p>Received £587,125.44 as the project partner for the <abbr title="Accelerating Carbon Capture and Storage Technologies">ACT</abbr> 3 project RETURN.</p>

<p>RETURN aims on unlocking the potential for CO2 storage in depleted oil and gas reservoirs. The goal is to enable safe and cost-efficient use of depleted reservoirs as long-term storage sites for CO2.</p>

<h3>TWI Limited</h3>
<p>Received £518,777.19 as the project lead for the <abbr title="Accelerating Carbon Capture and Storage Technologies">ACT</abbr> 3 project CoCaCO2La*.</p>

<p>ACTION* aims to establish how an efficient infrastructure, connecting CO2 sources with CO2 geological storage and non-geological utilisation options. It can be developed as part of regional decarbonisation efforts.</p>

<h2>About <abbr title="Accelerating Carbon Capture and Storage Technologies">ACT</abbr> 3</h2>
<p><abbr title="Accelerating Carbon Capture and Storage Technologies">ACT</abbr> 3 is an international initiative between 14 countries including the UK. The aim is to accelerate and mature <abbr title="Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage">CCUS</abbr> technologies through funding research and innovation projects. <abbr title="Accelerating Carbon Capture and Storage Technologies">ACT</abbr> partners include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Province of Alberta</li>
  <li>Denmark</li>
  <li>France</li>
  <li>Germany</li>
  <li>Greece</li>
  <li>India</li>
  <li>Italy</li>
  <li>Netherlands</li>
  <li>Norway</li>
  <li>Romania</li>
  <li>Switzerland</li>
  <li>Turkey</li>
  <li>UK</li>
  <li>USA</li>
</ul>

<p>The UK element of the <abbr title="Accelerating Carbon Capture and Storage Technologies">ACT</abbr> 3 programme will be funded from the BEIS Net Zero Innovation Portfolio (<abbr title="Net Zero Innovation Portfolio">NZIP</abbr>). It will provide up to £5 million in grant funding up until 31 March 2025 for <abbr title="Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage">CCUS</abbr> developers to expand on their research and development to push their technologies to higher technology readiness levels. The £5 million provided by the UK will contribute to a total funding pot of around £40 million (including in-kind and industry funds), of which around £25 million is being provided by <abbr title="Accelerating Carbon Capture and Storage Technologies">ACT</abbr> partners.</p>

<p>In 2015, the UK was made aware that a group of European countries, led by Norway, were looking to develop a collaborative programme on <abbr title="Carbon Capture and Storage">CCS</abbr> innovation, where the <abbr title="Accelerating Carbon Capture and Storage Technologies">ACT</abbr> programme was formed. Each project consortium is made up of one lead country and at least two partner countries to encourage international collaboration.</p>

<p><abbr title="Accelerating Carbon Capture and Storage Technologies">ACT</abbr> 3 follows on from <abbr title="Accelerating Carbon Capture and Storage Technologies">ACT</abbr> 1 and 2 which provided a total of around £58 million, where 15 UK projects were funded a total of £13 million from this pot. Some key outputs from the programme include international collaboration, dissemination of findings, and promoting the acceleration of <abbr title="Carbon Capture and Storage">CCS</abbr> technologies towards full scale/commercialisation.
