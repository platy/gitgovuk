<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>The academies chart of accounts (<abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr>) is the Department for Education’s (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s) standard for financial data that underpins the academies accounts return and budget forecast returns.</p>

<p>For more information, please view the introductory video below.

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Benefits of adopting the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s chart of accounts</h2>

<p>When a trust first converts to using the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s <abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr>, there will be an initial outlay for a trust in terms of time and effort to bring the new accounting structure into operation. However, once embedded, the benefits of using the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s standardised <abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that it maps directly to the accounts return and budget forecast returns and therefore enables direct input of financial data into these returns</li>
  <li>it enables trusts to make use of the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s application programme interface (<abbr title="Application programme interface">API</abbr>) tool for pre-populating the Accounts return completing up to 80% of the AR, resulting in a reduction of data entry time</li>
  <li>enables use of automated draft financial statements via <abbr title="Application programme interface">API</abbr>
</li>
  <li>reduces subjectivity across the academies sector and so develops the reliability of benchmarking data comparisons</li>
  <li>potential for efficiency savings</li>
</ul>

<p>Adopting the <abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr> means using the ledger codes in the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s chart of accounts. Trusts’ cost centres do not need to change. Trusts may map their existing ledger codes but will need to ensure that the existing ledger code structure has enough detail for full adoption, particularly balance sheet reporting in the accounts return.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>
<abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr> structure</h3>
<p>The chart of accounts structure for nominal codes is laid out in the table below:</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Mapping</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-chart-of-accounts">‘Academies chart of accounts’</a> spreadsheet provides a “<abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr> structures and mapping” tab which shows the direct relationship between accounts codes and the different tables of the accounts return, the budget forecast return, and also how the account codes map to ‘View My Financial Insights’ (VMFI).</p>

<p>The current chart of accounts mapping to the ‘Academies accounts return’ is shown in column G.</p>

<h4>Contributions from academies to trust</h4>

<p>Please note that the following account codes both map to AR field OTA060 ‘Other trading activities’ and the two MUST net to zero, or this will cause a validation on the AR with benchmarking field BTI130/BAI130-A ‘Other income revenue’.</p>

<ul>
  <li>530990 – ‘Trust contribution from academies’</li>
  <li>835170 – ‘Contribs from academy to trust’</li>
</ul>

<p>This is because the trust level data is reported in the <abbr title="Statement of Financial Activities">SoFA</abbr>, but is requested at central services and academy level in the benchmarking tables, although again, the overall total for the trust must equal zero.</p>

<h4>Mapping to the draft financial statements</h4>

<p>Mapping columns have been added to the <abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr> 2022-23 showing where the account codes map to in the draft financial statements spreadsheet which the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> has recently developed.</p>

<p>The draft financial statement spreadsheet can be automatically populated from the trusts general ledger if they are able to take advantage of the <abbr title="Application programme interface">API</abbr> functionality. Alternatively, a spreadsheet which can be manually populated will be available on the <abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr> and automation webpage in due course.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Adding account codes to the chart of accounts</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> have designed the <abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr> to meet the reporting needs of most academy trusts and it is important to keep a standard format. We expect trusts will be able to use their own cost centre structure to meet local reporting requirements, but we will consider creating new ledger codes where one or more of the following criteria are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is a change in accounting standards</li>
  <li>we change the reporting requirements</li>
  <li>we receive enough requests for additional codes for clearly different cost classifications</li>
</ul>

<p>If you require codes that do not meet the above criteria, we advise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>using cost centres or analysis codes to create the internal breakdown you need</li>
  <li>creating a ‘local’ ledger code in the <abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr>. The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> have left the last digit free under each ledger code. This gives the option to create an additional nine account codes for each account code in the standard chart of accounts.</li>
</ul>

<p>As an example, there is no specific <abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr> account code for maths hub funding. If a trust wished to record this separately, a trust could either</p>

<ul>
  <li>allocate this income along with associated expenditure under a separate cost centre heading using account code 510950 “Other <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> revenue grants”, or</li>
  <li>set up a flexible account code within the range 510951 to 510959 for ‘Maths Hub funding’ to report this grant separately. Any flexible codes set up by a trust for local reporting would roll up to the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> <abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr> account code level for the purposes of <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> reporting</li>
</ul>

<p>This short video demonstrates examples of how a trust can set up their own local account codes.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://youtu.be/EI2pU3uH9m0" rel="external">Chart of Accounts: adding a local account code</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>Excluding accounts codes</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr> account code structure has been set up to cover the variety of all trusts’ material needs. For this reason, there may be many <abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr> account codes that are not applicable for some trusts.</p>

<p>Trusts only need to use those account codes that are applicable to them, and therefore may exclude relevant account codes on the <abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr> from their nominal ledger.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>Renaming of account codes</h3>

<p>It is advised that account codes are not renamed as this reduces consistency across academies and trusts. Flexible account codes may be set up as described in the section above.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span>Account code level guidance</h3>

<p>Guidance for each income and expenditure nominal account code is now provided the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-chart-of-accounts">Account code guidance</a> document on the <abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr> Gov.UK web page. This guidance may be updated and evolve to help trusts in using the <abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.7 </span>
<abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr> and cost centres/management reporting</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr> only lays out a structure for nominal codes, that is ‘what’ a trust has received income for and expended funds on. The <abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr> does not dictate ‘where’ income and expenditure should be allocated, therefore it is up to each trust to decide how they wish to set up their own cost centre headings.</p>

<p>It is suggested that cost centres should be set up to at least be able to define income and expenditure at Academy level so that completion of the accounts return academy tables, such as benchmarking, can easily be populated. It will not be possible to automate academy level tables if information cannot be extracted from the <abbr title="Financial management system">FMS</abbr> database at academy level.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.8 </span>Balance sheet codes</h3>

<p>The balance sheet codes in the <abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr> reflect the full range of the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s fixed assets, investments and disposals. Most academy trusts will not need to use all of these. You can mark these inactive in your finance system and activate them if you need them in the future.</p>

<p>The ‘Funds’ section is currently not mapped in full to fields within the ‘Funds’ tables of the AR on-line form and balances have to be manually broken down and input, even when using automation. We are currently reviewing this section of the <abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.9 </span>Capital expenditure</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s <abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr> does not provide revenue account codes for capital expenditure. It is good practice to capitalise expenditure at the point it is incurred and post directly as an ‘addition’ to the relevant capital asset category on the balance sheet account code range 100000 to 199999. It is suggested that trusts either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>set up separate capital cost centres to record this data</li>
  <li>and/or use analysis codes if you are mapping to supplier software that has this facility
This will help group the income source with the expenditure, which will aid in the management of grant.</li>
</ul>

<p>Exceptions to the above would be:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>where the trust has paid an invoice for items that maybe split between capital and revenue, prior to deciding what value needs to be capitalised or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>where a trust is unsure of what the total value of the asset will be and whether or not it will fall above or below the de minimis capitalisation threshold set by the trust for that asset class.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In such cases, the trust may wish to use 710200 ‘Repairs and maintenance - Building improvements’ as a holding account until revenue and capitalisation values can be ascertained.</p>

<h4>3.10.1 COVID-19 income</h4>

<p>There are no <abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr> codes available to post COVID-19 funding directly to, therefore, in addition to reviewing the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1002647/Academies_Accounts_Direction_supplementary_bulletin_2020_to_2021.pdf" rel="external">Academies Accounts Direction supplementary bulletin:July 2021</a>, please take the following action:</p>

<ul>
  <li>RGR151 ‘COVID-19 funding support’ (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>/<abbr title="Education &amp; Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>): allocate to account 510950 which will map to RGR150 on the AR, values will then have to be manually updated to split COVID-19 funding to RGR151 in the AR and BTI061 ‘COVID-19 government funding’ in the benchmarking table</li>
  <li>ORG041 ‘COVID-19 Job Retention Scheme Grant’: allocate to account 520300 which will map to ORG040 on the AR, values will then have to be manually updated to split COVID-19 funding to ORG041 in the AR and BTI061 ‘COVID-19 government funding’ in the benchmarking table</li>
  <li>ORG042 ‘COVID-19 Government funding – other’: allocate to account 520300 which will map to ORG040 on the AR, values will then have to be manually updated to split COVID-19 funding to ORG042 in the AR and BTI061 ‘COVID-19 government funding’ in the benchmarking table</li>
</ul>

<p>Trusts may wish to keep this information separate on their chart of accounts by either allocating to a separate cost centre or by using the flexible 6th digit of the existing account codes stated above to set up additional income codes.</p>

<p>With regards to the COVID-19 Recovery Premium grant, we advise you allocate income to 510950 ‘Other <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>/<abbr title="Education &amp; Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> Revenue ‘. Again, trusts may wish to set up an additional account code. Further guidance will be issued once the AAD for the relevant financial year is released.</p>

<p>Any other new COVID -19 related funding not mentioned above should be allocated to 510950 unless further guidance is provided.</p>

<h4>3.10.2 Pupil premium for LAC</h4>

<p>Pupil premium received from a local authority for Looked after Children should be allocated to 520200 ‘LA – Other grants’.</p>

<h4>3.10.3 Schools Direct salaried income/SCITT</h4>

<p>Where trusts are acting as an agency for funding that is reported outside of their financial statements, they should use cost centres and/or the ‘local’ general ledger codes as described in 3.2 Adding account codes to the chart of accounts.</p>

<p>The financial year end process should then journal out these balances to show a net zero in revenue and any carry forward balance would be shown as a creditor on the balance sheet  . An exception to this would be where the trust has been allocated funds as the co-ordinating body, and therefore the relevant income and expenditure should be reported within their financial statements.</p>

<h4>3.10.5 16 to 19 Bursary Fund</h4>

<p>Please see below, using the example of £100k funding, to illustrate how to allocate income and expenditure for the 16 to19 Bursary Fund.</p>

<p>Table 3.10.5i Worked example showing allocation of 16 to 19 Bursary Fund**</p>

<p>*As the 5% admin expenditure is already in the accounts, and the income covers a proportion of staffing, stationery, resources etc, no further coding/journals are required.</p>

<h4>3.10.6 Repayment of Salix loans &amp; other loans</h4>

<p>The accounting treatment for Salix loans is the same as for other loans, except that repayments need to gross back up the GAG rebatement.</p>

<p>The account code 720400 ‘Repayment of Salix loans’ has been removed from the <abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr> 2022-23.</p>

<p>Please note that this guidance applies to academy trusts and differs from the advice given to local authority maintained schools.</p>

<h4>3.10.7 Allocation between leadership and teaching accounts code categories</h4>

<p>The leadership codes in the chart of accounts have been included to help trusts with their statutory reporting (financial statements), and it is advised that trusts use these account codes from this perspective.</p>

<p>Note that there are differences between the requirements of the trust’s own financial statements (in accordance with the Academy Accounts Direction (AAD), based on the charity SORP (as amended by the Companies Act)) and the academies accounts return (in accordance with the Government Financial Reporting Manual (FreM), based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).</p>

<p>For trust’s financial statements, section 2.135 of the AAD 2020/21 sets out the reporting requirements for management as “Management should include senior leadership team members who do not have day-to-day teaching duties. The head of school should always be considered to be management irrespective of any teaching duties.”</p>

<p>The accounts return 2020/21 guidance; section 5.1, sets out the requirement as “the leadership category (STF020) should include salaries and wages direct pay costs for senior leadership team members who do not have day to day teaching duties. Leadership would be those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of a reporting entity, directly or indirectly, including any director (whether executive or otherwise). It should be noted that this breakdown is therefore different to that required by the financial statements between teaching and management costs.”</p>

<p>For trusts who have different reporting requirements for each route, it is advised they adopt one of the requirements, but be mindful of how they will produce the other.</p>

<p>Trusts may be able to meet both requirements through the use of cost centres and/or the flexibility of the final digit in the <abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr> code.</p>

<h4>3.10.8 Recharges</h4>

<p><strong>Pooling recharges:</strong></p>

<p>The <abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr> has the following account codes to show academies internal contribution towards central services costs (pooling) where applicable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>530990: Trust contribution from academy (income)</li>
  <li>835170: Contributions from academies to trust (expenditure)
The balances on these account codes must net off to zero.</li>
</ul>

<p>These account codes will not be mapped at trust level into the <abbr title="Statement of Financial Activities">SoFA</abbr>, however they are mapped to benchmarking fields as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>530990 to BTI170 - Contributions from academies to trust (central services tables), with no mapping to academy benchmarking.</li>
  <li>835170 to BAI170 - Contributions from academies to trust (academies tables), with no mapping to academy benchmarking.</li>
</ul>

<p>If a trust wishes to be specific about identified elements of “pooling”. they could set up additional codes under these headings, for example: under 530990 the trust could set up account codes 530991 for ‘Grounds maintenance charges’, this would be summarised up to 530990 for the purposes of the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s financial returns.</p>

<p><strong>Inter-trust recharges:</strong></p>

<p>If the recharge is between academies within the trust, we suggest that the appropriate academies either</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>debits and credits the same appropriate expenditure code in each academy or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sets up an additional local account code under the relevant DfE account code so that these charges can be identified separately if the trust wishes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Either way, the balances should net to zero when reporting at trust level but would be identified in the academy level benchmarking tables. This ensures expenditure is allocated to the correct field in the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s financial returns.</p>

<p><strong>Intra-trust recharges:</strong></p>

<p>If the recharge is between trusts and is part of a traded service, then the charge to the trust should be allocated to an income code. However, for seconded staff, please use account codes 675300/675320 for secondment income, the income is within the staff costs range as the income should be net off against the salary costs, so that your salary costs are shown no higher than they really are.</p>

<p>Please note that intra-trust trading and recharges may need to be reported within the Counterparty section of the Accounts Return. Counterparty categories are shown against relevant account code on the ‘<abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr> structures and mappings’ tab within the academies chart of accounts spreadsheet.</p>

<h4>3.10.9 Leasehold land depreciation</h4>

<p>There are only extremely rare circumstances where depreciation should be charged on land specifically, which is why there is no specific chart of accounts code for depreciation against freehold and leasehold land.</p>

<p>The only circumstance may be through such issues as subsidence, but it very rare for depreciation to be charged on land.</p>

<p>Both the AAD and the accounts return (AR) combine land and buildings together in descriptions and reporting requirements, but in practice, depreciation would only be charged against the buildings element for both freehold and leasehold land and buildings.</p>

<p>It may be relevant to impair the land if the value of property in the surrounding area has reduced, and therefore use account code 120910 ‘Leasehold land: Impairment charged’.</p>

<p>If there is good reason to depreciate the land, it will have to be charged to 125710 ‘Leasehold Buildings – depreciation charged’ which maps into AR category TFD030-B. The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> is content that trusts apply their own accounting policy as the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> replaces some values within the land and buildings tables using a consistent recognition and depreciation policy across all trusts.</p>

<p>In addition, the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> does not depreciate land on peppercorn rent sites and are therefore satisfied that both sides of the adjustment are omitted in the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> returns.</p>

<p>Further guidance can be found in the AAD section 3.23 under the ‘Land and buildings’ heading which provides scenarios of long term leases.</p>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#academiesCoA1">Financial management systems (<abbr title="Financial management system">FMS</abbr>) software suppliers</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Application programme interface">API</abbr> functionality is based on the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s chart of accounts and allows the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> to understand your data and automatically match it to the right part of the online forms using the mappings identified in the “<abbr title="Chart of Accounts">CoA</abbr> structure and mapping” tab of the published chart of accounts. <abbr title="Application programme interface">API</abbr> also provides trusts with the opportunity to produce their draft financial statements.</p>

<p>For those using the <abbr title="Application programme interface">API</abbr> tool, the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> has providing an automated mapping report which compares the trusts <abbr title="Financial management system">FMS</abbr> data, at account code level, with the populated AR, enabling trusts to understand how their trial balance data has populated the AR.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Benefits of adopting <abbr title="Application programme interface">API</abbr>
</h3>

<p>For trusts adopting <abbr title="Application programme interface">API</abbr>, the benefits are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the auto population of approximately 80% of the AR including <abbr title="Statement of Financial Activities">SoFA</abbr>, balance sheet, land and buildings  and benchmarking tables</li>
  <li>allows trusts to use the automated draft financial statements functionality</li>
  <li>potential efficiency savings for trusts in the reduced time spent inputting data into the online AR form by the internal and external preparers</li>
  <li>readiness to take advantage of future developments</li>
</ul>
