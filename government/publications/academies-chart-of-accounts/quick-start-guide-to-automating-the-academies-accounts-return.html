<h2>Why automate?</h2>

<p>Over the last few years, the Department for Education (DfE) has been working closely with financial management system (<abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr>) suppliers in the sector to enable new automation functionality within their software. The automation functionality has been used by trusts for their live <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> collections and we have received positive feedback confirming the time saving potential for the sector. This guide shows how simple it is to get set up.</p>

<p>There are many benefits of using automation - these include: pre-population of your trial balance data within the accounts return; removing repetitive data entry for information already held in your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr>; speeding up submission time; and providing an audit trail via automated mapping document. The DfE also envisage there will be further benefits as we explore other uses for automation in sector reporting.</p>

<p>For more information on how automation can help in the completion of the academies accounts return and what steps you need to take to use automation, please view the video below.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHWK0R44A9k&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="external">Automating your Academies Accounts Return</a></p>

<h2>How does automation work?</h2>

<p>This new technology enables you to send data directly from your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr>.  This flowchart provides a summary of the steps taken during automation.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="QS Automation Flowchart " src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/107436/QS_Automation_flowchart.png"></div></figure>

<p>The trial balance data you apply will then be used to pre-populate up to 80% of your <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Can I use automation?</h2>

<p>We have been working with <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> suppliers who cover the majority of the sector. Response to the project has been positive and most suppliers have completed the necessary changes to their product.</p>

<p>Please contact your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> supplier to understand if they have this automation functionality set up and how to use it to send your financial data.</p>

<h2>Three quick steps to automating your return</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Allocate someone in your trust to transfer the data</h3>

<h4>What do I need to do?</h4>

<ol>
  <li>ensure the user sending the data has an IDAMS account</li>
  <li>ensure this user has been allocated the ‘data transfer approver’ role</li>
</ol>

<p>A super-user must assign or approve all requests for the data transfer approver role, more information can be found here (IDAMS page).</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Note: Trusts retain control over when their data is shared with the DfE.  Data will only be shared with the DfE when a user, assigned by the trust, chooses to send their FMS data and will only be accepted into the online form submissions, when a user, designated by the trust, applies it.</p>
</div>

<h3>Step 2: Send your data to the DfE</h3>

<p>Within your financial management system (<abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr>), there will be an option to send your data to the DfE.  Please contact your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> supplier for detailed instructions on how to send your data to the DfE from your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr>. The process may vary between suppliers.</p>

<p>Once you have sent data from your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr>, you will be directed to IDAMS to confirm your username, password and that you are happy for your financial data to be transferred to the DfE.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Approval page for sending data from financial management system to department for education" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/106970/Azure_B2C_Approvals_Screenshot.png"></div></figure>

<h3>Step 3: Apply the data to your accounts return</h3>

<p>If you are already logged into the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> when you submit the data via your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr>, you will see a data uploads link with a pending tag appear in the top right hand corner of the screen which will take you to the data uploads page.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Index Page with pending tag" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/107437/QS_Pending_Index_Page.png"></div></figure>

<p>If you are not logged in, when you next sign into your <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> you will be taken straight to the data uploads page where you will be able to decide what to do with your data.</p>

<p>This screen will present you with the following options:</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Data uploads choice options" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/106976/Data_Uploads_Screenshot.png"></div></figure>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Apply</strong>: the data will be used to pre-populate the relevant trial balance cells in your <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr>. Note that if there is already data in these cells it will be <strong>overwritten</strong> by this new data upload.  This only applies to data that can be automated, it will <strong>not overwrite non-trial balance cells</strong>, as these can only be completed manually.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reject</strong>: the data is deleted and will not pre-populate your <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr>. You will receive a warning message to confirm this before the rejection is performed.  If you decide that you should have applied the upload, you can resubmit this data or any amended data again via your financial management system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ignore</strong>: the data will not pre-populate your <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> but it is saved in the background. The data uploads link will remain in the top right-hand corner so that you can return to this screen later to accept or reject it. If you submit more than one set of data without accepting or rejecting it, only the latest submitted data will be available.
The data uploads page will keep track of your data acceptance/rejection history.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>What next?</h2>

<p>Once you have applied the data to your form, you still need to follow the normal form process and check it is correct, clear any validations and add any additional information that is not held in your finance system before submitting.</p>

<h3>How do I know what data has come from my financial management system?</h3>

<p>To easily identify which cells have been pre-populated from your finance system (rather than completed manually) these cells have been tagged with ‘Automated’ underneath them. If you manually change the data by overtyping in the field the tag will change to ‘Modified’ and the cell outline colour will change from grey to blue as illustrated below.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="AR Cell Tags" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/107439/QS_Tags.png"></div></figure>

<h3>How do I know what <abbr title="chart of accounts">CoA</abbr> data is in each <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> cell?</h3>

<p>A new report has been added for download which shows how the data from your financial management system has been populated in the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> return.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Download FMS Mapping report" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/106977/Download_FMS_Mapping.png"></div></figure>

<p>Below, is an extract of this report which shows how the value in the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> cell is made up from the <abbr title="chart of accounts">CoA</abbr> values you have sent across from your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr>.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Extract of the FMS Mapping report" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/107438/QS_Mapping.png"></div></figure>

<h2>Additional Information</h2>

<p>For more information, a detailed guide to the new features available with automation is available <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-chart-of-accounts/guide-to-automating-the-academies-accounts-return">here</a>.</p>

<p>There is also a video guide to automating the academies accounts return.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://youtu.be/XZfEBQI2Gw0" rel="external">automating the academies accounts return</a>.</p>

<h2>Automated draft trust financial statements</h2>

<p>This functionality will enable trusts sending automated data into the accounts return on-line form, to submit their trusts trial balance data directly from the <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> to auto-populate their draft financial statements.</p>

<p>The ‘Draft trust financial statements’ workbook is available to download and test this year. The primary purpose is to obtain feedback ahead of a wider release next year.</p>

<p>Please send any feedback you may have to API.Finance@education.gov.uk to enable us to improve this functionality.</p>

<h3>Data upload</h3>

<p>Trusts need to upload their <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> data using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-chart-of-accounts/guide-to-automating-the-academies-accounts-return">guide to automating the academies accounts return</a>.</p>

<h3>Data access</h3>

<p>For the auditors to gain access to the financial statements data, the trust will need to access the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> and select the subheading ‘External Auditor details’, found under the heading ‘Overview’, and ensure the information is correct for the auditor conducting the testing.</p>

<h3>Data transformation process</h3>

<p>Trusts can generate their draft financial statements by clicking on the ‘Draft Trust Financial Statements’ link, which is located in the right hand menu of the index page of the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> and is highlighted with a red box in the image below. When clicked, this link displays options for the user to download the data into an Excel or PDF file format.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Screen shot or accounts return index page highlighting link to the 'Draft Trust Financial Statements' download." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/137411/index_page_link.JPG"></div></figure>

<h3>Draft trust financial statements workbook</h3>

<p>The workbook uses the trusts automated data to produce draft financial statements in the Coketown format. An ‘Instructions’ tab has been included at the beginning of the workbook to aid with understanding the workbook.</p>

<h4>Workbook data population</h4>

<p>The workbook can be updated with new data by uploading in a new version of the trusts <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> upload file to the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> form. It will populate this template and be ready to download. There is no need to accept the data into the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> form first.</p>

<p>Each new automated data submission generates a new ‘Draft trust financial statements’ workbook. Older versions will not be retained. If you wish to keep older versions these will need to be downloaded and stored locally.</p>

<h4>Workbook navigation</h4>

<p>The ‘Note names’ tab enables easier navigation and the user can move around the workbook in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>each note is hyperlinked, and the user can navigate to them easily from the ‘Notes name’ tab</li>
  <li>alternatively, the user can right click on the arrows found in the bottom left hand corner of the workbook and select the appropriate tab from the list</li>
  <li>links are also available to the notes from the relevant references on the primary statements</li>
  <li>the user can also navigate back to the ‘Notes name’ tab from any of the notes by clicking on the note name in the top left cell (cell A1)</li>
  <li>the user can navigate to the relevant tabs directly from the B/S, SoFA, and CF tabs by clicking on the note number, found in Column C ‘B/S’ tab, or column B (CF and SoFA tab)</li>
</ul>

<p>The image below highlights the note numbers that can be clicked on to navigate to other tabs within the document.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Example highlighting note names to navigate through the financial statements report" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/137669/Updated_pic.png"></div></figure>

<h4>The ‘Note names’ tab</h4>

<p>The ‘Note names’ tab can be used to alter the note numbering dynamically by deleting any number. An example is shown below where you may wish to delete Note 7 (Expenditure).</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Screen shot of 'Notes name' tab on 'Draft trust financial statements' report." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/136502/Note_names_tab.JPG"></div></figure>

<h4>The ‘Mapping’ tab</h4>

<p>The ‘Mapping’ tab shows the downloaded <abbr title="chart of accounts">CoA</abbr> data from the trusts <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> data upload. This shows how the account codes map to the draft trust financial statements workbook and the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr>.</p>

<p>Selecting the ‘+’ above the stated columns unhides the relevant sections for you to view.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Screen shot of mapping tab in the draft financial statements" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/136567/Mapping_tab.JPG"></div></figure>

<p>All cells can be overwritten, but many are formula driven. If you change them, the formulas may no longer work. Where data is not available from the automated feed, you can manually type information in. We suggest adding/subtracting from existing formulas rather than overwriting where this is necessary. If you find there are errors in the mapping, please feed this back via API.Finance@education.gov.uk so we can improve the workbook.</p>

<p>Please note the following with regards to account codes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if your trust has added its own account codes, these will be rolled up to the DfE’s account code</li>
  <li>if an account code is being used which is currently not in our chart of accounts, for example, the trust has used a code added to the following version of the <abbr title="chart of accounts">CoA</abbr>, then it must be added manually</li>
  <li>if there are any cases where an account code is missing from the current collection periods <abbr title="chart of accounts">CoA</abbr>, please feed this back to us via API.Finance@education.gov.uk</li>
</ul>

<h4>Prior year data</h4>
<p>The prior year tab is currently unavailable, but the data can be added manually.</p>

<h4>Workbook data types</h4>

<p>The workbook will need to be reviewed and updated with any changes needed for pre-populated data and also for non-trial balance data so that the trust has a full data set for the draft financial statements.</p>

<p>The table below describes the action required in different tabs of the workbook to provide the trust with a full set of financial statements data.</p>
