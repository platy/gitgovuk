<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>General information - automating the academies accounts return</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>What this guidance covers</h3>

<p>This guidance is intended to support and assist trusts using the automation process to send data from their financial management software (FMS) to the Department for Education (DfE) for completing the 2020/21 accounts return (AR) only. It provides detailed guidance on the process of how to send your data as well as some of the new functionalities available within the AR to help trusts using automation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Introduction to automation</h3>

<p>The department has developed automation technology to help reduce the burden of submitting your financial information. This technology enables you to electronically submit your trial balance data directly from your FMS to the department, where it will then be used to pre-populate up to 80% of your AR.</p>

<p>We envisage that this technology can deliver huge time saving benefits to the sector.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Automation availability</h3>

<p>We are working with an increasing number of software suppliers in the sector to make this technology available to as many trusts as possible over the next few years. Please contact your FMS supplier to understand if they have this automation functionality set up and how to use it to send your financial data.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>Guidance review date</h3>

<p>This guidance is applicable to the automation process for completing the 2020/21 AR only.
The next review of this guidance will be in September 2022</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Getting started</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>IDAMS registration and roles required</h3>

<p>In order to send data from your financial management system, all academy trust users will need to be set up on the department for education’s (DfE) secure identity management service called IDAMS and assigned the relevant responsibility.</p>

<h4>IDAMS registration</h4>

<ul>
  <li>all academy trust users sending data from their financial management system need to be assigned a <strong>Data Transfer Approver</strong> role for their trust</li>
  <li>a super-user must assign or approve all requests for the data transfer approver role</li>
  <li>for new trusts, all users will need to be set up, starting with the super-user (please do this at the earliest opportunity)</li>
</ul>

<p>For further information on how to get set up and assign roles, please click on the following link: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-register-for-an-idams-account/academy-trust-idams-guidance-for-financial-returns">academy trust IDAMS guidance for financial returns</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Automation flowchart</h3>

<p>The department has developed an application programming interface (API) which enables you to send data to the department via your financial management system (FMS). This flowchart provides a summary of the steps taken during automation.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Automation Flowchart" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/107432/Automation_Flowchart__Apply.png"></div></figure>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Sending your data</h3>

<p>Trusts retain control over when their data is automatically shared with the DfE. Data will only be shared with the DfE when a user, assigned by the trust, chooses to send their FMS data and will only accepted into the online form submissions, when a user, designated by the trust, accepts it, as describes in <a class="govuk-link" href="#applying-submitted-data-to-your-AR1">section 3.6</a>.</p>

<p>In order to send your data to the DfE, please ensure you have registered in IDAMS and been assigned the data transfer approver role as described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#IDAMS-Registration">section 2</a>.</p>

<p>You must then log into your FMS to send your data to the DfE. Please contact your supplier for detailed instructions on how to send your data to the DfE from your FMS. The process may vary between suppliers.</p>

<p>The user sending the data will be asked to confirm their username, password and that they are happy for their financial data to be transferred to the department for education. In approving the transfer of data to the department, the user is authorising the department to use that data for the purpose of populating the AR form.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>API validations</h3>

<p>An application programming interface (API) is a set of programming code that enables data transmission between your FMS and the DfE. When you choose to send data to the DfE in your FMS, your software supplier will call the API. The code in the API will then perform several validations on your FMS data submission and if your data meets the criteria, it will be successfully accepted into the DfE database. It will be rejected if any of the following reasons occur:</p>

<ol>
  <li>your trial balance doesn’t balance</li>
  <li>there are non-numerical values</li>
  <li>it contains a number with more than 3 decimal places</li>
  <li>you have sent academy data identifiers that do not match the records the department holds for your trust. More information on this can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Validating-your-trust1">validating your trust section</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your FMS supplier understands the validations that will be carried out on the data submitted and where possible will be sending the data to meet these requirements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>Validating your trust</h3>

<p>Your supplier has set up your submission so that trust level data will include a unique identifier such as your company registration number or trust UPIN. Your academy level data will also be sent with a unique identifier for each of the academies in your trust, their LA Establishment Number (LAESTAB).</p>

<p>When your data is sent, the API will cross check these identifiers with department records to validate your submission. The submission will be rejected if the trust UPIN or company number is not recognised, if the LAESTAB is not recognised as being associated with that trust, or if the person trying to give consent does not have the correct role for that trust.</p>

<p>You can send academy level data for any number of academies within your trust but the LAESTAB number must match our records for all the academies that you send data for or the whole submission will be rejected.</p>

<p>Once your data has been successfully submitted via the API it will be transferred into the department’s database.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span>Applying submitted data to your accounts return</h3>

<p>When you next sign into your AR you will be taken straight to a data uploads page where you will be able to decide what to do with your data. Please note, this can only be accessed by users who have been assigned one of the following roles: accounts return internal preparer, accounts return internal approver or external auditor preparer. External auditor approvers are not able to select what happens to the submitted data.</p>

<p>If you are already logged into the AR when you submit the data via your FMS, the user logged in will see a “Data uploads” link and a “Pending” tag in the right hand corner of the screen. If you click on this, you will be taken to the data uploads page where you will see a choice of actions of what to do with the data.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Data uploads choice options" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/106976/Data_Uploads_Screenshot.png"></div></figure>

<p>The following information is provided to ensure you recognise the submission:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Initiated by:</strong> Identifies who in your organisation sent the data from your financial management system</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Date and time:</strong> Identifies when your organisation sent the data from your financial management system</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You have the following choice of actions available and you must select one to enable you to leave this screen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Apply:</strong> the data will be used to pre-populate the trial balance cells in your AR. Please note, that if there is already data in these cells they will be overwritten by this new data upload. Non-trial balance fields will not be impacted. You will receive a warning message to confirm this before the acceptance is performed. Following an import, page statuses will update and validations will clear or trigger according to the new data. Further validations may trigger as you go on to complete each page.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Reject:</strong> the data is deleted and will not pre-populate your AR. If you decide that you should have accepted the upload, you must resubmit the data via your financial management system. You will receive a warning message to confirm this before the rejection is performed.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Ignore:</strong> the data will not pre-populate your AR but it is saved in the background so that you can return to this screen later to accept or reject it. If you submit more than one set of data without accepting or rejecting it, only the latest submitted data will be available, therefore, you will lose your previously ignored uploaded data. You can access this ignored data through the “Data Uploads” link which is located on the top right hand side of every screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>The data uploads page will keep track of your data acceptance/rejection history. You can see this at any time in the ‘Activity History’ section on the bottom right hand side of the index screen. The data uploads page will keep track of your data acceptance/rejection history. You can see this at any time in the ‘Activity History’ section on the bottom right hand side of the index screen.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.7 </span>Data transformation</h3>

<p>The data sent in the FMS submission is formatted to meet the AR requirements. This includes four main activities:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>sub-totalling of chart of account codes to AR field level following the mapping described in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-chart-of-accounts/guide-to-adopting-the-academies-chart-of-accounts">chart of accounts</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the sub-totalled values are rounded to the nearest £000</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>due to the rounding occurring in step two, the residual values left after rounding are allocated to certain AR fields throughout the form. These are listed in the table below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the signage of the values is flipped on certain account codes e.g. your income and liability codes are likely to contain negative values in your FMS but the AR may require you to report them as positive values</p>
  </li>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Overview updates</h3>

<p>The ‘overview’ section of the AR has four tables. All four tables must be completed to proceed with the rest of the AR form. You can accept the FMS submission but until you complete all four of the tables in the overview section, you will not be able to see your data.</p>

<p>Many of the AR tables and data entry rows/columns displayed within the AR form are dependent on information provided in the four tables within the ‘overview’ section. If you send data through your FMS submission, for this data to be presented in the form, we populate certain answers within the overview section according to what has been sent. The next few sections go into this in more detail.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Academy information – teaching schools</h3>

<p>If an academy school within the trust has teaching school status, it is required to report income and expenditure relating to the teaching school separately.</p>

<p>If a trust has data at academy level in teaching school chart of account codes, this will be sent across in their FMS submission, within the academy trial balance dataset. When this data is accepted in the AR, the form will automatically select ‘Yes’ against the teaching school question (ACI050) for the relevant academy, in order to display additional fields relating to teaching schools within the ‘SoFA’ and ‘benchmarking’ sections.</p>

<p>If however, a trust has data against a teaching school chart of account code at trust level and not academy level, i.e. only within the trust trial balance dataset, then the form will not be able to automatically make this selection. A form user will be required to review the list of academies on the academy information page and select yes to the teaching school question (ACI050) for the relevant academies before the page can be marked as complete. If your trust only contains one academy, then ‘Yes’ will automatically be selected against the relevant teaching school question (ACI050).</p>

<p>All three of the above scenarios will lead to the status of the academy information page being re-set to in progress after accepting the FMS submission.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Academy information – transfers and conversions</h3>

<p>The trust is required to confirm the status of each academy school within the trust on the academy information page. This can be done by selecting the correct status from the drop-down list which is situated below the ESFA recorded status.</p>

<p>If a trust sends an FMS submission containing data against in-period transfer-in, in-period transfer-out or newly converted member chart of account codes at academy level, i.e. within the academy trial balance dataset, then the form will automatically select the relevant status in the drop-down list for that academy (ACI040). This will display additional fields relating to this type of transfer or conversion within the AR form, as well as activating the ‘transfers and conversions’ section.</p>

<p>If however, there is data against in-period transfer-in, in-period transfer-out or newly converted member chart of account codes at trust level and not academy level, i.e. within the trust trial balance dataset, the form will not be able to automatically make this selection. A form user will be required to review the list of academies on the academy information page and update the transfer status in line with the data which has been submitted. For example, if the FMS submission contained data for in-period transfer-in and newly converted member, the form user would need to ensure both these statuses are selected in the drop down list (ACI040) for the relevant academies before the page can be marked as complete.</p>

<p>The above scenarios will lead to the status of the academy information page being re-set to in progress after accepting the FMS submission.</p>

<p>If the form user has already completed the academy information section and the data imported from the FMS submission does not contradict the information input, there will be no change to the page status.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p><strong>ACTION FOR TRUSTS:</strong> Check academies have the correct status</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>Questionnaire</h3>

<p>Most trusts will not have disclosures for every table in the return and completing this questionnaire tailors the return to the tables, assets and investment types that are relevant to them.</p>

<p>When an FMS submission is accepted, the system will check if there is any data related to the optional tables which can be made available through a questionnaire selection. If there is, this selection will be automatically chosen on the questionnaire, according to the data sent from the FMS, so that the table is made available and the user can see all values populated in the form. This will override any previous questionnaire responses, and the status of the questionnaire page will be changed from either not started or completed to in progress.</p>

<p>If the user has already completed the questionnaire and the data loaded through the FMS submission does not contradict the information input, then the status of this page will remain as completed.</p>

<p>If you have selected to make a table available in the questionnaire, and there is no data imported for this category, your answer on the questionnaire will not be changed.</p>

<p>Trusts can change the answers to questions at any time before the form is approved. Note that doing so would also remove any associated data in the form, including both data that has been imported through the FMS submission or manually entered.</p>

<p>Trusts may find that certain responses are pre-populated and in a read-only (greyed out) format, this is as a result of the closing balances disclosed in the trust’s 2018/19 AR. You will not be able to change the response to these questions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span>Calculated fields – opening balances</h3>

<p>Opening balances are pre-populated fields using the data submitted as the closing balance in the previous year’s AR. The opening balance values are read-only and cannot be modified.</p>

<p>When an FMS submission is accepted, the pre-populated opening balances figures are deducted from the brought forward figure sent through the FMS and any remaining posted to the relevant adjustments made to opening balance line.</p>

<p>Below is a worked example showing the data transformation and opening balance calculation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span>Calculated fields – funds</h3>

<p>Within the chart of accounts, the funds trial balance codes represent the total funds balance for the year. When this information is passed from the FMS to the DfE to be populated in the AR, a calculation is required. The AR already pre-populates the opening balance with the closing balance submitted in the previous year’s AR. As the funds balance contains the opening balance within its figure, the AR form deducts this opening balance from the funds balance and the remainder is added into the ‘Other gains, losses and transfers’ line in the funds table.</p>

<p>As the trial balance codes do not provide further detail, you will need to go into the form and manually modify the funds tables to provide the breakdown of the fund balance. Worked examples are below.</p>

<p>Data can only be automated if it is held within your FMS and therefore part of the trial balance. There are several non-trial balance chart of account codes, these all starting with 9. These will not be sent across from your FMS and so fields within the AR, which relate to non-trial balance data, will have to be completely manually.</p>

<p>Cells which must be completed manually are called non-automated cells. Sending data from your FMS will have no <strong>impact on these non-automated cells</strong> – i.e. where you have manually entered data into the non-automated cells and then need to import or re-import data from your FMS, these non-automated (manual) cells will not be overwritten.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.8 </span>Checking and tracking your data</h3>

<p>Once you have accepted your data upload into your AR, you will need to check it is correct. To easily identify which cells have been pre-populated from your finance system (rather than completed manually) these cells have been tagged with ‘Automated’ underneath them. If you manually change the data by overtyping in the field the tag will change to ‘Modified’ and the cell outline colour will change from grey to blue. If you decide the original pre-populated value was correct and you change it back, the tag will revert to ‘Automated’ and the cell outline colour will be grey once again.</p>

<p>Where fields are calculated using data provided from your FMS, such as <a class="govuk-link" href="#Calculated-fields-2">opening balances</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="#Calculated-fields-funds2">funds</a>, if the calculation results in a different number to the one sent from your FMS, the field will be tagged with the ‘modified’ label.</p>

<p>This field level tracking functionality will be turned on as a default when you accept data into your form. You can turn it off/on using the display tracking button on the right-hand side of the index screen. Please note this button, as well as the field level tracking, is only visible after you have accepted an FMS submission, and can then only be seen by those with the accounts return internal preparer, external auditor preparer or accounts return internal approver roles.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.9 </span>Report showing mapping between FMS and AR</h3>

<p>The FMS mapping report can be found on the right-hand side of the index screen once you have accepted a data upload. Please note, this report will not be visible before this point. This report shows which chart of accounts codes have been fed from your FMS into which AR fields. You will also be able to see the original values submitted from your FMS and how they have been transformed to meet the AR requirements per the <a class="govuk-link" href="#data-transformation1">data transformation steps</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.10 </span>Amending your data</h3>

<p>If you need to make amendments to the pre-populated cells you can either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>change the data manually by deleting the automated figure and typing in your own. Note that this will change the field level tracking tag for those cells from ‘Automated’ to ‘Modified’.</li>
  <li>make the adjustments in your finance systems and upload a new set of trial balance data. Note this will overwrite all automated cells including those you may have previously changed manually - n.b. Manual cells (those that can’t be automated) will be unaffected.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that for single academy trusts, where possible, the form will use data submitted in the SoFA to auto-populate cells in the benchmarking section. This will be read-only data and you will not be able to amend these fields.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.11 </span>Cut off for data uploads</h3>

<p>Uploads from your finance system will only be possible up to the point the form is sent through the approval cycle. After this no more uploads will be accepted, even if the form is sent back to preparer stage.</p>

<p>All changes will thereafter need to be made manually.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.12 </span>Accounts return review, approval, and submission</h3>

<p>Once you have completed your return, checked your data and confirmed this by clicking mark as complete on each page and cleared any validations, please follow the normal approval process, submitting the accounts return to your trust and auditor approvers, more information on this can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-academy-financial-returns-accounts-return/academies-accounts-return-201819-guidance-for-completing-the-online-form#eel-decline8">here</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Checklist for trusts using automation</h3>

<p>This checklist is provided as a pointer of things you may want to check if you are submitting your financial information via automation.</p>

<p>Before you start:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure you set up a ‘Data Transfer Approver’ on IDAMS otherwise you will not be able to send data from your FMS to the AR</li>
</ul>

<p>Once data has been accepted into the AR form:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>overview - Check each academy has the correct status for teaching schools and transfers on the academy information page</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>overview - Review and confirm questionnaire responses</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>balance Sheet Funds and Other Disclosures - Update funds table pages</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>manually update non-trial balance cells throughout the form</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>check all your data and confirm using the mark as complete button on each page before sending for approval.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
