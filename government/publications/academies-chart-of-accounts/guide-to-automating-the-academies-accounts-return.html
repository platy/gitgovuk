<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>What this guidance covers</h3>

<p>This guidance is intended to support and assist trusts using the automation process to send data from their financial management system (<abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr>) to the Department for Education (DfE) for completing the 2021/22 accounts return (<abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr>) and draft trust financial statements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Introduction to automation</h3>

<p>The department has developed automation technology to help reduce the burden of submitting your financial information. This technology enables you to electronically submit your trial balance data directly from your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> to the department, which can then be used to pre-populate up to 80% of your <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> and the trail balance information needed for the trusts financial statements.</p>

<p>There are 3 pre-requisites for using automation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The trust has either adopted the <abbr title="chart of accounts">CoA</abbr> natively or is mapping to it via their <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> software provider – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-chart-of-accounts/guide-to-adopting-the-academies-chart-of-accounts">‘Guide to adopting the academies chart of accounts’</a>
</li>
  <li>The trusts software provider has developed the automation – see <a class="govuk-link" href="#automation-availability">automation availability</a>
</li>
  <li>The trust has assigned and registered a ‘data transfer approver’ role within the trust on IDAMS – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-register-for-an-idams-account/academy-trust-idams-guidance-for-financial-returns">‘Academy trust IDAMS guidance for financial returns’</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Automation availability</h3>

<p>We are working with an increasing number of software suppliers in the sector to make this technology available to as many trusts as possible over the next few years. Please contact your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> supplier to understand if they have this automation functionality set up and how to use it to send your financial data.</p>

<p><abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> software suppliers who successfully automated trusts’ general ledger to populate the 2020/21 accounts return were Access, ESS (formally Capita), Hoge and Sage (provided by Dayta).</p>

<p>In addition, we can confirmation that IRIS (formally PS Financials) will also be automate their clients/trusts <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> data for the 2021/22 accounts return. We are expecting a few other software suppliers to also be automation ready for this coming collection period.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>Timelines for the availability of on-line forms</h3>

<p>Please see the table below for the timelines of when trusts can automate their financial data to populate the draft trust financial statements and the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> for the 2021/22 collection period.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Shows timelines that the account return is live for for both the draft trust financial statements and the accounts return itself." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/160565/AR___DTFS_timeline.png"></div></figure>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span>Guidance review date</h3>

<p>This guidance is applicable to the automation process for completing the 2021/22 <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> only.
The next review of this guidance will be in September 2023</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Getting started</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>IDAMS registration and roles required</h3>

<p>To send data from your financial management system, all academy trust users will need to be set up on the DfE secure identity management service called IDAMS and assigned the relevant responsibility.</p>

<h4>2.1.1 IDAMS registration</h4>

<ol>
  <li>all academy trust users sending data from their financial management system need to be assigned a <strong>Data Transfer Approver</strong> role for their trust</li>
  <li>a super-user must assign or approve all requests for the data transfer approver role</li>
  <li>for new trusts, all users will need to be set up, starting with the super-user (please do this at the earliest opportunity)</li>
</ol>

<p>For further information on how to get set up and assign roles, please click on the following link: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-register-for-an-idams-account/academy-trust-idams-guidance-for-financial-returns">academy trust IDAMS guidance for financial returns</a>.</p>

</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Automation flowchart</h3>

<p>The department has developed an application programming interface (API) which enables you to send data to the department via your financial management system (<abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr>). This flowchart provides a summary of the steps taken during automation.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Shows summary of automation process" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/160871/Summary_of_automation_process.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>*draft FS - draft trust financial statements: the workbook will include prior year data if the trust sent their data via an API in the previous financial year, and it will be the final data set loaded so please check for accuracy against your final financial statement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Sending your data</h3>

<p>Trusts retain control over when their data is automatically shared with the DfE. Data will only be shared with the DfE when:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the data transfer approver, assigned by the trust, chooses to send their <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> data and</li>
  <li>the data is accepted into the online form when a user, designated by the trust, accepts it, as described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#applying-submitted-data-to-your-AR1">section 3.6</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to send your data to the DfE, please ensure you have registered in IDAMS and been assigned the data transfer approver role as described in&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-chart-of-accounts/guide-to-automating-the-academies-accounts-return#IDAMS-Registration">section 2</a>.</p>

<p>You must then log into your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> to send your data to the DfE. Please contact your supplier for detailed instructions on how to send your data to the DfE from your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr>. The process may vary between suppliers.</p>

<p>The user sending the data will be asked to confirm their username, password and that they are happy for their financial data to be transferred to the department for education. In approving the transfer of data to the department, the user is authorising the department to use that data for the purpose of populating the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> form.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Shows screen shot of consent to send screen" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/160870/Consent_to_send.JPG"></div></figure>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Types of <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> data included in submission</h3>

<p>Each supplier has different functionality set up, but your submission could include up to four data sets.</p>

<p>Please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-chart-of-accounts/guide-to-adopting-the-academies-chart-of-accounts">chart of accounts webpage</a> for a more detailed breakdown on each of the above mappings.</p>

<h4>3.3.1 Trading Subsidiaries</h4>

<p>For those trusts whose have a trading subsidiary which is operating as part of the same legal corporate entity as the trust.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the accounts for a trading subsidiary are recorded on a separate financial management system (<abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr>), then it is currently not possible to include your data within the automation processes, unless trusts journaled all the data from the trading subsidiary to the trusts main accounting system at the year end, as the API can only accept a single data feed into the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr>. However, if the <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> software provider for the trading subsidiary has adopted the <abbr title="chart of accounts">CoA</abbr>, the trust could also adopt the <abbr title="chart of accounts">CoA</abbr> on that system so that the information across the two systems is consistent and would improve efficiencies, such as mapping data to <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> fields and making inter-company journals more transparent.</li>
  <li>If the trading subsidiary is simply set up on a separate cost centre on the same <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr>, then there will be no problem in automating this data. For the purposes of automation, this trading cost centre data would need to be tagged as ‘matOverview’ or ‘Academies’ by the <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> provider, see footnote below. Also, if the trading cost centre is specific to one academy only, then it should also be tagged with the LEA Establishment number by the <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> provider for automation.</li>
  <li>If the trading subsidiary is set up as a separate ‘entity’ on the accounting system, even though it is part of the same legal corporate legal entity, the trust will need to check with their <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> provider whether this data can be amalgamated with the trusts main ‘entity’ to automate the data in one upload.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Footnote:</strong> if the trust is a MAT, it is up to the trust to decide where to report the trading organisation on the benchmarking, it should be included within the relevant academy if the trading is solely related to that academy; a test of which would be if the academy were to move to another trust, would the trading subsidiary also move. However, if the trading applies to two or move academies within the trust it should be allocated to MAT central services.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>API validations</h3>

<p>An application programming interface (API) is a set of programming code that enables data transmission between your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> and the DfE. When you choose to send data to the DfE in your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr>, your software supplier will call the API. The code in the API will then perform several validations on your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> data submission and if your data meets the criteria, it will be successfully accepted into the DfE database. It will be rejected if any of the following reasons occur:</p>

<ol>
  <li>your trial balance doesn’t balance</li>
  <li>there are non-numerical values</li>
  <li>it contains a number with more than 3 decimal places</li>
  <li>you have sent academy data identifiers that do not match the records the department holds for your trust. More information on this can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Validating-your-trust1">validating your trust section</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> supplier understands the validations that will be carried out on the data submitted and where possible will be sending the data to meet these requirements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>Validating your trust</h3>

<p>Your supplier has set up your submission so that trust level data will include a unique identifier such as your company registration number or trust UPIN. Your academy level data will also be sent with a unique identifier for each of the academies in your trust, their LA Establishment Number (LAESTAB).</p>

<p>When your data is sent, the API will cross check these identifiers with department records to validate your submission. The submission will be rejected if the trust UPIN or company number is not recognised, if the LAESTAB is not recognised as being associated with that trust, or if the person trying to give consent does not have the correct role for that trust.</p>

<p>You can send academy level data for any number of academies within your trust but the LAESTAB number must match our records for all the academies that you send data for or the whole submission will be rejected.</p>

<p>Once your data has been successfully submitted via the API it will be transferred into the department’s database.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span>Applying submitted data to your accounts return</h3>

<p>When you next sign into your <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> you will be taken straight to a data uploads page where you will be able to decide what to do with your data. Please note, this can only be accessed by users who have been assigned one of the following roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accounts return internal preparer,</li>
  <li>accounts return internal approver or</li>
  <li>external auditor preparer.</li>
</ul>

<p>External auditor approvers are not able to select what happens to the submitted data.</p>

<p>If you are already logged into the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> when you submit the data via your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr>, the user logged in will see a “Data uploads” link and a “Pending” tag in the right hand corner of the screen.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Index Page with pending tag" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/107437/QS_Pending_Index_Page.png"></div></figure>

<p>If you click on this, you will be taken to the data uploads page where you will see a choice of actions of what to do with the data.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Data uploads choice options" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/106976/Data_Uploads_Screenshot.png"></div></figure>

<p>The following information is provided to ensure you recognise the submission:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Initiated by:</strong> Identifies who in your organisation sent the data from your financial management system</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Date and time:</strong> Identifies when your organisation sent the data from your financial management system</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You have the following choice of actions available and you must select one to enable you to leave this screen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Apply:</strong> the data will be used to pre-populate the trial balance cells in your <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr>. Please note, that if there is already data in these cells they will be overwritten by this new data upload. Non-trial balance fields will not be impacted. You will receive a warning message to confirm this before the acceptance is performed. Following an import, page statuses will update and validations will clear or trigger according to the new data. Further validations may trigger as you go on to complete each page.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Reject:</strong> the data is deleted and will not pre-populate your <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr>. If you decide that you should have accepted the upload, you must resubmit the data via your financial management system. You will receive a warning message to confirm this before the rejection is performed.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Ignore:</strong> the data will not pre-populate your <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> but it is saved in the background so that you can return to this screen later to accept or reject it. If you submit more than one set of data without accepting or rejecting it, only the latest submitted data will be available, therefore, you will lose your previously ignored uploaded data.

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Data transformation - accounts return</h3>

<p>The data sent in the <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> submission is formatted to meet the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> requirements. This includes four main activities:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>sub-totalling of chart of account codes to <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> field level following the mapping described in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-chart-of-accounts/guide-to-adopting-the-academies-chart-of-accounts">chart of accounts</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the sub-totalled values are rounded to the nearest £000</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>due to the rounding occurring in step two, the residual values left after rounding are allocated to certain <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> fields throughout the form. These are listed in the table below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the signage of the values is flipped on certain account codes e.g. your income and liability codes are likely to contain negative values in your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> but the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> may require you to report them as positive values</p>
  </li>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Overview updates</h3>

<p>The ‘overview’ section of the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> has four tables. All four tables must be completed to proceed with the rest of the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> form. You can accept the <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> submission but until you complete all four of the tables in the overview section, you will not be able to see your data.</p>

<p>Many of the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> tables, data entry rows/columns and fields displayed within the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> form are dependent on information provided in the four tables within the four ‘Overview’ tables. The <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> submission trusts send, will populate certain answers within these tables depending on the data sent.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Academy information – teaching schools</h3>

<p>If an academy school within the trust has teaching school status, it is required to report income and expenditure relating to the teaching school separately.</p>

<p>If a trust has data at academy level in teaching school chart of account codes, this will be sent across in their <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> submission, within the academy trial balance dataset. When this data is accepted in the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr>, the form will automatically select ‘Yes’ against the teaching school question (ACI050) for the relevant academy, in order to display additional fields relating to teaching schools within the ‘SoFA’ and ‘benchmarking’ sections.</p>

<p>If however, a trust has data against a teaching school chart of account code at trust level and not academy level, i.e. only within the trust trial balance dataset, then the form will not be able to automatically make this selection. A form user will be required to review the list of academies on the academy information page and select yes to the teaching school question (ACI050) for the relevant academies before the page can be marked as complete. If your trust only contains one academy, then ‘Yes’ will automatically be selected against the relevant teaching school question (ACI050).</p>

<p>All three of the above scenarios will lead to the status of the academy information page being re-set to in progress after accepting the <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> submission.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Academy information – transfers and conversions</h3>

<p>The trust is required to confirm the status of each academy school within the trust on the academy information page. This can be done by selecting the correct status from the drop-down list which is situated below the ESFA recorded status.</p>

<p>If a trust sends an <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> submission containing data against in-period transfer-in, in-period transfer-out or newly converted member chart of account codes at academy level, i.e. within the academy trial balance dataset, then the form will automatically select the relevant status in the drop-down list for that academy (ACI040). This will display additional fields relating to this type of transfer or conversion within the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> form, as well as activating the ‘transfers and conversions’ section.</p>

<p>If however, there is data against in-period transfer-in, in-period transfer-out or newly converted member chart of account codes at trust level and not academy level, i.e. within the trust trial balance dataset, the form will not be able to automatically make this selection. A form user will be required to review the list of academies on the academy information page and update the transfer status in line with the data which has been submitted. For example, if the <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> submission contained data for in-period transfer-in and newly converted member, the form user would need to ensure both these statuses are selected in the drop down list (ACI040) for the relevant academies before the page can be marked as complete.</p>

<p>The above scenarios will lead to the status of the academy information page being re-set to in progress after accepting the <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> submission.</p>

<p>If the form user has already completed the academy information section and the data imported from the <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> submission does not contradict the information input, there will be no change to the page status.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p><strong>ACTION FOR TRUSTS:</strong> Check academies have the correct status</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Questionnaire</h3>

<p>Most trusts will not have disclosures for every table in the return and completing this questionnaire tailors the return to the tables, assets and investment types that are relevant to them.</p>

<p>When an <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> submission is accepted, the system will check if there is any data related to the optional tables which can be made available through a questionnaire selection. If there is, this selection will be automatically chosen on the questionnaire, according to the data sent from the <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr>, so that the table is made available and the user can see all values populated in the form. This will override any previous questionnaire responses, and the status of the questionnaire page will be changed from either not started or completed to in progress.</p>

<p>If the user has already completed the questionnaire and the data loaded through the <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> submission does not contradict the information input, then the status of this page will remain as completed.</p>

<p>If you have selected to make a table available in the questionnaire, and there is no data imported for this category, your answer on the questionnaire will not be changed.</p>

<p>Trusts can change the answers to questions at any time before the form is approved. Note that doing so would also remove any associated data in the form, including both data that has been imported through the <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> submission or manually entered.</p>

<p>Trusts may find that certain responses are pre-populated and in a read-only (greyed out) format, this is as a result of the closing balances disclosed in the trust’s 2018/19 <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr>. You will not be able to change the response to these questions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span>Calculated fields – opening balances</h3>

<p>Opening balances are pre-populated fields using the data submitted as the closing balance in the previous year’s <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr>. The opening balance values are read-only and cannot be modified.</p>

<p>When an <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> submission is accepted, the pre-populated opening balances figures are deducted from the brought forward figure sent through the <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> and any remaining posted to the relevant adjustments made to opening balance line.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span>Calculated fields – funds</h3>

<p>Within the chart of accounts, the funds trial balance codes represent the total funds balance for the year. When this information is passed from the <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> to the DfE to be populated in the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr>, a calculation is required. The <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> already pre-populates the opening balance with the closing balance submitted in the previous year’s <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr>. As the funds balance contains the opening balance within its figure, the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> form deducts this opening balance from the funds balance and the remainder is added into the ‘Other gains, losses and transfers’ line in the funds table.</p>

<p>As the trial balance codes do not provide further detail, you will need to go into the form and manually modify the funds tables to provide the breakdown of the fund balance. Worked examples are below.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.8 </span>Non-automated data</h3>

<p>Data can only be automated if it is held within your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> and therefore part of the trial balance. There are several non-trial balance chart of account codes, these all starting with 9. These will not be sent across from your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> and so fields within the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr>, which relate to non-trial balance data, will have to be completely manually.</p>

<p>There are several tables within the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr>, which compromise of only non-trial balance information. These tables are listed below and where applicable, will need to be completed manually:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Academy transfer In</li>
  <li>Academy transfer Out</li>
  <li>Agency arrangements</li>
  <li>Amortisation periods</li>
  <li>Average staff numbers (FTE)</li>
  <li>Capital commitments - contracted</li>
  <li>Capitalisation thresholds</li>
  <li>Contingent liabilities</li>
  <li><strong>COVID revenue grants (see section ***)</strong></li>
  <li>Depreciation periods</li>
  <li>Exit schemes</li>
  <li>Finance lease commitments</li>
  <li>Fixed asset financing</li>
  <li>Fund analysis</li>
  <li>Intangible fixed assets - asset financing</li>
  <li>Loan analysis</li>
  <li>Loss of office payments</li>
  <li>Losses &amp; special payments</li>
  <li>Newly converted member</li>
  <li>Non-cancellable contracts</li>
  <li>Off payroll arrangements</li>
  <li>Operating lease commitments</li>
  <li>Pension breakdown</li>
  <li>Pension - employer contribution</li>
  <li>Pension life expectancy</li>
  <li>Pension major assumptions</li>
  <li>Pension plan assets</li>
  <li>Pension sensitivity</li>
  <li>Permanent employees - gender analysis</li>
  <li>PFI commitments</li>

  <li>Staff costs</li>
  <li>Staff emoluments</li>
  <li>Staff sickness - days lost</li>
  <li>Trustee remuneration</li>
</ul>

<p>Cells which must be completed manually are called non-automated cells. Sending data from your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> will have no <strong>impact on these non-automated cells</strong> – i.e. where you have manually entered data into the non-automated cells and then need to import or re-import data from your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr>, these non-automated (manual) cells will not be overwritten.</p>

</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.9 </span>Checking and tracking your data</h3>

<p>Once you have accepted your data upload into your <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr>, you will need to check it is correct. To easily identify which cells have been pre-populated from your finance system (rather than completed manually) these cells have been tagged with ‘Automated’ underneath them. If you manually change the data by overtyping in the field the tag will change to ‘Modified’ and the cell outline colour will change from grey to blue. If you decide the original pre-populated value was correct and you change it back, the tag will revert to ‘Automated’ and the cell outline colour will be grey once again.</p>

<p>Where fields are calculated using data provided from your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr>, such as <a class="govuk-link" href="#Calculated-fields-2">opening balances</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="#Calculated-fields-funds2">funds</a>, if the calculation results in a different number to the one sent from your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr>, the field will be tagged with the ‘modified’ label.</p>

<p>This field level tracking functionality will be turned on as a default when you accept data into your form. You can turn it off/on using the display tracking button on the right-hand side of the index screen. Please note this button, as well as the field level tracking, is only visible after you have accepted an <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> submission, and can then only be seen by those with the accounts return internal preparer, external auditor preparer or accounts return internal approver roles.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.10 </span>Report showing mapping between <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> and <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> mapping report can be found on the right-hand side of the index screen once you have accepted a data upload. Please note, this report will not be visible before this point. This report shows which chart of accounts codes have been fed from your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> into which <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> fields. You will also be able to see the original values submitted from your <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> and how they have been transformed to meet the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> requirements per the <a class="govuk-link" href="#data-transformation1">data transformation steps</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.11 </span>Amending your data</h3>

<p>If you need to make amendments to the pre-populated cells you can either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>change the data manually by deleting the automated figure and typing in your own. Note that this will change the field level tracking tag for those cells from ‘Automated’ to ‘Modified’.</li>
  <li>make the adjustments in your finance systems and upload a new set of trial balance data. Note this will overwrite all automated cells including those you may have previously changed manually - n.b. Manual cells (those that can’t be automated) will be unaffected.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that for single academy trusts, where possible, the form will use data submitted in the SoFA to auto-populate cells in the benchmarking section. This will be read-only data and you will not be able to amend these fields.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.12 </span>Cut off for data uploads</h3>

<p>Uploads from your finance system will only be possible up to the point the form is sent through the approval cycle. After this no more uploads will be accepted, even if the form is sent back to preparer stage.</p>

<p>All changes will thereafter need to be made manually.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.13 </span>Accounts return review, approval, and submission</h3>

<p>Once you have completed your return, checked your data and confirmed this by clicking mark as complete on each page and cleared any validations, please follow the normal approval process, submitting the accounts return to your trust and auditor approvers, more information on this can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-academy-financial-returns-accounts-return/academies-accounts-return-201819-guidance-for-completing-the-online-form#eel-decline8">here</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Data upload and acceptance processes</h3>

<p>Trusts use the same process of uploading and accepting data into the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> form and should refer to guidance in section 3 ‘How automation works’.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> the differences between this guidance, for draft financial statements, and the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> guidance are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> form for will be open from early September 2022 to upload and accept data into the for the financial statements report only, the form will be open to send data to the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> from 18th October, 2022</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>external audit preparers will not be able to access the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> to run the financial statements report before the full <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> is live, and therefore during the period the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> is open for trusts to run the financial statements only, the trust will have to run the report and send the Excel spreadsheet to their auditor</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the overview section of the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> form does not need to be completed to use the financial statements report</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Data transformation</h3>

<p>Trusts can generate their draft financial statements by clicking on the ‘Draft Trust Financial Statements’ link, which is located in the right hand menu of the index page of the&nbsp;<abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr>&nbsp;and is highlighted with a red box in the image below. When clicked, this link displays options for the user to download the data into an Excel or PDF file format.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Screen shot or accounts return index page highlighting link to the 'Draft Trust Financial Statements' download." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/137411/index_page_link.JPG"></div></figure>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>Draft trust financial statements workbook</h3>
<p>{#draft-trust-financial-statements-workbook}</p>

<p>The workbook uses the trusts automated data to produce draft financial statements in the Coketown format. An ‘Instructions’ tab has been included at the beginning of the workbook to aid with understanding the workbook.</p>

<h4>6.3.1 Workbook data population</h4>

<p>The workbook can be updated with new data by uploading in a new version of the trusts <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> upload file to the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> form. It will populate this template and be ready to download. There is no need to accept the data into the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr> form first.</p>

<p>Each new automated data submission generates a new ‘Draft trust financial statements’ workbook. Older versions will not be retained. If you wish to keep older versions these will need to be downloaded and stored locally.</p>

<h4>6.3.2 Workbook navigation</h4>

<p>The ‘Note names’ tab enables easier navigation and the user can move around the workbook in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>each note is hyperlinked, and the user can navigate to them easily from the ‘Notes name’ tab</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>alternatively, the user can right click on the arrows found in the bottom left hand corner of the workbook and select the appropriate tab from the list</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>links are also available to the notes from the relevant references on the primary statements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the user can also navigate back to the ‘Notes name’ tab from any of the notes by clicking on the note name in the top left cell (cell A1)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the user can navigate to the relevant tabs directly from the B/S, SoFA, and CF tabs by clicking on the note number, found in Column C ‘B/S’ tab, or column B (CF and SoFA tab)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The image below highlights the note numbers that can be clicked on to navigate to other tabs within the document.</p>

<h4>6.3.3 The ‘Note names’ tab</h4>

<p>The ‘Note names’ tab can be used to alter the note numbering dynamically by deleting any number. An example is shown below where you may wish to delete Note 7 (Expenditure).</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Screen shot of 'Notes name' tab on 'Draft trust financial statements' report." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/136502/Note_names_tab.JPG"></div></figure>

<h4>6.3.4 The ‘Mapping’ tab</h4>

<p>The ‘Mapping’ tab shows the downloaded <abbr title="chart of accounts">CoA</abbr> data from the trusts <abbr title="financial management system">FMS</abbr> data upload. This shows how the account codes map to the draft trust financial statements workbook and the <abbr title="accounts return">AR</abbr>.</p>

<p>Selecting the ‘+’ above the stated columns unhides the relevant sections for you to view.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Screen shot of mapping tab in the draft financial statements" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/136567/Mapping_tab.JPG"></div></figure>

<p>All cells can be overwritten, but many are formula driven. If you change them, the formulas may no longer work. Where data is not available from the automated feed, you can manually type information in. We suggest adding/subtracting from existing formulas rather than overwriting where this is necessary. If you find there are errors in the mapping, please feed this back via API.Finance@education.gov.uk so we can improve the workbook.</p>

<p>Please note the following with regards to account codes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if your trust has added its own account codes, these will be rolled up to the DfE’s account code</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if an account code is being used which is currently not in our chart of accounts, for example, the trust has used a code added to the following version of the <abbr title="chart of accounts">CoA</abbr>, then it must be added manually</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if there are any cases where an account code is missing from the current collection periods <abbr title="chart of accounts">CoA</abbr>, please feed this back to us via API.Finance@education.gov.uk</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>6.3.5 Prior year data</h4>

<p>The prior year tab is currently unavailable, but the data can be added manually.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span>6.3.6 Workbook data types</h3>

<p>The workbook will need to be reviewed and updated with any changes needed for pre-populated data and also for non-trial balance data so that the trust has a full data set for the draft financial statements.</p>

<p>The table below describes the action required in different tabs of the workbook to provide the trust with a full set of financial statements data.</p>
