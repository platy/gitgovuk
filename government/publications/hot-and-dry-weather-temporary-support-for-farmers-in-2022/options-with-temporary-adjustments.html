<p>The table lists the Countryside Stewardship (<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>) and Environmental Stewardship (<abbr title="Environmental Stewardship">ES</abbr>) options that have a temporary adjustment. The current requirement is shown, together with the temporary requirement adjustment and possible use. (The requirement may differ slightly if your agreement is from 2020 onwards, so please check the wording in your agreement.)</p>

<p>The temporary adjustment also applies to those Entry Level Stewardship (<abbr title="Entry Level Stewardship">ELS</abbr>) and Organic Entry Level Stewardship (<abbr title="Organic Entry Level Stewardship">OELS</abbr>) options included in Higher Level Stewardship (<abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship]">HLS</abbr>) agreements as <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship]">HLS</abbr> options. The option codes are prefixed with an ‘H’ instead of an ‘E’ or ‘O’. For example, when EF4 Nectar flower mixture is entered into agreement as an <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship]">HLS</abbr> option, it is renamed HF4 Nectar flower mixture.</p>
