<h2>Main changes to this guidance</h2>

<p>The main changes include removing information on attendance at wraparound childcare and out-of-school settings before 8 March.</p>

<h2>Who this guidance is for</h2>

<p>This guidance is for out-of-school setting providers and their staff, who provide, for children (who were under the age of 18 on 31 August 2020):</p>

<ul>
  <li>community activities</li>
  <li>tuition</li>
  <li>holiday clubs</li>
  <li>breakfast and after-school clubs for children</li>
</ul>

<p>It applies to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providers that fall within the government’s definition of an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-out-of-school-settings-code-of-practice/keeping-children-safe-during-community-activities-after-school-clubs-and-tuition-non-statutory-guidance-for-providers-running-out-of-school-settings" class="govuk-link">out-of-school setting</a>
</li>
  <li>providers caring for children aged 5 and over and registered with Ofsted on either the compulsory or voluntary childcare register</li>
  <li>schools or colleges that offer extra-curricular activities or provision for children before and after school, during weekends or outside of term-time</li>
</ul>

<p>Providers that offer breakfast, after-school clubs or extra-curricular activities in schools, should also refer to the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Actions for schools during the coronavirus outbreak</a>.</p>

<p>Registered early years providers caring for children under the age of 5 should refer to the guidance for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures#who-this-guidance-is-for">early years and childcare providers during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak</a>.</p>

<p>Providers of youth services and activities should refer to the <a rel="external" href="https://nya.org.uk/guidance/" class="govuk-link">National Youth Agency’s guidance for managing youth sector spaces and activities during COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>There is separate guidance available for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-parents-and-carers-of-children-attending-out-of-school-settings-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak" class="govuk-link">parents and carers of children attending out-of-school settings during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak</a>.</p>

<h2>Venue-specific guidance</h2>

<p>If your out-of-school setting takes place in one of the following premises, you should also follow:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-the-safe-use-of-places-of-worship-during-the-pandemic-from-4-july" class="govuk-link">guidance for places of worship</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-the-safe-use-of-multi-purpose-community-facilities/covid-19-guidance-for-the-safe-use-of-multi-purpose-community-facilities">guidance for community centres, village halls and other multi-purpose community facilities</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/providers-of-grassroots-sport-and-gym-leisure-facilities" class="govuk-link">guidance for providers of grassroots sport and leisure facilities</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak" class="govuk-link">actions for schools during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/homes">guidance on working safely during coronavirus in other people’s homes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Providers operating out of these premises should work with the relevant parties (for example, the owner or voluntary management committee) to agree on and distribute responsibility for protective measures to help prevent the transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19). Read <a href="#risk-assessment" class="govuk-link">carrying out a risk assessment</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>About this guidance</h3>

<p>Out-of-school settings can continue to open for indoor and outdoor provision. They should follow the protective measures set out in this guidance.</p>

<p>Evidence continues to confirm that children can be susceptible to coronavirus (COVID-19) infection although a range of analyses suggest that children’s susceptibility to infection appears less than adults. The evidence is stronger that pre-school and primary aged children are less susceptible to infection than adults and more mixed for secondary-age and older children.</p>

<p>We know that the new variant of coronavirus (COVID-19) prevalent in the UK is more transmissible, which means it remains very important to follow the all the measures in this guidance carefully, especially the system of controls in the <a class="govuk-link" href="##infection-protection-control">infection, protection and control section</a>. We have also recommended additional precautionary measures, where applicable, throughout this guidance to further reduce the risk of transmission.</p>

<h2>Who can attend your setting</h2>

<p>As of 8 March, out-of-school settings and wraparound childcare providers can now offer face-to-face indoor and outdoor provision to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vulnerable children and young people, under any circumstance</li>
  <li>all other children, where the provision is one of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>reasonably necessary to enable their parents and carers to work, search for work, undertake education or training, or attend a medical appointment or address a medical need, or attend a support group</li>
      <li>being used by electively home educating parents as part of their arrangements for their child to receive a suitable full-time education</li>
      <li>being used as part of their efforts to obtain a regulated qualification, meet the entry requirements for an education institution, or to undertake exams and assessments</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>From 29 March, as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021">COVID-19 response – spring 2021 guidance</a>, and in line with when schools close for the Easter holidays, out-of-school settings and wraparound providers will be able to offer the following provision.</p>

<p>Outdoor provision to all children, without restrictions on the purpose for which they may attend.</p>

<p>Indoor provision to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vulnerable children and young people, under any circumstance</li>
  <li>children on free school meals, where they are attending as part of the Department for Education’s holiday activities and food programme</li>
  <li>all other children, where the provision is one of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>reasonably necessary to enable their parents and carers to work, search for work, undertake education or training, or attend a medical appointment or address a medical need, or attend a support group</li>
      <li>being used by electively home educating parents as part of their arrangements for their child to receive a suitable full-time education</li>
      <li>being used as part of their efforts to obtain a regulated qualification, meet the entry requirements for an education institution, or to undertake exams and assessments</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Where school terms and holiday dates can vary between different areas, you should check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/school-term-holiday-dates">school term and holiday dates</a> in your local authority to find out when the majority of schools will be closed over Easter, to ensure you are minimising mixing of different children, when children are also attending school.</p>

<p>The government’s intention is then for out-of-school settings and wraparound childcare providers to be able offer provision to all children, without restriction on the reasons for which they may attend, from the start of the school summer term. This will be no earlier than 12 April, and will be confirmed as part of step 2 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021">COVID-19 response - spring 2021</a>.</p>

<p>We will amend the relevant regulations to allow for each of these easements to take place.</p>

<p>You should note that some premises are only permitted to open for certain exempt activities. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home#businesses-and-venues-which-can-remain-open" class="govuk-link">National lockdown: stay at home guidance</a> provides a list of businesses and venues which must close, and those that can open for certain purposes, including registered childcare and supervised activities for children or, where applicable, for education or training.</p>

<p>Children should be encouraged to attend settings close to where they live or go to school. This should, ideally, be within walking or cycling distance.</p>

<p>Children deemed clinically extremely vulnerable are advised not to attend out-of-school settings while shielding advice applies nationally. The Department of Health and Social Care has published updated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">guidance on shielding and protecting people who are clinically extremely vulnerable from COVID-19</a>.</p>

<h2>Home education</h2>

<p>Where a child who is electively home educated takes part in an out-of-school setting, this guidance will apply. This is the case regardless of whether the setting is attended solely by children who are electively home educated or a combination of children attending school and children being home educated.</p>

<p>All children returning to school, children who are electively home educated can attend out-of-school settings, where the provision is being used by electively home educating parents, as part of their arrangements for their child to receive a suitable full-time education; and can also use these settings for a limited set of other essential purposes. For example, where the provision is being used to support parents to work, seek work, undertake education or training, attend a medical appointment or address a medical need, or to attend a support group.</p>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="#who-can-attend">who can attend your setting</a> for more detail. This section also provides more information on which children and young people can attend out-of-school settings, and for which purposes, during the Easter holidays (from 29 March) and from the start of the summer term (no earlier than 12 April).</p>

<h2>Staff and workforce</h2>

<p>You should ensure you have enough staff available to meet the required ratios for your setting. You should have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at least one person with first aid training</li>
  <li>at least one person with up-to-date Designated Safeguarding Lead (<abbr title="Designated Safeguarding Lead">DSL</abbr>) training - you may want to consider a deputy <abbr title="Designated Safeguarding Lead">DSL</abbr> to cover if the <abbr title="Designated Safeguarding Lead">DSL</abbr> is unavailable</li>
  <li>a caretaker or cleaning staff if available</li>
</ul>

<p>If appointing a person to cover these roles, you should carry out the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-out-of-school-settings-code-of-practice/keeping-children-safe-during-community-activities-after-school-clubs-and-tuition-non-statutory-guidance-for-providers-running-out-of-school-settings#section-3-suitability-of-staff-and-volunteers">appropriate pre-employment checks</a> to assess their suitability to work with children.</p>

<p>You should ensure that new staff members and volunteers follow the protective measures you have in place to help prevent the transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<h3>Staff who are clinically extremely vulnerable</h3>

<p>Staff who are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19#cev" class="govuk-link">clinically extremely vulnerable</a> (<abbr title="clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr>) are advised not to attend the workplace and should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19#work" class="govuk-link">guidance on shielding and protecting people who are clinically extremely vulnerable from COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>Those living with someone who is <abbr title="clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr> can still attend work where home working is not possible, but should ensure they maintain good prevention practice in the workplace and home settings.</p>

<p>The shielding guidance is reviewed regularly. <abbr title="clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr> individuals will be advised in advance of any extension or end date to inform them of changes or continuation of the guidance.</p>

<p><abbr title="clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr> individuals (over 18) have been prioritised for vaccination in phase 1 before the general population and in line with the priority ordering set by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.</p>

<p>Current DHSC guidance, informed by PHE, currently advises that <abbr title="clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr> individuals should continue to shield even after they have been vaccinated. This may change as we get further data on the effects of vaccination.</p>

<h3>Staff who are clinically vulnerable</h3>

<p>Clinically vulnerable staff can continue to attend the setting where it is not possible to work from home. They should practise good hand and respiratory hygiene, minimise contact and maintain social distancing.</p>

<p>Those living with someone who is clinically vulnerable can attend the workplace but should ensure they maintain good prevention practice in the workplace and in home settings.</p>

<h3>Pregnancy</h3>

<p>You will need to follow the specific <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-pregnant-employees/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-pregnant-employees" class="govuk-link">guidance for pregnant employees</a> because pregnant women are considered clinically vulnerable. In some cases pregnant women may also have other health conditions that mean they are considered <abbr title="clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr>, where the advice for clinically extremely vulnerable individuals will apply. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccination-women-of-childbearing-age-currently-pregnant-planning-a-pregnancy-or-breastfeeding/covid-19-vaccination-a-guide-for-women-of-childbearing-age-pregnant-planning-a-pregnancy-or-breastfeeding" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 vaccination: a guide for women of childbearing age, pregnant or breastfeeding</a> contains vaccination advice.</p>

<p>Your workplace risk assessment should already consider any risks to female employees of childbearing age and, in particular, risks to new and expectant mothers. If you are notified that an employee is pregnant, breastfeeding, or has given birth within the last 6 months, you should check the workplace risk assessment to see if any new risks have arisen. An assessment may help identify any additional action that needs to be taken to mitigate risks.</p>

<p>Any risks identified at that point, or later during the pregnancy, in the first 6 months after birth, or while the employee is still breastfeeding, must be included and managed as part of the general workplace risk assessment. You must take appropriate sensible action to reduce, remove or control the risks.</p>

<p>As part of your risk assessment, you should consider whether adapting duties and/or facilitating home working may be appropriate to mitigate risks.</p>

<p>You should be aware that pregnant women from 28 weeks’ gestation, or with underlying health conditions at any point of gestation, may be at greater risk of severe illness if they catch coronavirus (COVID-19). This is also the case for pregnant women with underlying health conditions that place them at greater risk of severe illness if they catch coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<h3>Staff who may otherwise be at increased risk from coronavirus (COVID-19)</h3>

<p>Current evidence shows that a range of factors mean that some people may be at comparatively increased risk from coronavirus (COVID-19). Where it is not possible to work from home, these staff can attend your setting as long as the system of controls set out in this guidance are in place. You should continue with an equitable approach to risk management for your workforce, recognising that staff may have a variety of baseline risks. Work continues to build our understanding of what these baseline factors are and the increased risks they pose.</p>

<p>There is further information available on <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/people-at-higher-risk/">who is at higher risk from coronavirus</a>. Staff who live with those who may have comparatively increased risk from coronavirus (COVID-19) can attend the workplace where it is not possible to work from home.</p>

<h2>Carrying out a risk assessment</h2>

<p>There are important actions that you should take during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, to help prevent the transmission of the virus.</p>

<p>Employers have a legal duty to protect people from harm. This includes taking reasonable steps to protect staff, children and others attending your setting from coronavirus (COVID-19). You must comply with health and safety law.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend that you consult advice set out by the <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/index.htm" class="govuk-link">Health and Safety Executive on coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm" class="govuk-link">managing risks and risk assessment at work</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/l74.htm">first aid at work</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/first-aid-and-medicals/first-aid-certificate-coronavirus.htm" rel="external" class="govuk-link">first aid cover and qualifications during the coronavirus pandemic</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As part of your risk assessment, you should identify protective measures to put in place, such as those listed in the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19">working safely during coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>. If you work in other’s people homes, for example as a private tutor, you should follow the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/homes" class="govuk-link">Other people’s homes - working safely during coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>.</p>

<p>You should also look at other disease transmission risks, such as the tendency for older children to mix with other community groups outside your setting or when using public transport to attend your setting.</p>

<p>In most cases, risk assessments and preparation for reopening or wider opening of out-of-school settings should be carried out by a senior member of staff. However, you should also work with other relevant parties, such as your staff members, the owner of the premises where your provision is being held, and your local authority, to identify the risks and determine protective measures to put in place. You will need to establish who is responsible for implementing each protective measure.</p>

<p>You should regularly review and update your risk assessments – treating them as ‘living documents’ – as the circumstances at your setting and the public health advice changes. This will be particularly relevant at each point you prepare to welcome back more children.</p>

<p>You should share any significant findings of the risk assessment with your staff and on your website if you have one.</p>

<p>You should, as a minimum, be able to explain to parents and carers the steps you are taking to reduce the health and safety risks in your setting and outline the protective measures you have in place. If parents and carers need to be aware of the protective measures put in place by the owner of the premises that you are operating out of, you should outline these to them or direct them to the relevant website.</p>

<h2>Considering group sizes</h2>

<p>Decisions on group sizes for your setting should be based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the current government guidance on social distancing</li>
  <li>the ability of the children in attendance to maintain social distancing and practise hand hygiene</li>
  <li>the age of the children in attendance</li>
  <li>nature of your activity or provision (for example, static, classroom set-up rather than an activity that requires a range of movement)</li>
  <li>the size or layout of your premises</li>
  <li>the ability to ventilate your premises effectively with fresh air</li>
</ul>

<p>You should aim to minimise the number of different people each member of staff and child comes into contact with. Where possible, you should work with parents and carers, schools and early years settings to ensure that children are kept in a group with children from the same bubble they are in during the school day. For more information, read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak">actions for schools during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak</a>.</p>

<p>Where it is not possible to group children in the same bubble as they are in during the school day – for example, if you only have one or two children attending your provision from the same school day bubble, you may need to group them with other children from outside their school day bubble.</p>

<p>Where it is not possible to group children in the same bubble as they are in during the school day, you should try to keep them in small groups of no more than 15 children and at least one staff member, with the same children each time they attend, as far as possible. You should also ensure any children from the same school are kept together. You should only group children from different schools together where it is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Where it is not possible to follow school day bubbles, you should also work with parents and carers to try and keep siblings together. This will help minimise the amount of mixing between different households and contacts.</p>

<p>Frequently review these groups to minimise the amount of ‘mixing’. For example, when new children register for your provision, you should determine whether they attend the same school or early years setting as other children in your setting and group them together if appropriate.</p>

<p>To help you review your groups, you should keep up-to-date records of the children attending your setting for at least 21 days. These records should include the school or early years setting that they attend and the specific groups and members of staff they have been assigned to in your setting.</p>

<p>There may be instances where you cannot keep consistent groups, or you need to have groups of less than 15, because of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the premises not being large enough to ensure social distancing between groups</li>
  <li>the premises having insufficient safe ventilation capacity</li>
  <li>varying booking patterns</li>
  <li>additional bookings throughout the term and during school holidays</li>
  <li>safeguarding or welfare concerns</li>
  <li>children of different ages attending</li>
  <li>the ‘drop in’ nature of some services and activities, for example support groups for vulnerable young people</li>
</ul>

<p>Any decisions should be taken with full consideration of any welfare needs and safeguarding concerns.</p>

<h3>Operating with multiple groups</h3>

<p>When operating provision for multiple groups of children throughout the day, you should allow enough changeover time in between groups for cleaning, and to prevent children and parents or carers waiting in large groups.
Multiple groups of 15 children plus staff can use the same shared space if necessary, with distancing between the groups and adequate ventilation. Although, different groups sharing the same space should be avoided where possible.</p>

<h3>Group sizes for children under 5</h3>

<p>Providers caring for children:</p>

<ul>
  <li>under 5 only should refer to the guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures#who-this-guidance-is-for" class="govuk-link">early years and childcare providers during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak</a>
</li>
  <li>both under 5 and aged 5 and over, in mixed groups together should follow this guidance and keep children in small consistent groups, of no more than 15, where possible</li>
  <li>over 5 should follow this guidance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Indoor provision</h2>

<p>If you normally run sessions indoors, you should consider whether you can run them safely outside instead, as the risk of transmission is lower outdoors.</p>

<p>If you operate in a shared space, you should also discuss the infection protection and control measures outlined in the following section with the owner of the space. The owners of these shared spaces must continue to meet all existing health and safety obligations to ensure that their premises are safe for providers to hire and to operate from.</p>

<h2>System of controls: Infection protection and control</h2>

<p>In this section, where something is essential for public health reasons, as advised by Public Health England (PHE), we have said ‘must’. Where there is a legal requirement we have made that clear. This guidance does not create any new legal obligations.</p>

<p>This is the set of actions you must take. They are grouped into ‘prevention’ and ‘response to any infection’.
If you follow the system of controls, you will effectively reduce risks in your setting and create an inherently safer environment.</p>

<p>These additional measures will be reviewed in partnership with health experts to decide whether evidence suggests that these measures can be eased ahead of the summer.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Prevention</h3>

<p>Providers (including their staff where applicable) must always:</p>

<p>1) Minimise contact with individuals who are required to self-isolate by ensuring they do not attend your setting.</p>

<p>2) Ensure face coverings are used in recommended circumstances.</p>

<p>3) Ensure everyone is advised to clean their hands thoroughly and more often than usual.</p>

<p>4) Ensure good respiratory hygiene for everyone by promoting the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach.</p>

<p>5) Maintain enhanced cleaning, including cleaning frequently touched surfaces often, using standard products such as detergents.</p>

<p>6) Consider how to minimise contact across the site and maintain social distancing wherever possible.</p>

<p>7) Keep occupied spaces well ventilated.</p>

<p>In specific circumstances:</p>

<p>8) Ensure individuals wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) where necessary.</p>

<p>9) Promote and engage in asymptomatic testing, where available.</p>

<h3>Response to any infection</h3>

<p>Providers (including their staff where applicable) must always:</p>

<p>10)  Promote and engage with the NHS Test and Trace process.</p>

<p>11) Manage and report confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) amongst the setting community.</p>

<p>12) Contain any outbreak by following local health protection team advice.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Minimise contact with individuals who are required to self-isolate by ensuring they do not attend your setting</h3>

<h4>When an individual develops coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms or has a positive test</h4>

<p>Children and young people, staff and other adults must not come into your setting if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they have one or more <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works#part-1-people-who-develop-symptoms-of-coronavirus" class="govuk-link">coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms</a>
</li>
  <li>a member of their household (including someone in their <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household" class="govuk-link">support bubble</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-childcare-bubble-with-another-household" class="govuk-link">childcare bubble</a>, if they have one) has coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms</li>
  <li>they are required to quarantine having recently visited countries outside the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control/self-isolating-when-you-arrive" class="govuk-link">common travel area</a>
</li>
  <li>they have had a positive test</li>
</ul>

<p>They must immediately cease to attend and not attend for at least 10 days from the day after:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the start of their symptoms</li>
  <li>the test date if they did not have any symptoms but have had a positive test - whether this was a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#tests-for-covid-19">lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) or polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) test</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You must follow this process and ensure everyone onsite or visiting is aware of it.</p>

<p>Anyone told to isolate by NHS Test and Trace or by their public health protection team, has a legal obligation to self-isolate, but you may leave home to avoid injury or illness or to escape risk of harm. More information can be found on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works">NHS Test and Trace: how it works</a>.</p>

<p>If anyone in your setting develops a new and continuous cough or a high temperature, or has a loss of, or change in, their normal sense of taste or smell (anosmia), you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>must send them home to begin isolation - the isolation period includes the day the symptoms started and the next 10 full days</li>
  <li>advise them to follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">guidance for households with possible or confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) infection</a>
</li>
  <li>advise them to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested" class="govuk-link">arrange to have a test</a> to see if they have coronavirus (COVID-19)</li>
</ul>

<p>Other members of their household (including any siblings and members of their support or childcare bubble if they have one) should self-isolate. Their isolation period includes the day symptoms started for the first person in their household, or the day their test was taken if they did not have symptoms, whether this was a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#tests-for-covid-190" class="govuk-link">lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) or polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) test</a>, and the next 10 full days. If a member of the household starts to display symptoms while self-isolating, they will need to restart the 10-day isolation period and book a test.</p>

<p>If a child in your setting displays symptoms and is awaiting collection, they should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>move to a well-ventilated room, if possible, where they can be isolated behind a closed door, depending on the age of the child and with appropriate adult supervision - a window should also be opened for ventilation if it is safe to do so</li>
  <li>stay at least 2 metres away from other people</li>
  <li>use a separate bathroom if possible, which must be cleaned and disinfected using standard cleaning products before being used by anyone else</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be worn by staff caring for the child while they await collection if a distance of 2 metres cannot be maintained.</p>

<p>In an emergency, call 999 if someone is seriously ill or injured or their life is at risk. Anyone with coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms should not visit the GP, pharmacy, urgent care centre or a hospital, unless advised to.
Further information is available on how to <a href="#manage-confirmed-cases" class="govuk-link">manage and report confirmed cases</a> of coronavirus (COVID-19) amongst the out-of-school settings community.</p>

<h4>When an individual has had close contact with someone with coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms</h4>

<p>Any member of staff who has provided close contact care to someone with symptoms, regardless of whether they are wearing <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, and all other members of staff or children who have been in close contact with that person, do not need to go home to self-isolate unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the symptomatic person subsequently tests positive</li>
  <li>they develop symptoms themselves (in which case, they should self-isolate immediately and arrange to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested" class="govuk-link">have a test</a>)</li>
  <li>they are requested to do so by NHS Test and Trace or the Public Health England (PHE) advice service (or PHE local health protection team if escalated)</li>
  <li>they have tested positive from an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test as part of a community or worker programme</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone must wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds with soap and running water or use hand sanitiser after any contact with someone who has symptoms. The area around the person with symptoms must be cleaned after they have left, to reduce the risk of passing the infection on to other people. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">COVID-19: cleaning of non-healthcare settings guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Ensure face coverings are used in recommended circumstances</h3>

<p>Where children in year 7 and above, or equivalent age (which would be children who were aged 11 on 31 August 2020) are educated, we recommend that face coverings should be worn by adults and children when moving around the premises, outside of classrooms, such as in corridors and communal areas where social distancing cannot easily be maintained. Face coverings do not need to be worn by children when outdoors on the premises.</p>

<p>In addition, we now also recommend in those settings, that face coverings should be worn in classrooms or during activities unless social distancing can be maintained. This does not apply in situations where wearing a face covering would impact on the ability to take part in exercise or strenuous activity, for example during sports.</p>

<p>Where children in primary schools or of equivalent age (which would be children were aged under 11 on 31 August 2020) are educated, we recommend that face coverings should be worn by staff and adult visitors in settings in situations where social distancing between adults is not possible (for example, when moving around in corridors and communal areas). Children in primary school  (or of equivalent age) should not wear face coverings.</p>

<p>We are taking this additional precautionary measure for a limited time during this period of high coronavirus (COVID-19) prevalence in the community. These measures will be in place until Easter. As with all measures, we will keep it under review and update guidance at that point.</p>

<p>Transparent face coverings which may assist communication with someone who relies on lip reading, clear sound or facial expression to communicate can also be worn. Their use needs to be carefully assessed because they may not provide others with protection from the wearer (source control) but they are more likely to be effective in reducing the spread of coronavirus than not wearing a face covering at all. There is currently very limited evidence regarding the effectiveness or safety of transparent face coverings.</p>

<p>Those who rely on visual signals for communication, or provide support to such individuals, are currently exempt from any requirement to wear face coverings in schools or in public places.</p>

<p>Face visors or shields should not routinely be worn as an alternative to face coverings. They may protect against droplet spread in specific circumstances but are unlikely to be effective in reducing aerosol transmission. They should only be used after carrying out a risk assessment for the specific situation and should always be cleaned appropriately.</p>

<h4>Exemptions</h4>

<p>Some individuals are exempt from wearing <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">face coverings</a>. This applies to those who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cannot put on, wear or remove a face covering because of a physical impairment or disability, illness or mental health difficulties</li>
  <li>speak to or provide help to someone who relies on lip reading, clear sound or facial expression to communicate</li>
</ul>

<p>The same exemptions will apply in education and childcare settings and you should be sensitive to those needs, noting that some people are less able to wear face coverings and that the reasons for this may not be visible to others.</p>

<h4>Access to face coverings</h4>

<p>Due to the increasing use of face coverings in wider society, staff and children and young people are already likely to have access to face coverings. PHE has also published guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-wear-and-make-a-cloth-face-covering/how-to-wear-and-make-a-cloth-face-covering">how to make a simple face covering</a>.
You should have a small contingency supply available for people who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are struggling to access a face covering</li>
  <li>are unable to use their face covering as it has become damp, soiled or unsafe</li>
  <li>have forgotten their face covering</li>
</ul>

<h4>Safe wearing and removal of face coverings</h4>

<p>You should have a process for when face coverings are worn within your setting and how they should be removed. You should communicate this process clearly to children and young people, staff and visitors and allow for adjustments to be made for children and young people with SEND who may be distressed if required to remove a face covering against their wishes. Safe wearing of face coverings requires the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cleaning of hands before and after touching – including to remove or put them on</li>
  <li>safe storage of them in individual, sealable plastic bags between use</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a face covering becomes damp, it should not be worn, and the face covering should be replaced carefully. Staff and children and young people may consider bringing a spare face covering to wear if their face covering becomes damp during the day.</p>

<p>You must instruct children and young people to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not touch the front of their face covering during use or when removing it</li>
  <li>dispose of temporary face coverings in a ‘black bag’ waste bin (not recycling bin)</li>
  <li>place reusable face coverings in a plastic bag they can take home with them</li>
  <li>wash their hands again before heading to their classroom or activity room</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Ensure everyone is advised to clean their hands thoroughly and more often than usual</h3>

<p>Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an easy virus to kill when it is on skin. This can be done with soap and water or hand sanitiser. You must ensure that children clean their hands regularly, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when they arrive at your setting</li>
  <li>when they return from breaks</li>
  <li>when they change rooms</li>
  <li>before and after eating</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider how often children and staff will need to wash their hands and incorporate time in for this. Staff working with children who spit uncontrollably may want more opportunities to wash their hands than other staff. Children who use saliva as a sensory stimulant or who struggle with ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ may also need more opportunities to wash their hands.</p>

<p>Continue to help children with complex needs to clean their hands properly.</p>

<p>Frequent and thorough hand cleaning should now be regular practice. You should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether you have enough hand washing or hand sanitiser stations available so that all children and staff can clean their hands regularly</li>
  <li>if you need to supervise hand sanitiser use given the risks around ingestion – skin friendly skin cleaning wipes can be used as an alternative</li>
  <li>building these routines into your setting’s culture, supported by behaviour expectations and helping ensure younger pupils and those with complex needs understand the need to follow them</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Ensure good respiratory hygiene for everyone by promoting the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach</h3>

<p>The ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach continues to be very important. Make sure enough tissues and bins are available to support children and staff to follow this routine. As with hand cleaning, you must ensure younger children and those with complex needs are helped to get this right, and all pupils understand that this is now part of how the setting operates. The <a rel="external" href="https://e-bug.eu/eng_home.aspx?cc=eng&amp;ss=1&amp;t=Information%20about%20the%20Coronavirus" class="govuk-link">e-Bug coronavirus (COVID-19) website</a> contains free resources for schools, including materials to encourage good hand and respiratory hygiene.</p>

<p>Some children with complex needs will struggle to maintain as good respiratory hygiene as their peers, for example those who spit uncontrollably or use saliva as a sensory stimulant. This should be considered in risk assessments in order to support these children and the staff working with them and is not a reason to deny these children a place at your setting.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5. </span> Maintain enhanced cleaning, including cleaning frequently touched surfaces often, using standard products, such as detergents</h3>

<p>In line with the risk assessment and timetabling of activities in your setting, put in place and maintain an enhanced cleaning schedule. This should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>more frequent cleaning of rooms or shared areas that are used by different groups</li>
  <li>frequently touched surfaces being cleaned more often than normal</li>
  <li>cleaning toilets regularly</li>
  <li>encouraging children to wash their hands thoroughly after using the toilet</li>
  <li>if your site allows it, allocating different groups their own toilet blocks</li>
</ul>

<p>PHE has published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">guidance for cleaning non-healthcare settings</a>. This contains advice on the general cleaning required in addition to the existing advice on cleaning when there is a suspected case.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6. </span> Consider how to minimise contact and maintain social distancing across the site wherever possible</h3>

<p>Minimising contacts and mixing between people reduces transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19). This is important in all contexts, and you must consider how to implement this.</p>

<p>The overarching principle to apply is reducing the number of contacts between children and staff. This can be achieved through keeping groups separate and consistent - read the section <a href="#considering-group-sizes" class="govuk-link">considering group sizes</a> - and through maintaining distance between individuals.</p>

<p>You should encourage children and young people to maintain social distancing as far as possible. This should also be observed by staff members and parents and carers at pick up and drop off.</p>

<p>Staff members and children and young people within the setting, should also maintain <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing#social-distancing" class="govuk-link">social distancing</a> as far as possible.</p>

<p>There will be some situations where social distancing is not possible, for example between younger children or in outdoor sports and activities. Therefore it is important that the other protective measures outlined in this guidance are implemented.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7. </span> Keep occupied spaces well ventilated</h3>

<p>Good ventilation reduces the concentration of the virus in the air, which reduces the risks from airborne transmission. This happens when people breathe in small particles (aerosols) in the air after someone with the virus has occupied an enclosed area.</p>

<p>When your setting is in operation, it is important to ensure it is well ventilated and a comfortable childcare or teaching environment is maintained. These can be achieved by a variety of measures including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mechanical ventilation systems – these should be adjusted to increase the ventilation rate wherever possible, and checked to confirm that normal operation meets current guidance and that only fresh outside air is circulated. If possible, systems should be adjusted to full fresh air or, if not, then systems should be operated as normal as long as they are within a single room and supplemented by an outdoor air supply)</li>
  <li>natural ventilation – opening windows (in cooler weather windows should be opened just enough to provide constant background ventilation, and opened more fully during breaks to purge the air in the space). Opening internal doors can also assist with creating a throughput of air</li>
  <li>natural ventilation – if necessary external opening doors may also be used (as long as they are not fire doors and where safe to do so)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Health and Safety Executive <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation.htm" rel="external">guidance on air conditioning and ventilation during the coronavirus outbreak</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.cibse.org/coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">CIBSE Coronavirus (COVID-19) Advice</a> provides more information.</p>

<p>To balance the need for increased ventilation while maintaining a comfortable temperature, consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>opening high level windows in colder weather in preference to low level to reduce draughts</li>
  <li>increasing the ventilation while spaces are unoccupied</li>
  <li>providing flexibility to allow additional, suitable indoor clothing</li>
  <li>rearranging furniture where possible to avoid direct draughts</li>
</ul>

<p>Heating should be used as necessary to ensure comfort levels are maintained particularly in occupied spaces.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8. </span> Ensure individuals wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) where necessary</h3>

<p>Most staff in out-of-school settings will not require <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> beyond what they would normally need for their work. Face coverings are not classified as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control"><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> (personal protective equipment)</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is only needed in a very small number of cases, for example:</p>

<ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">9. </span> Promote and engage in asymptomatic testing, where available</h3>

<p>Asymptomatic testing will help to break the chains of transmission of coronavirus in education and childcare settings by identifying asymptomatic positive cases. This is important as up to one in three people who have the virus have it without symptoms (they are asymptomatic) so could be spreading the disease unknowingly. Staff who test positive then self-isolate, helping to reduce transmission of the virus.</p>

<p>Primary, school-based nursery and maintained nursery staff have been supplied with lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) test kits to self-swab.</p>

<p>For secondary schools we are moving to a home testing model.  The lateral flow devices used have received regulatory approval from the MHRA for self-use. Home test kits will be available for all staff on return.</p>

<p>More information can be found in:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>The asymptomatic testing programme in education will also expand to staff in all private, voluntary and independent (<abbr title="private, voluntary and independent">PVI</abbr>) nurseries, who will start to receive deliveries of lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) home testing kits to offer to all their staff for twice weekly testing.</p>

<p>If operating on, or linked to, a school, including maintained nursery sites, then you should discuss with that school or nursery how your staff can access regular asymptomatic testing. Schools and nurseries should offer testing to all staff who are working in their settings including contractors or peripatetic staff. They should also offer testing to those supporting with wraparound childcare to children currently attending school, as well as other staff members such as clinical practitioners, therapists, other support staff, caterers and volunteers.</p>

<p>Staff working in wraparound childcare, as critical workers, are also being prioritised for asymptomatic testing through local community testing programmes - more information is available at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-covid-19-lateral-flow-test-site" class="govuk-link">Find out if your area offers rapid lateral flow test sites</a>.</p>

<p>The asymptomatic testing programme does not replace the current testing policy for those with symptoms. Anyone with symptoms (even if they recently had a negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result), should still self-isolate immediately according to government guidelines and get a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>System of controls - response to any infection</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">10. </span> Promote and engage with the NHS Test and Trace process</h3>

<p>The NHS Test and Trace service will help to manage the risk of the virus re-emerging as restrictions on everyday life are eased.</p>

<p>Anyone contacted by NHS Test and Trace and told to self-isolate has a legal obligation to do so, but they may leave home, to avoid injury or illness or to escape risk of harm. More information can be found on NHS Test and Trace: how it works.</p>

<p>Staff members, parents and carers will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested" class="govuk-link">book a test</a> if they or their child has symptoms - the main symptoms are:
    <ul>
      <li>a high temperature</li>
      <li>a new continuous cough</li>
      <li>a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">self-isolate</a> immediately and not come to your setting if:
    <ul>
      <li>they develop symptoms</li>
      <li>they have been in close contact with someone who tests positive for coronavirus (COVID-19)</li>
      <li>anyone in their household or support or childcare bubble develops symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19)</li>
      <li>they are required to do so having recently travelled from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control/self-isolating-when-you-arrive" class="govuk-link">certain other countries</a>
</li>
      <li>they have been advised to isolate by NHS test and trace or the PHE local health protection team</li>
      <li>provide details of anyone they have been in close contact with, if they test positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) or if asked by NHS Test and Trace</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Polymerase chain reaction tests (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) for symptomatic testing</h4>

<p>Anyone who displays symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) can and should get a test. Tests for symptomatic illness can be booked online through the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/" class="govuk-link">NHS testing and tracing for coronavirus (COVID-19) website</a>, or ordered by telephone via NHS 119 for those without access to the internet.</p>

<p>Essential workers, which includes anyone involved in education or childcare, have priority access to testing. 
All children and young people can be tested if they have symptoms. This includes children under 5, but children aged 11 and under will need to be helped by their parents or carers if using a home testing kit.</p>

<h4>Use of the NHS COVID-19 app</h4>

<p>Please refer to the guidance on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/use-of-the-nhs-covid-19-app-in-schools-and-further-education-colleges/use-of-the-nhs-covid-19-app-in-schools-and-further-education-colleges">use of the app in schools and further education colleges</a> for more information. The app is available to download for anyone aged 16 and over.</p>

<h4>Test and Trace support payments</h4>

<p>Individuals who are self-isolating and are unable to work from home may lose income as a result. These individuals may be entitled to a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme-claiming-financial-support/claiming-financial-support-under-the-test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme" class="govuk-link">Test and Trace support payment</a> of £500, payable as a lump sum from local authorities.</p>

<p>To be eligible for a Test and Trace support payment, the individual must be living in England, meet the eligibility criteria and be formally advised to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace, who will provide them with an NHS Test and Trace Account ID.</p>

<p>More information about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/test-and-trace-support-payment" class="govuk-link">applying for a Test and Trace Support Payment</a> is available.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11. </span> Manage confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) amongst the setting community</h3>

<p>You must take swift action when you become aware that someone who has attended has tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>If they test positive, NHS Test and Trace will speak directly to those they have been in contact with. This may mean that the rest of their group or bubble will be required to self-isolate. If this is the case, they will be advised to self-isolate immediately and for the next 10 full days counting from the day after contact with the individual who tested positive.</p>

<p>To support NHS Test and Trace in reaching close contacts, you should keep a record of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>close contact between children and staff in specific groups or rooms</li>
  <li>the timing of the activities and interactions</li>
</ul>

<p>Records should be kept for 21 days.</p>

<p>You should also  inform your local authority of a positive case in your setting. Where more detailed local arrangements are in place with the local authority, and are working, your setting can continue to receive support through that route to take action in response to a positive case.</p>

<p>Household members of those contacts who are sent home do not need to self-isolate themselves unless the pupil or staff member who is self-isolating subsequently develops symptoms, or they have been told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace, in which case they must self-isolate. If someone in a class or group that has been asked to self-isolate develops symptoms themselves within the 10 days from the day after contact with the individual who tested positive, they should follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">guidance for households with possible or confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) infection</a>.</p>

<p>You should not request evidence of negative test results or other medical evidence before admitting children or welcoming them back after a period of self-isolation.</p>

<p>If a child, young person or staff member develops coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms but tests negative, they can return to your setting. If they remain unwell, they should not return until they have recovered.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12. </span> Contain any outbreak by following PHE local health protection team advice</h3>

<p>If you have 2 or more confirmed cases within 14 days, or an overall rise in sickness absence where coronavirus (COVID-19) is suspected, you may have an outbreak.</p>

<p>You should work with your local health protection team who will be able to advise if additional action is required.</p>

<p>In some cases, health protection teams may recommend that a larger number of other children self-isolate at home as a precautionary measure. This could be the whole site or bubble.</p>

<p>If you are implementing the protective measures in this guidance, addressing any issues you have identified and therefore reducing transmission risks, whole site closure will not generally be necessary. You should not consider closing except on the advice of health protection teams.</p>

<h2>Safety measures for activities in out-of-school settings</h2>

<h3>Sports provision</h3>

<p>From 8 March, all children can access indoor and outdoor sports provision, where it is being used for the purposes of supporting their parents to work, seek work, undertake education or training, attend a medical appointment or address a medical need, or to attend a support group; and for other limited purposes. Vulnerable children can access this provision under any circumstance.</p>

<p>From 29 March, as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021">COVID-19 response – spring 2021 guidance</a>, all outdoor sports provision will be able to be accessed by all children without restriction on the purposes for which they may attend. However, restrictions on access to indoor provision will remain. Read the section on <a href="#who-can-attend" class="govuk-link">who can attend your out-of-school setting</a>.</p>

<p>Care should be taken to maintain social distancing in a sports setting as people breathe more heavily and rapidly during exercise. Outdoor sports should be prioritised where possible, and large indoor spaces used where it is not, maximising natural ventilation flows (though opening windows and doors or using air conditioning systems wherever possible), distancing between children, and paying scrupulous attention to cleaning and hygiene.</p>

<p>Where you are considering team sports you should only engage in those sports whose national governing bodies have developed guidance under the principles of the government’s guidance on team sport, and been approved by the government, for example sports on the list available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-grassroots-sports-guidance-for-safe-provision-including-team-sport-contact-combat-sport-and-organised-sport-events">grassroots sports guidance for safe provision</a> including team sport, contact combat sport and organised sport events. Competition between different settings should not take place.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/providers-of-grassroots-sport-and-gym-leisure-facilities" class="govuk-link">providers of grassroots sport and sport facilities guidance</a> for more information. Providers of sports activities should also refer to relevant guidance from:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.sportengland.org/how-we-can-help/coronavirus" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Sport England</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.afpe.org.uk/physical-education/wp-content/uploads/COVID-19-Interpreting-the-Government-Guidance-in-a-PESSPA-Context-FINAL.pdf" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Association for Physical Education</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youthsporttrust.org/coronavirus-support" rel="external">Youth Sport Trust</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Music, dance and drama provision</h3>

<p>Teaching music, dance and drama, can be particularly valuable for supporting children’s wellbeing, and helping them to build more self-confidence.</p>

<p>Music lessons in private homes can take place, following the protective measures in this guidance, and additionally following the government <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/homes">guidance for working in homes</a>. However, there may be an additional risk of infection in environments where singing, chanting, playing wind or brass instruments, dance or drama take place. There is now some evidence that additional risk can build from aerosol transmission with volume and, in particular, with the combined numbers of individuals within a confined space. This is particularly evident for singing and shouting.</p>

<p>When planning this provision, you should therefore consider additional safety measures; and should ensure you follow the measures in this guidance and read the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/performing-arts" class="govuk-link">working safely in performing arts</a> to reduce any risks of aerosol transmission.</p>

<h4>Minimising contact between individuals</h4>

<p>You should take particular care in music, dance and drama activities to observe social distancing where possible. This may mean you need to have groups smaller than fifteen. It will also prevent physical correction by teachers and contact between children and young people in dance and drama.</p>

<p>Measures you can take to reduce the risk of transmission and infection during these activities include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>limiting the number of children singing or playing</li>
  <li>ensuring children are in groups of no more than 15</li>
  <li>making sure children are socially distanced at all times (2 metres apart), are outside or in a well-ventilated room</li>
  <li>activities which can create aerosol are discouraged, such as shouting or singing loudly</li>
  <li>keep any background or accompanying music to levels which do not encourage teachers or other performers to raise their voices unduly</li>
</ul>

<p>When children are singing or playing wind or brass instruments, you should also ensure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>children sit down where possible to help maintain social distancing</li>
  <li>back-to-back or side-to-side positioning (rather than face-to-face) is used whenever possible, to ensure for example, air from instruments does not blow on to another player</li>
  <li>use microphones where possible or encourage children to sing quietly - if possible, do not share microphones; if they are shared, follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak" class="govuk-link">guidance on handling equipment and instruments</a>
</li>
  <li>if indoors, use a room with as much space as possible, for example, larger rooms; rooms with high ceilings are expected to enable dilution of aerosol transmission</li>
  <li>limit the number of children to maintain social distancing and increase space ventilation.</li>
  <li>improve ventilation whenever possible, through the use of mechanical systems or opening windows and doors</li>
  <li>limit the length of activity as far as possible, considering the need for breaks</li>
</ul>

<p>Providers should not host performances with an audience for the duration of the national lockdown.</p>

<h2>Educational visits and trips</h2>

<p>We advise against educational visits and trips at this time. This guidance will be kept under review.</p>

<h2>Use of shared equipment</h2>

<p>Equipment and resources are integral to many different out-of-school activities. For frequently used resources, such as pens and pencils, we recommend that staff, children and young people should have their own. Classroom based resources, such as books and games, can be used and shared within groups.</p>

<p>Equipment that is shared between groups, such as sports or art equipment, should either be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cleaned frequently and in between use by different groups</li>
  <li>rotated to allow it to be left unused for 48 hours (72 hours for plastics) between use by different groups</li>
</ul>

<p>Outdoor playground equipment should be cleaned more frequently than usual, and where possible, between use by different groups of children.</p>

<p>Children and young people should only bring essential items into your setting. Bags should be allowed.</p>

<p>Children, young people and staff need not be forbidden to take books and other shared resources home, although unnecessary sharing should be avoided. The same rules on cleaning and rotation should apply to these resources.</p>

<h3>Managing toilet use</h3>

<p>When managing toilet use you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consider how to limit the number of children using the toilet at any one time</li>
  <li>encourage children to wash their hands thoroughly, with soap and water for 20 seconds, after using the toilet</li>
  <li>consider allocating groups their own toilet blocks, but only if the site allows it</li>
</ul>

<p>Toilets should be cleaned thoroughly using detergent and bleach. The frequency of cleaning required will depend on usage, however we expect toilet facilities to be cleaned at least twice a day, and in between use by different groups.</p>

<p>The guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">cleaning of non-healthcare settings outside the home</a> provides general advice about the cleaning of facilities, as well as advice for the cleaning of facilities if they have been used by someone suspected of having, or confirmed to have coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<h2>Communicating with staff and parents or carers</h2>

<p>Please ensure you read and implement the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">working safely during coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>. Talk to staff about your safety measures and discuss whether specific training would be helpful. You should also arrange regular opportunities to get feedback from staff on these safety measures.</p>

<p>If you employ cleaning staff, you should tell them about the extra cleaning requirements and agree additional hours to allow for this.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak" class="govuk-link">actions for schools during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak</a> includes information for staff that you may be able to apply to your own setting.</p>

<p>When communicating with parents and carers about safety measures, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make clear to parents and carers which children are eligible to attend for which purposes - read the section on <a href="#who-can-attend" class="govuk-link">who can attend your out-of-school setting</a>
</li>
  <li>advise parents and carers that they should be limiting their use of multiple out-of-school settings, and should as far as possible only be sending their children to one out-of-school setting, in addition to school, in order to minimise mixing</li>
  <li>encourage parents and carers to avoid public transport to get to your setting - where possible, encourage them to have their child walk or cycle to the setting, or have them dropped off by a member of their household in a private car</li>
  <li>ensure they know the process for pick-up and drop-offs, for example, which entrance to use or limiting drop off and pick up to one parent or carer per family and staggering timings</li>
</ul>

<p>Try to avoid the need for parents and carers to wait if possible, but where they have to, consider whether distancing markings can be used and make clear they cannot gather at entrance gates or doors.</p>

<h2>Safeguarding and wellbeing</h2>

<h3>Safeguarding and child protection</h3>

<p>The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak may have caused significant mental health or wellbeing difficulties for some children and they may be at increased risk of harm or abuse. Due to the current circumstances, vulnerable children may be particularly isolated, meaning that the family, community and professional networks they usually rely on may be unavailable or hard to access.</p>

<p>It is important that you and your staff are aware of safeguarding issues and the signs to look out for. Further information is available in the guidance for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-out-of-school-settings-code-of-practice/keeping-children-safe-during-community-activities-after-school-clubs-and-tuition-non-statutory-guidance-for-providers-running-out-of-school-settings#section-2-safeguarding-and-child-protection">keeping children safe during community activities, after-school clubs and tuition</a>.</p>

<h3>Supporting children and young people’s wellbeing</h3>

<p>You and your staff may also need to consider how to support:</p>

<ul>
  <li>children and young people who have found the long period at home hard to manage</li>
  <li>those who have developed anxieties relating to the coronavirus (COVID-19)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some children may have experienced bereavements in their family or wider circle of friends, or may have increased or new caring responsibilities. As part of your provision, you may wish to provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>opportunities for children to talk about their experiences of the past few months</li>
  <li>opportunities for conversations with trusted adults</li>
  <li>lessons on relevant topics, for example, mental wellbeing and staying safe</li>
</ul>

<h3>Equality</h3>

<p>It is important that you create spaces, services and opportunities that enable everyone to engage equally.</p>

<p>This may require adjustments to ensure that everyone benefits fairly. Your equality and diversity policy should be considered at all times, especially when making decisions and judgements related to the impact on individuals and groups with different protected characteristics.</p>

<p>When applying this guidance, consider the particular needs of different groups of workers and individuals. You should be aware that some parents and carers may look to holiday clubs and out-of-school settings to offer respite childcare for children with special educational needs or with an education, health and care plan (EHCP). Parents or carers of disabled children may continue to access respite care to support them in caring for their disabled child. Further information on this is available in the guidance for children’s social care services.</p>

<p>Providers are permitted to open for disabled children<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1">[footnote 1]</a></sup> who are accessing these services as a local authority funded short break or as respite care, and ensuring that provision is available and accessible to these children, as far as possible, should remain a priority in these current circumstances.</p>

<p>Local authorities will need to work with their short breaks/ respite care provider base to ensure children can attend services (and to ensure that these can operate during the school holidays, as this can be a key pressure point for families with caring responsibilities). For example, some local authorities have made more use of direct payments beyond their usual criteria.</p>

<p>It is against the law to discriminate, directly or indirectly, against anyone in employment and in the provision of services because of a protected characteristic, such as age, sex, race or disability.</p>

<p>Employers and organisations (voluntary or otherwise) also have additional responsibilities towards disabled individuals and those who are new or expectant mothers.</p>

<p>There is evidence that black, Asian and minority ethnic (<abbr title="Black, Asian and minority ethnic">BAME</abbr>) individuals may be more severely affected by coronavirus (COVID-19). You should be especially sensitive to the needs and worries of <abbr title="Black, Asian and minority ethnic">BAME</abbr> children and young people, parents and carers, and staff. Interventions in the work setting to manage risk should be carefully and appropriately communicated.</p>
