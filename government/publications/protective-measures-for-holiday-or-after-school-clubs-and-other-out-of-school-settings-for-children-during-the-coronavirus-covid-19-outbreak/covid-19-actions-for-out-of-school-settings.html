<h2>About this guidance</h2>

<p>This guidance explains the actions out-of-school settings should take to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 in their settings. This includes public health advice, endorsed by the United Kingdom Health Security Agency (<abbr title="United Kingdom Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>).</p>

<p>We use the terms ‘must’ and ‘should’ throughout the guidance. We use the term ‘must’ when the person in question is legally required to do something and ‘should’ when the advice set out should be followed unless there is good reason not to.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The government continues to manage the risk of serious illness from the spread of the virus. The Prime Minister announced on 27 November the temporary introduction of new measures as a result of the Omicron variant. These measures are precautionary, while the variant is tracked and assessed and will be reviewed after 3 weeks. As a result, we are reflecting these measures in this guidance for out-of-school settings and wraparound childcare, most directly a temporary recommendation on the wearing of face coverings in out-of-school settings and wraparound childcare and changes to isolation requirements for confirmed and suspected cases of the Omicron variant and their contacts. This advice remains subject to change as the situation develops.</p>

<p>COVID-19 continues to be a virus that we learn to live with, and the imperative to reduce the disruption to children and young people’s education remains.</p>

<p>Our priority is for you to deliver face-to-face, high-quality provision to all children.</p>

<p>We have worked closely with the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) and the United Kingdom Health Security Agency (<abbr title="United Kingdom Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) to revise this guidance.</p>

<h2>Who can attend your setting</h2>

<p>Out-of-school settings and wraparound childcare providers can offer provision to all children, without restriction on the reasons for which they may attend.</p>

<h3>Home education</h3>

<p>Where a child who is electively home educated takes part in an out-of-school setting, this guidance will apply. This is the case regardless of whether the setting is attended solely by children who are electively home educated or a combination of children attending school and children being home educated.</p>

<p>All children who are electively home educated may attend out-of-school settings.</p>

<h3>Staff and workforce</h3>

<p>Out-of-school setting leaders are best placed to determine the workforce required to meet the needs of the children in attendance.</p>

<p>Social distancing measures ended in the workplace on 19 July and the government is no longer advising people to work from home.</p>

<p>The shielding programme has now come to an end and adults previously considered clinically extremely vulnerable (<abbr title="clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr>) should, as a minimum, continue to follow the same guidance as everyone else. It is important that everyone adheres to this guidance but people previously considered <abbr title="clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr> may wish to consider taking extra precautions.</p>

<p>Employers should be able to explain the measures they have in place to keep staff safe at work. The Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) has published guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/protect-people.htm" class="govuk-link">protecting vulnerable workers</a>, including advice for employers and employees on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/talking-to-your-workers/index.htm" rel="external">how to talk about reducing risks in the workplace</a>.</p>

<h4>Contractors</h4>

<p>You should ensure that key contractors are aware of your setting’s control measures and ways of working.</p>

<h4>Other considerations</h4>

<p>Clinical studies have shown that children and young people, including those previously considered to be <abbr title="clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr>, are at very low risk of serious illness if they catch the virus. The UK Clinical Review Panel has recommended that no children and young people under the age of 18 should be considered <abbr title="clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr> and under-18s should be removed from the Shielded Patient List. The chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency and head of NHS Test and Trace has written to parents of these children to inform them.</p>

<p>Children and young people previously considered <abbr title="clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr> can continue to attend out-of-school settings and wraparound childcare and should follow the same <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 guidance</a> as the rest of the population. However, if advised to isolate or reduce their social contact by their specialist, due to the nature of their medical condition or treatment, rather than because of the pandemic, they should continue to follow the advice of their specialist.</p>

<p>We recommend all staff and eligible children and young people take up the offer of a vaccine.</p>

<p>You can find out more about the in-school vaccination programme in<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccination-resources-for-schools/covid-19-vaccination-programme-for-children-and-young-people-guidance-for-schools" class="govuk-link"> </a><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccination-resources-for-schools/covid-19-vaccination-programme-for-children-and-young-people-guidance-for-schools" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 vaccination programme for children and young people guidance for schools</a>.</p>

<h4>Group sizes</h4>

<p>Wraparound childcare and other organised activities for children may take place in groups of any number.</p>

<h2>Risk assessment</h2>

<p>As a provider, you are likely to have a legal duty of care to try to ensure the environment is safe for people who visit or attend. This means you have a duty to take reasonable steps to ensure that people will be safe using the venue for the purposes for which they attend, including regularly reviewing and updating your risk assessments - treating them as ‘living documents’, as the circumstances in your setting and the public health advice changes. This includes having active arrangements in place to monitor whether the controls are effective and working as planned.</p>

<p>For more information on what is required of out-of-school setting leaders in relation to health and safety risk assessments and managing risk see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Health and safety: advice for schools</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-out-of-school-settings-code-of-practice" class="govuk-link">Keeping children safe during community activities, after-school clubs and tuition</a>.</p>

<h3>Mixing and ‘bubbles’</h3>

<p>We do not recommend that it is necessary to keep children in consistent groups (‘bubbles’). This means that ‘bubbles’ do not need to be used in out-of-school settings or wraparound childcare provision.</p>

<h3>Tracing close contacts and self-isolation</h3>

<p>Close contacts in out-of-school settings are identified by NHS Test and Trace and out-of-school settings are not expected to undertake contact tracing. As with positive cases in any other setting, NHS Test and Trace will work with the positive case or their parent to identify close contacts. Contacts from an out-of-school setting will only be traced by NHS Test and Trace where the positive case specifically identifies the individual as being a close contact. This is likely to be a small number of individuals who would be most at risk of contracting COVID-19 due to the nature of the close contact. You may be contacted in exceptional cases to help with identifying close contacts, as currently happens in managing other infectious diseases.</p>

<p>All individuals who have been identified as a close contact of a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, irrespective of vaccination status and age, will be contacted directly and required to self-isolate immediately and asked to book a PCR test. They will be informed by the local health protection team or NHS Test and Trace if they fall into this category and provided details about self-isolation.</p>

<p>Further actions for educational and childcare settings may be advised by a local Incident Management Team (IMT) investigating a confirmed or suspected case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19.</p>

<p>For everyone else, isolation rules are unchanged. Individuals are not required to self-isolate if they live in the same household as someone with COVID-19 who is not a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant, or are a close contact of someone with COVID-19 who is not a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant, and any of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they are fully vaccinated</li>
  <li>they are below the age of 18 years and 6 months</li>
  <li>they have taken part in or are currently part of an approved COVID-19 vaccine trial</li>
  <li>they are not able to get vaccinated for medical reasons</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead, they will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace, informed they have been in close contact with a positive case and advised to take a PCR test.</p>

<p>We would encourage all individuals to take a PCR test if advised to do so.</p>

<p>Staff who do not need to self-isolate, and children and young people aged under 18 years and 6 months, who usually attend an out-of-school setting, and have been identified as a close contact of someone with COVID-19 who is not a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant, can continue to attend the setting as normal.</p>

<p>Further information is available in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace: what to do if you are contacted</a> and in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">stay at home: guidance for households with possible or confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) infection</a>.</p>

<p>Eighteen years olds will be treated in the same way as children until 6 months after their 18th birthday. This will allow them the opportunity to get fully vaccinated, at which point they will be subject to the same rules as adults. If they choose not to get vaccinated, they will need to self-isolate if identified as a close contact of someone with COVID-19 that has not been identified as the Omicron variant.</p>

<p>Settings will continue to have a role in working with health protection teams in the case of a local outbreak. If there is a substantial increase in the number of positive cases in a setting (for more information, see <a href="#stepping" class="govuk-link">stepping measures up and down</a> or if central government offers the area an enhanced response package, a director of public health might advise a setting to temporarily reintroduce some control measures.</p>

<h3>Face coverings</h3>

<p>Face coverings help protect the wearer and others against the spread of infection because they cover the nose and mouth, which are the main confirmed sources of transmission of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Where children in year 7 (which would be children who were aged 11 on 31 August 2021) and above are educated or cared for, we recommend that face coverings should be worn by children, staff and adult visitors when moving around the premises, outside of classrooms or activity rooms, such as in corridors and communal areas. This is a temporary measure.</p>

<p>Children in these settings should also wear a face covering when travelling on public transport and dedicated transport to and from the setting. We do not advise that children and staff wear face coverings in classrooms.</p>

<p>Health advice continues to be that children under 11 should not wear face coverings. Where children of primary-school age are educated or cared for (which would be children who were under age 11 on 31 August 2021), we recommend that face coverings should be worn by staff and adults (including visitors) when moving around in corridors and communal areas.</p>

<p>See <a href="#circumstances" class="govuk-link">circumstances where people are not able to wear face coverings</a> for exceptions.</p>

<p>Face coverings do not need to be worn when outdoors.</p>

<h4>Transparent face coverings and visors</h4>

<p>Transparent face coverings can be worn, which may assist communication with someone who relies on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lip reading</li>
  <li>clear sound</li>
  <li>facial expression</li>
</ul>

<p>Transparent face coverings may be effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. However, the evidence to support this is currently very limited.</p>

<p>The benefits of transparent face coverings should be considered alongside the comfort and breathability of a face covering that contains plastic, which may mean that the face covering is less breathable than layers of cloth.</p>

<p>Face coverings (whether transparent or cloth) should fit securely around the face to cover the nose and mouth and be made with a breathable material capable of filtering airborne particles.</p>

<p>Face visors or shields can be worn by those exempt from wearing a face covering but they are not an equivalent alternative in terms of source control of virus transmission. They may protect the wearer against droplet spread in specific circumstances but are unlikely to be effective in preventing the escape of smaller respiratory particles when used without an additional face covering. They should only be used after carrying out a risk assessment for the specific situation and should always be cleaned appropriately.</p>

<h4>Circumstances where people are not able to wear face coverings</h4>

<p>There are some circumstances where people may not be able to wear a face covering. Please be mindful and respectful of such circumstances. Some people are less able to wear face coverings, and the reasons for this may not be visible to others.</p>

<p>In relation to education and childcare settings, this includes (but is not limited to):</p>

<ul>
  <li>people who cannot put on, wear or remove a face covering because of a physical or mental illness or impairment, or disability</li>
  <li>people for whom putting on, wearing or removing a face covering will cause severe distress</li>
  <li>people speaking to or providing assistance to someone who relies on lip reading, clear sound or facial expressions to communicate</li>
  <li>to avoid the risk of harm or injury to yourself or others</li>
  <li>you are also permitted to remove a face covering in order to take medication</li>
</ul>

<h4>Access to face coverings</h4>

<p>Due to the use of face coverings in wider society, staff and children are already likely to have access to face coverings.</p>

<p>You should have a small contingency supply available for people who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are struggling to access a face covering</li>
  <li>are unable to use their face covering as it has become damp, soiled or unsafe</li>
  <li>have forgotten their face covering</li>
</ul>

<p>Staff and children may consider bringing a spare face covering to wear if their face covering becomes damp during the day.</p>

<h4>Safe wearing and removal of face coverings</h4>

<p>Your contingency plans should already cover a process for when face coverings are worn within your setting and how they should be removed. You should communicate this process clearly to children, parents, staff and visitors and allow for adjustments to be made for children who may be distressed if required to remove a face covering against their wishes, particularly those with SEND.</p>

<p>When wearing a face covering, staff, visitors and children should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand sanitiser before putting a face covering on</li>
  <li>avoid touching the part of the face covering in contact with the mouth and nose, as it could be contaminated with the virus</li>
  <li>change the face covering if it becomes damp or if they’ve touched the part of the face covering in contact with the mouth and nose</li>
  <li>avoid taking it off and putting it back on a lot in quick succession to minimise potential contamination</li>
</ul>

<p>When removing a face covering, staff, visitors and children should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand sanitiser before removing</li>
  <li>only handle the straps, ties or clips</li>
  <li>not give it to someone else to use</li>
  <li>if single-use, dispose of it carefully in a household waste bin and do not recycle</li>
  <li>once removed, store reusable face coverings in a plastic bag until there is an opportunity to wash them</li>
  <li>if reusable, wash it in line with manufacturer’s instructions at the highest temperature appropriate for the fabric</li>
  <li>wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand sanitiser once removed</li>
</ul>

<p>Separate guidance is available on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care/the-use-of-personal-protective-equipment-ppe-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care-settings-including-for-aerosol-generating-procedure" class="govuk-link">preventing and controlling infection</a>, including the use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, in education, childcare and children’s social care settings.</p>

<h4>Stepping measures up and down</h4>

<p>You should have contingency plans (sometimes called outbreak management plans) outlining what you would do if children or staff test positive for COVID-19, or how you would operate if you were advised to take extra measures to help break chains of transmission. Given the detrimental impact that restrictions on education and childcare can have on children and young people, any measures in out-of-school settings should only ever be considered as a last resort, kept to the minimum number of settings or groups possible, and for the shortest amount of time possible.</p>

<p>Central government may offer local areas of particular concern an enhanced response package to help limit increases in transmission.</p>

<p>For most settings it will make sense to think about taking extra action if the number of positive cases substantially increases. Information on what circumstances might lead you to consider taking additional action, and the steps you should work through, can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-local-restrictions-in-education-and-childcare-settings/contingency-framework-education-and-childcare-settings">contingency framework</a>.</p>

<p>The contingency framework describes the principles of managing local outbreaks of COVID-19 in education and childcare settings. Local authorities, directors of public health (<abbr title="directors of public health">DsPH</abbr>) and <abbr title="United Kingdom Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> health protection teams (<abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>) can recommend measures described in the contingency framework in individual education and childcare settings - or a small cluster of settings - as part of their outbreak management responsibilities.</p>

<h2>Control measures</h2>

<p>You should:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Ensure good hygiene for everyone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintain appropriate cleaning regimes, using standard products such as detergents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep occupied spaces well ventilated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow public health advice on testing, self-isolation and managing confirmed cases of COVID-19</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Ensure good hygiene for everyone</h3>

<h4>Hand hygiene</h4>

<p>Frequent and thorough hand cleaning should now be regular practice. You should continue to ensure that children clean their hands regularly. This can be done with soap and water or hand sanitiser.</p>

<h4>Respiratory hygiene</h4>

<p>The ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach continues to be very important.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://e-bug.eu/eng_home.aspx?cc=eng&amp;ss=1&amp;t=Information%20about%20the%20Coronavirus">e-Bug COVID-19 website</a> contains free resources, including materials to encourage good hand and respiratory hygiene.</p>

<h4>Use of personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>)</h4>

<p>Most staff in out-of-school settings will not require <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> beyond what they would normally need for their work. The guidance on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care/the-use-of-personal-protective-equipment-ppe-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care-settings-including-for-aerosol-generating-procedure">use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in education, childcare and children’s social care settings</a> provides more information on the use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for COVID-19.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Maintain appropriate cleaning regimes, using standard products, such as detergents</h3>

<p>You should put in place and maintain an appropriate cleaning schedule. This should include regular cleaning of areas and equipment (for example, twice per day), with a particular focus on frequently touched surfaces. <abbr title="United Kingdom Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> has published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">guidance on the cleaning of non-healthcare settings</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Keep occupied spaces well ventilated</h3>

<p>When your setting is in operation, it is important to ensure it is well ventilated and that a comfortable childcare or learning environment is maintained.</p>

<p>You should identify any poorly ventilated spaces as part of your risk assessment and take steps to improve fresh air flow in these areas, giving particular consideration when holding events where visitors such as parents are on site, for example performances.</p>

<p>Mechanical ventilation is a system that uses a fan to draw fresh air, or extract air from a room. These should be adjusted to increase the ventilation rate wherever possible and checked to confirm that normal operation meets current guidance and that only fresh outside air is circulated.</p>

<p>If possible, systems should be adjusted to full fresh air or, if this is not possible, then systems should be operated as normal as long as they are within a single room and supplemented by an outdoor air supply.</p>

<p>Where mechanical ventilation systems exist, you should ensure that they are maintained in accordance with the manufacturers’ recommendations.</p>

<p>Opening external windows can improve natural ventilation, and in addition, opening internal doors can also assist with creating a throughput of air. If necessary, external opening doors may also be used (if they are not fire doors and where safe to do so).</p>

<p>You should balance the need for increased ventilation while maintaining a comfortable temperature.</p>

<p>The Health and Safety Executive <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation.htm" class="govuk-link" rel="external">guidance on air conditioning and ventilation</a> during the coronavirus outbreak and <a rel="external" href="https://www.cibse.org/coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">CIBSE COVID-19 advice</a> provides more information.</p>

<p>CO2 monitors are being provided to state-funded education settings, so staff can quickly identify where ventilation needs to be improved. Further information will be issued as monitors are rolled out.</p>

<p>The government has also launched a trial of air purifiers in 30 schools in Bradford, which is designed to assess the technology in education settings and whether they could reduce the risk of transmission.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Follow public health advice on testing, self-isolation and managing confirmed cases of COVID-19</h3>

<h4>When an individual develops COVID-19 symptoms or has a positive test</h4>

<p>Children, staff and other adults should follow public health advice on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/when-to-self-isolate-and-what-to-do/" rel="external">when to self-isolate</a> and what to do. They should not come into your setting if they have <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/">symptoms</a> or other reasons requiring them to stay at home due to the risk of them passing on COVID-19 (for example they are required to quarantine or they are a close contact of a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19).</p>

<p>If anyone in your setting develops COVID-19 symptoms, however mild, you should send them home and they should follow public health advice.</p>

<p>For everyone with symptoms, they should avoid using public transport and, wherever possible, be collected by a member of their family or household.</p>

<p>If a child is awaiting collection, they should be left in a room on their own if possible and safe to do so. A window should be opened for fresh air ventilation if possible. Appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should also be used if close contact is necessary, further information on this can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care/the-use-of-personal-protective-equipment-ppe-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care-settings-including-for-aerosol-generating-procedure">use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in education, childcare and children’s social care settings</a> guidance. Any rooms they use should be cleaned after they have left.</p>

<p>The household (including any siblings) should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="United Kingdom Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> stay at home: guidance for households with possible or confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) infection</a>.</p>

<h4>Asymptomatic testing</h4>

<p>Testing remains important in reducing the risk of transmission of infection within settings.</p>

<p>Staff and secondary aged children should continue to test twice weekly at home, with lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) test kits, 3 to 4 days apart. Testing remains voluntary but is strongly encouraged.</p>

<p>There is no need for primary age children (those in year 6 and below) to test.</p>

<p>If you are operating on or linked to a school, you may wish to discuss with that school how your staff can continue to access regular asymptomatic testing via this route.</p>

<p>However, testing is widely available for all settings operating on and away from school sites. Staff and secondary age children can collect home test kits by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>collecting them from their local pharmacy</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/order-coronavirus-rapid-lateral-flow-tests" class="govuk-link">ordering coronavirus (COVID-19) rapid lateral flow tests online</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You should communicate this to staff, secondary age children and parents.</p>

<h4>Confirmatory PCR tests</h4>

<p>Staff and children with a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result should self-isolate in line with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance</a> for households with possible or confirmed (COVID-19) infection. They will also need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">get a free PCR test to check if they have COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>Whilst awaiting the PCR result, the individual should continue to self-isolate.</p>

<p>If the PCR test is taken within 2 days of the positive lateral flow test, and is negative, it overrides the self-test <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test and the child or staff member can return to your setting, as long as the individual doesn’t have COVID-19 symptoms.</p>

<h3>Welcoming children back to your setting</h3>

<p>In most cases, parents and carers will agree that a child with symptoms should not attend your setting, given the potential risk to others.</p>

<p>If a parent or carer insists on a child with symptoms attending your setting, you can take the decision to refuse the child if, in your reasonable judgement, it is necessary to protect other children and staff from possible infection with COVID-19. Your decision would need to be carefully considered in light of all the circumstances and current public health advice.</p>

<h2>Safety measures for activities in out-of-school settings</h2>

<h3>Parental attendance</h3>

<p>We no longer advise that providers limit the attendance of parents and carers at sessions. You should continue to ensure that you have parents’ and carers’ most up-to-date contact details in case of an emergency.</p>

<h3>Sports provision</h3>

<p>All sports provision, including competition between settings, should be planned and delivered in line with this guidance.</p>

<p>Providers of sports activities should also refer to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-grassroots-sports-guidance-for-the-public-and-sport-providers">grassroots sports for public and sport providers</a>, safe provision and facilities and <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sportengland.org/how-we-can-help/coronavirus">guidance from Sport England</a>

</li>
</ul>

<h3>Performances and events</h3>

<p>If planning an indoor or outdoor face-to-face performance or event in front of a live audience, you should follow the latest advice in the Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport (<abbr title="Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport">DCMS</abbr>) <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions" class="govuk-link">Working safely during coronavirus (COVID-19): events and attractions guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Educational visits and trips</h3>

<p>We recommend that you consider whether to go ahead with planned international educational visits at this time, recognising the risk of disruption to education resulting from the need to isolate and test on arrival back into the UK. You should refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office travel advice</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">guidance on international travel</a> before booking and travelling.</p>

<p>You should speak to either your visit provider, commercial insurance company, or the Risk Protection Arrangement (<abbr title="Risk Protection Arrangement">RPA</abbr>) to assess the protection available. Independent advice on insurance cover and options can be sought from the British Insurance Brokers’ Association (<abbr title="British Insurance Brokers’ Association">BIBA</abbr>) or Association of British Insurers (<abbr title="Association of British Insurers">ABI</abbr>).</p>

<p>You should undertake full and thorough risk assessments in relation to all educational visits and ensure that any public health advice, such as hygiene and ventilation requirements, is included as part of that risk assessment. General <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-and-safety-on-educational-visits%5C">guidance about educational visits</a> is available and is supported by specialist<a href="https://oeapng.info/" rel="external" class="govuk-link"> </a><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://oeapng.info/">advice from the Outdoor Education Advisory Panel</a> (<abbr title="Outdoor Education Advisory Panel">OEAP</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Safeguarding</h3>

<p>It is important that you and your staff are aware of safeguarding issues and the signs to look out for. Further information is available in the guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-out-of-school-settings-code-of-practice/keeping-children-safe-during-community-activities-after-school-clubs-and-tuition-non-statutory-guidance-for-providers-running-out-of-school-settings#section-2-safeguarding-and-child-protection" class="govuk-link">keeping children safe during community activities, after-school clubs and tuition</a>.</p>
