<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>	Background</h2>

<p>1.1	The Supporting Families programme has, since its inception in 2012 as Troubled Families, funded and advocated for transformation in the Early Help system.</p>

<p>1.2	There are currently 14 areas who operate under Earned Autonomy where all funding is provided upfront, rather than a proportion of the funding as a payment by results for family outcomes. These 14 areas were granted Earned Autonomy status following a bidding exercise in which they evidenced that having the funding upfront would accelerate transformation.</p>

<p>1.3	In our policy narrative ‘Supporting Families 2021-22 and beyond’ we outlined commitments that would help mature and modernise the programme and do more to encourage transformation.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Supporting Families 2021-22 and beyond</p>

<p>“Over the next year we will work with areas to develop a renewed upfront funding offer, in return for consistent family outcomes, a strong local voice for families and progress on partnerships and data. We expect these local areas to lead the way in demonstrating what a partnership-based, data driven, coordinated whole system approach to supporting vulnerable families looks like, and how this is reflected in the outcomes they are achieving at both service and system levels”</p>
</div>

<p>1.4	We want to learn from the achievements of the most ambitious areas, partnering with them to continue to drive innovation and to shape local services for families into the future.</p>

<p>1.5	Following a consultation process during 2021, this prospectus outlines a new process for areas to apply for Earned Autonomy. This sees Earned Autonomy as a progression from Payment by Results (PbR) for areas who have reached a defined standard of maturity with their Early Help System.</p>

<p>1.6	We see these areas as leading the way locally and nationally, helping us to develop future policy and strategy by demonstrating what is possible. We expect these areas to work closely with the national programme team to influence future direction of travel and to share their good practice and innovation with other areas.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>	The role of Payment by Results and progression to Earned Autonomy</h2>

<p>2.1	Payment by Results for family outcomes is a mechanism that helps encourage and maintain a focus on the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The outcomes families are achieving – knowing more about how families’ lives have been changed</li>
  <li>Data maturity – embedding outcomes in case management systems, sourcing, matching and analysing multiple partner data sets to gain insight into outcomes</li>
  <li>Engaging partners in delivering whole family working – broadening the range of partner organisations who are part of working with families in a whole family way</li>
</ul>

<p>2.2	These elements are at the core of an effective Early Help System.</p>

<p>2.3	Where an area can evidence these elements are well developed and embedded and there is strong local momentum to continue to improve, we believe there is no longer a need for PbR to incentivise this. From 2022 onwards we will be making a stronger connection between elements of the system being in place in an area and having Earned Autonomy status. The markers of maturity are discussed in detail below.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>	Maturity markers</h2>

<p>3.1	A consultation exercise was carried out to gather views on the level of maturity which should be in place in Earned Autonomy areas. The following markers underpin the criteria to become an Earned Autonomy area:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Comfortably <strong>exceeding minimum numbers</strong> for successful family outcomes (exceeded 100% in 2021/22 and achieved 30% or more by Quarter 1 2022/23)</li>
  <li>Met the <strong>20/21 data milestones</strong> set out in the 2021/22 programme sign up conditions</li>
  <li>Committed to <strong>work on ‘all Early Help Data’</strong> and will have recording and reporting in place to do this during 2022/23</li>
  <li>Strong evidence that <strong>whole family working is an essential element of practice</strong>
</li>
  <li>Strong evidence of <strong>family voice informing service delivery</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p>3.2	To demonstrate the ongoing drive for improving the Early Help System, areas wishing to become Earned Autonomy will also need to demonstrate their vision for the local system including: how the work on data for the programme is integrated with wider data transformation programmes; their strategy to work towards rebalancing the system towards greater prevention and how family hubs are being developed as part of this system. They would also need to provide assurance of their internal audit process for quality assuring successful family outcomes.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>	Benefits for Earned Autonomy areas</h2>

<p>4.1	We believe this approach brings clarity for all areas around a common standard of maturity for the programme. With this incentive, it encourages all areas to level up and aim for this standard of maturity. All Earned Autonomy areas would:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Receive all allocated funding upfront providing certainty of funding amount and simplifying the funding stream</li>
  <li>Have the national profile as having reached this standard of maturity</li>
</ul>

<p>4.2	There may also be opportunities to contribute more to the development of the national programme, evaluation and peer support of other areas.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>	Ongoing requirements and assurance mechanisms for Earned Autonomy areas</h2>

<p>5.1	In the first iteration of Earned Autonomy there were some additional assurance tasks required of areas. These included submitting an investment plan, agreeing and submitting population outcomes to the national team, providing an annual assurance report and hosting an assurance visit, alongside continuing to report successful family outcomes and the other business as usual requirements of the programme.</p>

<p>5.2	Programme assurance requirements will be reduced compared to the first iteration of Earned Autonomy to reduce the administrative workload for more mature areas.</p>

<p>5.3	However, we are also conscious that things can change quickly in a local area and that some assurance will need to remain in place to ensure the level of maturity remains high and there is continuous improvement. As a progression from PbR, there may be some areas who regress and need an improvement plan to remain Earned Autonomy or may need to return to PbR if there is insufficient strategic ambition to improve.</p>

<p>5.4	Continued and increasing maturity of Earned Autonomy areas will be monitored through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All Earned Autonomy areas will continue to use the Early Help System Guide self-assessment to guide plans and priorities locally and complete the data survey</li>
  <li>All Earned Autonomy areas will continue to report successful family outcome data until such time as the ‘all Early Help Data pilot’ has progressed and data returns for this can replace successful family outcome data.</li>
  <li>Ongoing assurance visits will also be used to gain greater insights into progress at the local level. An outline agenda for this is provided in Annex A.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>	Criteria and assessment</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Process in brief</strong></p>

<p><strong>Stage 1:</strong> The Early Help System Guide self-assessment and successful family outcome performance will be used to assess the maturity of all areas against the maturity markers.</p>

<p>For prospective EA areas, only those who have scored at or above the levels outlined below will be invited to progress to stage 2.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 2:</strong> For prospective EA areas, an application form (Annex A) and panel process. For existing EA areas an assurance visit (Annex D) will be conducted.</p>
</div>

<p>6.1	To progress to Stage 2, prospective EA areas will need to meet the following criteria:</p>

<p>1.	Successful family outcomes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exceeded 100% in 2021/22</li>
  <li>Achieved 30% or more by 30 June 2022 (Quarter 1 2022/23)</li>
</ul>

<p>2.	Early Help System Guide self-assessment (relevant descriptors included at Annex C):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Family voice 1 (minimum score 4 or above)</li>
  <li>Workforce 1 (minimum score 4 or above)</li>
  <li>Workforce 3 (minimum score 3 or above)</li>
  <li>Leaders 1 (minimum score 4 or above)</li>
  <li>Leaders 3 (minimum score 3 or above)</li>
  <li>Data 1 (minimum score 4 or above)</li>
  <li>Data 3 (minimum score 4 or above)</li>
  <li>Data 4 (minimum score 4 or above)</li>
  <li>Data 7 (minimum score 3 or above)</li>
</ul>

<p>6.2	<strong>Important</strong>: Areas should be realistic with their responses to the self- assessment. It is important that the self-assessment scoring is accurate and the narrative robust as the information and scoring provided will be tested through Stage 2 of the process.</p>

As well as describing what is common, this framework will also recognise the value of the specialisms and perspectives from different agencies.

Strong partnerships also evidence that leaders at different levels across the Early Help Partnership focus on building productive relationships with partners and trust one another. All themed initiatives such as serious violence, child poverty and homelessness are co-ordinated and seen as interdependent and are supported by strong data governance arrangements.<br>Leaders speak with one voice on the importance of early help, whole family and whole system working and ensure this culture is embedded through senior and middle management and the front line and staff at all levels are effectively involved in shaping and developing improvements.</td>

The performance against these measures shows that outcomes for families are improving.<br><br>A mature area has a shared set of measures owned by all partners who take collective responsibility for contributing to positive change. Population measures cover the whole population of the area e.g. Primary school attendance rates.<br><br>Cohort measures cover a specific subset of the population e.g. primary attendance rates of children in families who received a specific service. Demand measures are those which measure activity in the system e.g. child in need per 10,000 population. Family measures track progress in outcomes for individual families e.g. child attending school at least 90% in last three consecutive terms. All outcome measures are used to generate an enquiring and learning culture, with high support and high challenge. This enables shared responsibility for improving outcomes, recognising that no one organisation delivers a specific outcome on their own.</td>
