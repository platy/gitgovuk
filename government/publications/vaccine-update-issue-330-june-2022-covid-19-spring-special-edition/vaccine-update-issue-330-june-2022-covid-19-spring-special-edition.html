<h2>
<span class="number">148 million </span> doses of COVID-19 vaccine given in England</h2>

<p>Thank you to all the vaccinators, vaccinees, and all of the teams working so hard to give the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccinations – every one is a great step forward.</p>

<p>It’s been over one year and 5 months since the COVID-19 vaccination programme started across the UK. Since 8 December 2020, when Margaret Keenan became the first person in the world to receive her first vaccine there have been more than 148 million vaccinations given across the country.</p>

<p>We are seeing good uptake of COVID-19 spring booster vaccinations which are being offered to people aged over 75, adult care home residents and individuals aged 12 and over who are immunosuppressed. We really want to encourage anyone eligible who has not yet come forward to have their vaccines to make an appointment. Having positive vaccination conversations and signposting to trusted sources on information can help to address any concerns and build confidence to then take up the offer.</p>

<p>Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes, including Immunisation, UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The continuing decline in case rates and hospitalisations is good news but it is still crucial to get vaccination. If you have yet to take up the offer of a vaccine or have missed your latest jab please come forward now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are in a crowded, enclosed space it is still sensible to wear a face covering and remember to keep washing your hands regularly. If you have symptoms of a respiratory infection and a high temperature or feel unwell, try to stay at home or away from others – especially elderly or vulnerable people and pregnant women.</p>

<p>This issue of vaccine update focuses on all the new and revised resources published and the importance of the uptake of these resources to make sure everyone has their vaccination consent information, in a format which meets their needs. Thank you to everyone who has worked tirelessly to deliver this lifesaving programme.</p>

<h2>Autumn COVID-19 boosters coming soon</h2>

<p>The boosters would be for more vulnerable adults, alongside frontline social care and health workers, in order to maintain their protection over the winter against severe COVID-19.</p>

<p>As in autumn 2021, the primary objective of the 2022 autumn booster programme will be to increase population immunity and protection against severe COVID-19, specifically hospitalisation and death, over the winter period.</p>

<p>The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation’s (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>’s) current view is that in autumn 2022, a COVID-19 vaccine should be offered to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>residents in a care home for older adults and staff</li>
  <li>frontline health and social care workers</li>
  <li>all those 65 years of age and over</li>
  <li>adults aged 16 to 64 years who are in a clinical risk group</li>
</ul>

<p>Professor Wei Shen Lim, Chair of COVID-19 vaccination on the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Last year’s autumn booster vaccination programme provided excellent protection against severe COVID-19, including against the Omicron variant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have provided interim advice on an autumn booster programme for 2022 so that the NHS and care homes are able to start the necessary operational planning, to enable high levels of protection for more vulnerable individuals and frontline healthcare staff over next winter.</p>

<p>As we continue to review the scientific data, further updates to this advice will follow.</p>

<p>Throughout the pandemic, evidence has clearly shown that COVID-19 has disproportionately affected those in older age groups, residents in care homes for older adults, and those with certain underlying health conditions, particularly those who are severely immunosuppressed.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> will continue its ongoing review of the vaccination programme and the epidemiological situation, particularly in relation to the timing and value of doses for less vulnerable older adults and those in clinical risk groups ahead of autumn 2022.</p>

<p>The committee will announce its final plans for the autumn programme, including further detail on the definitions of clinical risk groups, in due course.</p>

<h2>How you can continue to keep yourself and your loved ones safe</h2>

<h4>Vaccines</h4>
<p>Get vaccinated to reduce your risk of catching COVID-19 and becoming seriously ill, and to reduce the risk of spreading the virus to others.</p>

<h4>Fresh air</h4>
<p>Letting fresh air in if meeting indoors, or meeting outside to disperse COVID-19 particles and reduce the risk of spreading the virus.</p>

<h4>Face covering</h4>
<p>Considerer wearing a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces.</p>

<h4>Stay at home if unwell</h4>
<p>Try to stay at home if you are unwell.</p>

<h4>Hand washing</h4>
<p>Wash your hands regularly to limit the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<h3>Insights and communications</h3>
<p>Insight work from December 2020 to May 2021 used the Clinical Commissioning Groups’ (<abbr title="Clinical Commissioning Groups">CCGs</abbr>) citizen’s panel, <abbr title="Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire">BNSSG</abbr> public surveys, interviews with individuals from the priority groups and shared learning from South West <abbr title="Clinical Commissioning Groups">CCGs</abbr> and national forums.</p>

<p>Key insight findings informed the programme planning, gave practical suggestions for improving clinic access, addressing non-English language requirements, and targeting vaccination motivations and concerns. It also showed friends and family, local community and faith leaders, and healthcare professionals from within communities were the most trusted sources of advice. This informed the communication and engagement strategy.</p>

<h3>Maximising uptake</h3>

<p>Successfully maximising vaccine uptake in <abbr title="Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire">BNSSG</abbr> has been through a multi-faceted approach as shown in the table below.</p>

<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>For some priority sub-groups vaccination uptake figures trended towards the <abbr title="Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire">BNSSG</abbr> average, with trends coinciding with outreach and engagement activities.</p>

<h4>Figure 1: Uptake of COVID-19 vaccination for lower super output areas (<abbr title="lower super output areas">LSOA</abbr>) of <abbr title="Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire">BNSSG</abbr> with higher proportions of people with non-English first language or from ethnic minority groups, for <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> cohorts 1 to 5</h4>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Uptake of COVID-19 vaccination for lower super output areas (LSOA) of BNSSG with higher proportions of people with non-English first language or from ethnic minority groups, for JCVI cohorts 1 to 5" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/150769/F2_Uptake_by_LSOA.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>In the complex context, it is difficult to attribute cause and effect. As vaccination decisions are mostly driven by influence within community networks, it is likely that both engagement work and outreach work had wider impact than is indicated by the doses delivered in the outreach clinics. Including whole programme costs, outreach vaccinations alone were delivered at a cost of £15 per dose. For reasons given above, this likely overestimates the cost per additional vaccine achieved through the overall maximising uptake programme. The evidence-based approach to prioritisation and delivery will further have increased cost-effectiveness. Figures 2 to 5 show results for the different priority groups and sub-groups, showing areas of success and where further work is needed.</p>

<h3>Successes and challenges</h3>
<p>Partnership working between multiple stakeholders, and giving communities greater ownership, alongside an evidence-based, tailored approach to different subgroups have been critical. This programme has also been responsive to developing needs and review of the data. Successful approaches for some subgroups did not have the same impact in others. The programme has deepened its understanding of the challenges both in accessibility and acceptability of vaccination for these populations, and routes of engagement. It’s recognised that maximising uptake must remain a priority, and evaluation work will feed into this, and other vaccination/healthcare programmes.</p>

<p>Key findings that informed the planning included the Citizen’s panel December 2020. This showed a significant minority of around 10% said they were either unlikely to accept vaccination, or unsure. It demonstrated that locally people make vaccine decisions on a range of factors, these vary by group, and are summarised below:</p>

<h4>Drivers and barriers to vaccination identified in local insight work</h4>

<p>Drivers for vaccination:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prosocial approach (protection of others)</li>
  <li>protection of self</li>
  <li>community influence</li>
  <li>practicalities: clinic locations, GP access</li>
  <li>information (and sources)</li>
</ul>

<p>Barriers to vaccination:</p>

<ul>
  <li>safety concerns</li>
  <li>lack of information</li>
  <li>accessibility of vaccination</li>
  <li>acceptability or practicality of vaccination locations</li>
  <li>vaccine misconceptions</li>
  <li>fertility concerns</li>
  <li>mistrust of government or other official organisations</li>
</ul>

<p>The biggest factor in someone’s decision is speaking with trusted family and friends, as shown in this survey conducted at an outreach clinic.</p>

<h3>Engagement and communication strategies in the Maximising Uptake COVID-19 vaccination programme</h3>

<p>Engagement and communications methods:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Community champions (including &gt;100 people with influence from black and minority ethnic (<abbr title="black and minority ethnic">BME</abbr>) and deprived communities) trained on COVID-19 and vaccines.</li>
  <li>MECC approach training people in libraries, one stop shop (local authority), street care.</li>
  <li>Written and video information in other languages.</li>
  <li>6 short videos with community leaders from ethnic minority communities sharing personal experience of how they’d been affected by COVID-19, worries about vaccination.</li>
  <li>Templated posters for fast turnaround production to be used locally, for example in clinics encouraging people to share their vaccination experiences; publicity for walk ins; can include community leader quotes.</li>
  <li>Language hub on the Healthier Together website of trusted resources in 22 different languages.</li>
  <li>Revised wording of COVID-19 vaccine appointment text message invitations from <abbr title="Primary Care Networks (PCNs)">PCNs</abbr> using more positively-framed language and translated to 8 languages.</li>
  <li>Webinars developed for ethnic minority and disabled communities, and addressing concerns for pregnancy, breast feeding and fertility, but accessible for all demographics.</li>
  <li>Small scale webinars run by communities in own languages, such as in Somali community and by House of Praise, by local <abbr title="Primary Care Networks (PCNs)">PCNs</abbr> prior to 1st dose clinics also helped to allay concerns and get people signing up for vaccinations once they became eligible.</li>
  <li>Videos and leaflets in different languages.</li>
  <li>Community-led videos made by organisations embedded within local communities, often in community language.</li>
  <li>Vaccinated: pull-up banners and posters encouraging people to share their experience of being vaccinated with family and friends will be available at all vaccination clinics.</li>
