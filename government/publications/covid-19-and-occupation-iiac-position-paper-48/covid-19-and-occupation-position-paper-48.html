<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (<abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>), was first identified at the end of December 2019 in China as the cause of an outbreak of cases of ‘atypical viral pneumonia’, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The first case of COVID-19 documented in the UK was on 31 January 2020. The UK experienced a first wave of infection between March and July 2020 with a second beginning in late August 2020. Over 75,000 deaths from COVID-19 had occurred by the end of December 2020. Knowledge of many aspects of <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> and COVID-19, including detection, transmission, diagnosis, treatment and disease progression, has gradually accumulated during 2020. The Industrial Injuries Advisory Council (<abbr title="Industrial Injuries Advisory Council">IIAC</abbr>), therefore considered it timely and necessary to review the evidence for the relationship between occupation and COVID-19 during 2020 whilst acknowledging that, as yet, there may not be sufficient good quality information to make definitive recommendations.</p>

<p>The health effects arising from workplace exposure to <abbr title="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome">SARS</abbr>-COV-2 cannot be distinguished from infection transmitted in non-occupational circumstances. The Council thus looks for robust research evidence that the risk of developing the disease is more likely than not to have arisen from occupational exposure i.e. is more than doubled.</p>

<p>This interim position paper reports an evaluation of the available evidence with a focus on occupational mortality data based on death certificates, together with information on infection and hospitalisation rates by occupation and data on patterns of occupational exposure to <abbr title="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome">SARS</abbr>-COV-2.</p>

<p>There is evidence from several large outbreaks that working in close proximity to others in workplaces increases the risk of infection in workers, as does close proximity to infected individuals in health and social care settings and transport. The risk of suffering severe COVID-19 is also increased in social care and transport workers in the UK. There is, however, limited scientific evidence on the exact modes of transmission of COVID-19 in both workplaces and community settings and scarce data on dose, exposure frequency and length of exposure in the workplace.</p>

<p>Analyses of UK death certificates between March and December 2020 show more than a two-fold risk in several occupations especially for males, including social care, nursing, bus and taxi driving, food processing, retail work, local and national administration and security. The number of occurrences of cases and deaths from COVID-19 reported through <abbr title="Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Regulations">RIDDOR</abbr> (Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Regulations) for these occupations mirror the death data; <abbr title="Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Regulations">RIDDOR</abbr> also provides evidence of the relatively high numbers of cases in other occupations such as education.</p>

<p>The Council concludes that there is a clear association between several occupations and increased risk of death from COVID-19 but acknowledges that the consistency. and extent of the mortality data, and the lack of adjustment for factors such as deprivation, means that the evidence is currently too limited in quality and quantity to justify prescription at this stage. Information regarding any link between occupation and risk of disability following <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> infection is also currently scarce. The Council therefore concludes, overall, that the evidence is not at present sufficient for recommending prescription. However, the evidence of a doubling of risk in several occupations indicates a pathway to potential prescription and the Council expects that future data will enable a better understanding of the effect that Post-COVID-19 syndrome may have on loss of function. The Council will recommend prescription if and when there is strong enough evidence that occupational exposures cause disabling disease on the ‘balance of probabilities.’</p>

<p>The Council is aware of several ongoing studies and will continue to monitor the literature closely. It is particularly interested in large good quality studies of workers and workplaces and also community-based studies regarding both death and long-term effects of infection with <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>.</p>

<p>This report contains some technical terms, the meanings of which are explained in a concluding glossary.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>1. At the end of December 2019, a cluster of cases of “atypical viral pneumonia” was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, People’s Republic of China. A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (<abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>), was identified as the cause of this outbreak and its genetic code was reported in early January 2020. Evidence of human-to-human transmission was also reported during January 2020. The disease state caused by <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> was specified as Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and by 30 January 2020, the World Health Organisation declared the epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (<abbr title="Public Health Emergency of International Concern">PHEIC</abbr>). The first case of COVID-19 documented in the UK was on 31 January 2020. The World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 a global pandemic in early March 2020. The UK went into national lockdown in late March 2020 after a dramatic rise in cases, particularly in London, started to put pressure on the National Health Service (<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>).</p>

<p>2. The UK experienced a first wave of infection between March and July 2020 with 285,262 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 40,673 deaths. A second wave of infection began in late August 2020 with a further 2,372,013 confirmed cases and 35,530 deaths up to the end of December. Evidence about the virus has accumulated rapidly. Although there is considerably more analysis to do, the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council (<abbr title="Industrial Injuries Advisory Council">IIAC</abbr>) considered it timely and necessary to review the evidence for occupation and COVID-19 during 2020 whilst acknowledging that, as yet, there may not be sufficient good quality information to make definitive recommendations.</p>

<p>3. Industrial Injury Disablement Benefit (<abbr title="Industrial Injury Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr>) is currently prescribed for 15 biological agents. These include several infections (tuberculosis, hepatitis A, B and C) which can be acquired through occupational exposure.</p>

<p>4. There has been increasing evidence from several countries that workers in some occupational sectors are at increased risk of both being infected with <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> and dying from it. These sectors include health and community social care, security, transportation, retail, food production and construction. In addition, several countries have now recognised COVID-19 as a work-related disease and a few, such as Belgium and Norway, consider it to be a compensatable occupational disease.</p>

<h3>The Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Scheme</h3>

<p>5. The <abbr title="Industrial Injury Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> Scheme provides non-contributory, ‘no-fault’ benefits for disablement because of accidents or prescribed diseases which arise during the course of employed earners’ work. The benefit is paid in addition to other incapacity and disability benefits. It is tax-free and administered by the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>).</p>

<p>6. It is possible to make a posthumous claim for <abbr title="Industrial Injury Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> in respect of someone who was entitled to <abbr title="Industrial Injury Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr>, but who dies before being able to make a claim. A person wanting to make a posthumous claim on behalf of a deceased person must apply to be appointed to act on behalf of the deceased person. There is normally an absolute 12-month time limit from the date of the issue of a death certificate in which a person must apply to act for the deceased and/or be appointed to act; and also make a claim for benefit, after they have been appointed. A posthumous claim is treated as if it had been made by the deceased person on the day they died, with a maximum amount of back payment of 3 months.</p>

<p>7. The legal requirements for prescription are set out in The Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 which states that the Secretary of State may prescribe a disease where they are satisfied that the disease ought to be treated, having regard to its causes and incidence and any other relevant considerations, as a risk of the occupation and not as a risk common to all persons; and is such that, in the absence of special circumstances, the attribution of particular cases to the nature of the employment can be established or presumed with reasonable certainty.</p>

<p>8. Thus, a disease may only be prescribed if there is a recognised risk to workers in an occupation and the link between disease and occupation can be established or reasonably presumed in individual cases.</p>

<h3>The Role of the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council</h3>

<p>9. <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Advisory Council">IIAC</abbr> is an independent statutory body established in 1946 to advise the Secretary of State for Social Security on matters relating to the <abbr title="Industrial Injury Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> scheme. The major part of the Council’s time is spent considering whether the list of prescribed diseases for which benefit may be paid should be enlarged or amended.</p>

<p>10. In considering the question of prescription the Council searches for a practical way to demonstrate in the individual case that the disease can be attributed to occupational exposure with reasonable confidence; for this purpose, ‘reasonable confidence’ is interpreted as being based on the balance of probabilities.</p>

<p>11. Some occupational diseases are relatively simple to verify, as the link with occupation is clear-cut. Some only occur due to particular work or are almost always associated with work or have specific medical tests that prove their link with work, or have a rapid link to exposure, or other clinical features that make it easy to confirm the work connection. However, many other diseases are not uniquely occupational, and when caused by occupation, are indistinguishable from the same disease occurring in someone who has not been exposed to a hazard at work. In these circumstances, attribution to occupation depends on research evidence that work in the prescribed job or with the prescribed occupational exposures causes the disease on the balance of probabilities. The Council thus looks for evidence that the risk of developing the disease associated with a particular occupational exposure or circumstance is more than doubled (previous reports of the Council explain why this threshold was chosen).</p>

<p>12. The health effects arising from workplace exposure to <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> cannot be distinguished from infection transmitted in non-occupational circumstances, so the case for prescription rests on having robust research evidence on the causal probabilities.</p>

<p>13. For most individuals COVID-19 is a self-limiting illness but a minority experience persisting symptoms after infection. Current estimates indicate that the death rate for adult infections is about 1% and that several times this number may experience ‘Post-COVID-19 syndrome’ with symptoms lasting some months<sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. However, at this time it is not known what the longer-term effects are as there have been few studies of Post-COVID-19 syndrome; there is also no agreed case definition. Furthermore, there is no indication to date that COVID-19 due to occupational exposures is more or less likely to result in Post-COVID-19 syndrome than is the case for non-occupationally transmitted COVID-19.</p>

<p>14. The focus of this initial paper is on evidence relating to the pandemic during 2020. A major source of information is the data extracted from death certificates and reported by the UK Office of National Statistics (<abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr>). These data are presented and discussed together with supporting information from a wide range of sources including occupational studies investigating infection and hospitalisation rates.</p>

<p>15. The Council recognises that knowledge of many aspects of <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> and COVID-19, including detection, transmission, diagnosis, treatment and disease progression, has developed and expanded over the first few months of the pandemic. In parallel, guidance on measures to reduce infection for both the general community and for workers has changed quite rapidly over the same period. The Council will therefore further evaluate evidence as it emerges for both mortality and morbidity related to occupation. This will be reported in future papers. Emerging data from a longer period of follow-up will allow a greater understanding of the effect that Post-COVID-19 syndrome may have on loss of function.</p>

<h2>Characteristics of the disease</h2>

<p>16. Coronaviruses are ribonucleic acid (<abbr title="ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr>) viruses that are common causes of infection in animals and humans. Some cause mild illness such as the common cold. Others cause severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (<abbr title="Middle East Respiratory Syndrome">MERS</abbr>) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (<abbr title="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome">SARS</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>17. Approximately one-third of those infected with <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> never develop symptoms (Ward et al 2020).   Those that do can experience a range of symptoms including cough, fever, muscle aches, headache, shortness of breath, sore throat, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, a loss of sense of taste and smell, abdominal pain, nasal symptoms and skin rashes (Docherty et al 2020). Most patients recover within 2 weeks.  According to current data, approximately 5% report ongoing symptoms after one month and 2% after 3 months (Nguyen et al 2020).  This Post-COVID-19 syndrome is not necessarily closely related to the severity of the initial illness and currently remains poorly characterised (Yelin et al 2020).</p>

<p>18. A minority of patients develop respiratory failure or other complications of COVID-19 infection severe enough to require hospital admission. Data up to October 2020 indicate that approximately 1% of those infected die during the acute illness; however, the risk of complications and death is strongly influenced by age and the presence of comorbidities.</p>

<p>19. Although usually presenting with respiratory symptoms, COVID-19 is now recognised as a multi-system inflammatory condition with impacts on every system in the body. Pulmonary fibrosis, cardiac injury, thromboembolic disease including pulmonary emboli and strokes, and encephalopathy are all recognised. In addition, patients requiring periods of intense medical treatment are at risk of a post-ICU syndrome, comprising a range of physical, cognitive and psychological impairments which persist after discharge from Intensive Care. The proportion of patients affected and the course of any disability is currently unknown.</p>

<p>20. There is currently no curative treatment for COVID-19 but there is emerging evidence of the effectiveness of a number of therapeutic approaches.</p>

<h3>Diagnosis</h3>

<p>21. <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> infection can be diagnosed by detecting the virus during the acute illness, or by the detection of antibodies in the convalescent phase.</p>

<p>22. Acute COVID-19 infection is most reliably diagnosed by detecting viral <abbr title="ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr> in upper airway secretions using nucleic acid amplification tests and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (<abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions">RT-PCR</abbr>).  These tests are very specific but failed to identify the virus in about 20% of subjects with typical clinical and radiological features of COVID-19 in the period from March to June 2020 (Woloshin et al 2020). Inadequate sampling and the timing of the test contributed to the false negative results. The test does not distinguish between dead and live viral <abbr title="ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr> and in some cases is positive for weeks after the onset of symptoms, even though the individual is not necessarily infectious.</p>

<p>23. <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions">RT-PCR</abbr> tests require sophisticated equipment and can take several hours to process. Several rapid tests have been developed for use at the point of care. They employ techniques such as simplified single-step or isothermal molecular amplification and lateral flow chromatography using surface-bound antibodies to detect viral antigen.  The sensitivity and specificity of these tests is currently uncertain, particularly amongst individuals with low viral loads (Dinnes et al 2020).</p>

<p>24. Prior <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> infection can be diagnosed by the presence of antibodies in the blood.</p>

<h2>Risk factors for infection with <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> and the development of COVID-19</h2>

<p>25. There are rare reports of infection with <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> from farmed animals (Oreshkova et al 2020) but infection is almost always caused by direct or indirect contact with another infected individual. The risk of infection is determined primarily by personal lifestyle and individual factors (including occupational) that increase contact with others who are already infected.</p>

<p>26. In the earlier stages of the pandemic COVID-19 testing was largely confined to more severely symptomatic individuals (particularly those who were hospitalised), making it difficult to distinguish risks of infection from risks of developing severe disease and death. Three large population-based studies have helped clarify the issues. The UK Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr>) infection survey (<abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr>, 2020a) and <abbr title="Real-Time Assessment of Community Transmission">REACT</abbr>-1 (Riley et al 2020) carried out tests for active infection using <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions">RT-PCR</abbr>. <abbr title="Real-Time Assessment of Community Transmission">REACT</abbr>-2 (Ward et al 2020) investigated prior infection using antibody tests. The <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> conducted weekly surveys from April 2020 with a total of 1,116,988 tests up to November 2020, 7,595 (0.7%) of which were positive. <abbr title="Real-Time Assessment of Community Transmission">REACT</abbr>-1 involved 7 rounds of tests between May and November 2020.  1,197,387 tests were carried out, and 5,582 (0.5%) of these were positive. <abbr title="Real-Time Assessment of Community Transmission">REACT</abbr>-2 involved 365,104 antibody tests carried out in 3 rounds between June and September 2020.  17,576 (4.8%) of these were positive.</p>

<p>27. Over the periods in which these studies were carried out, those who reported definite contact with an infected individual were up to 30 times more likely than others to have evidence of infection themselves (Riley et al 2020). Infection rates were approximately twice as high in young adults as in older age groups; in round 1 of <abbr title="Real-Time Assessment of Community Transmission">REACT</abbr>-2, for example, the prevalence of positive antibodies fell from 7.9% in the 18 to 24 age group to 3.3% in those aged 75 or older. Infection was marginally more common in men compared with women: 0.13% vs 0.12% in <abbr title="Real-Time Assessment of Community Transmission">REACT</abbr>-1 and 6.2% vs 5.7% in <abbr title="Real-Time Assessment of Community Transmission">REACT</abbr>-2.</p>

<p>28. Living in a large household with five or more individuals or in a care home was associated with approximately a doubled risk of infection compared with living alone (<abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> 2020a, Ward et al 2020). Those in the most deprived quartile of social deprivation were approximately 50% more likely to be infected compared with the least deprived (<abbr title="Real-Time Assessment of Community Transmission">REACT</abbr>-2). These associations are likely to reflect increased risks of contact with infected individuals. The <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> and <abbr title="Real-Time Assessment of Community Transmission">REACT</abbr> studies showed that those of a non-white ethnic background were 2 to 3 times more likely to have a positive test for <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> compared with white ethnic background subjects (<abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> 2020a, Riley et al 2020, Ward et al 2020). The openSAFELY Collaborative studied the primary care records of 17.5 million adults in England between February and August 2020 (Mahur et al 2020). After adjusting for age, sex, deprivation quintile, clinical co-morbidities, household size and care home residency the results showed that South Asian, Black and mixed ethnic groups were marginally more likely to be tested for <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>, and substantially more likely to test positive compared with white adults (South Asian Hazard Ratio (HR) 2.02, Black HR 1.68, mixed HR 1.46).</p>

<p>29. Unlike the risk of acquiring infection, the risks of hospitalisation or death with COVID-19 are determined primarily by age, sex and the presence of co-morbidities. The risk of being admitted to ICU for COVID-19 was substantially increased in the openSafely study in all ethnic minority groups compared with white adults (South Asian HR 2.22, 95% CI 1.96-2.52; Black HR 3.07, 95% CI 2.61-3.61; Mixed HR 2.86, 95% CI 2.19-3.75, Other HR 2.86, 95% CI 2.31-3.63) (Williamson et al, 2020). However, the hazard ratios for COVID-19 mortality were less elevated (South Asian HR 1.27, Black HR 1.55, mixed HR 1.40).  Similar findings were found in a study in Leicester of all individuals assessed for COVID-19 with polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) testing at University Hospitals of Leicester <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Trust between 1 March and 28 April 2020. (Martin et al, 2020) and in a systematic review and meta-analysis by the same Leicester research group (Sze et al, 2020).</p>

<p>30. These findings probably largely reflect socio-economic factors (including occupational exposures) that increase the risk of infection; ethnic differences in susceptibility are currently uncertain (Public Health England 2020a). The study by Martin et al, found that South Asian and Black participants were significantly younger, more likely to have diabetes and live in a larger household than those of white ethnicity and were more likely to live in a deprived area.</p>

<p>31. Age is the strongest predictor of death and other severe outcomes. Overall, those aged over 80 are approximately 70 times more likely to die following infection compared with those under 40 (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> 2020). After adjustment for comorbidities (which increase with age) those over 80 remain approximately 14 times more likely to die compared with those under 50 (Docherty et al 2020, Williamson et al 2020).</p>

<p>32. Although men are only marginally more likely to be infected with <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> than women, they are substantially more likely to die of COVID-19. Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) data indicate an adjusted hazard ratio (<abbr title="adjusted hazard ratio">aHR</abbr>) of 1.54 (95% CI 1.50 - 1.57) for male deaths vs female; UK Biobank an odds ratio (<abbr title="odds ratio">OR</abbr>) of 1.52 (1.28 to 1.81) and openSAFELY an <abbr title="adjusted hazard ratio">aHR</abbr> of 1.93 (1.80-2.06). There is some evidence from the <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> data that the gender disparity is greater in working-aged men with an <abbr title="adjusted hazard ratio">aHR</abbr> of 1.99 (1.85 - 2.14) compared with an <abbr title="adjusted hazard ratio">aHR</abbr> of 1.47 (1.44 - 1.51) in those aged above 64 years.</p>

<p>33. A number of comorbid conditions are associated with severe outcomes and an increased risk of death following COVID-19 infection. Obesity is consistently associated with poorer outcomes. An openSAFELY collaborative paper (Williamson et al, 2020) found that those with BMI  ≥ 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were more than twice as likely to die as the non-obese (<abbr title="adjusted hazard ratio">aHR</abbr>  2.27: 95% CI 1.99-2.58). Other associations have been demonstrated with diabetes, immunosuppression, respiratory disease, neurological disease and malignancy.</p>

<p>34. Those of a non-white ethnic background are 2 to 4 times more likely to die of COVID-19 compared with white ethnic background individuals (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> 2020).  The differences are reduced when social factors and comorbidities are taken into account but some differences in outcome appear to persist (Zakeri et al 2020).</p>

<p>35. <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> has also produced a report on ethnic differences in COVID-19 deaths up until 28 July 2020 (<abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> 2020b). It found that males of Black African ethnic background had 2.7 times the risk of COVID-19 death compared with males of White ethnic background; females of Black Caribbean ethnic background had death rates higher than females of white ethnic background. Taking into account region, socio-economic characteristics and pre-existing conditions, males of Black African background still had 2.5 times the COVID-19 death rate of White males; for females, the corresponding estimate was 2.1. All ethnic minority groups other than Chinese had higher COVID-19 death rates than the White ethnic population. The Report concluded that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">ethnic differences in mortality involving COVID-19 are most strongly associated with demographic and socio-economic factors such as place of residence and occupational exposures and cannot be explained by pre-existing health conditions using hospital data or self-reported health status.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Potential for exposure and patterns of exposure within key occupations, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> use and effectiveness</h2>

<p>36. Modes of transmission of <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> are not fully understood. It seems that transmission may occur from close contact with an infected person (droplet or aerosol transmission), or indirectly from touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. The risk of viral infection depends on the level of exposure which, in turn, depends on the number, frequency, and proximity of infection sources (both social and occupational).</p>

<p>37. The <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> has created an estimate of exposure to generic disease, and physical proximity to others, for UK occupations based on US analysis of these factors.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">[footnote 2]</a></sup> Occupations involving both regular exposure to disease plus close contact with people will have higher risk of infection, while those with close proximity yet lower exposure to disease will have lower risk. For example, health and social care workers who have a greater chance of being in close proximity to infected people will be at greater risk than someone working from home.</p>

<p>38. The available information shows that there is widespread contamination of the air and surfaces in hospitals, although not all of the studies found the virus, and most of the positive studies showed relatively low concentrations<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:3">[footnote 3]</a></sup>. Studies involving measuring <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> on surfaces on public transportation showed that low-level contamination was possible. The extent of virus contamination in other workplaces is unknown since there have been no studies. While clusters of infection have been reported in numerous workplaces and occupations, it is uncertain whether these resulted from local contamination or person-to-person spread, though the latter seems more likely.</p>

<p>39. The British Occupational Hygiene Society (<abbr title="British Occupational Hygiene Society">BOHS</abbr>) has developed a Risk Matrix (see Appendix Table 1) to synthesise the science into a set of practical guidance on the types of control measures that should be adopted to protect workers. This is based on the likelihood and duration of exposure. The highest risk ratings are for care workers, and then ‘public facing’ workers with a high chance of face-to-face contact. The <abbr title="British Occupational Hygiene Society">BOHS</abbr> Matrix also provides best practice advice on the control measures that should be used to protect workers in the various exposure categories. In line with the guidance from the Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>), these focus on control at the source of the potential infection, for example isolation of infected people, restricted staff access, physical distancing, regular surface disinfection, use of personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>).</p>

<p>40. <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> can never completely protect the wearer: the effectiveness of respirators and face coverings, for example, depends on factors such as mask type/material, fit to the face, and consistency of wearing. While good <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> practice may be feasible in a hospital environment, it is not necessarily as feasible in many other workplaces where workers are at potential risk. Other controls such as plastic screens, simple visors, and cloth face coverings are likely to offer suboptimal protection, particularly as there is growing concern that airborne transmission may be a significant infection mechanism in some workplace outbreaks. Furthermore, there are both compliance and feasibility issues that can limit the effectiveness of control measures. Patchy implementation of control measures will be compounded by the presence within workforces of an unknown proportion of asymptomatic yet infectious workers (particularly among the young). Effective control of risk of infection within the workplace is likely to remain a challenge, as indeed will controlling the risk of the virus entering the workplace from shared travel to work or from the wider community.</p>

<p>41. In summary, the scientific evidence on exposure is limited, both in quality and quantity, so our understanding is likely to develop further as new data on the transmission modes of <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> emerges, Thus, there remains uncertainty over the relative importance of the primary modes of transmission of <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>, along with uncertainty over exposure times, proximity, infective dose, and the relative likelihood of <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> originating in the workplace or the community. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume (and there is preliminary evidence) that some workplaces/workers will be at higher risk of infection due to higher levels of exposure related to job and workplace characteristics, and that this risk varies by age, sex, country, and labour market position.</p>

<h2>Occupation and mortality from COVID-19</h2>

<h3>
<abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> data</h3>

<p>42. The Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr>) has published three bulletins reporting analyses of deaths for England and Wales involving COVID-19 by occupation, the first for 2494 deaths aged 20 to 64 up to 20 April 2020, the second for 4761 deaths aged 20 to 64 registered (rather than based on the date of death), between 9 March and 25 May 2020 and the most recent for 7961 deaths aged 20 to 64 from 9 March to 28 December 2020 (<abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> 2020c,d,e). Information from the third publication is presented and discussed here.</p>

<p>43. Population counts for occupations were obtained from the Annual Population Survey (<abbr title="Annual Population Survey">APS</abbr>), using data collected in 2019. The <abbr title="Annual Population Survey">APS</abbr> is the largest ongoing household survey in the UK, based on interviews with members of randomly selected households. The survey covers a range of diverse topics, including information on occupation, which is then coded using the SOC2010 Manual (<abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> 2010). The population counts were restricted to those aged 20 to 64 years and were weighted to be representative of those living in England and Wales. Mortality rates for the broader population of all usual residents in England and Wales were based on the mid-year population estimates for 2018.</p>

<p>44. Cause of death on death certificates is coded using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (<abbr title="International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision">ICD-10</abbr>). Deaths involving the <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> virus (COVID-19) include those with an underlying cause, or any mention, of <abbr title="International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision">ICD-10</abbr> codes U07.1 (COVID-19, virus identified) or U07.2 (COVID-19, virus not identified). <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> applied an age restriction, selecting deaths among those aged 20 to 64 years, because of limitations of occupational mortality data for those outside these ranges; within these only those deaths with an occupation recorded on the death certificate at the time of death registration by the informant were included. This information was then coded using the Standard Occupational Classification 2010 (<abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> 2010). This is a hierarchical coding system in which jobs are classified in terms of their skill level and skill content; ‘skill’ is defined in terms of the nature and duration of the qualifications, training and work experience required to become competent to perform the associated tasks in a particular job. There are nine Major job groups (see Table 2 below) ranging from Managerial jobs through to ‘Elementary occupations’; these are numbered 1 to 9 (<abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> 1-digit codes).  These are then subdivided into Sub-major groups (<abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> 2-digit), Minor groups (<abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> 3-digit) and Unit groups (<abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> 4-digit).</p>

<p>45. The analyses are presented as age standardised death rates (<abbr title="age standardised death rates">ASDRs</abbr>) per 100,000 (with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI)); the 2013 European Standard Population was used for age standardisation. Occupation was analysed by 9 major <abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> groups (<abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> 1-digit), 25 sub-major (<abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> 2-digit), 90 minor (<abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> 3-digit) and &gt;350 individual (<abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> 4-digit) groups of occupations.</p>

<p>46. Of the 7961 deaths that included information on occupation involving COVID-19 in people aged between 20 and 64 between March and the end of December 2020, 60% (4761) occurred between March 2020 and the end of May 2020 with 40% occurring after that. Nearly two-thirds of the 7961 deaths were among men, with 5128 (64.4%) deaths compared with 35.6% (2833 deaths) among women. Men had a statistically higher rate of death involving COVID-19, with 31.4 deaths per 100,000 men of the working population, compared with 16.8 deaths per 100,000 women (Table 1).</p>

<p>47. Of the death certificates of men of working age (20-64 years), 80.6% deaths overall and 82.4% (4225) of those involving COVID-19 included information on occupation. Fewer women’s death certificates included occupational information: 69.0 % overall and 61.5% (1742) involving COVID-19 (Appendix Table 2).

The Relative Risk (<abbr title="Relative Risk">RR</abbr>) for each occupational group has been estimated by dividing the death rate/100,000 for the specific occupation by the overall death rate per 100,000 (31.4 deaths per 100,000 men of the working population; 16.8 deaths per 100,000 women of the working population). Occupations are presented where the <abbr title="Relative Risk">RR</abbr> is:</p>

<p>a. more than double and with 20 or more registered deaths<br>
b. slightly less than doubled but with 20 or more registered deaths<br>
c. more than double but based on &lt;20 registered deaths</p>

<p>52. The <abbr title="Relative Risks">RRs</abbr> are more than 3 for the first 7 4-digit occupations for males (Table 3) and a further 8 are more than doubled. The care workers/home carers category is the only 4-digit category with large numbers of deaths with a <abbr title="Relative Risk">RR</abbr> that is more than doubled for women; however, there are several other categories with small numbers of deaths including hairdressers, sewing machinists, chefs, house-parents and shopkeepers.</p>

<p>53. The findings for male transport workers are of particular interest because they involve workers in the same industry who have varying degrees of contact with the public. Nearly a third (28%) of the total deaths (739) among taxi and cab drivers and nearly a quarter (23%) of the total deaths (367) among bus and coach drivers between March and December 2020 were from COVID-19. There were high death rates and <abbr title="Relative Risks">RRs</abbr> for these groups. These are occupations which involve frequent contact with the public. However, the death rate for male van drivers (limited contact with the public) and large goods vehicle drivers (<abbr title="large goods vehicle">LGV</abbr> lorries) (little or no contact with the public) were both 39.7/100,000 population, only a little above the overall death rate. This supports the hypothesis that occupations with high levels of public contact (in this case taxi and cab drivers and bus and coach drivers) have high risks of COVID-19 death compared to similar occupations that have little contact with the public (for example, van drivers, large goods vehicle drivers).</p>

<p>54. The <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> deaths rates have been adjusted for age and sex and not for other factors such as deprivation, region and ethnicity. Whilst the rates amongst cab/taxi drivers appear considerably elevated relative to the other driving groups, there are currently no data amongst drivers which take ethnicity into account (see paragraphs 34 and 35). According to Department of Transport data from 2019/20, 52% of taxi drivers were of white ethnicity and 37% Asian or Asian British (Department of Transport, 2020). Likewise, a high proportion of London bus and coach drivers are male (93%) and of non-white ethnicity (79%). (Goldblatt &amp; Morrison). Initial analysis of deaths amongst London bus drivers identified 27 deaths from COVID-19, 20 of which occurred amongst drivers of black (41%) or Asian (33%) ethnicity; 22% were of White ethnicity. Moreover, 18% of the deaths occurred amongst drivers aged &gt; 65 years even though they accounted for only 4% of the workforce.</p>

<p>55. The potentially high risk of exposure to <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> amongst those working in the care and personal services occupations has been highlighted above. The death rates for this sector overall (<abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> 3-digit code 614) were 91/100,000 for males and 38.3/100,000 for females giving <abbr title="Relative Risks">RRs</abbr> of 2.9 and 2.3 respectively. The largest 4-digit <abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> code sub-group is care workers and home care workers. There were 204 deaths in care workers and home carers between March and the end of May 2020 and a further 143 up to the end of December. More than three times the risk of death was found for males and nearly three times for females. Elevated risks were also found for other 4-digit subgroups including both male and female nursing auxiliaries and male ambulance men although risks were not always doubled.</p>

<p>56. In the health care sector, a <abbr title="Relative Risk">RR</abbr> of more than double was found for male nurses with a smaller increase for female nurses (Tables 3 and 4). <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> carried out specific analyses for two large categories of workers grouping together various SOC2010 codes; health care workers (including doctors, nurses and midwives, nurse assistants, paramedics and ambulance staff, and hospital porters), and social care workers (including care workers and home carers, social workers, managers of residential care institutions, and care escorts). Rates of death involving COVID-19 among men (79.1/100,00, 150 deaths) and women (35.9/100,000, 319 deaths) social care workers were more than doubled compared with the general population (adjusted for age and sex) in England and Wales. The rates of death involving COVID-19 were lower for health care workers and not more than doubled- 44.9/100,000 for men (190 deaths) and 17.3/100,000 for women (224 deaths). However, combining such a diverse group of workers who may have different risks may have obscured true associations for some types of workers. As shown in Tables 3 and 4, elevated death rates were found among some of the individual health care professions such as nurses and nursing auxiliaries and assistants.</p>

<p>57. Food preparation and the hospitality trade have also been highlighted as workplaces where increased exposure to <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> may occur, as has retail work. As shown in Table 3, increased <abbr title="Relative Risks">RRs</abbr> have been found in several occupations within these industries in both males and females. Other areas of concern include security, cleaning, local and national administration, postal work and hairdressing.</p>

<h2>Discussion of strengths and limitations</h2>

<p>58. As acknowledged by the <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> (<abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> 2020d) the data used may suffer from various biases. One potential problem is for numerator-denominator bias to occur because the deaths and the population denominators were classified (by occupation) at different times and in different data systems. The numerator data comes from the death certificates and occupation was missing for a relatively high proportion of men (18%) and very high proportion of women (40%). Numerator-denominator bias may occur if the non-recording of occupation is systematically biased. In general, this problem is likely to be minor, but there may be exceptions, for example if health care workers were more likely to have their occupations recorded on death certificates by informants, whereas some other occupations were less likely to be recorded, or if the accuracy of the recording differs by occupation (for example, if a mid-level office worker is recorded as a ‘Manager’). <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> point out that the occupation recorded on the death certificate may reflect the deceased’s main lifetime occupation rather than their job at the time of death. <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> comment that the occupations found to have higher rates of death involving COVID-19 are generally consistent with other evidence on occupations where exposure is more likely to occur.</p>

<p>59. The denominator data comes from the Annual Population Survey (<abbr title="Annual Population Survey">APS</abbr>), using data collected in 2019. The <abbr title="Annual Population Survey">APS</abbr> is the largest ongoing household survey in the UK, based on interviews with members of randomly selected households. The survey covers a range of diverse topics, including information on occupation, which is then coded to <abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> 2010. The population counts are also restricted to those aged 20 to 64 years and are weighted to be representative of those living in England and Wales. Such surveys can never be fully comprehensive and are always subject to some responder bias.</p>

<p>60. A further potential problem is that of negative numerator bias i.e. under-counting of deaths involving COVID-19 and attributed to occupation. The Chief Coroner (England and Wales) has re-asserted that such cases of deaths which might be attributed to employment must be notified to the coroner using a “low threshold test; [which is] lower even than a prima facie case and requiring only grounds for surmise.” (Lucraft 2020). This bias may be substantial (Agius 2020a). If the coroner decides to proceed to an inquest, then usually only a (non-registrable) Certificate of Fact of Death (<abbr title="Certificates of Fact of Death">CFD</abbr>) is issued i.e. one where neither the cause nor the occupation are recorded. This would mean that these deaths are unlikely to be registered for at least one year (Agius 2020a) and would not be available for inclusion in the <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> data until then.</p>

<p>61. The causes of death recorded on death certificates may also be subject to uncertainties and inaccuracies. <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> included all deaths ‘involving’ COVID-19, i.e. whether they were the underlying cause in Part 1 of the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death or in Part II (contributory). This might introduce bias if there were to be an association between comorbidity and occupation (for example if workers in the security sector were pursuing a second career for health reasons). In addition, <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> included deaths for which the <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> virus was identified for example, through testing (ICD code U07.1) but also those where the virus had not been formally identified (ICD U07.2).</p>

<p>62. <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> were unable to calculate age-standardised mortality rates for some 4-digit occupations when the population data for those occupations was deemed to be unreliable. Most of these occupations had very small numbers of deaths. However, for 4-digit <abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> code 9139, ‘elementary process plant occupations not elsewhere classified’, there were 100 male deaths and 25 female deaths. Occupations in 9139 include engineering factory hands and labourers, fitter/electrician mates, and machinery and work area cleaners. The death rate for the overall 3-digit category, ‘elementary process plant occupations’, (3-digit code 913) was more than doubled for men 143.2/100,000 based on 120 deaths, (<abbr title="Relative Risk">RR</abbr>=3.7) and for women 49.9/100,000 (<abbr title="Relative Risk">RR</abbr>=3.0), based on 33 deaths.</p>

<p>63. The interpretation of <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> results regarding the risk of COVID-19 and the likelihood of exposure to <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> thus partly depends on the level of aggregation within the <abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> codes from 9 broadly defined 1-digit Major groups of occupations that include a wide range of jobs through to occupations coded to 4-digits which are more specifically defined in terms of the tasks and jobs performed. The downside of more specificity is that the numbers of deaths in specific occupations coded at the 4-digit level may be fairly small and this has indeed occurred in the data for women.  This is illustrated in the seemingly disparate results for health care workers described above. The <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> analysis of a large group of health care occupations with wide ranging jobs and potential exposures to <abbr title="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome">SARS</abbr>-CoV-19 did not show any increased risk of death from COVID-19. However, for men, the 4-digit group ‘nurses’ and the 4-digit group ‘nursing auxiliaries and assistants’ had more than double the risk. For women, although the risks were elevated for these two categories they were not double but were based on much smaller numbers of deaths.</p>

<p>64. More than double the risk for women was found at the 3-digit <abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> code level for managers and proprietors in hospitality and leisure services (3-digit <abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> code 122, 26 deaths, death rate 35.1100,000), hairdressers and related services (3-digit <abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> code 622, 26 deaths, death rate 39.8/100,000) and assemblers and routine operators (3-digit <abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> code 813, 21 deaths, death rate 39.2/100,000). For men the 3-digit <abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> code 331, protective service occupations (Officers in the police, fire and prison services, police community support officer and other community protective professionals) showed double the risk of death from COVID-19, 67 deaths, death rate 71.2/100,000.</p>

<p>65. The <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> death rates are age-adjusted but have not been adjusted for any other variables including deprivation, ethnicity and region. These adjustments may reduce the difference in <abbr title="age standardised death rates">ASDRs</abbr>. However, the significant (more than) doubling of some of the <abbr title="age standardised death rates">ASDRs</abbr> shown above is unlikely to be eliminated by such adjustment. On the other hand, it cannot be ruled out that some of the elevated risks in tables 3 and 4 may be reduced (and may be less than doubled) once these adjustments have been done. This particularly applies to transport workers where it is possible to make a comparison within the same broad occupational category. It is also possible that the high COVID-19 death rates found in certain ethnic groups or areas may be due to occupational exposures (rather than the high death rates in certain occupations being due to ethnicity or area of deprivation). Currently, these questions are unresolved. The <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> report on ethnic differences in COVID-19 deaths up to the end of July 2020 also noted that ‘an imbalance across ethnic groups working in at-risk occupations, such as front-facing occupations, could be a determining factor’.</p>

<h2><abbr title="Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Regulations">RIDDOR</abbr></h2>

<p>66. Another source of information on occurrences of and deaths from COVID-19 is the Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Regulations (<abbr title="Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Regulations">RIDDOR</abbr>) 2013 data which is collected by the Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>). <abbr title="Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Regulations">RIDDOR</abbr> places a legal duty on employers to make reports to the enforcing authorities (i.e. to <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> or to Local Authorities) about work-related accidents which cause death or serious injury, diagnosed cases of certain industrial diseases and ‘dangerous occurrences’ i.e. incidents with the potential to cause serious harm. Accurate disease reporting depends on the reliable attribution of a case of disease to an occupational exposure. This is particularly difficult in the case of COVID-19 because the infection is prevalent in the general community.</p>

<p>67. The <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> guidance (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> 2020a) relating to COVID-19 and <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> is complex but could be summarised as follows:</p>

<p>A report under <abbr title="Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Regulations">RIDDOR</abbr> should be made when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a person at work (a worker) has been diagnosed as having COVID-19 attributed to an occupational exposure to coronavirus (reported as a ‘case of disease’)</li>
  <li>a worker dies as a result of occupational exposure to <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>. (reported as a work-related death)</li>
  <li>an accident or incident at work has, or could have, led to the release or escape of <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>, reported as a dangerous occurrence</li>
</ul>

<p>68. To determine whether there is reasonable evidence linking the nature of the person’s work with an increased risk of becoming exposed to <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> guidance indicates that account should be taken of whether or not work activities increased the risk of <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> exposure, there was any specific, identifiable incident leading to an increased risk of exposure, or the person’s work directly brought them into contact with a known <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> hazard without effective control measures. Cases where a registered medical practitioner has highlighted the significance of work-related factors in relation to a diagnosis of COVID-19 would also be reportable.</p>

<p>69. The <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> guidance states that for an occupational exposure to be judged as the likely cause of the disease, it should be more likely than not that the person’s work was the source of exposure to <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> as opposed to general societal exposure. In this context, work with the general public, as opposed to work with persons known to be infected, would not in itself be considered sufficient to indicate that a COVID-19 diagnosis is likely to be attributable to occupational exposure. Unlike for the usual diagnoses of occupational disease, for pragmatic reasons the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> accept that cases of COVID-19 can be reported without a registered medical practitioner’s written diagnosis, for example, on the basis of laboratory test results (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> 2020a).</p>

<p>70. National Statistics relating to <abbr title="Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Regulations">RIDDOR</abbr> published by <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> do not routinely include disease notifications due to data limitations, particularly the underreporting of cases. However, the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> has published technical summaries of the <abbr title="Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Regulations">RIDDOR</abbr> data for COVID-19. These are published as ‘Management Information’ rather than as more rigorously validated National Statistics. The latest technical summary considered for the purposes of this <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Advisory Council">IIAC</abbr> report collated reports notified to the enforcing authorities over the period 10 April – 12 December 2020 (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> 2020b). The data show that there were 17,895 of cases of COVID-19 (including 223 deaths) in workers where there was ‘reasonable’ evidence to suggest it was caused by occupational exposure in Great Britain (GB) i.e. excluding Northern Ireland (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> 2020b).</p>

<p>71. The weekly number of <abbr title="Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Regulations">RIDDOR</abbr> (GB) notifications for COVID-19 peaked at 1183 (including 23 deaths) in the week ending 2 May 2020, two weeks later than the peak of deaths among the general population, as reported by the <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> (<abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> 2020e) (Agius et al. 2020). The number of <abbr title="Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Regulations">RIDDOR</abbr> notifications began to rise again at the end of August, similarly shadowing the general population trend although the second wave in <abbr title="Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Regulations">RIDDOR</abbr> has not exceeded the weekly first wave <abbr title="Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Regulations">RIDDOR</abbr> peak at least from the data shown in the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> December 2020 summary. The pattern of reporting differed over 2020. The proportion of reports recorded against health and social work activities was higher in the first wave of reporting (10 April through August) than the second wave (September to 12 December) - 78% compared with 53%. In contrast, education and manufacturing combined accounted for less than 2% of all first wave reports, but around 17% of all reports made in the second wave. This could be attributed in part to the re-opening of the economy in July with more reports thence coming through from other sectors. It may also reflect increased awareness of risks in the workplace.</p>

<p>72. Table 5 shows the numbers of notifications from the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>’s December 2020 technical summary by industry sectors defined by Standard Industry Classification (<abbr title="Standard Industry Classification">SIC</abbr>). These are not directly comparable with the <abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> codes used by <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> and tend to be broader groups.  For example, the industry section of ‘human health and social work activities’ could include occupations as diverse as nurses, cleaners, administrators and computer programmers. Over 70% of the notifications and deaths reported in Table 5 were for this industry section. Comparable numbers were reported for the 2 main divisions of this sector, ’human health activities’ and ’residential care activities’. There were also large numbers of reports from ‘personal service activities’ (includes hairdressing and beauty treatment, physical wellbeing activities, laundering and dry cleaning, portering etc) accommodation (hotels and other accommodation) and manufacturing, particularly of food products (not beverages).</p>

<p>*Industry as reported by employers.  A review of a sample of reports coded to <abbr title="Standard Industry Classification">SIC</abbr> 96, 55 and 84 show that many of these are mis-allocation of reports that should have been recorded under residential care or social care activities (<abbr title="Standard Industry Classification">SIC</abbr> 87 or 88)<br>

<p>73. In Northern Ireland <abbr title="Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Regulations">RIDDOR</abbr> is reported to, and collected by, the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> in Northern Ireland (<abbr title="Heath and Safety Executive in Northern Ireland">HSENI</abbr> 2020). According to a communication from <abbr title="Heath and Safety Executive in Northern Ireland">HSENI</abbr> (Ref: FOI/111/2020) within the date range 18 March to 12 August 2020 the total number of <abbr title="Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Regulations">RIDDOR</abbr> reports for COVID-19 (or synonyms) received by <abbr title="Heath and Safety Executive in Northern Ireland">HSENI</abbr> was 814 (including one death). Of the 814 Reports, 811 related to the health and social work sector, 2 related to the fire and rescue sector and 1 related to manufacturing. However, because of the variation in guidance and in data collation it is not feasible to combine the datasets or to make reliable comparisons for example by sector.</p>

<p>74. The <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> acknowledges various shortcomings in the <abbr title="Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Regulations">RIDDOR</abbr> data including widespread under-reporting of cases and some misallocation in the coding of the industry in which the worker is employed.  In particular, workers in residential and social care are often incorrectly recorded as working in the accommodation sector or in personal service (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> 2020b).  In addition, the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> technical summaries omit data notified before the 10 April 2020 (HSE2020a) (Agius 2020b). The summaries may tend to exclude COVID-19 cases due to work in jobs that do not entail dealing with people known to be infected but with the general public, for example the transport sector. (HSE2020a). Nevertheless, acceptance of cases where a registered medical practitioner has highlighted the significance of work-related factors may have led to the numbers reported in industries such as food manufacture (Agius 2020a). The <abbr title="Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Regulations">RIDDOR</abbr> data provide useful additional information of occupations where COVID-19 cases occur but the data need to be interpreted in the light of the above limitations (Agius 2020a, Agius 2020b) including potential underreporting in many and perhaps all occupations.</p>

<h2>Occupation and infection rates from <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>
</h2>

<h3>
<abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> infection rates and occupation</h3>

<p>75. Information on the risks of infection by <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> is becoming increasingly available for both the general population and by occupational sector. Access to testing in the UK and other countries was limited in the early months of the pandemic with sectors such as healthcare being prioritised. Many studies were thus opportunistic and focused on infection rates in healthcare settings.  Interpretation is often limited by biases introduced by test availability and by the potential for inclusion and recall biases, small sample sizes or unclear participation rates, lack of comparator populations, imprecise exposure estimates, absence of control for confounders, and insufficient information about outcomes.</p>

<h3>Healthcare workers</h3>

<p>76. Chou et al identified 85 studies of infection rates in healthcare workers up to October 2020 (Chou et al 2020).  The incidence of <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> ranged from 0.6% to 50% based on <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions">RT-PCR</abbr> testing, and the prevalence ranged from 1.6% to 32% based on antibody testing.  Galanis et al carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of 49 studies of <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> antibodies involving 127,480 subjects.  7 of the studies were from the UK. The overall seroprevalence of <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> antibodies was 8.7% (95% CI 6.7,10.9%). The UK studies reported prevalence rates ranging from 6% to 44%. These differences in infection rates in health care staff are likely to reflect varying prevalence rates in the local communities, staff roles and the extent to which these involved contact with infected patients, the extent to which the normal capacity of the service was strained, the availability and use of protective equipment, and possibly other factors.</p>

<p>77. Houlihan and colleagues recruited 200 high-risk frontline healthcare workers in a London hospital between March 26 and April 8, 2020 (Houlihan et al 2020).   23% had evidence of <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> antibodies at recruitment, and 45% of 181 subjects who were retested one month later were positive.  21% had positive <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions">RT-PCR</abbr> tests.  Infection rates varied from 37% amongst those working in the intensive care unit to 51% amongst those on the acute admission unit. The infection was asymptomatic in about half of the cases.</p>

<p>78. A similar study in another London teaching hospital reported virology and staff sickness results from screening of 1045 staff (about 11% of the total) for <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> between March 18 and May 3 2020 (Zheng et al 2020).  <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> infection rates in the healthcare workers largely rose and declined in parallel with the number of community cases. White and non-White ethnic groups had similar rates of infection. Clinical staff had a higher rate of laboratory-confirmed infection (7.3%) than non-clinical staff (2.8%), but total sickness rates were similar. Rates of infection varied from 17.3% in those working in emergency medicine and 10.4% in acute medicine to 1.9% amongst pharmacy workers and 2.4% in women’s services. Rates in the emergency department declined when all staff were advised to use <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. The authors conclude that much of the staff infection was caused by community transmission; however, they acknowledge that department-specific data showing localized clusters of infection indicates that some patient transmission may have occurred.</p>

<p>79. Pallett et al (2020) measured <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> antibodies in previously symptomatic staff and a sample of asymptomatic staff of two London hospitals between April 8 and June 12 2020. 22% of the 6400 staff had experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection, and 47% of those tested (622/1391) had positive antibody tests. 10.6% of the 405 asymptomatic staff also had positive antibody tests. The overall prevalence of antibody test positivity amongst the workforce was estimated at 18%. The authors compared that to a figure of 7.1% for the general London population.</p>

<p>80. Grant et al (2020) studied approximately half of the staff of another London hospital (2167 subjects) who self-referred for <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> antibody tests between May 15 and June 5 2020. Antibodies were detected in 32%, approximately twice the rate in the general London population. 67% of the subjects reported having prolonged direct patient contact and they were more likely to have a positive test (35%; p&lt;0.005) than others. Infection rates were higher amongst those working on COVID-19 wards (41.3-42.0%) compared with those undertaking non-clinical work (22.6%).The rates in intensive care staff were relatively low at 25.0%.  However, account was not taken of control measures to prevent exposure.</p>

<p>81. Eyre et al (2020) reported the results of a volunteer survey of 77% of the staff (10,610 of 13,800) working in 4 hospitals in Oxford, mainly in the first three weeks of May 2020.  Overall, 11.2% of subjects had evidence of infection either from <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions">RT-PCR</abbr> (2.9%), antibody tests (10.7%), or both. The overall UK seroprevalence was 6.8% around the same time (28th May 2020).</p>

<p>82. Risk factors for a positive test included: household contact with a confirmed case (38.5% vs 10.7%); contact with an infected patient without using <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> (17.0% vs 9.6%) and work on wards caring for COVID-19 patients (22.6% vs 8.6%). Porters and cleaners had the highest rates (18.6%), followed by physiotherapy, occupational and speech and language therapists (14.9%) and nurses/healthcare-assistants (14.2%).  Rates also varied by self-described ethnicity:  White 9.5%; Asian 16.8%; Black 18.0%; Chinese 7.5%; Mixed 11.6%. Multivariate analysis showed increased risks associated with household contact with a known case (adjusted <abbr title="odds ratio">OR</abbr> 4.82, 95% CI 3.45, 6.72), working in a COVID-19 facing area (adjusted <abbr title="odds ratio">OR</abbr> 2.47, 95% CI 1.99, 3.08), and workplace exposure to a suspected or known COVID-19-positive patient without <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> (adjusted <abbr title="odds ratio">OR</abbr> 1.44, 95% CI 1.24,1.67).</p>

<p>83. A cohort of all Scottish healthcare workers employed by the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> on 1 March 2020 was linked to the Community Health Index (CHI) database, a registry of all patients registered to receive care from the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> in Scotland, to obtain the unique CHI number for each individual (Shah et al. 2020). The CHI number was used to create a cohort linking these data on healthcare workers to several Scotland-wide datasets containing individual level clinical information for virology testing for <abbr title="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome">SARS</abbr> CoV-2, general hospital admission data, community prescribing, critical care admissions, and the national register for deaths. The CHI database also enabled identification of all individuals who were not themselves healthcare workers but shared a household with a healthcare worker.</p>

<p>84. The cohort consisted of 158,445 healthcare workers, 57% patient-facing, and 229,905 household members. 17.2% (360/2097) of hospital admissions in the 18-65 age range were in healthcare workers or their households. After adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and comorbidity, the risk of admission due to COVID-19 in non-patient facing healthcare workers and their households was similar to the risk in the general population. Patient-facing healthcare workers were at higher risk of hospital admission compared with non-patient facing healthcare workers, (hazard ratio (HR)= 3.30, 95% CI 2.13, 5.13), as were household members of patient facing healthcare workers (HR =1.79, 95% CI 1.10, 2.91). After sub-division of patient-facing healthcare workers into those who worked in “front door,” intensive care, and non-intensive care aerosol generating settings and other, those in front door roles were at higher risk (HR = 2.09, 95% CI 1.49, 2.94). The authors comment that healthcare workers may potentially present earlier, improving their survival for a given severity of COVID-19, and/or they may have a lower threshold for admission.</p>

<p>85. Iversen et al (2020) carried out <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> antibody tests on 29,884 Danish health care workers (97% participation rate) and in 4672 randomly selected blood donors aged 18 to 64. The seroprevalence was significantly higher in the health care workers than in the blood donors (4.04% vs 3.04%, <abbr title="Relative Risk">RR</abbr>=1·33, 95% CI 1·12,1·58).    Frontline hospital workers had a significantly higher seroprevalence compared with the remaining health-care workers (4.55% vs 3.29%, <abbr title="Relative Risk">RR</abbr>=1·38, 95% CI 1·22,1·56); as had those working on a dedicated COVID-19 ward (7.19% vs 4·35% for other frontline staff; <abbr title="Relative Risk">RR</abbr>=1·65, 95% CI 1·34, 2·03).</p>

<p>86. Jespersen et al (2020) carried out a similar antibody study on 17,987 (69% of the total) healthcare workers and administrative staff in central Denmark, and on 360 blood donors. The overall prevalence of positive antibodies was 3.4% in the healthcare workers and 0.6-1.2% in the blood donors.  There were marked regional differences with test positivity ranging from 1.2%-11.9%. Test positivity was higher in younger workers.  In the higher prevalence area, there were associations with type of work: aHRs compared with secretaries were 7.3 (95% CI, 3.5, 14.9) for nurses; 4.0 (95% CI, 1.8, 8.9) for doctors; and 5.0 (95% CI, 2.1, 11.6) for laboratory staff (who carried out phlebotomy and thus had close patient contact).  There was a close association with previous <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> positivity in 4364 workers who had undergone both tests.</p>

<p>87. Sims et al (2020) carried out antibody tests on 20,614 of 43,000 staff at 8 Michigan hospitals.  8.1% were positive.  There were associations with age, ethnicity, and job category. Those doing direct patient care had a higher seropositivity rate (9.5%, 95% CI 9.1%, 10.0%) than those who did not (7.0%, 95% CI 6.3%, 7.6%).  Those with the greatest contact (phlebotomy, respiratory therapy, and nursing staff) had a significantly higher rate (11.0%, 95% CI 10.4%, 11.7%) than those with most direct patient contact (physicians or clinical support (7.4%, 95% CI 6.7%, 8.0%). The use of face masks was associated with lower rates of seropositivity.</p>

<h2>Community studies including health and social care workers</h2>

<p>88. The records of participants in the UK Biobank cohort, resident in England, alive and aged less than 65 years in 2020 and employed or self-employed at baseline data collection (2006-2008) were linked to <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> test results from Public Health England (16 March to 26 July 2020) (Mutambudzi et al. 2020).  A comparison was made between the occupation data collected at baseline and that collected for a subsample of the cohort (n=12,306) who participated in further data collection when attending a clinic visit to participate in the UK Biobank Imaging between 30 April 2014 and 7 March 2019 (median August 2017). A high correlation (r=0.71, p&lt;0.001) was found between job at baseline and follow-up indicating a high likelihood that participants had continued working in the same profession. The analyses adjusted for baseline demographic, socioeconomic, work-related, health, and lifestyle-related risk factors. Of 120,075 participants, 271 were defined as having severe COVID-19, defined as a positive test taken in a hospital setting.</p>

<p>89. After adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity and country of birth, relative to non-essential workers, healthcare workers (<abbr title="Relative Risk">RR</abbr>=7.43, 95% CI 5.52,10.00), social and education workers (<abbr title="Relative Risk">RR</abbr>=1.84, 95% CI:1.21,2.82) and other essential workers (<abbr title="Relative Risk">RR</abbr>=1.60, 95% CI 1.05,2.45) had a higher risk of severe COVID-19. Medical support staff had particularly high risks (<abbr title="Relative Risk">RR</abbr>=8.70, 95% CI 4.87,15.55),</p>

<p>90. Nguyen et al (2020) reported the findings from a prospective cohort study of the UK and USA general communities, including frontline health care workers, who voluntarily reported information through the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application (developed by Zoe Global Ltd).   4.7% of the 2.1 million users self-identified as health care workers.  There were 5545 reports of a positive <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> test between March 23 and April 23 2020.   Front-line health-care workers were 11.6 times more likely than others to report a positive test (adjusted HR 11·61, 95% CI 10·93, 12·33). The association was more marked in the UK (adjusted HR =12·52, 95% CI 11·77, 13·31) compared with the USA (adjusted HR 2·80, 2·09, 3·75).</p>

<p>91. Health care workers were 4-5 times more likely than others to have a <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> test suggesting that the higher rate of test positivity could have been in part related to eligibility for testing. A further analysis with weighting for predictors of testing also showed a greater risk of infection among front-line health-care workers (adjusted HR=3·40, 95% CI 3·37, 3·43), which was higher in the UK (3·43, 95% CI 3·18, 3·69) than in the USA (1·97, 95% CI 1·36, 2·85).  The authors also noted that the development of combinations of symptoms that were predictive of <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> infection were more common in health-care workers (adjusted HR= 2·05, 95% CI 1·99–2·10).  Amongst health care workers there were increased risks for those reporting caring for patients with documented COVID-19 (adjusted HR=4·83, 95% CI 3·99, 5·85), suspected COVID-19 (adjusted HR=2·39, 95% CI 1·90–3·00), and using inadequate personal protective equipment (adjusted HR=5·91, 95% CI 4·53, 7·71).</p>

<p>92. <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> carried out a series of community surveys of <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> infection using <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions">RT-PCR</abbr> between 26 April and 27 June 2020.  1.58% (95% CI 0.99-2.38%) of individuals who reported working in patient-facing healthcare or resident-facing social care roles had a positive test compared with 0.27% (95% CI 0.22, 0.34%) in those not working in these roles<sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:4" class="govuk-link">[footnote 4]</a></sup>. A later analysis carried out between 2 September and 16 October 2020 found no cases in resident-facing care home workers, and no significant difference between infection rates in patient-facing health care workers (0.37%, 95% CI 0.25, 0.54%) and rates in other professions (0.44%, 95% CI 0.39, 0.49%).</p>

<p>93. The <abbr title="Real-Time Assessment of Community Transmission">REACT</abbr>-1 <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions">RT-PCR</abbr> study carried out between May and November 2020 demonstrated differences in infection rates by age, sex, ethnicity, household size, COVID-19 contact history, symptoms, and employment type.   In the first round of testing carried out in May 2020 health care and care home workers had higher infection rates (0.50%, 95% CI 033%, 0.76%) compared with other workers (0.09%, 95% CI 0.06, 0.13%). In the second round of testing carried out between 19 May and 7 July 2020 there were no significant differences in infection rates between health care/ care home workers (0.09%, 95% CI 0.04, 0.18%) and other workers (0.08%, 95% CI 0.06, 0.11%). There have been no significant differences between occupational groups in any subsequent rounds up to November 2020.</p>

<p>94. The <abbr title="Real-Time Assessment of Community Transmission">REACT</abbr>-2 antibody study also identified higher rates of infection in health and social care workers. In the first round of testing carried out between 20 June and 13 July 2020 antibody tests were positive in 12.91% (95% CI 11.61, 14.32%) of self-reported patient-facing health care workers and 19.56% (95% CI 16.42, 23.10%) of self-reported client-facing care home workers. That compared with 6.50% (95% CI 6.20, 6.82%) of other workers. The proportion of positive tests in ‘other workers’ had declined to 4.35% (95% CI 4.1, 4.56%) by the time of the third round of testing (15-23 September), and had declined to 11.09% (95% CI 8.96, 13.59%) in client-facing care home workers. It had increased slightly to 13.37% (95% CI 12.33, 14.47%) in patient-facing health care workers.  That suggests an ongoing greater risk of infection in health care workers than in other groups but that cannot be quantified as it is superimposed on declining levels of antibodies in those with earlier infection.</p>

<h3>Other workers</h3>

<p>95. Compared with health and social care workers, much less information has been published so far about risks of infection in other groups of workers.</p>

<p>96. The <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> infection survey demonstrated higher rates of COVID-19 infection in those who reported working outside their home between 26 April and 27 June (0.56%, 95% CI 0.59, 0.77%) compared with those who reported working at home (0.15%, 95% CI 0.07, 0.28%). The figures are not adjusted to take account of potential covariates such as ethnicity and socio-economic status.</p>

<p>97. The UK Biobank study (Mutambudzi et al. 2020) demonstrated higher rates of severe COVID-19 in social and education workers (<abbr title="Relative Risk">RR</abbr>=1.84, 95% CI 1.21, 2.82) and other essential workers (<abbr title="Relative Risk">RR</abbr>=1.60, 95% CI 1.05, 2.45) compared with non-essential workers. Occupation coded to 4- digit <abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> code was classified into five broad groups (non-essential workers, healthcare workers, social and education workers, police and protective service and ‘other’ essential workers and within these into eight more precise categories of essential workers: healthcare professionals (for example, doctors, pharmacists); health associated professionals (for example, nurses, paramedics); medical support staff (nursing assistants, hospital porters); social care workers, education workers, food workers, transport workers, and police and protective services (including sanitary service workers).  Social care (<abbr title="Relative Risk">RR</abbr>=2.46, 95% CI 1.47, 4.14) and transport workers (<abbr title="Relative Risk">RR</abbr>=2.20, 95% CI 1.21, 4.00) had the highest risks within the broader groups. Compared to white non-essential workers, non-white non-essential workers had a higher risk (<abbr title="Relative Risk">RR</abbr>=3.27, 95% CI 1.90, 5.62) and non-white essential workers had the highest risk (<abbr title="Relative Risk">RR</abbr>=8.34, 95% CI 5.17,1 3.47). Using SOC2000 major groups, associate professional and technical occupations, personal service occupations and plant and machine operatives had higher risks, compared to managers and senior officials. (Note: the authors carried out several analyses using different models that adjust for the above co-variates with several others including socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors co-morbidity etc). It should be noted however that there are small numbers of participants with severe COVID-19 in some job categories in this study, for example only 7 food workers.</p>

<p>98. A study of the entire population of Norway included approximately 3.5 million residents aged 20-70 and investigated whether employees in occupations that typically involve close contact with other people (including pupils/students/patients/customers), coded to the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-08) codes were at higher risk of COVID-19 and related hospitalization, for the first (February to July) and second (July to October) wave of infection in Norway (Magnusson et al 2020). Nurses, physicians, dentists, and bus and tram drivers had more than doubled risk of COVID-19 during the first wave of infection when compared to everyone in their working age. Excess risks for these occupations were not found in the second wave of the epidemic. Bartenders, waiters, food service counter attendants, taxi drivers and travel stewards had 1.5-4 times the odds of COVID-19 when compared to everyone in their working age. Teachers had no increased or only a moderately increased risk of COVID-19 in either wave. None of the included occupations had any particularly increased risk of severe COVID-19, indicated by hospitalization, when compared with all infected in their working age apart from dentists, who had an <abbr title="odds ratio">OR</abbr> of 7.66 (95% CI 3.17,18.5) and pre-school teachers, child-care workers and taxi, bus and tram drivers who had a 1-2 times increased <abbr title="odds ratio">OR</abbr>. The authors note that there were no hospitalizations for several occupations, and that for many occupations there were small numbers of cases with wide confidence intervals.</p>

<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>99. Many of the studies of health care workers have shown high rates of COVID-19 infection. The rates are generally higher than those reported in general population surveys but few studies have made any direct comparison with a control population. More readily available access to testing amongst health care workers might have contributed to the high risks demonstrated in some studies. This potential bias could also have occurred in some of the community-based studies reviewed for example, the Biobank and Nguygen studies and participation bias is a risk in these studies. Other studies that attempted to obtain random population samples are less likely to have been subject to that bias.</p>

<p>100. The community studies do generally point to a higher rate of infection in health and social care workers compared with others in the earlier phases of the epidemic.  They also provide some evidence that the risks reduced from May 2020 onwards.</p>

<h2>Clusters and outbreaks in workplaces</h2>

<p>101. There have been numerous reports of outbreaks and clusters of COVID-19 in a variety of occupational settings. A report from fifteen countries from the European Union, the European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>/<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) and the United Kingdom (UK) described 1376 clusters of COVID-19 which occurred between March and early July 2020 (COVID-19 clusters and outbreaks in occupational settings in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>/<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> and the UK. Stockholm: ECDC; 2020). The majority of occupational COVID-19 clusters reported were from the health sector, with large numbers of clusters also reported from the food packaging and processing sectors, in factories and manufacturing and in office settings.</p>

<p>102. The UK clusters were in food processing and also in retail and sales. For example, a cluster was identified in a chicken processing plant in Anglesey where there were 58 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among staff on site, out of a workforce of 560 people. Another cluster was seen in a meat factory in Yorkshire where 165 workers tested positive for COVID-19<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>103. This paper reports on evidence concerning the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health of workers in the UK during 2020. In evaluating the evidence, the Council notes that the health effects of infection with <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> in the workplace are indistinguishable from those resulting from non-occupational infection.</p>

<p>104. Much of the focus of this interim report is on occupational mortality data based on death certificates, in particular the reports made by <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> throughout 2020 and early 2021. These data were amongst the first occupational data to emerge in the UK, and up to the time of preparing this report it remains the most comprehensive source of information about occupational risks. Other information on infection and hospitalisation rates by occupation have also been evaluated, together with information on patterns of exposure to <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>.</p>

<p>105. Although this report deals primarily with deaths associated with <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> infection the Council recognises that morbidity associated with the Post-COVID-19 syndrome is likely to cause a substantial health burden and potential long-term disability.  At present there is insufficient information about the characteristics of post-COVID-19 syndrome and its association with occupation for that to be considered further in the current report. The Council will address this issue as additional information becomes available.</p>

<p>106. The risk of infection has been shown to increase with direct contact with an infected individual, living in a care home or living in a household with five or more individuals. There is evidence from several large outbreaks that physical close proximity in workplaces increases the risk of infection in workers, as does close proximity to infected individuals in health and social care settings. There is, however, limited scientific evidence on the exact modes of transmission of COVID-19 in both workplaces and community settings and scarce data on dose, exposure frequency and length of exposure. Moreover, there is limited evidence about the extent to which workplace measures such as distancing, the use of physical barriers, and personal protective equipment reduce the likelihood of infection and lessen any occupational risks.</p>

<p>107. The mortality data published by <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> demonstrate that the occupations that show increased risks are largely those where there is regular contact with the public and/or patients. For men, fifteen occupations (<abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> 4-digit) with more than 20 deaths had at least a two-fold risk of death from COVID-19 with the highest rates found in food processing, care work, transport, security, nursing, local, national and local government administration and retail work.  For women there were large numbers of deaths and a high death rate for care work. Food processing, and retail work were also of concern although with small numbers of deaths, as were nursing, sewing machining and hairdressing.</p>

<p>108. The findings were adjusted for age, but not other factors such as ethnic group, place of residence and deprivation. The distribution of ethnic groups among workers in some occupations differs from that of the general population, for example in the transport industry, as does the distribution of other factors such as area of residence, type of housing etc. Adjustment for these factors might potentially result in reduced estimates of risks associated with occupation but is unlikely to substantially affect the high risk identified in the <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> data.</p>

<p>109. The <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> mortality data do not always provide a consistent pattern of the risks, with some being increased in males but not females or in different subgroups of the same industry, such as food processing. Many of these inconsistencies are due to small numbers in the more specific occupations coded to <abbr title="Standard Occupational Classification">SOC</abbr> 2010 4-digits. It is unlikely that the risks for males and females in the same jobs will be substantially different although worker practices may differ.</p>

<p>110. There are also seemingly disparate results in risk between different levels of aggregation of occupations. For example, an analysis of a large category of health care occupations grouped together did not show any increased risk whereas the specific jobs, nurses and nursing assistants, showed a doubling of risk for men and a smaller but still increased risk for women. The risk of exposure to <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> in analyses of larger groups may be diluted due to the wide-ranging nature of the jobs included as compared with analyses of the more specific occupations.</p>

<p>111. The Council notes that the available mortality data may suffer from a number of limitations. Occupation is under-reported on death certificates particularly for women and may be inaccurate, for example, the usual or longest-held job may be reported rather than that immediately prior to death. The <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> data include cases with and without confirmation of a positive test, although it is likely to be largely accurate for those who received hospital treatment. A high rate of Coroner referrals and delayed reporting of deaths in health care workers, or redeployment of staff away from their usual role may also have impacted on the results. In addition, the risk of death is likely to be modified by the provision of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> but this information cannot be directly inferred from death certificates.</p>

<p>112. The occupational classification used for <abbr title="Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Regulations">RIDDOR</abbr> is not directly comparable to that used for the <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> mortality data. However, occupations with large numbers of notifications overall and fatal notifications tend to mirror those with high rates of death in the <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> data; these include human health and social work activities, transportation and storage, education, and personal service activities. The <abbr title="Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Regulations">RIDDOR</abbr> scheme depends on awareness by employers of the requirement for notification and it is acknowledged that there is general underreporting; There were also marked differences for some occupations between numbers reported at different phases of the pandemic suggesting changes in patterns of in reporting behaviour. However, the <abbr title="Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Regulations">RIDDOR</abbr> data provide useful additional indication of occupations where COVID-19 cases and deaths occur.</p>

<p>113. Many of the initial studies of the risk of infection in workplaces were opportunistic and small and carried out predominantly in health care settings where testing was more readily available. The studies generally found high rates of infection in health care workers. Community studies involving testing for the <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> virus or antibodies also indicate a higher rate of infection (several with more than two-fold risk) in health care workers, particularly ‘frontline workers’, and social care workers compared with others. The UK Biobank also showed more than a two-fold increased risk in transport workers. The results from these studies appear to have been partly influenced by the date at which they were carried out and the phase of the pandemic with respect to the use of prevention measures. For example, the <abbr title="Real-Time Assessment of Community Transmission">REACT</abbr> studies tend to show increased rates in the earlier phases of the epidemic; they also provide some evidence that the risks reduced in the summer of 2020.</p>

<p>114. The Council’s evaluation of the evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health of workers has highlighted the inadequacy of available information on occupation. In addition to problems of using death certificate data, highlighted above, the Council notes that most of the studies of infection and hospitalisation rates were unable to include analyses by occupation or adjust for this; occupational information is rarely routinely collected in many healthcare data systems.</p>

<p>115. These problems may have contributed to perceived disparities in occupationally-related risks in different subgroups. For example, the gender disparity observed in the <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> analyses of deaths by occupation may partly reflect the smaller numbers of death certificates with occupational information for women and/or the imprecision and inaccuracies in the occupational information. There are also disparities in risk of infection, hospitalisation and death in people of non-white ethnicity backgrounds compared with those of white ethnicity background; individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds may be more likely to live in larger (multigenerational) households, are often employed as essential workers, less likely to be able to work from home and have jobs that involve more contact with other workers and/or the general public. Assessing the influence of these related characteristics remains challenging. In their evaluations, <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Advisory Council">IIAC</abbr> does not generally take account of confounders other than those that are clearly established competing causes of the disease of interest. In addition, it should be noted that the available data used for many of the current prescriptions is often limited; for example, only studies of men may be available but this does not preclude women in the relevant occupations from claiming <abbr title="Industrial Injury Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>116. In this interim report, <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Advisory Council">IIAC</abbr> has reviewed the evidence relating to the health risks of infection by <abbr title="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome">SARS</abbr>-COV-2 and has discussed the strengths and weaknesses of the information. The Council has found evidence that:</p>

<p>a. some workplaces and thus workers are at higher risk of COVID-19 due to higher levels of exposure related to job and workplace characteristics<br>
b. higher infection rates are found in workers in healthcare, social care, and transport, particularly in the first wave of the pandemic. The risk of suffering severe COVID-19 is also increased in social care and transport workers in the UK<br>
c. analyses of UK death certificates between March and December 2020 showed more than doubled risk in several occupations especially for males, including social care, nursing, bus and taxi driving, food processing, retail work, local and national administration and security<br>
d. the large number of <abbr title="Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Regulations">RIDDOR</abbr> disease (including death) reports for COVID-19 for these occupations mirror the death data; <abbr title="Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Regulations">RIDDOR</abbr> also provides evidence of high numbers of cases in other occupations such as education</p>

<p>117. The Council concludes that there is a clear association between several occupations and increased risk of death from COVID-19 but acknowledges that the consistency and extent of the mortality data, and the lack of adjustment for factors such as deprivation, means that the evidence is currently too limited and of varying quality to justify prescription at this stage. Information regarding any link between occupation and risk of disability following COVID-19 is currently scarce The Council therefore concludes overall that the evidence is not at present sufficient for prescription. However, the evidence of a doubling of risk in several occupations indicates a pathway to potential prescription and the Council expects that future data will inform this. The Council will recommend prescription if and when there is strong enough evidence that occupational exposures cause disabling disease on the ‘balance of probabilities.’</p>

<p>118. The Council will continue to monitor the literature for future published papers and reports. The Council is aware of several ongoing studies. They are particularly interested in large good quality studies of workers and workplaces and also community-based studies regarding both death and long term effects of infection with <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Prevention</h2>

<p>119. Development of COVID-19 requires human-to-human transmission of the virus, <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>, so the only way to prevent the disease is to stop the virus being transferred from an infectious person to the nose or mouth of an uninfected individual. Preventive measures seek to reduce exposure by minimising emission of virus from the infected person, for example by wearing a face covering and maintaining physical distance between people, reducing transmission through the environment, for example by providing good air ventilation and by protecting the person at risk of infection, for example by requiring the wearing of a visor and respirator. However, because transmission may occur by multiple routes, i.e. by inhaling aerosol, intercepting large droplets or hand contact with contaminated surfaces, complete prevention for workers is not feasible. While exposure levels vary in different workplaces, exposure is difficult to quantify and people can be infective even when asymptomatic. So, it is prudent to apply as much control as is practicable for the workplace concerned, with a variety of control measures likely being required.</p>

<p>120. This includes carrying out a COVID-19 risk assessment, maintaining adequate physical distance where possible, use of physical barriers, for example screens, and appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, providing good ventilation, and maintaining regular sanitisation of hands and touch-points. In high-risk jobs, particularly where there is close contact with potentially infected persons, such as in healthcare, public transport and retail, the level of intervention will need to be proportionally higher to achieve optimal control. The <abbr title="British Occupational Hygiene Society">BOHS</abbr> Risk matrix (see Appendix Table 1) provides general advice on control strategies. Official government advice on workplace prevention is available from the <a href="www.gov.uk/coronavirus" class="govuk-link">GOV.UK</a> website and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/index.htm" rel="external"><abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>121. Pharmacological prevention is also developing, with vaccination being the most obvious strategy. As yet, the overall preventive potential of these strategies remains unknown, and it will be considerable time before herd protection can be envisaged. As we learn more about the virus and its transmission, our understanding of the best approaches to prevention will evolve further.</p>

<h2>Glossary</h2>

<p><abbr title="Certificates of Fact of Death">CFD</abbr>: Certificates of Fact of Death (also known as Coroners’ interim death certificates) which can be used to notify asset holders and other organisations of the death and to make an application for probate.</p>

<p><abbr title="Medical Certificate of Cause of Death">MCCD</abbr>: Medical Certificate of Cause of Death - issued by a doctor after someone has died. It details the cause of death and is required to register the death.</p>

<h3>Measures of association</h3>

<p>Statistical significance and P values: Statistical significance refers to the probability that a result as large as that observed, or more extreme still, could have arisen simply by chance. The smaller the probability, the less likely it is that the findings arise by chance alone and the more likely they are to be ‘true’. A ‘statistically significant’ result is one for which the chance alone probability is suitably small, as judged by reference to a pre-defined cut-point. (Conventionally, this is often less than 5% (p&lt;0.05)).</p>

<p>Relative Risk (<abbr title="Relative Risk">RR</abbr>): A measure of the strength of association between exposure and disease. <abbr title="Relative Risk">RR</abbr> is the ratio of the risk of disease in one group to that in another. Often the first group is exposed and the second unexposed or less exposed. A value greater than 1.0 indicates a positive association between exposure and disease. (This may be causal, or have other explanations, such as bias, chance or confounding.) <abbr title="Relative Risk">RR</abbr> is measured or approximated by other measures in this glossary, such as the Odds Ratio, Standardised Incidence Ratio and Standardised Mortality Ratio.</p>

<p>Odds Ratio (<abbr title="odds ratio">OR</abbr>): A measure of the strength of association between exposure and disease. It is the odds of exposure in those with disease relative to the odds of exposure in those without disease, expressed as a ratio. For rare exposures, odds and risks are numerically very similar, so the <abbr title="odds ratio">OR</abbr> can be thought of as a Relative Risk. A value greater than 1.0 indicates a positive association between exposure and disease. (This may be causal, or have other explanations, such as bias, chance or confounding.)</p>

<p>Standardised Mortality Ratio (<abbr title="Standardised Mortality Ratio">SMR</abbr>): A measure of the strength of association between exposure and mortality; a form of Relative Risk in which the outcome is death. The <abbr title="Standardised Mortality Ratio">SMR</abbr> is the ratio of the number of deaths (due to a given disease arising from exposure to a specific risk factor) that occurs within the study population to the number of deaths that would be expected if the study population had the same rate of mortality as the general population (the standard).</p>

<p>By convention, <abbr title="Standardised Mortality Ratios">SMRs</abbr> (and proportional mortality ratios, as described below) are usually multiplied by 100. Thus, an <abbr title="Standardised Mortality Ratio">SMR</abbr> (or <abbr title="proportional mortality ratio">PMR</abbr>) of 200 corresponds to a <abbr title="Relative Risk">RR</abbr> of 2.0. For ease of understanding in this report, <abbr title="Standardised Mortality Ratios">SMRs</abbr> (or <abbr title="proportional mortality ratios">PMRs</abbr>) are quoted as if <abbr title="Relative Risks">RRs</abbr>, and are not multiplied by 100. Thus, a value greater than 1.0 indicates a positive association between exposure and disease. (This may be causal, or have other explanations, such as bias, chance or confounding.)</p>

<p><abbr title="age standardised death rate">ASDR</abbr>: age standardised death rate -  the death rate of a population adjusted to a standard age distribution. It is calculated as a weighted average of the age-specific death rates of a given population; the weights are the age distribution of that population.</p>

<p>Hazard ratio: A measure of how often a particular event happens in one group compared to how often it happens in another group, over time. In cancer research, hazard ratios are often used in clinical trials to measure survival at any point in time in a group of patients who have been given a specific treatment compared to a control group given another treatment or a placebo. A hazard ratio of one means that there is no difference in survival between the two groups. A hazard ratio of greater than one or less than one means that survival was better in one of the groups.</p>

<h3>Other epidemiological terms</h3>

<p>Prevalence:  the proportion of a particular population found to be affected by a medical condition (typically a disease or a risk factor such as smoking). It is derived by comparing the number of people found to have the condition with the total number of people studied, and is usually expressed as a fraction, as a percentage, or as the number of cases per 10,000 or 100,000 people. It is the total number of cases of a disease in a given area during a given time period.</p>

<p>Seroprevalence: the number of persons in a population who test positive for a specific disease based on serology (blood serum) specimens; often presented as a percent of the total specimens tested or as a proportion per 100,000 persons tested.</p>

<p>Systematic review: a complex piece of research which aims to identify, select and synthesise all research published on a particular question or topic. Systematic reviews adhere to a strict scientific design based on pre-specified and reproducible methods. They provide reliable estimates about the effects of interventions.
Meta-analysis: a statistical procedure for combining data from multiple studies. When the treatment effect (or effect size) is consistent from one study to the next, meta-analysis can be used to identify this common effect. The effect may be summarised as a meta-estimate of relative risk (meta-<abbr title="Relative Risk">RR</abbr>).</p>

<p>Risk: the probability that an event will occur (for example, that an individual will develop disease within a stated period of time or by a certain age).</p>

<p>Incidence rate or incidence: the rate of occurrence of a new event of interest (for example, cancer) in a given population over a given time period. (The rate is often expressed in terms of cases per year of ‘person-time’, and so incorporates the numbers at risk of the event, the time for which they are at risk and the numbers that go on to develop that event.)</p>

<p>Confidence Interval (CI): the Relative Risk reported in a study is only an estimate of the true value of relative risk in the underlying population; a different sample may give a somewhat different estimate. The CI defines a plausible range in which the true population value lies, given the extent of statistical uncertainty in the data. The commonly chosen 95% <abbr title="Confidence Intervals">CIs</abbr> give a range in which there is a 95% chance that the true value will be found (in the absence of bias and confounding). Small studies generate much uncertainty and a wide range, whereas very large studies provide a narrower band of compatible values.</p>

<p>Bias: a systematic tendency to over- or under-estimate the size of a measure of interest in a study.
Numerator-denominator bias: a systematic distortion due to a denominator which does not match the numerator, or vice versa. For example, when calculating the mortality rate of a population, a numerator-denominator bias will occur if the numerator does not relate to the population in the denominator. This would be the case if the numerator contained all deaths that occurred within a particular country, whereas the denominator contained only the resident population.</p>

<p>Confounding: arises when the association between exposure and disease is explained in whole or part by a third factor (confounder), itself a cause of the disease that occurs to a different extent in the groups being compared.
Comorbidity: is the presence of two or more conditions occurring in a person, either at the same time, or successively (one condition which occurs right after the other).</p>
