<h2>What this guide is about</h2>

<p>This guide explains what you, as an employer, need to do if Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) Debt Management asks you to implement a Direct Earnings Attachment (<abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr>). Where you receive a notice to operate a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> we ask you to read the information contained in this guide. It provides information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> is</li>
  <li>how a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> operates</li>
  <li>how to calculate a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>your responsibilities</li>
  <li>how to make payments to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management</li>
</ul>

<p>This guide is intended to help you understand the main points about a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr>. It is not a full description or statement of the law.</p>

<p>Further guidance which includes worked examples can be found in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/direct-earnings-attachments-an-employers-guide/direct-earnings-attachment-a-more-detailed-guide">more detailed guide for employers</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>Introduction to a Direct Earnings Attachment</h2>

<p>The Welfare Reform Act 2012, which became law in March 2012, allows <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management, part of the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to ask you as an employer, to make deductions directly from a customer’s earnings. We (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management) do this by asking you to operate a Direct Earnings Attachment (<abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr>). We do not have to go through the civil courts to do this, unlike for example the Attachment of Earnings Order (<abbr title="Attachment of Earnings Order">AOE</abbr>) process.
Within the Welfare Reform Act, the legislation covering DEAs, part of the Social Security (Overpayment and Recovery) Regulations 2013, came into force on 8th April 2013 and these regulations are available on the internet. Note that these regulations are only in force in England, Scotland and Wales and so exclude Northern Ireland, Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> has its own regulations and operates differently from other orders such as a Deduction from Earnings Order (<abbr title="Deduction from Earnings Order">DEO</abbr>), AEO and Council Tax Attachment of Earnings Order (<abbr title="Council Tax Attachment of Earnings Order">CTAEO</abbr>). A <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> does not replace any of these other orders and in some circumstances employers may receive requests to implement deductions for multiple orders for the same employee.</p>

<p>Local Authorities, who can recover monies resulting from Housing Benefit (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>) overpayments, also have the power to issue a Direct Earnings Attachment under this legislation. Please note, however, that this guidance reflects only DEAs operated by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<h2>How does a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> arise?</h2>

<p>Where the Secretary of State has been unable to recover monies owed to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> from customers not in receipt of a benefit, and who have not voluntarily agreed to repay, those monies may be recovered by deduction from the customer’s earnings.</p>

<p>We will send you a formal notice for each qualifying employee asking you to implement a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr>, including basic instructions on how to do this.</p>

<p>We will include the National Insurance number of the employee on all departmental letters sent to you.</p>

<p>It is important that you quote this reference number:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on any correspondence you send to us</li>
  <li>in the payment/payee reference field if you make an online BACS payment for an individual employee</li>
  <li>on the back of a cheque if you make a cheque payment for an individual employee</li>
  <li>if you are making a card payment for one employee</li>
</ul>

<h2>What legal responsibilities and duties does a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> place on an employer?</h2>

<p>You have a legal obligation to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>calculate a deduction based on the net earnings (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#net-earnings">information on net earnings</a>) for each pay date (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#dea-calculated">How is a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> calculated?</a>), or</li>
  <li>apply a fixed amount calculated by us if we ask you to do so</li>
  <li>pay us the amounts deducted (other than your administrative costs) by the 19th day of the month following the month in which the deduction is made</li>
  <li>ensure payments to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management carry the required reference, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management use the employee’s National Insurance number, that allows us to allocate to the customer’s accounts</li>
  <li>keep a record of each employee from whom a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> deduction has been made, together with the amount of each deduction</li>
</ul>

<p>If you fail to comply, you may be subject, upon conviction, to a fine of up to £1,000 per notice.</p>

<p>You have a duty to notify the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management in writing or by phone within 10 days of the date of the <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> notice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when someone we have asked you to implement a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> for does not work for you</li>
  <li>when, and the date from which, an employee ceases to be in your employment</li>
</ul>

<p>If either of the above applies you will need to notify us in writing at the address shown at the top of the <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> notice letter, or by phone.</p>

<p>You have a duty to your employee:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to notify your employee in writing of:
    <ul>
      <li>the amount of the deduction taken, including any amount taken for administrative costs (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#administrative-costs">section on administrative costs</a>)</li>
      <li>how the deduction amount was calculated</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The above information may be provided on the payslip for the pay period to which the deduction relates.</p>

<p>Ensure you advise your employee that deductions will be made from their wages/salary and made over to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management, well in advance of the payday when the first deduction will be made.</p>

<p>If you have any problems or queries relating to the <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr>, please contact our dedicated employer helpline number on:</p>

<h2>Protected and net earnings</h2>

<h3>Protected Earnings</h3>

<p>Where we ask you to operate a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> you must consider what is known as the Protected Earnings amount which is an amount equal to 60% of an employee’s net earnings. This means that for each pay period where a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> calculation is applicable, you must additionally ensure (after adding the amount of the <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> to the total amount of other orders that may be already in place) that your employee is left with at least 60% of their net wage.</p>

<p>In cases where the addition of the <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> would increase the overall amount of deductions to more than 40% of the net wage, the <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> deduction must be adjusted to an amount that will leave the employee with 60% of their net earnings. This applies even where we have asked you to apply a fixed rate deduction.</p>

<p>Therefore, in the circumstance where (before the consideration of a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> deduction) other orders are already in place and the employees net wage is already equal to or less than 60% of their overall and initial net wage (some other orders do not apply the protected earnings consideration), you should not deduct any <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> amount calculated for that pay period. However, you must still check if a deduction applies for the next and every subsequent pay period, and additionally ensure that a schedule is sent to us in respect of this pay period, as we will have been expecting to receive a payment.</p>

<h3>Net earnings</h3>

<p>For the purposes of calculating a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> deduction, net earnings means earnings after the deduction of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Income Tax</li>
  <li>Class 1 National Insurance, and</li>
  <li>superannuation contributions</li>
</ul>

<h3>What does count as earnings?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>wages</li>
  <li>salary</li>
  <li>fees</li>
  <li>bonuses</li>
  <li>commission</li>
  <li>overtime pay</li>
  <li>occupational pensions, if paid with wages or salary</li>
  <li>compensation payments</li>
  <li>statutory sick pay</li>
  <li>payment in lieu of notice</li>
  <li>most other payments on top of wages</li>
</ul>

<h3>What does not count as earnings?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>statutory maternity pay</li>
  <li>statutory adoption pay</li>
  <li>ordinary statutory paternity pay</li>
  <li>statutory Shared parental pay</li>
  <li>any pension, benefit, allowance or credit paid by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, a local authority or Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>a guaranteed minimum pension under the Pensions Scheme Act 1993 (b)</li>
  <li>amounts paid by a public department of the Government of Northern Ireland or anywhere outside the United Kingdom</li>
  <li>sums paid to reimburse expenses wholly and necessarily incurred in the course of the employment</li>
  <li>pay or allowances as a member of Her Majesty’s forces, other than pay or allowances payable to them by you as a special member of a reserve force</li>
  <li>statutory Redundancy Payments</li>
</ul>

<p>You must continue to calculate a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> deduction every pay day until either one of the following change of circumstances occurs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we advise you to stop – you may receive this request by telephone, which will be confirmed later in writing</li>
  <li>the employee leaves your employment</li>
  <li>the employee dies and the salary is paid after the date of the employee’s death</li>
  <li>the amount to recover is no longer outstanding or</li>
  <li>we ask you to apply a <a class="govuk-link" href="#fixed-rate-deductions">fixed rate deduction</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>How is a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> calculated?</h2>

<p>There are two deduction percentage rates for calculation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Standard Rate.</li>
  <li>Higher Rate.</li>
</ol>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management will let you know which of these rates we want you to apply, when we contact you about setting up the <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr>. The rate we ask you to apply may change throughout the life of the <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr>, from Standard to Higher and vice versa, and you will be notified of this by letter.</p>

<p>After considering an employee’s protected earnings requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>calculate the employee’s net earnings for the pay period</li>
  <li>find the correct deduction percentage rate based on:
    <ul>
      <li>the frequency of their pay (apply frequency rate from Table A for Standard Rate or Table B for Higher Rate)</li>
      <li>the net earnings figure</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>multiply the net earnings figure by the percentage rate – Standard or Higher – to calculate the <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> amount</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Note: If you are calculating a DEA based on a daily rate, you must also multiply the daily rate figure by the number of days in the pay period. (please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/direct-earnings-attachments-an-employers-guide/direct-earnings-attachment-a-more-detailed-guide">more detailed guide for employers</a> at 7.12 a) and b))</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management will notify you which rate – Standard or Higher – you must apply to the <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> for an individual employee. The rate we ask you to apply may change throughout the life of the <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr>, from Standard to Higher and vice versa, and you will be notified of this by letter.</p>

<p>If you need to confirm with us that you are deducting at the correct rate, you can do this by phone.</p>

<h2>Fixed Rate Deductions</h2>

<p>In exceptional circumstances we may write to you to apply a fixed rate deduction amount for an employee. This revised amount should be applied from the next (and each subsequent) pay date following the date you receive the notice. However, if the earnings for any pay date are below the threshold (see Tables A and B above) then no <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> deduction can be applied.</p>

<p>You must always ensure that the Protected Earnings Rate is taken into account, including when we have asked you to apply a fixed rate deduction.</p>

<h2>Other Orders and Priorities</h2>

<p>After calculating the <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> amount, you must consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>other priority orders in place, and</li>
  <li>the protected earnings amount</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> can be imposed without a court order, but if your employee has any other deduction orders against them there are rules that tell you which you should take first.</p>

<p>If your employee has one or more of the following in place, or they are received after a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> notice has been received, these will take priority over a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> (and are known as priority orders):</p>

<h3>England &amp; Wales:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Deduction from Earnings Order (<abbr title="Deduction from Earnings Order">DEO</abbr>) from Child Maintenance Group (<abbr title="Child Maintenance Group">CMG</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Attachment of Earnings Order (AEO) for Maintenance or Fines</li>
  <li>Council Tax Attachment of Earnings Order (<abbr title="Council Tax Attachment of Earnings Order">CTAEO</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scotland:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Deduction of Earnings Order (<abbr title="Deduction from Earnings Order">DEO</abbr>) from <abbr title="Child Maintenance Group">CMG</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Conjoined Arrestment Order (<abbr title="Conjoined Arrestment Order">CAO</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Earnings Arrestment (<abbr title="Earnings Arrestment">EA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Current Maintenance Arrestment (<abbr title="Current Maintenance Arrestment">CMA</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Where you already have either an <abbr title="Earnings Arrestment">EA</abbr> or <abbr title="Current Maintenance Arrestment">CMA</abbr> in place for an employee and you receive a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> notice from us, you do not have to apply to the courts for a conjoined order.</p>

<p>Applying for a conjoined order only applies where you receive other Scottish orders.</p>

<p>Once these priority orders have been taken into account in your calculation a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> will then take priority over any other orders, known as non-priority orders or notices (such as Local Authority Housing Benefit DEAs), in date order (see below).</p>

<p>The order of non-priority orders will be decided by the date of the notice. For Scottish orders this will be decided by the date they were received.</p>

<h3>Student Loans</h3>

<p>A student loan is not an order but if it is being recovered, it is treated in exactly the same way as a priority order. This applies in both England &amp; Wales and Scotland.</p>

<p>If you have any further enquiries on orders or priorities, please contact us using:</p>

<h2>First <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> deduction (payday)</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> notice issued to you has effect from the next pay day which falls on or after 22 days after the date on the notice letter. As an example, if a notice is issued on 2nd September 2015; the first pay date would be on or after the 24th September 2015.</p>

<p>Payments to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management need to be made in line with your payroll and at least on a monthly basis. If your employee is paid monthly or four weekly, payments must match this cycle. If your employee is paid weekly, payments may be made either weekly as the deduction is taken or on a per month basis. Regardless of the payment cycle remittance to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management must be made by the 19th of the month following the date the deduction was made.</p>

<h2>Administrative costs</h2>

<p>For each pay period where a calculation results in a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> deduction, you may take up to
£1.00<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> from your employee’s earnings towards your administrative costs. This charge is to cover your costs so do not send this administration cost deduction to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management. You can take this charge even if it reduces the employee’s income below the 60% protected earnings amount.</p>

<p>Please note that the administration charge of £1.00 is only applied when a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> deduction is actually made, and cannot be deducted for any pay period when no <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> deduction is made.</p>

<h2>Responsibilities</h2>

<h3>Employer</h3>

<p>It is your responsibility to ensure you calculate the deduction correctly from your employee’s net earnings each pay period and pay that amount to us. When you calculate the <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> deduction amount, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure that your employee has enough net earnings in the pay period for you to calculate a deduction (see Table A)</li>
  <li>check that the correct percentage rate Standard or Higher has been applied against those net earnings</li>
  <li>check that the total of all deductions does not exceed 40% and therefore leave the employee with less than the protected earnings amount which is 60% of their total net earnings during the calculating period to which the deduction relates</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management has a legal requirement to issue a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> 2 (letter to employer to implement <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr>) to the employer address provided by <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. Even though you may have contracted a payroll provider to undertake your payroll activities associated with <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr>, it is your responsibility to ensure the DEA2 is forwarded to the payroll provider. Do not ask <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management to amend your employer address as provided by <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> to direct the DEA2 to your payroll provider.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management</h3>

<p>It is Debt Management’s responsibility to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact you if you fail to make a payment to us when it is due</li>
  <li>contact you to verify payment information, if applicable</li>
  <li>refund monies directly to an employee when the balance of the debt has been reduced to zero but a further payment has been received from an employer</li>
  <li>return monies to an employer where, under the regulations, no <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> payment should have been made, for example:
    <ul>
      <li>a payment made to us in error as the earnings for that pay period were under the earnings threshold and no <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> deduction should therefore have been made</li>
      <li>a payment made to us in error because other deductions were already 40% or greater of net earnings for that pay period, and therefore no <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> deduction should have been made</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In either of these circumstances you should contact us on the employer helpline number (0800 916 0614) for information on how these monies can be returned to you.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management is not able to:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>return monies to an employer where a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> payment was applicable, but was calculated at an incorrect rate, for example:
    <ul>
      <li>where we have received a payment greater than the one which should have been calculated for a specific pay period. In this case, and from the following pay period(s), you should reduce the amount to be deducted by the excess previously taken. For example, an employer sends a payment for £100 when only £80 was due. At the next pay period the amount of the <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> to be deducted should be reduced by £20</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>trace and return monies to an employer, where:
    <ul>
      <li>the employer has sent a payment meant for us to another department or account. In this case you should still make a payment to us but additionally make contact with the other department in order to recover the money you incorrectly paid</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Making payments to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management</h2>

<p>You are required to pay the amount you have calculated and deducted from your employees net wages to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management as soon as possible. Ideally this will be at the same time as you make the deduction(s) from your employee’s salary. However, you must send us the payment no later than the 19th day of the month following the month in which you have taken it (For example, if you take the money on 30th September, you
must send it to us before 19th October; if you take the money on 1st October, you must send it to us before 19th November).</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management offer several Method of Payment options to employers. These options are explained in detail in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#methods-of-payment">Methods of payment</a> section to ensure that payments sent to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management contain the relevant information to allow them to be allocated correctly to the employees account.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Note: Under no circumstances should you send us a cash payment.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management bank details are:</p>

<p>Account Number: 10025634<br>
Sort code: 60-70-80<br>
Payment / Payee Reference: It is critical that you enter one of the two references illustrated below, as applicable.</p>

<p>Please use either:</p>

<p>1. National Insurance number where you are making:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a single BACS payment in respect of an individual employee, or</li>
  <li>a series of single BACS payments in respect of each of a number of individual employees</li>
</ul>

<p>In both these cases, as each individual payment will be allocated to a National Insurance number it is not necessary for you to separately issue <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management with a payment schedule.</p>

<p>2. <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> where you are making a single consolidated BACS payment for more than one employee. In this instance, a payment schedule (see Appendix 1) is required to allow <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management to correctly allocate payments to individual’s accounts. It is critical that a payment schedule is completed and sent to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management for each consolidated BACS payment. Failure to do this will result in unnecessary contact to you from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management.</p>

<p>Appendix 2 shows two examples of how the Payment/Payee Reference fields should be completed for a BACS payment, for an individual employee and for more than one employee.</p>

<p>The account screen you use for making BACS (online) payments may look different to the ones shown in the examples in Appendix 2.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Cheque</h3>

<p>You can also pay by cheque. The cheque should be made payable to:</p>

<div class="contact">
<p>DWP DM</p>
</div>

<p>and sent to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Freepost DWP DEA DM
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>This is a one line address and you must not mark your envelope in any other way.</p>

<p>It is critical that you write on the reverse of the cheque one of the two references illustrated below, as applicable.</p>

<p>Please use either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>National Insurance number for a payment for an individual employee only</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> for a payment for more than one employee</li>
</ul>

<p>It is also critical that a payment schedule (see Appendix 1) is completed and sent to us for each cheque payment you make, and that the total amount on the schedule and the cheque match. Failure to do so will mean that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management will not be able to allocate payments to the correct accounts and will result in unnecessary contact to you from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Card</h3>

<p>If you wish to make a payment by debit card (or Visa Debit, Debit MasterCard, Maestro, Solo and Visa Electron) use the telephone number 0800 916 0614. Please have your card details and the employee’s National Insurance number to hand along with your letter when you ring.</p>

<p>You do not need to complete a payment schedule when paying by card.</p>

<p>A card payment can only be made for one individual employee and you must quote the National Insurance number when you telephone. If you have more than one employee, you must make a separate payment for each employee.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> Payment Schedule</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management requires that a payment schedule be completed and issued in order to ensure that the correct payment is allocated to the correct customer account – and prevents any unnecessary contact to you from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management.</p>

<p>However, you do not need to complete and issue a schedule provided that the employee’s National Insurance number is given as a reference if you are making either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a single BACS payment for one employee or</li>
  <li>a series of single BACS payments for a number of individual employees, or</li>
  <li>a card payment for one employee</li>
</ul>

<p>In all other circumstances, a schedule must be completed and issues to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management. Other circumstances include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a BACS payment that consolidates a number of individual <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> deductions into one payment</li>
  <li>a cheque payment</li>
  <li>where a £0.00 deduction is being made<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a number of individual <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> deductions have been consolidated into one payment (either by BACS or cheque), all the individual deduction details can be entered onto one schedule provided that the total adds up to the payment made.</p>

<p>For each schedule entry you make, the following information must be included on the schedule:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the full name for each employee the payment relates to</li>
  <li>the National Insurance number for each employee the payment relates to</li>
  <li>the amount attributable for each employee</li>
  <li>reason for any £0.00 deduction<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>the total payment amount (this should agree to the payment you made by BACS (online banking) or cheque</li>
  <li>an employer contact name and telephone number</li>
</ul>

<p>The schedule in all cases should be sent to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Freepost DWP DEA DM
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>This is a one line address and you must not mark your envelope in any other way.</p>

<p>If you wish to use your own schedule, the following information must be included on the schedule:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the full name for each employee the payment relates to</li>
  <li>the National Insurance number for each employee the payment relates to</li>
  <li>the amount attributable for each employee</li>
  <li>reason for any £0.00 deduction</li>
  <li>the total payment amount (this should correspond to the payment you made by BACS or cheque.</li>
  <li>an employer contact name and telephone number</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sending Payment Schedules via email</h2>

<p>Following a successful trial with selected employers, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management have introduced an email route to receive payment schedules from employers, and are promoting it as the preferred way for payment schedules to be sent. By employers providing the data via email, the process of allocating payments to our customer records on our <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management systems is more efficient and results in fewer queries.</p>

<p>For data security reasons the data required for the email payment schedule is slightly different to that on the paper schedule. Our solicitors have advised that by restricting the data recorded on the email payment schedule <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management will still have enough information to correctly allocate payments to our customer records, whilst minimising the risk of personal data being fraudulently used should the email fall into the hands of a third party. We have confirmed that schedules do not need to be encrypted before emailing.</p>

<p>For the email payment schedule, the following information is to be supplied for each employee:</p>

<ul>
  <li>date of payment</li>
  <li>amount</li>
  <li>National Insurance Number</li>
  <li>initials of employee (max of 5 initials)</li>
  <li>identify whether payment is by BACS or cheque</li>
  <li>reason for any nil deductions</li>
</ul>

<p>Further information for cheques only:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sort code</li>
  <li>account number</li>
</ul>

<p>To participate and send payment schedules to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management via email we require a Declaration to be signed by an organisation/company representative with the authority to commit your organisation/company to the agreement.

<h2>Questions and answers</h2>

<h3>Where do I find more detailed guidance and worked examples (for example, irregular pay, holiday pay, multiple jobs etc) on how to calculate a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> deduction?</h3>

<p>More detailed guidance about how to operate a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> (including worked examples) can be found in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/direct-earnings-attachments-an-employers-guide/direct-earnings-attachment-a-more-detailed-guide">more detailed guide for employers</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>What if my employee does not earn enough for me to make the deduction?</h3>

<p>If the weekly or monthly earnings are below the threshold (see Table A or Table B) you cannot make a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> deduction, but you must either send us a schedule or contact us via the employers helpline to inform us of this.
You must continue to check if a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> deduction is applicable each pay period until we tell you to stop, the amount to recover is no longer outstanding or your employee leaves your employment.</p>

<p>I have received a letter from the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management to apply a fixed rate amount. What is this?
Employees can contact us to negotiate a fixed <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> deduction rate, which is usually a lower amount than the <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> deduction calculated by you. If we decide a fixed rate is applicable, we will write to you to apply a fixed rate deduction amount. This new rate will apply from the next pay period after you have received the new notice and until we tell you to stop. The protected earnings rules still applies to a fixed rate deduction (see Table A or Table B).</p>

<h3>I have been applying a fixed rate amount as requested by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management but the employees earnings have now changed. What do I do?</h3>

<p>If you receive a notice informing you to apply a fixed rate amount, it should be applied from the next available pay day and continue to apply this rate for future pay periods until <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management contact you to either apply a different rate or advise you to stop deductions altogether. However, no <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> deduction can be made (calculated or fixed rate) from earnings which are below the threshold (See Table A or Table B). The protected earnings rules still apply to a fixed rate deduction.</p>

<h3>I have reduced the <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> deduction from January’s pay period because other orders in place would reduce the employee’s net earnings to below 60% if the full deduction was applied. Do I need to make up the difference in the February pay period?</h3>

<p>No, this should not be carried forward. A deduction should only be carried forward where a shortfall occurs due to an incorrect lesser amount being deducted in error or when one or more deductions have been missed.</p>

<h3>What do I do if I receive a request from a Local Authority to implement a Direct Earnings Attachment</h3>

<p>Local Authorities can use the same regulations as <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management to implement a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr>. However, they are different organisations, and should be treated separately. This guidance only relates to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management DEAs. It is very important that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> payments are sent to the account number and/or address detailed in this leaflet, and Local Authority <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> payments are sent to the account number and/or address provided by that Local Authority. If you send a <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> payment to a Local Authority it is your responsibility to ask the Local Authority to return the money to you, and you must still make a payment to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management and LA DEAs are both non priority orders.</p>

<h3>I send payments to other departments, for example the Child Maintenance Group. Can I use either of their accounts to send <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> deduction payments?</h3>

<p>No. Only use the account details provided in this guide or as shown on the <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> schedule when you make a <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> payment to us. The departments work separately and collect the payments for different reasons. Please note that if you send a payment to another department in error it will be your responsibility to contact the other department and to recover the money.</p>

<h3>What if the employee thinks the amount they owe is wrong?</h3>

<p>If your employee thinks that the amount of money they owe is wrong, you should advise them to contact us on the telephone number at the top of the letter they received about the Direct Earnings Attachment. Please do not provide your employee with the Employer helpline number, as use of this number by an employee will cause a hand-off delay when they contact <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management to resolve their query.</p>

<h3>What if the employee thinks the amount I have calculated is too much?</h3>

<p>If they think that the amount you have calculated is too much, you should first check that the amount you have calculated following the instructions in this guide is correct. If it is correct, you should explain to the employee that you have made the deduction as instructed to do so. If they feel that this is too much for them to manage, you should advise them to telephone on the number at the top of the letter they received about the Direct Earnings Attachment.</p>

<h3>Do I have to send a schedule each time I send <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management a payment?</h3>

<p>Table D illustrates the circumstances when you do not need to send in a schedule and the circumstances when a schedule is necessary.</p>

<p>Sort Code: 60-70-80<br>

<h2>Appendix 2</h2>

<h3>Payment by BACS – payment for one employee</h3>

<p>Payment is for one employee, or is a series of individual payments in respect of each of a number of individual employees – the Payment/Payee reference must be the employees National Insurance number.</p>

<p>If you do not enter the employee’s National Insurance number, or use a different Payment/Payee reference, or you input the National Insurance number incorrectly, this will mean the payment you send will not be received correctly and will not automatically allocate it to their account.</p>

<p>If this happens we may need to take the following action:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contacting you as we will not be aware that the payment has been sent</li>
  <li>manual intervention to trace the customer to match against the right employer</li>
  <li>manually allocating the payment to the employees account</li>
</ul>

<p>This creates delays in payment allocation and unnecessary contact to you from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Payment by BACS – payment for more than one employee</h3>

<p>Payment is a single consolidated BACS payment in respect of more than one employee – the Payment/Payee reference must be <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The Payment/Payee reference <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> identifies to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management that the payment represents a payment from an employer. The action required to manage these payments is different to other multiple payments.
Please ensure you also complete the <abbr title="Direct Earnings Attachment">DEA</abbr> schedule which should contain details for each employee that the payment represents and send the schedule to us as soon as you have made the payment. Failure to send in a schedule will mean that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will not be able to allocate payments to the correct accounts and will result in unnecessary contact to you from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Debt Management.</p>
