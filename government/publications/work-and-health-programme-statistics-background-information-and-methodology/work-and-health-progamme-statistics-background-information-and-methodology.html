<p>The latest release of these statistics can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/work-and-health-programme-statistics">Work and Health Programme statistics collection</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>The underlying data can be accessed through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/" rel="external">Stat-Xplore</a>, an online tool for exploring some of the main Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) statistics.</p>

<h2>Work and Health Programme</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/work-health-programme">Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>)</a> was rolled out in England and Wales between November 2017 and April 2018. It predominantly helps disabled people, as well as the long-term unemployed, and certain priority groups (known as early access groups) to enter into and stay in work.</p>

<p>People are referred by jobcentres to work with organisations, known as providers, from the public, private and voluntary sectors. The providers are paid a service delivery fee as well as outcome related payments when a person reaches a specified level of earnings once in employment, or records 6 months of being in self-employment.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> offers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tailored support to meet individual needs</li>
  <li>utilising contacts so that providers can offer unique support to claimants</li>
  <li>strong links to national and local employers to help participants overcome specific barriers to work</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> providers integrate with local services and health provisions and support local service integration plans, to ensure that progress made by individuals whilst they are on the programme will be sustainable.</p>

<p>The support includes linking up with health, social care and other local services to meet health needs if they are a barrier to work, but the main focus is on overcoming the main barriers to employment not just health support.</p>

<p>Examples of the type of support available may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>participants having personalised support with regular face to face contact, mentoring and peer support</li>
  <li>integrated access to specialist support networks at a local level including health and wellbeing professionals</li>
  <li>support from dedicated employer experts with knowledge of the local labour market and job opportunities</li>
</ul>

<p>Providers will support participants for up to 15 months (456 calendar days). This may be extended for a further 6 months (182 days) to provide in-work support, to a maximum total of 21 months (639 days) on the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Once a participant starts work the providers offer personalised in-work support, to meet the needs of the individual. They ensure that appropriate arrangements for continuation of support, including Access to Work, is in place before the provider support ends.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> was gradually rolled out from 27 November 2017 to national Contract Package Areas, then devolved Local Government Partners.</p>

<p>In other locations, local areas have influenced the Department for Work and Pensionsâ (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) thinking on the design of the programme and the evaluation of potential suppliers, as Devolved Deal Areas. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cambridgeshire and Peterborough</li>
  <li>Sheffield City Region</li>
  <li>West of England</li>
  <li>West Midlands Combined Authority</li>
  <li>Liverpool City Region</li>
  <li>Cardiff Capital Region (a City Deal area)</li>
</ul>

<p>As a means for evaluation, the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> programme is the main strand of a randomised control designed delivery. A small percentage of claimants who are eligible for the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> will be randomly allocated to a control group and will be given standard Jobcentre Plus support for 24 months. This group will support the evaluation of <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Also as part of the evaluation of the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> some districts will operate a similar service called Public Sector Comparator (<abbr title="Public Sector Comparator">PSC</abbr>), to see if jobcentres can deliver similar or better performance in terms of outcomes and costs.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Public Sector Comparator">PSC</abbr> rolled out in January 2018 and runs alongside <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> in 4 districts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and Rutland</li>
  <li>Dorset, Wiltshire, Hampshire and Isle of Wight</li>
  <li>Leicestershire and Northamptonshire</li>
  <li>Devon and Cornwall</li>
</ul>

<h2>Purpose of the statistics</h2>

<p>The purpose of the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> statistics is to inform and present data on the number of people who have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>been referred to the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>started on the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>achieved their first earnings from employment while on the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>achieved a job outcome while on the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the statistics present a measure of the provider performance levels.</p>

<h3>Within <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The information in the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> publication and supplementary tables is used to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>evaluate, develop and support policy, strategy and operational decisions, initiatives and options and business plans</li>
  <li>answer Parliamentary Questions and Freedom of Information requests</li>
  <li>inform Press Office statements</li>
</ul>

<p>Within <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> the statistics will be used by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>policy, strategy, operational support and associated analytical teams</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Private Office and Press Office</li>
  <li>Parliamentary Question, Freedom of Information and briefing teams</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> partners</h3>

<p>These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Local Government Partners â Greater Manchester Combined Authority (<abbr title="Greater Manchester Combined Authority">GMCA</abbr>), London</li>
  <li>Devolved Deal Areas</li>
</ul>

<h3>External users</h3>

<p>Outside <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, the internet-based publication mechanism means that understanding the extent of the varied use of the statistics and data is challenging. However, we have heard from a variety of users during consultation.</p>

<p>These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>local authorities</li>
  <li>non-departmental public bodies</li>
  <li>charities</li>
  <li>business representative and trade bodies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> has progressively been rolled out across all areas since November 2017 until March 2018, meaning there are limitations when comparing areas against each other, as some areas have had up to 3 more months of time on the programme.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> is delivered through a Randomised Control Trial design â this publication reports only on those on the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> and not the other two groups of the trial, the Random Control Group or Public Sector Comparator.  All 3 groups will be included in the impact evaluation.</p>

<p>Within the publication, information is available within chart 7 detailing the distribution of all <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> individual referrals and starts across Contract Package Areas, from November 2017 to the latest available information.</p>

<p>For individuals with multiple referrals, the participant will always be included in the Contract Package Area they were first referred to the Work and Health Programme for the âIndividuals referredâ measure. If that individual did not go on to start on the programme by May 2022, they will be shown in the âIndividuals referred who have not yet startedâ measure for the Contract Package Area they were first referred in. However, if the same individual starts on the programme by May 2022, they will instead be shown in the âIndividuals referred who have startedâ measure for the Contract Package Area where they started.</p>

<p>Note, there is a possibility this area may differ to the area the participant was first referred if the participant moved locations during that period.</p>

<h2>Source</h2>

<p>The main source of data is taken from the Provider Referral and Payment System (<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>) which <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> providers use to record key data attributes and events in the journey of <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> participants (these are: referral, start, outcome, dates, group, area).</p>

<p>This is then combined with both the Labour Market System (<abbr title="Labour Market System">LMS</abbr>) and Universal Credit caseload data to add information about the participantâs age and gender. It is then combined with Real Time Earnings (<abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr>) information to add information on outcomes not captured on <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<p>These are known as administrative (admin) data sources.</p>

<h2>Rounding</h2>

<p>From the August 2020 publication, rounding has been applied to the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> statistics. The headline figures and those accompanying the graphs have been rounded as shown in the following table.</p>

<h2>Definitions and terminology</h2>

<h3>Measures</h3>

<p>The publication contains 5 main measures.</p>

<h4>1. Referrals</h4>

<p>A personâs eligibility for the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> will be decided using clearly defined criteria and key local organisations (including community and voluntary groups) can signpost individuals who wish to volunteer for the programme to Jobcentre Plus. Work coaches in Jobcentre Plus offices will send the details of a person wanting to join the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> to a provider. When a provider acknowledges the referral and contact has been established with the participant this is called a referral. <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> participants can be referred more than once and the figure does not include cancelled or rejected referrals.</p>

<p>As referrals can include multiple referrals for one individual, we also provide a measure of the number of individuals referred which only counts the first referral per person.</p>

<h4>2. Starts</h4>

<p>A start on the programme is recorded when a <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> participant attends the initial face-to-face meeting with the provider. The vast majority of starts should take place within 15 working days, although starts outside of the 15 days may occur if the customer is unable to attend the initial meeting within this timeframe.</p>

<h4>3. First earnings from employment</h4>

<p>The point at which a participant achieves their first earnings from their first employment whilst on the programme. A participant may not necessarily go on to achieve a job outcome. Statistics on first earnings from employment do not include earnings from self-employment.</p>

<h4>4. Job outcomes</h4>

<p>A participant is classed as achieving a job outcome when they have reached a specified level of earnings once in employment or have reached 6 months of being in self-employment.</p>

<p>The specified level of earnings varies across the different areas. The national <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> and the majority of Local Government Partners have an earning threshold as 16 hours per week for 26 weeks at the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates">National Living Wage</a>.</p>

<p>However, for the West London Alliance this is at the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/business-and-economy/london-living-wage" rel="external">London Living Wage</a> and for <abbr title="Greater Manchester Combined Authority">GMCA</abbr> at the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.livingwage.org.uk/what-real-living-wage" rel="external">Real Living Wage</a>.</p>

<p>The expectations for the number of job outcomes to be achieved by the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> are given in these statistics either as a whole, split by eligibility groups or split by providers. The section below gives more information about job outcome expectations.</p>

<h4>5. Provider performance levels</h4>

<p>From the November 2020 publication, the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> statistics include information on provider performance levels. There are key contextual differences to take into account between providers and Local Government Partners (<abbr title="Local Government Partners">LGPs</abbr>). The following section gives more information about job outcome expectations and their context surrounding <abbr title="Local Government Partners">LGPs</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has collaborated with Local Government Partners (<abbr title="Local Government Partners">LGPs</abbr>) on this work, providing <abbr title="Local Government Partners">LGPs</abbr> with a formal opportunity to contribute to discussions. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> remains committed to sharing what we plan to publish, in terms of the style and range of data. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> welcomed and appreciated the level of input and engagement with <abbr title="Local Government Partners">LGPs</abbr>, which has added value to our upcoming release.</p>

<h3>Origin of job outcome expectations</h3>

<p>The expectations used in the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> statistics are the expected number of job outcomes for the programme either as a whole, split by eligibility groups or split by providers. The expectations used in this series were drawn up by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> as a performance anticipation for the programme when it was designed. The expectations are calculated using 2 key measures:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>the proportion of individuals who have started the programme in any given month that are expected to achieve a job outcome at some stage</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how quickly these job outcomes are expected to be achieved throughout the individualâs time on the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>As an illustrative example, if 500 individuals started on the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> in January 2020, they could achieve a job outcome at some stage of the programme. The expectation may be that 1% of these individuals would achieve a job outcome in each of February, March and April 2020. The expectation for the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> would be that 5 individuals from the January 2020 cohort would be expected to achieve a job outcome in each of those 3 months. In total we would then expect 15 individuals from the January 2020 cohort to have achieved a job outcome by the end of April 2020.</p>

<p>These figures were defined by looking at the performance of similar historical programmes, for example âThe Work Programmeâ and âWork Choiceâ programme, when the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> was designed. As a result, a separate expectation for each of the three eligibility groups was created.</p>

<p>When providers submitted bids to deliver the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>, different expectations were supplied by each provider in support of their bids. These expectations were generally higher than those defined by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. These statistics use the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>-defined expectations created at the start of the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> as users can hold greater confidence in these more achievable expectations.</p>

<h3>Important context for performance against expectations</h3>

<p>There are likely to be many factors contributing to differences in actual performance relative to prior expectation.</p>

<p>Local Government Partners (<abbr title="Local Government Partners">LGPs</abbr>) designed elements of the programme, selected their own providers and manage the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> in their regions. Although these regions are often referred to by the <abbr title="Local Government Partner">LGP</abbr> name, it is important to remember there is joint accountability between the providers and the <abbr title="Local Government Partners">LGPs</abbr> themselves.</p>

<p>As part of the devolution agreement for <abbr title="Local Government Partners">LGPs</abbr> to manage their own <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> contracts, <abbr title="Local Government Partners">LGPs</abbr> secured an equivalent amount of funding from the European Social Fund (<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>) to increase the number of places on the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> in these <abbr title="Local Government Partner">LGP</abbr> areas. This provides direct added value. As a result, the expected volume of starts was greater for these <abbr title="Local Government Partners">LGPs</abbr> than if they had funding arrangements equivalent to the other national contracts. This is important because although there was an increased volume of starts, the opportunities for job outcomes were not proportionately larger in these areas. Therefore, it could be more difficult to get this larger volume of participants to achieve an outcome.</p>

<p>There are several factors which havenât been accounted for when comparing performance including socio-economic factors such as educational attainment, over-population, and different demographic groups across regions. Therefore, users should bear this in mind when comparing across regions. Also, the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> began in Contract Package Areas (<abbr title="Contract Package Areas">CPAs</abbr>) a few months before it started in <abbr title="Local Government Partners">LGPs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Some further contextual information is outlined in the following section, around the differing minimum wage levels used by providers and <abbr title="Local Government Partners">LGPs</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Differences in wage levels</h3>

<p>The funding that providers of the Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>) receive is partly based on the number of job outcomes achieved. They are paid when a participant reaches a specified level of earnings in employment.</p>

<p>Across all providers and <abbr title="Local Government Partners">LGPs</abbr> in the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>, this earnings level is equivalent to working 16 hours per week for 26 weeks at a specified minimum rate; or when a participant reaches six months of being in self-employment. However, the specified minimum rate used for the 16 hours per 26 weeksâ threshold, varies across the UK.</p>

<p>All providers delivering the national <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> (not the <abbr title="Local Government Partners">LGPs</abbr>) use the adult-rate of the National Living Wage (<abbr title="National Living Wage">NLW</abbr>). This is the same for three of the five <abbr title="Local Government Partners">LGPs</abbr>: Central London Forward, Local London and South London Partnership. The earnings threshold for national providers and these three <abbr title="Local Government Partners">LGPs</abbr> is equivalent to working 16 hours per week for 26 weeks at the <abbr title="National Living Wage">NLW</abbr>.</p>

<p>However, the West London Alliance earnings threshold is equivalent to the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> participant working at the London Living Wage (<abbr title="London Living Wage">LLW</abbr>) for 16 hours per week for 26 weeks. For <abbr title="Greater Manchester Combined Authority">GMCA</abbr> the earnings threshold is equivalent to the participant working at the Real Living Wage (<abbr title="Real Living Wage">RLW</abbr>) for 16 hours per week for 26 weeks, both the <abbr title="London Living Wage">LLW</abbr> and the <abbr title="Real Living Wage">RLW</abbr> are higher than the <abbr title="National Living Wage">NLW</abbr>.</p>

<p>Users should take this context into account, as the earnings levels used by <abbr title="Local Government Partners">LGPs</abbr> and national providers does directly affect the number of job outcomes achieved and therefore the funding they receive.</p>

<h2>Groups</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> is available for the following 3 groups.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Disability group</h3>

<p>The disability group is voluntary for disabled people, as defined by the Equality Act 2010. This is the main group the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> is aimed at.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Early access group</h3>

<p>The early access group is voluntary and aimed at people who may need additional support to move into employment and are in one of a number of priority groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ex-offender or offender</li>
  <li>carer</li>
  <li>ex-carer</li>
  <li>homeless person</li>
  <li>former member HM Armed Forces</li>
  <li>member HM Armed Forces Reserves</li>
  <li>partner of current or former Armed Forces personnel</li>
  <li>drug or alcohol dependencies (presenting as a barrier to employment)</li>
  <li>care leaver</li>
  <li>refugee</li>
  <li>young people in gangs and victims of domestic violence</li>
</ul>

<p>Some areas have added additional groups to the Early Access group, in line with local priorities.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Long-term unemployed group</h3>

<p>The long-term unemployed group is mandatory and is for Jobseekerâs Allowance or Universal Credit claimants who have reached 24 months of unemployment.</p>

<h2>Areas</h2>

<p>The publication also reports across 3 main areas.</p>

<h4>1. Contract Package Areas</h4>

<p><abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> is delivered by five providers across 6 areas known as Contract Package Areas. These areas were the first to deliver the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> in the phased rollout.</p>

<h4>2. Local Government Partners</h4>

<p>The government is committed to devolution and decentralising power and responsibility for delivering a <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> equivalent programme in the <abbr title="Greater Manchester Combined Authority">GMCA</abbr> and to the four sub-regional groups of boroughs in London. These are known as Local Government Partners. To enable this, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> made arrangements for <abbr title="Greater Manchester Combined Authority">GMCA</abbr> and London sub-regions to design, procure and contract manage their own <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> with Grant Funding paid by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. This has been matched funded with European Social Fund (<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>), allowing London and Manchester to increase the number of people supported on the programme.</p>

<h4>3. Devolved Deal Areas</h4>

<p>In some areas, the government has designed <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> in consultation with Local Enterprise Partnerships and city regions. These are known as Devolved Deal Areas. These areas will have a strong voice in the ongoing monitoring of the performance on the programme in their areas.</p>

<h2>Revisions</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has a policy for planned revisions describing how we will handle revisions and give confidence that all revisions will be handled in a transparent manner. For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> statistics, to reflect any updates to the figures, the full historical statistical series is refreshed each time the figures are released.</p>

<p>We allow some time for additional information to be incorporated into <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>âs data systems. This time period is referred to as retrospection. Information may be submitted, corrected or re-submitted sometime after the event occurred. This means data presented in each release is subject to some retrospection and figures may be revised in subsequent releases.</p>

<p>To ensure the statistics represent a more complete picture of events we publish data lagged by 3 months. This means in November we publish data to the end of August.</p>

<p>Please be aware that documents published between February 2021 and February 2022 contain a minor undercount for the number of individuals referred to <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> between October 2020 and November 2021. Whilst figures were affected, there was no material impact and the story of the statistics has not changed. This issue was corrected in May 2022 and for all subsequent releases.</p>
