<p>From July 2022, fit notes can be certified and issued by nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists in addition to doctors.</p>
</div>

<h2>Changes to the fit note</h2>

<p>From July 2022 the Department for Work and Pensions has updated the law for the fit note so that it can now be issued by nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists in addition to doctors. This means that you may be issued a fit note by someone other than a doctor as long as they are discussing your fitness to work with you. These health professionals should be treating you through NHS services.</p>

<p>You may notice changes to the fit note you receive from your healthcare professional as a new version of the fit note was introduced in April 2022.</p>

<p>The requirement for the healthcare professional to sign the form in ink has been removed and replaced by the issuer’s name and profession.</p>

<p>There will be a period during which both the new and previous version of the fit notes are legally valid.</p>

<h2>How the fit note works</h2>

<p>Doing the right kind of work is good for your health, including if you have a health condition.</p>

<p>You do not always need to be fully recovered to go back to work, and in fact it can often help your recovery. Your fit note can help you go back to work when you are able to.</p>

<p>Your healthcare professional will not automatically assess that you are not fit for work if you have a health condition. Instead, they will discuss with you how your health affects what you can do at work.</p>

<p>They will think about your fitness for work in general rather than just your current job.</p>

<p>You should ask your healthcare professional to give you practical advice in the fit note about what you can do at work, rather than simply record your health condition.</p>

<p>You should then discuss this advice with your  employer, to see if they can make any changes  to help you return to work.</p>

<h3>How work affects your health</h3>

<p>If your healthcare professional doesn’t ask you about how your  health affects what you can do at work, you  should raise the issue yourself.</p>

<p>Research shows that work can be good for your physical and mental health, lowers the risk of experiencing financial difficulties, and improves your overall quality of life.</p>

<p>You do not always need to be 100% ‘fit’ to be  able to do some work, indeed, work can help  your recovery from health problems or support  your all round wellbeing if you have a long term health condition.</p>

<p>Your healthcare professional is there to help you with your health. Healthcare professional understand that work can be  good for your health, and will talk to you about what you can do and whether you could return to work without making your health worse.</p>

<h3>Getting a fit note</h3>

<p>Your healthcare professional will only give you a fit note if your health affects your fitness for work. The fit note is your property and you should keep it. Your employer can take a copy if they want one for their records.</p>

<p>If you are fit for work, you do not need a fit note. You also do not need one if you are off sick for 7 calendar days or less, because  you can self-certify your leave for this time  – see guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statutory-sick-pay-employees-statement-of-sickness-sc2">employee’s statement of sickness to claim Statutory Sick Pay</a>.</p>

<p>Your healthcare professional cannot give you a fit note for non medical problems (such as problems at home  or relationship trouble at work). They may, however, be able to suggest other sources of  help – some are listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#further-support">further support</a>.</p>

<h3>Rules of the fit note</h3>

<p>You should get a fit note from the healthcare professional who is treating you. This should be a doctor, nurse, occupational therapist, pharmacist or physiotherapist delivering NHS services. Your healthcare professional can also issue a fit note based on a written report from another healthcare professional.</p>

<p>Fit notes can be handwritten, computer-generated and printed out or computer-generated and sent digitally to you. It must include the issuer’s name and profession and the address of the medical practice. Duplicate fit notes can only be issued if the original has been lost.</p>

<p>If your fit note does not include the issuer’s name or signature it is not valid and could be rejected by your employer or the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) and you may be asked to get a new fit note</p>

<p>The fit note is classed as advice from your healthcare professional Your employer can decide whether or not  to accept it, and your healthcare professional cannot get involved in any disputes between you and your employer. You may wish to seek help from a trade union or <abbr title="Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service">ACAS</abbr> (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service) in such situations.</p>

<h3>How your fitness for work will be assessed</h3>

<p>Your healthcare professional will assess your fitness for work by considering how your health affects what you can do at work (for example your stamina and concentration).</p>

<p>They will decide whether you are not fit for work  of any kind, or whether you may be fit for work  taking account of their advice.</p>

<p>Your healthcare professional will not automatically assess that you are not fit for work if you have a health  condition, and they will consider your fitness for work in general instead of just thinking about your current job.</p>

<p>This gives you and your employer the maximum flexibility to think about ways to help you go back to work (which might include moving you to a different job for a while or changing your duties).</p>

<h3>Making a claim to sickness related benefits</h3>

<p>You can use your fit note to support a claim to benefits. More information can be found on how to make a claim on the fit note itself, or on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/benefits">benefits</a> pages.</p>

<h3>If your fit note says that you are not fit for work</h3>

<p>Show the fit note to your employer to arrange  your sick pay. They can take a copy but you should keep the original.</p>

<p>It’s usually a good idea to keep in touch with  your employer while you are away, so that you are ready when it’s time to go back. You can get  advice about sick pay from your trade union or see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/working/time-off">information about sick pay</a>.</p>

<h3>If your fit note says that you may be fit for work</h3>

<p>Your healthcare professional will give you advice in the rest of  your fit note about how your health affects what  you can do at work. Make sure you discuss this  with them and understand their advice.</p>

<p>You should discuss your fit note with your  employer to see if they can help you return to  work; this won’t necessarily mean doing your  old job, or working full time. We know that  employers want to help their employees return  to work, and can often make changes to the  workplace or job duties.</p>

<p>Your local safety representative or trade union  may be able to help you in your discussions, and  the checklist below may help you prepare for  them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>look at the tick boxes and comment box for  advice on what you can do at work, and how  your employer could support you</li>
  <li>check how long your fit note lasts and  whether you are expected to be fit for work  when it expires – <a class="govuk-link" href="#fit-note-sections">explaining the sections of  the fit note</a> explains how you can do this</li>
  <li>think of <a class="govuk-link" href="#possible-changes">possible changes</a> to help you return  to work</li>
</ul>

<p>It may be helpful to put any changes you agree  down in writing, so that everyone is clear on what has been agreed. See an <a class="govuk-link" href="#examples">example</a> of someone using their fit note to help them go back to work.</p>

<p>If your employer cannot make any changes, they do not have to. In these circumstances, you should treat your fit note as if it said that you are not fit for work and use it as explained above. You should not go back to your healthcare professional for a new fit note.</p>

<h3>The tick boxes</h3>

<p>The tick boxes enable your healthcare professional to indicate the kind of general adaptations that might help you return to work. This is not binding on you, and you should feel free to discuss other options. Adaptations include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a phased return to work: a gradual increase in work duties or hours</li>
  <li>altered hours: changing your work times or total hours</li>
  <li>amended duties: changing your work duties</li>
  <li>workplace adaptations: changing aspects of your workplace</li>
</ul>

<h3>The comments box</h3>

<p>Your healthcare professional should use the comments box to give  you more detailed advice about the impact of your condition on what you can do at work. This  will be advice about what you can do at work in general, and will not be tied to your current job. This gives you and your employer maximum  flexibility to discuss ways to help you return to  work.</p>

<p>It is helpful for your healthcare professional to give practical  information about what you can do at work, eg  ‘should not drive, take regular breaks if using a  display screen’ instead of simply ‘dry eyes’. If  your healthcare professional thinks that your job may be affecting  your health, they will also indicate this in the comments box.</p>

<p>The information in this box is often very helpful  for employers, so you should ask your healthcare professional to provide advice here if they can. Ask your healthcare professional to include details about how your condition affects what you can do at work, rather than simply a diagnosis or description of your symptoms.</p>

<h3>Possible changes</h3>

<p>Check<a class="govuk-link" href="#further-support"> further support</a> for other resources which could help, and guidance for particular conditions. You should discuss anything that you think would help. Some examples are listed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>changing to a different job or location</li>
  <li>reduced or flexible hours, or a phased return to work</li>
  <li>changing work premises or equipment</li>
  <li>changing your duties / giving some of your tasks  to somebody else</li>
  <li>providing additional training or supervision</li>
  <li>providing a reader or interpreter</li>
  <li>working from home</li>
  <li>arranging a mentor or work buddy</li>
  <li>working in a team instead of by yourself (or vice  versa)</li>
  <li>arranging for an occupational health assessment.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Going back to work</h3>

<p>You should go back to work as soon as you feel able  to and with your employer’s agreement – this may  be before your fit note runs out. You do not need  to go back to see your healthcare professional before going back to  work. Your healthcare professional cannot give you a fit note stating  that you are ‘fit for work’.</p>

<p>For a small number of jobs there are separate  processes to ensure it is safe for you to return. If  this applies to you, your employer will tell you. You  do not need a fit note to cover this period while  you wait for your employer’s assessment and your healthcare professional will not be able to issue further fit notes to cover it.</p>

<h2>Explaining the sections of the fit note</h2>

<h3>Fit note issued without signature in ink (Med3 2022 template)</h3>

" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147085/sample-statement-fitness-for-work-april-2022.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>1. The date your healthcare professional assessed you, either in person or over the telephone, or when they considered a report from another healthcare professional.</p>

<p>2. The condition(s) affecting your fitness for work. It’s usually best for your healthcare professional to be as accurate as possible, but they can enter a less precise diagnosis if being too detailed might harm your position with your employer.</p>

<p>3. Your healthcare professional’s assessment that you are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not fit for work – you are not fit for work of any kind</li>
  <li>may be fit for work taking account of the  following advice – you may be fit for work, taking account of your healthcare professional’s advice in the fit note. This does not necessarily mean doing your current job</li>
</ul>

<p>4. Your healthcare professional’s advice about the impact of  your health condition. See the comments box for more information.</p>

<p>5. The period that your healthcare professional’s advice covers. This will either be from the date of the  assessment (Box 1), or between a particular start and end date. These dates are inclusive  (so a fit note dated from 2 April to 10 April will no longer apply from 11 April onwards). This section may cover a previous period if  your healthcare professional thinks that your condition has  affected your fitness for work before your assessment. This can be for any time up to an indefinite  period.</p>

<p>6. Whether your healthcare professional needs to see you at the end of your fit note. If they expect you will be fit for work at the end of the fit note, they will indicate that they do not need to see  you again.</p>

<p>7. The name of the issuer.</p>

<p>8. The profession of the issuer.</p>

<p>9. The date the fit note is issued. This may not always be the same as the date of the  assessment.</p>

<h3>Fit note with signature in ink (Med3 2017 template)</h3>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Sample Statement of Fitness for Work document issued before April 2022 showing the sections of the fit note. An explanation of the sections is described below.

<p>Complete sections 1 to 6 as above.</p>

<p>7. Your health professional needs to sign the fit note using ink. If they  are using the <a class="govuk-link" href="#fit-note-sections">computer-generated fit note</a>, the statement date and address of the practice will be completed automatically by the IT software. If not, they need ensure that these sections are filled in. If your health professional is a nurse, occupational therapist, pharmacist, physiotherapist, they must strike out ‘doctors’ and replace with their own profession.</p>

<p>8. The date the fit note is issued. This may not always be the same as the date of the  assessment.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Important: You can go back to work at any time you feel able to (including before the end  of the fit note) without going back to see your healthcare professional, even if your healthcare professional has indicated that they need to assess you again.</p>
</div>

<h2>Illustrative examples of how the fit note works</h2>

<h3>Using the fit note to go back to work</h3>

<h4>Case study 1: Working from home</h4>

<p>A proof reader for a publishing company has a fit note from his healthcare professional saying that he has a common cold and cystic fibrosis but that he may be fit for work taking account of the following advice. The workplace adaptations box is ticked. His fit note has a duration of 10 days and his healthcare professional has indicated that they do not need to see him again  once it expires.</p>

<p>The advice in the comments box reads: Your  employee cannot travel into the office because he is at local high risk of developing a chest  infection whilst he has a cold. The increased risk  is due to his pre-existing chest condition – cystic  fibrosis. He is able work from home during this  period.</p>

<p>The employee and his employer discuss his fit  note agree that he should work from home for  the next 10 days. His boss emails him some  work to do, and he does not go on to sick leave.  After 10 days, he has recovered from his cold and comes back to work as normal without going back to see his healthcare professional.</p>

<h4>Case study 2: A delivery driver who cannot drive</h4>

<p>A delivery driver for a major logistics firm has just had laser eye surgery. He has been told that he should not drive for 2 weeks.</p>

<p>His healthcare professional explains that the fit note is about his  general fitness for work, and discusses what  other tasks he can do. The healthcare professional indicates on his fit note that he may be fit for work. The comments  box reads ‘Dry eyes, may experience temporary  blurring of vision. Should not drive for 2 weeks.  Can still perform other reasonable physical tasks.  Mental function unaffected. If he uses a VDU (Visual Display Unit) he  should take regular short breaks as per standard  guidance.’ The healthcare professional ticks ‘amended duties’.</p>

<p>His healthcare professional indicates that they will not need to assess him again at the end of the fit note because they expect him to be back to normal by then. The driver and his employer discuss the advice in the  fit note.</p>

<p>Although he should not drive, the driver’s  knowledge of the company and its operations means they decide he can work in a back office role for the 2 weeks. The employee therefore  keeps his full pay, and keeps in the routine of working. After 2 weeks, his eyesight is back  to normal and he returns to his previous duties without going back to see his healthcare professional.</p>

<h2>Further support</h2>
