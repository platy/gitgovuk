<h2>Exporting using the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (<abbr title="Trade and Cooperation Agreement">TCA</abbr>)</h2>

<p>This document provides detailed guidance on the rules of origin requirements under the <abbr title="Trade and Cooperation Agreement">TCA</abbr> and explains the most important rules of origin provisions which businesses need to understand and comply with, in order to ensure that they pay zero tariffs when trading with the EU. This applies to both businesses that wish to export goods to the EU at zero tariffs, as well as businesses who wish to import goods from EU at zero tariffs.</p>

<p>Businesses may refer to this guidance and the rules of origin text directly to understand their requirements, or they may defer to a customs intermediary to comply with their obligations.</p>

<p>Find a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/appoint-someone-to-deal-with-customs-on-your-behalf" class="govuk-link">list of customs intermediaries.</a></p>

<p>Importantly, this guidance document does not contain information or explanations for all rules of origin relevant to the <abbr title="Trade and Cooperation Agreement">TCA</abbr>. Rather, this guidance provides detail on the most important provisions, and businesses should still refer to the full <abbr title="Trade and Cooperation Agreement">TCA</abbr> rules of origin text to understand their full obligations should they wish to export or import goods between the UK and EU and take advantage of the preferential treatment.</p>

<h2>Exporting without making use of the <abbr title="Trade and Cooperation Agreement">TCA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>This guidance is not relevant to businesses who do not wish to claim preferential treatment on the goods they import (from the EU) or export (to the EU). Such goods will be subject to the importing party’s non-preferential tariff. Therefore, payment of tariffs and duties will be due as per the UK’s and EU’s import requirements.</p>

<p>Businesses who do wish to access the preferential tariff treatment negotiated under the <abbr title="Trade and Cooperation Agreement">TCA</abbr>, however, must comply with the rules of origin.</p>

<h2>Easements for business under the <abbr title="Trade and Cooperation Agreement">TCA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>This guidance also contains information on the temporary easements available to businesses. For goods imported from the EU to GB (but not vice-versa) between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2021, GB traders will have up to 175 days to submit a full customs declaration and pay any necessary tariffs. This also includes declaring any proof of origin.</p>

<p>This guidance also has information on the temporary easement on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rules-of-origin-for-goods-moving-between-the-uk-and-eu/origin-procedures-proving-originating-status-and-claiming-preferential-treatment">supplier’s declarations</a>.</p>

<p>For UK-EU trade, until 31 December 2021, businesses do not need supplier’s declarations from business suppliers in place when the goods are exported but they must be confident that the goods do meet the <abbr title="Trade and Cooperation Agreement">TCA</abbr> preferential rules of origin. Businesses may be asked to retrospectively provide a supplier’s declaration after this date.</p>
