<h3>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING</h3>

<h3>Between</h3>

<h3>The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</h3>

<h3>And</h3>

<h3>The Government of the Republic of Rwanda</h3>

<p>For the Provision of an Asylum Partnership Arrangement to strengthen shared international commitments on the protection of refugees and migrants</p>

<p>The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the “United Kingdom”) and the Government of the Republic of Rwanda (“Rwanda”), together the Participants and in singular the Participant,</p>

<p>WISHING to continue the excellent bilateral relations between both countries,</p>

<p>APPRECIATING the deep economic, social and historical ties between the Participants,</p>

<p>Desiring to facilitate co-operation between the Participants in order to contribute to the prevention and combating of illegally facilitated and unlawful cross border migration by establishing a bilateral asylum partnership in which Rwanda commits to receive asylum seekers from the United Kingdom, to consider their claims for asylum, giving effect to their rights under international law through the Rwanda domestic asylum system and arranging for the settlement in Rwanda of those recognised as refugees or otherwise requiring protection,</p>

<p>CONSIDERING that for many years, Rwanda has willingly been hosting and giving shelter to hundreds of thousands of refugees, offering adequate systems of refugee protection, consistent with the principles of international solidarity that underpin the international refugee protection system, and committed to the notion that cooperation and burden-sharing with respect to refugee status claimants can be enhanced. Rwanda has made significant commitments to the protection and assistance of refugees including by signing the MoU with the African Union (AU) and UNHCR establishing the Emergency Transit Mechanism (ETM) aiming to provide life-saving protection, assistance and long-term solutions to extremely vulnerable refugees trapped in detention in Libya, through temporary evacuation to Rwanda,</p>

<p>CONSIDERING that the United Kingdom has a long proud history of providing protection to those who need it, in accordance with international obligations. The United Kingdom has resettled 25,000 vulnerable people from the Syrian conflict since 2015 and has committed to resettle 20,000 people from Afghanistan in addition to those who were employed by the United Kingdom. Furthermore, the UK opened safe and legal pathways for British National (Overseas) passports in Hong Kong, former Government and military employees in Afghanistan and uncapped humanitarian schemes in response to conflict in Ukraine. As like-minded partners, the United Kingdom and Rwanda will work together to promote a new fair and humane asylum system, deter illegal migration and create safe and legal routes for those fleeing persecution,</p>

<p>CONSIDERING that migrants and refugees make perilous journeys across borders and even oceans in search of safety and economic opportunity, running away from armed conflicts, famine, climate change and other hardships they have encountered in their home countries and that mass movement of irregular migrants organised by people smugglers is overwhelming the existing international asylum system,</p>

<p>ACKNOWLEDGING the need to provide better international protection for refugees and underlying the importance of effective and functioning systems which provide protection and a durable solution to those in need whilst preventing abuse,</p>

<p>WISHING to develop new ways of addressing the irregular migration challenge, including bridging gaps in human capital, in order to counter the business model of the human smugglers, protect the most vulnerable, manage flows of asylum seekers and refugees and promote durable solutions,</p>

<p>REAFFIRMING the commitment to strengthen and deepen bilateral cooperation to enhance the international protection of refugees by promoting responsibility sharing by ensuring that refugees are not subject to penalties on account of their illegal entry or presence, and ensuring the expeditious determination of claims to refugee status and asylum, and that the relevant criteria are interpreted reflecting the applicable international law and standards,</p>

<p>Having regard to the Participants’ commitment to upholding fundamental human rights and freedoms without discrimination, as guaranteed by the Participants’ national legislation, by their strong histories of implementing the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees and by their other respective international legal obligations,</p>
