<p>Dear Chief Executive</p>

<p>I wanted to write to you to let you know about the arrangements for data collection in the coming year. Timely and accurate data submission is a cornerstone of the co-regulatory settlement and we rely on the information you supply us to ensure proportionate and risk-based regulation. I would therefore be grateful if this letter can be passed onto the appropriate person within your organisation.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="RSH data collections website">NROSH+</abbr> Data Collection 2022</h2>

<p>From April 2022, we will be commencing our round of data collection from private registered providers (‘providers’) via the <abbr title="RSH data collections website">NROSH+</abbr> website https://nroshplus.regulatorofsocialhousing.org.uk</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="RSH data collections website">NROSH+</abbr> closure</h3>

<p>In order to prepare for the 2022/23 survey period, the <abbr title="RSH data collections website">NROSH+</abbr> system will be offline from 18:00 on Friday 25 March until launch on Friday 1 April. During this time, you will be unable to access the site and should make alternative provision to access documents and templates should you require these during this period. We will notify all users by email when <abbr title="RSH data collections website">NROSH+</abbr> launches for the 2022 collections.</p>

<h3>Data returns</h3>

<p>During 2022/23, all providers that own 1,000 or more units of social stock will be required to submit the following returns:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Data Returns</th>
      <th scope="col">Deadline</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

      <td>30-Jun-22  <br> <br> We encourage submission within 6 weeks of business plan sign off by the providerís board where this is earlier than 30 June 2022</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>3 weeks after each quarter end    <br>  As required (see disposal notification guidance available on <abbr title="RSH data collections website">NROSH+</abbr>)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The deadlines for all returns are in line with those operating in a standard collection year. We rely on the supply of timely and accurate data from all registered providers. Failure to supply quality data in line with the timescales we outline may be reflected in our published judgements of your compliance with the regulatory standards.</p>

<h4>If any of these present a practical problem for your organisation, please contact your key contact or the referrals and regulatory enquiries team <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:NROSHenquiries@rsh.gov.uk">NROSHenquiries@rsh.gov.uk</a> as soon as possible.</h4>

<p><abbr title="Statistical Data Return">SDR</abbr> submissions are due 31 May and are required from all registered providers even if a provider owns no stock. We will publish a list of all late or missing returns for 2022 when the <abbr title="Statistical Data Return">SDR</abbr> data is published in Autumn 2022.</p>

<h3>Changes to returns for 2022</h3>

<p>It is essential that guidance notes are reviewed before the completion of the surveys as there are new, moved and revised questions within each survey. For more information regarding changes, please refer to the note enclosed with this letter.</p>

<h4>Additionally, we remind you that it is your responsibility to correctly categorise and record stock accurately according to the latest applicable legislation and to ensure you understand and apply the rent rules correctly.</h4>

<p>We also ask that you focus attention on your reporting of decent homes non-compliance to ensure that the submitted figures are an accurate reflection of your stock’s performance against the requirements of the Decent Homes Standard.</p>

<h3>Submitting data</h3>

<p>In 2022 the annual surveys will launch in a staggered pattern, with <abbr title="Statistical Data Return">SDR</abbr> and <abbr title="Financial Forecast Return">FFR</abbr> surveys launching in April 2022 and the <abbr title="electronic annual accounts">FVA</abbr> launching in June 2022. The Quarterly Survey (Q4) will launch alongside the <abbr title="Statistical Data Return">SDR</abbr> and <abbr title="Financial Forecast Return">FFR</abbr> in April. Guidance materials and templates will be released on <abbr title="RSH data collections website">NROSH+</abbr> as they become available.</p>

<p>Please submit returns as early as possible within each of the survey periods. We encourage the submission of the <abbr title="Financial Forecast Return">FFR</abbr> within 6 weeks of business plan sign off by boards where this is earlier than 30 June 2022. This will allow sufficient time to raise any questions you have regarding your submissions.</p>

<h3>Query resolution</h3>

<p>We aim to respond to all queries within five working days. Please note that queries made to us within five working days of a survey deadline may not receive a response until after the deadline has passed. This may result in submissions which do not meet the survey deadline. Extensions to the deadline will not be granted due to late queries.</p>

<p>During the checking of submissions, we may contact some providers to discuss their data returns before signing them off for further analysis. Subsequently, we may contact a minority of providers where there are any regulatory issues arising from this analysis of the validated data.</p>

<h4>Organisational and contact details</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="RSH data collections website">NROSH+</abbr> website requires your organisation to enter and maintain a suite of organisational and contact details. It is the responsibility of each individual provider to ensure that this contact information is kept updated and accurate throughout the year.  This is important because we use this information to contact your organisation on regulatory matters. Please note that contact information cannot be updated between 1 April and mid-July except via your <abbr title="Statistical Data Return">SDR</abbr> return (please contact the enquiries team if you need to amend submitted data).</p>

<h4>It is very important that the organisational and contact details in <abbr title="RSH data collections website">NROSH+</abbr> are kept accurate and up to date by your officers.</h4>

<p>If they are not:</p>

<p>(a)	your organisation may not receive important information on statutory consultations and/ or regulatory requirements; and/ or</p>

<p>(b)	correspondence (which may include information about the provider’s business or regulatory compliance) may be sent to the wrong individuals (who in some cases may no longer work for the provider).</p>

<p>We take our duties in relation to data protection seriously, but to do this we rely on providers updating their contact information in a timely fashion. Please see our privacy policy on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nroshplus.regulatorofsocialhousing.org.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="RSH data collections website">NROSH+</abbr></a> for more details.</p>

<p>If you have any queries, please refer to the guidance and FAQs on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nroshplus.regulatorofsocialhousing.org.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="RSH data collections website">NROSH+</abbr></a>. If further assistance is required you can contact the referrals and regulatory enquiries team <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:NROSHenquiries@rsh.gov.uk">NROSHenquiries@rsh.gov.uk</a> who will assist you with your query.</p>

<p>Yours faithfully,</p>

<p>Will Perry</p>

<p>Director of Strategy</p>

<h2>Changes to regulatory returns for 2022-23 (annex)</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This note provides an overview of the changes to data returns for 2022/23. These changes have been made to ensure that they continue to most effectively support our operational approach and reflect provider structures and risks.</p>

<h3>Key messages</h3>

<p>The following points are applicable to all returns:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Timely and accurate data submission is a cornerstone of the co-regulatory settlement and we rely on the information you supply us to ensure proportionate and risk-based regulation. Failure to provide accurate and timely data may be reflected in our published judgement of a provider’s compliance with the regulatory standards. Following the 2022 Statistical Data Return (<abbr title="Statistical Data Return">SDR</abbr>) collection the regulator will publish a list of all late or missing returns as it did in earlier years.</li>
  <li>It is essential that providers read the guidance available on the <abbr title="RSH data collections website">NROSH+</abbr> website prior to starting any of the returns.</li>
  <li>Providers have a responsibility to correctly categorise and record their stock according to the latest applicable legislation. We ask that you pay particular attention to the classification of units to ensure they align with the 2020 rent standard.</li>
  <li>We also ask that you focus attention on your reporting of decent homes non-compliance to ensure that the submitted figures are an accurate reflection of your stock’s performance against the requirements of the Decent Homes Standard.</li>
  <li>During the checking of submissions, we may contact some providers to discuss their data returns before signing them off for further analysis. Subsequently, we may contact a minority of providers where there are any regulatory issues arising from this analysis of the validated data.</li>
  <li>Please access <abbr title="RSH data collections website">NROSH+</abbr> via <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nroshplus.regulatorofsocialhousing.org.uk/" rel="external">https://nroshplus.regulatorofsocialhousing.org.uk/</a>. For help and advice please refer to the guidance available and contact the Referrals and Regulatory Enquiries Team (<a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:NROSHenquiries@rsh.gov.uk">NROSHenquiries@rsh.gov.uk</a> and 0300 1245 225).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Financial data</h3>

<p>The regulator will keep the same suite of standard financial data returns that we collected in 2021 (Financial Forecast Return; Electronic Annual Accounts and Quarterly Survey).</p>

<h4><abbr title="Financial Forecast Return">FFR</abbr></h4>

<p>A small number of changes have been made to the <abbr title="Financial Forecast Return">FFR</abbr> in 2022. The adjustments are primarily to ensure that the data requested is relevant to the current operating environment.</p>

<h4><abbr title="electronic annual accounts">FVA</abbr></h4>

<p>Minimal changes have been made to the <abbr title="electronic annual accounts">FVA</abbr> in 2022. Guidance notes will be updated, and providers should refer to these to ensure continued quality in data submission. The new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1045837/Accounting_Direction_2022.pdf" rel="external">Accounting Direction</a> (published in January 2022 ) is applicable to accounting periods commencing 1 January 2022 and later.</p>

<p>However, earlier adoption is encouraged, and it is recommended the Direction is reviewed alongside <abbr title="electronic annual accounts">FVA</abbr> submission.</p>

<h3><abbr title="Quarterly Survey">QS</abbr></h3>

<p>The Quarterly Survey will continue to collect data on key financial indicators and emergent sector risks. Guidance notes will be updated on a quarterly basis and providers should always refer to these to see if there are any changes to our requirements.</p>

<h3>Statistical data</h3>

<p>The following changes have been made to update terminology and to ensure the <abbr title="Statistical Data Return">SDR</abbr> continues to provide us with data required to support our operational activity.</p>

<h4>Part 1: Entity level information</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Q20-Q23 have been modified to better capture contact details for fees and invoicing.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Part 3: Low cost home ownership</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Q2 has a text box added for providers to give a brief explanation for adjustments made to the number of units recorded in the previous <abbr title="Statistical Data Return">SDR</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Q5 has been reworked so that sales where the maximum allowable share has been sold, but where this is less than 100% of the equity, are excluded from the total sales.</li>
  <li>Q9 has a new line to allow the recording of the number of LCHO units in each ownership/ management category where the maximum share that can be bought has been bought by the tenant (but where the maximum share is less than 100% of the equity).</li>
  <li>Q11 has two new columns to allow the recording of the number of LCHO units in each ownership/ management category where the maximum share that can be bought has been bought by the tenant (but where the maximum share is less than 100% of the equity).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Part 6: Stock balance sheet</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Q2 a text box has been added for providers to give a brief explanation for adjustments made to the number of units recorded in the previous <abbr title="Statistical Data Return">SDR</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Part 8: Small provider stock and rents data</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Q2 has a new line to allow the recording of the number of LCHO units in each ownership/ management category where the maximum share that can be bought has been bought by the tenant (where the maximum share is less than 100% of the equity).</li>
</ul>

<p>For more details on the <abbr title="Statistical Data Return">SDR</abbr> questions and changes please refer to the <abbr title="Statistical Data Return">SDR</abbr> Guidance materials available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nroshplus.regulatorofsocialhousing.org.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="RSH data collections website">NROSH+</abbr> website</a> including the Changes to the <abbr title="Statistical Data Return">SDR</abbr> for 2022 document.</p>

<h3>Disposal notifications</h3>

<p>Providers are required to notify us about disposals made in line with our Direction on disposal notification. The Direction and supporting guidance, available on our website, sets out the detail of what must be notified and the type of information that must be provided. Providers should read the Direction and associated guidance on <abbr title="RSH data collections website">NROSH+</abbr> prior to completion of the Disposal Notification Form.</p>

<h3>Organisational data</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nroshplus.regulatorofsocialhousing.org.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="RSH data collections website">NROSH+</abbr> website</a> requires your organisation to enter and maintain a suite of organisational and contact details. It is the responsibility of each individual provider to ensure that this contact information is kept updated and accurate throughout the year.  This is important because we use this information to contact your organisation on regulatory matters. We take our duties in relation to data protection seriously, but to do this we rely on providers updating their contact information in a timely fashion. Guidance on how to access and amend this data is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nroshplus.regulatorofsocialhousing.org.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="RSH data collections website">NROSH+</abbr> website</a>.</p>
