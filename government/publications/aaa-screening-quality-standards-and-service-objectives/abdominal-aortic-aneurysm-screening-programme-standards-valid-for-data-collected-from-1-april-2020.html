<h2>
<abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr>-S01: uptake: completeness of the initial screen offer</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Proportion of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#eligible">eligible</a> men who are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#offer">offered</a> screening.</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>To maximise the impact of the screening programme all eligible men should be offered a screen. A man should not miss out on the opportunity to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#informed-choice-to-accept-screening">accept</a> screening because he was not <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#invite">invited</a> by the provider.</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#numerator">Numerator</a>: number of cohort men eligible for the initial screen offered an initial appointment date which occurs within the screening year plus an additional 2 months.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#denominator">Denominator</a>: number of cohort men eligible for the initial screen in the screening year.</p>

<p>An offer is assumed if a letter for invitation is generated on the Screening Management and Referral Tracking (<abbr title="Screening Management and Referral Tracking">SMaRT</abbr>) database. Men whose contact details are inaccurate, resulting in a post office return, are considered eligible but are not counted as being offered an invitation as there is evidence the offer was not received.</p>

<p>An additional 2 months after the end of the screening year is included to allow men who are loaded into the cohort on the last day of the screening year to be invited and screened.</p>

<p>Men who are offered an invitation for screening but are found to be ineligible are removed from the numerator and denominator.</p>

<p>We calculate performance by dividing numerator by denominator and multiplying by 100 to give a percentage.</p>

<h3>Performance thresholds</h3>

<p>Acceptable level: ≥ 95.0%</p>

<p>Achievable level: ≥ 99.9%</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr>-S02: uptake: completeness of the annual surveillance offer</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Proportion of annual surveillance appointments due where an appointment was offered 6 weeks either side of the due date.</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>To maximise the impact of the screening programme, men with detected small <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysms">AAAs</abbr> should be offered a timely annual surveillance scan. This is to ensure they are on the correct surveillance interval and to minimise the risk of rupture. A man should not miss out on the opportunity to accept a surveillance scan because he was not invited by the provider.</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>Numerator: number of appointments offered ≤ 6 weeks (≤ 42 calendar days) either side of the due date.</p>

<p>Denominator: number of annual surveillance appointment due dates occurring in the reporting period.</p>

<p>The surveillance standard counts appointments not men. For example, if a man has 2 due dates each one will be counted.</p>

<p>An offer is assumed if a letter for invitation is generated on the <abbr title="Screening Management and Referral Tracking">SMaRT</abbr> database. Men whose contact details are inaccurate, resulting in a post office return, are considered eligible but are not counted as being offered an invitation as there is evidence the offer was not received.</p>

<p>Appointments for men ineligible for surveillance ≤ 6 weeks (≤ 42 calendar days) after their due date and not conclusively scanned are not included in the numerator or denominator.</p>

<p>Ineligible criteria are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>died</li>
  <li>out of cohort</li>
  <li>surveillance ceased</li>
</ul>

<p>We calculate performance by dividing numerator by denominator and multiplying by 100 to give a percentage.</p>

<h3>Performance thresholds</h3>

<p>Acceptable level: ≥ 95.0%</p>

<p>Achievable level: ≥ 99.0%</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<p>None.</p>

<abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr>-S03: uptake: completeness of the quarterly surveillance offer</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Proportion of quarterly surveillance appointments due where an appointment was offered 4 weeks either side of the due date.</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>To maximise the impact of the screening programme, men with detected medium <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysms">AAAs</abbr> should be offered a timely quarterly surveillance scan. This to ensure they are on the correct surveillance interval and minimise the risk of rupture. A man should not miss out on the opportunity to accept a surveillance scan because he was not invited by the provider.</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>Numerator: number of appointments offered ≤4 weeks (≤28 calendar days) either side of the due date.</p>

<p>Denominator: number of quarterly surveillance appointment due dates occurring in the reporting period.</p>

<p>The surveillance standard counts appointments not men. For example, if a man has 4 due dates each one will be counted.</p>

<p>An offer is assumed if a letter for invitation is generated on the <abbr title="Screening Management and Referral Tracking">SMaRT</abbr> database. Men whose contact details are inaccurate, resulting in a post office return, are considered eligible but are not counted as being offered an invitation as there is evidence the offer was not received.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr>-S04: coverage: initial screen</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Proportion of eligible cohort men who are tested.</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>Coverage is an essential measure for the screening programme as it provides an indication of the accessibility of the service and that men are aware of the importance of screening.</p>

<p>This standard needs to be looked at in conjunction with the proportion of people offered an initial screen.</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>Numerator: number of cohort men eligible for the initial screen who had a conclusive screen result within the screening year plus an additional 2 months.</p>

<p>Denominator: number of cohort men eligible for the initial screen in the screening year.</p>

<p>An additional 2 months after the end of the screening year is included to allow men who do not attend or cancel at the end of the year to be reinvited and screened.</p>

<p>We calculate performance by dividing numerator by denominator and multiplying by 100 to give a percentage.</p>

<h3>Performance thresholds</h3>

<p>Acceptable level: ≥ 75.0%</p>

<p>Achievable level: ≥ 85.0%</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<p>Some men may choose to defer their initial screen which may lower the number tested within the screening year plus 2 months.</p>

<p>This standard is also key performance indicator (KPI) AA2</p>

<h3>Reporting period</h3>

<p>Screening year of the eligible cohort (1 April to 31 March).</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr>-S05: coverage: annual surveillance scan</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Proportion of annual surveillance appointments due where there is a conclusive scan ≤ 6 weeks either side of the due date.</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>Coverage is an essential measure for the screening programme. Timely and conclusive annual surveillance scans provide an indication of the accessibility of the service and that men are aware of the importance of surveillance. This standard needs to be looked at in conjunction with the proportion of annual surveillance appointments offered.</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>Numerator: number of conclusive scans ≤6 weeks (≤42 calendar days) either side of the due date for annual surveillance men.</p>

<p>Denominator: number of annual surveillance appointment due dates occurring in the reporting period.</p>

<p>The surveillance standard counts appointments not men. For example, if a man has 2 due dates each one will be counted.</p>

<p>Appointments for men ineligible for surveillance ≤ 6 weeks (≤42 calendar days) after their due date and not conclusively scanned are not included in the numerator or denominator.</p>

<p>Ineligible criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>died</li>
  <li>out of cohort</li>
  <li>surveillance ceased</li>

<abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr>-S06: coverage: quarterly surveillance scan</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Proportion of quarterly surveillance appointments due where there is a conclusive scan ≤4 weeks either side of the due date.</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>Coverage is an essential measure for the screening programme. Timely and conclusive quarterly surveillance scans provide an indication of the accessibility of the service and that men are aware of the importance of surveillance. This standard needs to be looked at in conjunction with the proportion of quarterly surveillance appointments offered.</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>Numerator: number of conclusive scans ≤4 weeks (≤28 calendar days) either side of the due date for quarterly surveillance men.</p>

<p>Denominator: number of quarterly surveillance appointment due dates occurring in the reporting period.</p>

<p>The surveillance standard counts appointments not men. For example, if a man has 4 due dates each one will be counted.</p>

<p>Appointments for men ineligible for surveillance ≤4 weeks (≤28 calendar days) after their due date and not conclusively scanned are not included in the numerator or denominator.</p>

<p>Ineligible criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>died</li>

<h2>
<abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr>-S07: coverage: initial screen in the most deprived 30% of local areas</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Proportion of men in the eligible cohort who were tested and who lived in a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/data_dictionary/nhs_business_definitions/l/lower_layer_super_output_area_de.asp?shownav=1" rel="external">lower super output area</a> (<abbr title="lower super output area">LSOA</abbr>) classed as decile 1 to 3 in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019">English indices of deprivation 2019</a>.</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>Men living in more deprived areas are less likely to attend for screening but are more likely to have an aneurysm. It is important for providers to engage with men living in more deprived areas to make sure they can make a personal informed choice.</p>

<p>This standard only focuses on one aspect of inequalities in access to <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> screening. It is acknowledged that there are many sources of inequalities and providers should work with commissioners to identify and reduce drivers of inequalities relevant to their local area. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening-reducing-inequalities"><abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> inequalities guidance</a> has further information.</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>Numerator: number of cohort men eligible for the initial screen in deciles 1 to 3 who had a conclusive screen result within the screening year plus an additional 2 months (in the event of non-attendance and cancellations at the end of the year this allows men to be reinvited and screened).</p>

<p>Denominator: number of cohort men eligible for the initial screen in the screening year who lived in a <abbr title="lower super output area">LSOA</abbr> classed as decile 1 to 3 in the index of multiple deprivation 2019.</p>

<p><abbr title="lower super output area">LSOA</abbr> is assigned based on the man’s postcode at time of discharge from the screening programme if he was screen clear, declined, did not attend or was an incomplete screening episode. If the man has an aneurysm detected it will be based on the postcode at the time the data was extracted from <abbr title="Screening Management and Referral Tracking">SMaRT</abbr>.</p>

<p>An additional 2 months after the end of the screening year is included to allow men who do not attend or cancel at the end of the year to be reinvited and screened.</p>

<p>We calculate performance by dividing numerator by denominator and multiplying by 100 to give a percentage.</p>

<h3>Performance thresholds</h3>

<p>Acceptable level: ≥ 75.0%</p>

<p>Achievable level: ≥ 85.0%</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<p>Some men may choose to defer their initial screen which may lower the number tested within the screening year plus 2 months.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Proportion of abnormal screens (aorta ≥3.0 to &lt;5.5cm) reviewed ≤21 calendar days of the initial screen date.</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>Ongoing internal quality assurance aims to identify omissions and inconsistencies in technique and training. This is to make sure quality and standards are maintained in line with the national standard operating procedures and the screening technician’s scope of practice. Where a screen indicates a small or medium aneurysm, the images should be reviewed by the clinical skills trainer or quality assurance lead ≤21 calendar days. This is so that a man can be moved into surveillance and referred for nurse assessment if he has a small or medium sized aneurysm (aorta ≥3.0 to &lt;5.5cm) or be reassured if no aneurysm is found (aorta &lt;3.0cm).</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>Numerator: number of abnormal screens reviewed by a clinical skills trainer or quality assurance lead ≤21 days of the initial screen date.</p>

<p>Denominator: number of initial screens identified as abnormal (aorta ≥3.0 to &lt;5.5cm) sent for internal quality assurance during the reporting period.</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>Men with aneurysms require close monitoring, support and secondary prevention to help reduce their overall vascular risk and improve outcomes. The nurse assessment appointment should occur shortly after finding the small or medium aneurysm to reduce anxiety. Nurse specialists assess men for vascular risk factors and give advice about health and lifestyle to reduce their risk. It also provides the man with an opportunity to ask questions about the condition.</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>Numerator: the number of men in the denominator who had a nurse assessment ≤12 weeks (≤84 calendar days) of their conclusive scan.</p>

<p>Denominator: number of men in the screening year with a</p>

<ul>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Proportion of men with an aorta ≥5.5cm seen by vascular surgeon ≤2 weeks of their last conclusive ultrasound scan.</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>Men with a large aneurysm are at risk of rupture and should be seen by a vascular surgeon and operated on (if suitable for surgery) within an 8-week (≤56 calendar days) time frame. Men should be assessed for their suitability for surgery ≤2 weeks (≤14 calendar days) of their last conclusive screen so that there are no unnecessary delays in treatment or patient care.</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>Numerator: number of men appropriately referred for surgery where the number of days between the date of the last conclusive ultrasound scan, where the aorta was measured as ≥5.5cm, and date of the first attended vascular surgeon appointment is ≤14 calendar days. Last conclusive ultrasound scan date = day 0.</p>

<p>Denominator: number of men appropriately referred for surgery within the screening year.</p>

<p>Men are deemed appropriately referred if their aorta is confirmed to measure ≥5.5cm by computerized tomography (<abbr title="computerised tomography">CT</abbr>) or magnetic resonance imaging (<abbr title="magnetic resonance imaging">MRI</abbr>) scan.</p>

<p>This includes cohort and self-referral men from the initial screen and surveillance.</p>

<p>Proportion of men with aorta ≥5.5cm appropriately referred, deemed fit for intervention and not declining, operated on by a vascular surgeon ≤8 weeks of their last conclusive ultrasound scan.</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>The screening pathway up to and including the time to treatment is commissioned by NHS England. Men with a large aneurysm are at risk of a rupture and should be seen by a vascular surgeon and operated on (if suitable for surgery) within an 8-week (≤56 calendar days) time frame.</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>Numerator: number of men appropriately referred, suitable for intervention and not declining where the number of days between last conclusive ultrasound scan at ≥5.5cm and date of surgery is ≤56 calendar days. Last conclusive ultrasound scan date = day 0.</p>

<p>Denominator: number of men appropriately referred for surgery and suitable for intervention and not declining in the screening year.</p>

<p>Men are deemed appropriate for referral if their aorta is confirmed to measure ≥5.5cm by <abbr title="computerised tomography">CT</abbr> or <abbr title="magnetic resonance imaging">MRI</abbr> scan.</p>

<p>This includes cohort and self-referral men from the initial screen and surveillance.</p>

<p>We calculate performance by dividing numerator by denominator and multiplying by 100 to give a percentage.</p>

<h3>Performance thresholds</h3>

<p>Acceptable level: ≥ 60.0%</p>

<p>Achievable level: ≥ 80.0%</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<p>Assessment for suitability for surgery is undertaken by the responsible vascular surgeon. This is based on professional clinical judgement.</p>

<p>Men not meeting the standard should be exception reported via the <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> tracker and discussed on a case by case basis at the local programme board. Further guidance is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/aaa-screening-waiting-times-standards"><abbr title="NHS abdominal aortic aneurysm screening programme">NAAASP</abbr> guidance on waiting times standards</a>.</p>
