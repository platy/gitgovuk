<p>5th Meeting – Meeting Minutes</p>

<h2>Note of last meeting and review of actions</h2>

<p>The note of the last meeting of 12 October 2015 was agreed. There were no
outstanding actions. The Secretary of State for Scotland (SoSS) welcomed
members. SoSS also said that the group has a significant role in taking
forward the transfer of welfare powers procedure.</p>

<p>The Cabinet Secretary for Communities, Social Security and Equalities (Cab
Sec CSSE) introduced her role and emphasised the importance of the newly
established Minister for Social Security role which was important given the
scale of challenge and complexity of the social security provisions.</p>

<p>The Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work (Cab Sec EJFW)
commented that he is keen on a smooth transition of powers. It was agreed
that the service provided to benefit recipients will be the primary focus for both
governments.</p>

<h2>Terms of Reference of the Joint Ministerial Working Group on Welfare</h2>

<p>The revised terms of reference were tabled given the responsibility for
implementation of powers to be with this group. The SoSS and the Deputy First Minister (DFM) had previously given an undertaking to the Scottish Parliament’s then Devolution (Further Powers) Committee to publish the terms of reference of the group. SoS DWP confirmed that he is keen to interact with Scottish Parliament in
relation to these issues.</p>

<p>It was agreed that any minister who had an interest in the agenda would be able to attend.</p>

<p>The terms of reference were agreed and the importance of joint working was emphasised. It was agreed that the terms of reference would be shared with the Scottish Parliament’s Social Security Committee and the Scottish
Affairs Committee.</p>

<p>Action: SO</p>

<p>It was agreed that future dates for meetings should be agreed in line with
need.</p>

<p>Action: SO/SG</p>

<h2>Scotland Act 2016 Commencement – Tranche 1</h2>

<p>SoS DWP reiterated his commitment to both governments working together
and noted the excellent engagement at official level to date. Both needed to
be mindful of the potential human impact of changes to service delivery.</p>

<p>SoS DWP spoke about arrangements for commencing some of the the
Welfare Benefit and Employment sections in part 3 of the Scotland Act. It was
agreed that 11 of the 13 sections, including universal credit and Employment
Support, should be commenced in an initial tranche. Once provisions had
been commenced, both governments would need to work together on
timescales for delivery.</p>

<p>The SoSS noted that he planned to take the Commencement Order forward
next month, along with a companion written ministerial statement.</p>

<p>Action: SO</p>

<p>It was agreed that it was important to have a common understanding of
practicalities and timetabling of commencement.</p>

proposed for Tranche 1. Cab Sec CSSE was keen that we take forward work
on Tranche 2 in a timely manner.</p>
