<p>Chair: Secretary of State for Scotland</p>

<p>Dover House, London
Monday 10 September 2018, 11th</p>

<h2>Welcome, introductions, minutes and actions from the previous meeting</h2>

<p>The Secretary of State for Scotland (SoSS), David Mundell MP, welcomed all
attendees, including the new Cabinet Secretary for Social Security and Older
People (CSSO) and thanked Angela Constance MSP and Jeane Freeman MSP in
absentia for their work in this group in their previous ministerial posts. SoSS
highlighted the importance of the group as a forum for both formal and more
informal discussion on devolution in the fields of employability and social security.</p>

<p>All present noted the minutes of the previous meeting had been agreed and will
shortly be published, and that all actions from that meeting were either complete
or included in the agenda of this meeting.</p>

<h2>Legislative updates</h2>
<p>CSSO provided an update noting there are a range of Orders planned in the near
future and stated that the timescales may be challenging for both Governments,
noting the importance of joint working to support this.</p>

<p>CSSO reported that officials are working closely on the detail of an additional
Section 93 Scotland Act Order for delivery of devolved social security benefits, with
an aim for this to be in place by mid to late 2019. CSSO requested reassurances
regarding the timetable to ensure delivery timescales are met. SoSS noted that a
revised draft timetable had been shared. CSSO asked that both sides work
together to ensure timescales are agreed and met. There had been
misunderstandings in this respect with regard to what had been agreed about the
UC Housing provisions. SoS DWP confirmed that her department would support
Local Authorities with the administration of Discretionary Housing Payments in the
interim period. SoSS agreed the need to engage and discuss with COSLA in a
timely manner as required.</p>

<p>CSSO updated the group on Scottish Government’s Programme for Government
which announced the aim to make the first payments of Best Start Grant before
Christmas. CSSO emphasised the need to progress with the Section 104 Scotland
Act Order to close Sure Start Maternity Grants in Scotland and disregard Best Start
Grant payments in income-related benefits at Great Britain level. There had been
some challenges to ensure the Customer Information System (CIS) was available 
to Scottish Government. SoSS clarified that the Scottish Government regulations
needed to be commenced before the GB provisions could take effect. CSSO
confirmed that the BSG regulations were being laid in the Scottish Parliament the
day after the Working Group meeting. Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) officials outlined the issues around CIS, and the interim and long-term solutions available. SG officials confirmed that they were developing contingency plans.</p>

<p>CSSO reported that officials had been continuing to work closely on a draft for the Section 63 Scotland Act Order to facilitate the Job Grant, in line with SG’s implementation timetable.</p>

<p>SoSS noted that the letter regarding the Section 104 Scotland Act Order for Funeral Expenses Assistance had been received, and he would respond shortly.</p>

<h2>Employability Programmes</h2>
<p>The Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills (MfBFWS), Jamie Hepburn MSP,
updated the Group on contracted employment provision. MfBFWS stated that
levels of referrals to Fair Start Scotland from Jobcentres had been in line with
forecasts, and highlighted ongoing successful joint working between DWP and SG,
as well as with contractors and partners. In particular the enthusiasm of work
coaches for Fair Start Scotland had been, and would continue to be, valued.</p>

<p>MfBFWS reported that there had been an ongoing lack of clarity on the devolution
of budgets linked to Specialist Employment Support. SoS DWP highlighted that
the Minister of State for Disabled People, Health and Work, Sarah Newton MP,
had been working closely with the Scottish Government on this.</p>

<h2>Current delivery activity</h2>

<p>CSSO reported that Social Security Scotland was officially operational. She paid
tribute to the hard work of staff in the Scottish Government, the Office of the
Secretary of State for Scotland, and the Department for Work and Pensions in
delivering this aspect of the joint programme of devolution of social security
powers, and noted that joint planning had, in general, worked very well. SoSS
echoed CSSO’s thanks to officials and recognised this as a significant
achievement. SoSS stated that this achievement demonstrated that officials
from the two governments can work together well to reach a positive outcome for
the people of Scotland.</p>

<p>SoS DWP asked for an update on the Scottish Government’s plans for split
payments of the UC award. Universal Credit was fundamentally about providing
wider support for people to meet their aspirations and address their challenges, not
just through financial assistance. Domestic abuse was a case in point, where
support could not be limited to changes to benefit payments.</p>

<p>CSSO explained that the Scottish Government was working with stakeholders and
people in receipt of benefits to develop its policy on splitting payments of the UC
award between partners in a couple. The Scottish Government’s view was that
entitlement to financial independence was a basic human right, and the 
introduction of split payments in UC would increase equality and fairness. CSSO
advised there should be more policy detail by the end of the year. CSSO asked
whether the UK government planned to support the Universal Credit (Application, Advice and Assistance) Bill 2017-19 being taken through by Philippa Whitford MP.</p>

<h2>Future Design and Planning</h2>

<p>CSSO noted that devolution of the remaining benefit areas (“Wave 2”) would bring a higher number of claimants into the Scottish social security system. This would place a premium on close collaborative working to ensure a seamless transition. Both sides would need to work together to ensure timescales were discussed, agreed and met.</p>

<p>SoSS agreed, and noted that Wave 2 changes represented a more significant challenge for both Governments. SoS DWP agreed, and noted the continued importance of sharing policies and plans so that detailed discussions and planning could happen at the right pace. Ministers from both Governments expressed their keenness to draw and apply lessons from experience to date in the devolution of social security and employability provision.</p>

<h2>Any Other Business</h2>
<p>No items</p>

<p>SoSS closed the meeting, stating the next meeting would be held on 13 December 2018.</p>
