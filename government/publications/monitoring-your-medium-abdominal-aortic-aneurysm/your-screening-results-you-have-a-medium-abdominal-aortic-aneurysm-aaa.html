<h2>Who this leaflet is for</h2>

<p>This page provides information for men who have had a <strong>medium aneurysm</strong> found through abdominal aortic aneurysm screening (also called <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> screening).</p>

<h3>Your <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> screening result</h3>

<p>When you were screened we found that your aorta is <strong>wider than normal</strong>. This means that you have a medium abdominal aortic aneurysm.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<ul>
  <li>Small AAA: 3.0cm to 4.4cm</li>
  <li><strong>Medium AAA: 4.5cm to 5.4cm</strong></li>
  <li>Large AAA: 5.5cm or bigger</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Around 1 in 500 men who are screened have a medium <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr>. We will invite you back for an ultrasound scan every 3 months to see if it is enlarging.</p>

<h2>What an abdominal aortic aneurysm is</h2>

<p>The aorta is the main blood vessel that supplies blood to your body. It runs from your heart down through your chest and abdomen.</p>

<p>In some people, as they get older, the wall of the aorta in the abdomen can become weak.</p>

<p>It can then expand and form what is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm.</p>

<h2>How serious a medium <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> is</h2>

<p>A medium <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> can become serious if it continues to enlarge, so it is important to monitor its size. If it enlarges to 5.5cm (large aneurysm) we will arrange for you to have an appointment with a specialist for further test and to talk about possible treatment, usually an operation. A large aneurysm can be very serious because as the wall of the aorta stretches, it becomes weaker and could burst, causing internal bleeding.</p>

<p>Around 85 out of 100 people die when an aneurysm bursts.</p>

<p>Most aneurysms enlarge slowly, so you may never develop a large <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> that needs treatment.</p>

<h2>What happens next</h2>

<ol>
  <li>We will invite you back for a scan in 3 months’ time.</li>
  <li>Just before your next scan is due, we will send you an appointment letter.</li>
  <li>We will arrange for you to speak to a specialist nurse. They will be able to give you advice on your general health in relation to your aneurysm.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Looking after your health</h2>

<p>You can help look after your health by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>seeking help to try to cut down or stop smoking, if you are a smoker</li>
  <li>making sure your blood pressure is normal – if you have not had it checked recently, it is worth getting it checked</li>
  <li>eating a healthy, balanced diet and cutting down on fatty food</li>
  <li>trying to lose weight, if you are overweight</li>
  <li>taking regular exercise</li>
  <li>keeping within sensible limits, if you drink alcohol</li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need to make any other changes to your lifestyle and should continue with any sports or hobbies.</p>

<p>Your GP practice will be able to give you advice on all of the above and may also want to give you medication or review your current medication.</p>

<h2>How often you need to come back</h2>

<p>Everyone is different, so it is not possible to say exactly how many scans you will need to come back for.</p>

<p>We will continue to invite you for a scan every 3 months unless your aorta increases to 5.5cm or wider. We would then arrange an appointment with a specialist for more tests and to talk about possible treatment.</p>

<h3>Why you cannot have an operation now</h3>

<p>All operations have risks and the operation for an abdominal aortic aneurysm is no different.</p>

<p>Research shows that an operation to treat a medium aneurysm has a higher risk of health problems than monitoring the aneurysm and only operating if it enlarges to 5.5cm or wider.</p>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<p>If you have an aneurysm, you will not generally notice any symptoms, so it is unlikely that you will feel any pain or discomfort from a medium aneurysm.</p>

<p>If you go into hospital for any reason, you should let the staff know that you have an abdominal aortic aneurysm found through screening.</p>

<p>If you have questions about your screening result, you can phone your local screening programme. If you feel generally unwell, you should speak to your GP.</p>

<h3>Symptoms of a burst aneurysm</h3>

<p>It is extremely unlikely that a medium <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> will burst, but it is important that you are aware of any symptoms of a ruptured <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you have new symptoms of severe, persistent abdominal and/or lower back pain, you should seek immediate medical help through an accident and emergency department. Make sure you tell any medical staff that you have an <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you have questions about your screening result, you can phone your local screening programme. If you feel generally unwell, you should speak to your GP.</p>

<h2>Close family</h2>

<p>The risk of having an <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> increases if your brother, sister or parent has, or has had, an abdominal aortic aneurysm.</p>

<p>You should therefore inform any brothers, sisters or children that your <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> means that they are also at risk. They can ask their GP about the possibility of requesting a scan at an age 5 years earlier than the age at which your <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> was found.</p>

<h2>Driving</h2>

<p>Car drivers:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You must inform the DVLA if your aneurysm grows to 6cm.</li>
  <li>Your licence will be suspended if your aneurysm grows to 6.5cm.</li>
  <li>Your licence will be reinstated after your aneurysm has been successfully treated.</li>
</ol>

<p>Bus, coach and lorry drivers:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You must inform the DVLA that you have an aneurysm.</li>
  <li>Your licence will be suspended if your aneurysm grows to 5.5cm.</li>
  <li>Your licence will be reinstated after your aneurysm has been successfully treated.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Health-related insurance</h2>

<p>If you declare your <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> when applying for travel or any other health-related insurance you may be charged an additional premium or have the condition excluded from cover. When looking for cover, a broker can help. The British Insurance Brokers Association operates a ‘find a broker’ service. Visit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.biba.org.uk" rel="external">their website</a> or call 0370 950 1790.</p>
