<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<h3>Who is this guide for?</h3>

<p>This guide is for tenants who are renting a house or flat from a private landlord on an Assured or Assured Shorthold Tenancy in England or Wales.</p>

<p>This guide is designed to assist tenants whose landlord or letting agent has served them with a notice requiring possession (Form 6A for the section 21 possession process in England) or a notice seeking possession (Form 3 for the section 8 possession process). This starts the possession action process, through which you may legally be evicted from your home. See the <a href="#an-overview-of-the-possession-process" class="govuk-link">overview of the possession process</a> below.</p>

<p>This guidance also provides useful advice for tenants who are in rent arrears or who otherwise feel that they may be at risk of being served with notice by their landlord.</p>

<p>Most of this guidance will equally apply if you are in a shared property but in certain cases your rights and responsibilities will vary. The guide does not cover lodgers (people who live with their landlord) or people with licences (such as many property guardians – see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/property-guardians-fact-sheet" class="govuk-link">specific guidance</a>), or tenants living in a property which is not their main or only home.</p>

<p>Separate guidance is available for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-the-possession-action-process-guidance-for-landlords-and-tenants/understanding-the-possession-action-process-a-guide-for-social-rented-tenants-in-england-and-wales">social tenants</a>.</p>

<p>If you are an owner occupier and are worried about you mortgage lender repossessing your home, separate guidance is available at: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/repossession">https://www.gov.uk/repossession</a>.</p>

<p>Being served with a notice seeking or requiring possession can be a worrying or stressful experience. This guide will help you to understand your rights, and the options which are available to you. However, this guidance is intended as information rather than legal advice. It is important that you access legal and money advice and support tailored to your individual circumstances as early as possible.</p>

<p>For general advice about renting a property under an Assured Shorthold Tenancy, please consult our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-rent" class="govuk-link">How to rent guide (England only)</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> An overview of the possession process</h2>

<p>If there is a change in your circumstances which will make it difficult for you to keep to the terms of your tenancy (such as your ability to pay rent) you should let your landlord know as soon as possible. You and your landlord should try to resolve these matters outside of court. More information can be found at Part 5 of this guidance ‘If you are worried about rent arrears’. Your landlord may suggest using a third-party dispute resolution or mediation service. You should engage with this process to avoid formal possession proceedings in the courts.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 1: Notice requiring/seeking possession</strong></p>

<p>Your landlord will give you a notice requiring possession (under section 21 of the Housing Act 1988), or a notice seeking possession (under section 8 of the Housing Act 1988). The notice will specify a date by which you are being asked to leave your home and after which possession proceedings may be started in the county court.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Due to coronavirus (COVID-19), there have been alterations to the length of notice period required when serving Section 8 and Section 21 notices in England and Wales since 26 March 2020.
<br><br>
<strong>In England</strong> 
<br><br>
From 1 October 2021, all notice periods returned to their pre-pandemic lengths.<br><br> 
However, if you served a notice between 26 March 2020 and 30 September 2021, the notice period needed to be different:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From 26 March 2020 to 28 August 2020, a notice period of 3 months was required in all cases.</li>
  <li>From 29 August 2020 to 31 May 2021, a notice period of 6 months was required in most cases, with exemptions for certain serious cases, including anti-social behaviour, extreme rent arrears, no right to rent and fraud.</li>
  <li>From 1 June 2021 until 30 September 2021, a notice period of 4 months was required in most cases, with exemptions for certain serious cases including anti-social behaviour, rent arrears, no right to rent and fraud.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more detailed information about notice periods changes, including the exemptions, please see <a href="#section-8-notice" class="govuk-link">Section 8 notices</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-21-notice">Section 21 notices</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-a-minimum-notice-period-lengths-under-section-8-of-the-housing-act-1988-in-england">Annex A</a> provides a full list of Section 8 notice period requirements since March 2020. You can also find more information in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-and-renting-guidance-for-landlords-tenants-and-local-authorities/technical-guidance-on-eviction-notices">Technical guidance on eviction notices</a>. 
<br><br>
<strong>In Wales</strong>
<br><br>
If your landlord served you notice between 26 March 2020 and 23 July 2020, they had to provide 3 months’ notice.<br><br>
If your landlord served or serves you notice on or after 24 July 2020 until at least 24 March 2022, the notice period must be at least 6 months, other than for grounds relating to anti-social behaviour which remained at 3 months until 28 September but have subsequently returned to their pre-Coronavirus Act 2020 lengths of 1 month or less, depending on the type of tenancy and ground used. <a href="#annex-b-minimum-notice-period-lengths-under-section-8-of-the-housing-act-1988-in-wales" class="govuk-link">Annex B</a> provides a full list of Section 8 notice period requirements in Wales since March 2020.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Stage 2: If you stay in your home after the notice expires</strong></p>

<p>If you do not leave by the date in the notice, your landlord can issue a claim for possession in the county court. Your landlord will have to provide the court with a Covid Notice informing the court, to the best of your landlord’s knowledge, of what the effect of the coronavirus pandemic has been on you and your dependants. The Covid Notice should be detailed on Section 7 of the Particulars of Claim  form and further information can be provided on a written note attached to that form. The Particulars of Claim set out the legal basis upon which the landlord claims to be entitled to possession for example arrears of rent.</p>

<p>You will be sent a copy of the landlord’s claim documents. You will also receive information on where to obtain legal advice to help you with your case. You can file a defence against a notice given under section 8 and you can challenge the validity of the notice whichever process has been used. You can include details about your circumstances and how you have been affected by the pandemic. If you are likely to suffer extreme hardship as a result of having to leave your home, you can ask the court to postpone possession for up to a maximum of 6 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 3: Before the hearing</strong></p>

<p>You will be notified by the court of the date for the hearing and the court will provide you with any further directions as necessary. Your landlord will need to provide you with all the case documents including the Covid Notice setting out the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on you and/or your dependants. Before the hearing, you and your landlord should attempt to reach a settlement, for example agreeing a plan to repay rent arrears. A legal adviser may be able to help you to reach a settlement with your landlord. Your landlord should inform the court if a settlement has been reached and a hearing is no longer required.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 4: The possession hearing</strong></p>

<p>If a settlement cannot be agreed, there will be a full possession hearing, at which a judge will decide whether to make a possession order. If you are an assured shorthold tenant and your landlord is using the section 21 possession process, the court may make a decision without a review appointment or a hearing taking place, as it may be clear, on the papers submitted, that your landlord is entitled to a possession order.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 5: Warrant for possession and bailiffs</strong></p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If a possession order was granted at the hearing and you do not leave your home by the date specified in the order, your landlord can apply for a warrant of possession, which enables a county court bailiff to evict you. In some circumstances, you can apply to suspend the warrant. However, if you do not make an application or if the court does not agree to suspend the warrant, a county court bailiff will enforce the warrant and evict you from your home.
<br><br>
In England and in Wales, legislation which restricted bailiff enforcement of evictions has now been lifted. This was in place in England from 17 November 2020 until 31 May 2021 and in Wales from 11 December 2020 until 30 June 2021. Therefore, orders can now be enforced where the landlord has a valid warrant of possession.
<br><br>
However, bailiffs must provide 14 days’ notice of an eviction and have been asked not to carry out an eviction if they are made aware that anyone living in the property has COVID-19 symptoms or is self-isolating.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> If your landlord has an outstanding warrant of possession</h2>

<p>In England and in Wales, legislation which restricted bailiff enforcement of evictions has now been lifted. This was in place in England from 17 November 2020 until 31 May 2021 and in Wales from 11 December 2020 until 30 June 2021. Therefore, orders can now be enforced where the landlord has a valid warrant of possession.</p>

<p>However, bailiffs must provide 14 days’ notice of an eviction and have been asked not to carry out an eviction if they are made aware that anyone living in the property has COVID-19 symptoms or is self-isolating.</p>

<p>You will receive a ‘notice of eviction’ form (form N54), which states that a warrant has been issued giving bailiffs the authority to evict you.</p>

<p>However, bailiffs will not carry out an eviction if they are made aware that you or anyone you live with has coronavirus symptoms, has tested positive for COVID-19 or are waiting for a test result, or has been instructed by the NHS to self-isolate. If this applies to you, you must inform the court at the address provided on the N54 form, explaining when the symptoms started and/or how long you have been in self-isolation for. The appointment will be rescheduled for a later date with a minimum of 14 days’ notice.</p>

<p>When you receive the notice of eviction form, you can make an application to suspend the warrant, which if successful will result in the eviction being postponed or the warrant being set aside, allowing you to remain in your home. The court fee for making an application to suspend is £14. You must follow the instructions on the notice if you wish to make an application to suspend the warrant. See Stage 5 for more information about the circumstances under which a suspension may be granted.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> If you are worried about rent arrears</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Financial support</strong>
<br><br>
If you fall into financial difficulties due to a change in your employment or earnings you may qualify for Universal Credit. Find more information about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/how-to-claim-universal-credit" class="govuk-link">Universal Credit</a>.
<br><br>
Local authorities can provide support for tenants to stay in their homes. Ask your council about Discretionary Housing Payments. Find out more information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/financial-support-for-businesses-during-coronavirus-covid-19">government support for employers and employees</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>It is important that you contact your landlord or agent as soon as possible if you are worried that you may not be able to meet your rental payments. An early conversation with your landlord can help you to agree a plan if you are struggling to pay the rent. This can include agreeing that your landlord does not seek possession action for a period of time and instead accepts a lower level of rent from you. You may also reach an agreement to plan to pay off arrears at a later date.</p>

<p>If you have suffered a loss of income or other changes to your financial circumstances, you must write to your landlord to set out your circumstances and what you are doing to address them, in as much detail as you feel able to. You must set out a payment proposal and make clear that you are willing to engage in regular contact with your landlord to resolve the situation.</p>

<p>If you and your dependants have been affected by the pandemic in a way that has affected your ability to pay the rent, or to keep to other terms of your tenancy agreement, let your landlord know the details.</p>

<p>The housing charity Shelter has more information on its website about requesting a rent reduction caused by the coronavirus outbreak, including a <a rel="external" href="https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/private_renting/how_to_negotiate_a_rent_reduction_during_the_coronavirus_outbreak" class="govuk-link">template letter</a> which you can use.</p>

<p>The government has also worked with the National Residential Landlords Association to produce a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nrla.org.uk/resources/ending-your-tenancy/pre-action-plan-avoiding-possession-claims" rel="external">guide for Managing arrears and avoiding possession claims in the context of the coronavirus pandemic</a>, which you and your landlord may find useful</p>

<p>When discussing your options with your landlord, a consumer advice service, your local council or a legal advisor, they may offer a mediation service. There are several services available in the market which specialise in resolving disputes in the private rented sector (such as TDS Resolution, PRS Mediation Service and Resolve by Flatfair) which they may use.</p>

<p>Mediation allows an independent third-party to assist those involved to reach a mutually acceptable agreement to resolve their dispute, without the matter needing to progress through court. This may include agreeing to a rent repayment plan. Settling a dispute early could help you to avoid a breakdown in relations with your landlord and let you move forward with the tenancy. You don’t have to talk to a mediator if you don’t want to, although it might be preferable to court action. It may also prevent additional costs for your landlord.</p>

<p>Where mediation is provided privately, the landlord typically pays, but this does not mean that the mediator is not able to help you both, and it is generally in your interests to engage with a mediator and see if they can help you to agree a mutually agreeable solution.</p>

<p>If mediation has not been offered, but you feel that it would be suitable for your circumstances, you may wish to find a suitable scheme in your area and ask your landlord to consider using it. There are several services, as well as individual mediators, available in the market who specialise in resolving disputes. There is no single list of organisations or schemes offering dispute resolution in specific areas, but you can check by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>asking your local council: some local authorities offer free of charge specialist support for landlords who are considering serving a notice of possession (you can find your local council using this tool</li>
  <li>searching online</li>
  <li>asking a consumer advice service such as Citizens Advice</li>
  <li>consulting a legal professional</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do agree a plan to pay off arrears at a later date, it is important you stick to this plan. Talk to your landlord immediately if you are unable to do so.</p>

<p>If your landlord refuses to communicate with you or refuses to enter into a payment plan, you must pay what you can afford. The fact that some amount has been paid regularly may help you to keep your home when the case is heard at court.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Stages of the possession process</h2>

<h3>Stage 1: What to do when you are served with a notice of possession</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>It is important that you read the Section 8 or Section 21 notice carefully. You should act quickly and calmly and seek advice about your circumstances as quickly as possible.</p>
</div>

<p>You should think about whether you have a good case to stay in your home if you go to court, but also about what your options are if you decide to leave. If there is a risk you that will become homeless and will need assistance from your local council, you should contact your homelessness team for advice before agreeing to leave the property.</p>

<p>If you are served with a section 8 or section 21 notice you could seek advice from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/about-us/contact-us/contact-us/contact-us/" rel="external">Citizens Advice</a> or <a href="https://england.shelter.org.uk/get_help" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Shelter</a>. Talking to an adviser face to face or over the phone may help to put your mind at ease and going through the case in detail with them could result in a better outcome. For example, you may be able to stay in your home or have more time to seek out alternative accommodation.</p>

<p>You can ask your local council for help as soon as you get a notice seeking possession. They may help you to stay in your home, including supporting negotiations between you and your landlord, or to find alternative accommodation. Find the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council" class="govuk-link">website of your local council</a>.</p>

<p>You should also talk to your landlord or letting agent. They may decide to permit you to stay if you can prove that you can repay any rent arrears.</p>

<p>If you are unsure which type of tenancy you have, you can use Shelter’s <a href="https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/downloads_and_tools/tenancy_rights_checker" class="govuk-link" rel="external">tenancy rights checker</a>.</p>

<h4>Rules which your landlord must follow</h4>

<p>If you do not agree to bring your tenancy to an end, your landlord must follow the court process to regain possession of your home. This includes, for both Section 8 or Section 21 claims, providing a statement to the court setting out what knowledge they have about the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on you and your dependants. Their claim for possession may not proceed if they do not provide this information.</p>

<p>Your landlord must not harass you, if they do, they will be acting unlawfully. Examples of unlawful eviction and harassment are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>making threats</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>violence towards you, your household members or property</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>entering your home without your permission</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>changing the locks when you are out</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>turning off essential services</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are subjected to unlawful behaviour, you must contact, a solicitor, Shelter and/or the police.</p>

<h4>If you are served with a Section 8 notice</h4>

<p>Section 8 notices apply to assured shorthold tenancies and assured tenancies.</p>

<p>You can receive a Section 8 notice at any time during your tenancy. Your landlord has to provide a reason for giving you a section 8 notice. There are several reasons, or grounds, for serving a Section 8 notice. These include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>rent arrears</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>damage to the property</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>causing a nuisance to neighbours (anti-social behaviour)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>breach of contract terms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the landlord wants to move back into the property</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the property is being repossessed by the mortgagee</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Due to coronavirus (COVID-19):</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>In England</strong>
<br><br>
From 1 October 2021, notice periods in respect of the various grounds for possession returned to what they were prior to the pandemic. The notice periods are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-a-minimum-notice-period-lengths-under-section-8-of-the-housing-act-1988-in-england">Annex A</a> of this guidance. You can also find more information in our our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-and-renting-guidance-for-landlords-tenants-and-local-authorities/technical-guidance-on-eviction-notices">Technical guidance on eviction notices</a>.
<br><br>
However, if a notice was served between 26 March 2020 and 30 September 2021, the notice period which needed to be provided by your landlord may have been longer than before the pandemic, dependent on the ground used and when the notice was served - see below.</p>

<p><strong>26 March 2020 to 28 August 2020</strong></p>

<p>Under the provisions of the Coronavirus Act 2020, a notice seeking possession which was served by a landlord from 26 March to 28 August 2020 must have provided the tenant with a notice period of at least 3 months.</p>

<p><strong>29 August 2020 to 31 May 2021</strong></p>

<p>If your landlord served you notice on or after 29 August 2020 until 31 May 2021, the notice period had to be at least 6 months for most grounds. However, there were exceptions to this in some instances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For notices in relation to anti-social behaviour, rioting and false statement, the required notice periods returned to their pre-Coronavirus Act 2020 lengths.</li>
  <li>Where at least 6 months of rent was unpaid, a minimum 4-week notice period was required. If less than 6 months of rent was unpaid, then the notice period was 6 months.</li>
  <li>Where a tenant had passed away or was in breach of immigration rules and did not have a right to rent a property in the United Kingdom, a minimum 3-month notice period was usually required.
<br><br>
<strong>1 June 2021 to 30 September 2021</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p>From 1 June 2021 to 30 September 2021, landlords were required to serve at least 4 months’ notice in all but the most serious cases, and other changes were made appropriate to the easing of national restrictions, so that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For notices in relation to anti-social behaviour, rioting and false statement, the required notice periods continued to be the pre-Coronavirus Act 2020 length, as had been the case from 29 August 2020.</li>
  <li>Notices served in relation to the death of a tenant and no right to rent returned to the pre-coronavirus length from 1 June 2021.</li>
  <li>Where 4 month or more months’ rent is outstanding, the notice period was 4 weeks.</li>
  <li>For cases where possession was sought on rent arrears grounds and less than 4 months’ rent was outstanding, the notice period was 4 months between 1 June 2021 and 31 July 2021 and 2 months between 1 August 2021 and 30 September 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>Further information about notice period lengths since 26 March 2020 can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-a-minimum-notice-period-lengths-under-section-8-of-the-housing-act-1988-in-england">Annex A</a>.
<br><br>
<strong>In Wales</strong>
<br><br>
If your landlord gave you notice from the 26 March to 23 July 2020, the notice period must have been for at least 3 months for all grounds.
<br><br>
If your landlord served or serves you notice on or after 24 July 2020 until at least 24 March 2022, the notice period must be at least 6 months, other than for grounds relating to anti-social behaviour which remained at 3 months until 28 September but which subsequently returned to their pre-Coronavirus Act 2020 lengths of 1 month or less, depending on the type of tenancy and ground used.</p>
</div>

<p>If you do not move out and the landlord wishes to start possession proceedings, they must apply to court within a year of giving you the notice. If they don’t, the notice will expire and the landlord cannot use it.</p>

<h4>What to do next</h4>

<p>Once the landlord has made a Claim for Possession, you will be able to provide reasons for contesting the claim, if there are any, in your defence (see <a href="#defence-form" class="govuk-link">below</a>). You will be able to contest the Claim at the court hearing.</p>

<p>When you receive a section 8 notice, you can check that the notice has been served correctly. You can also check if you think that the grounds that they have used are justified. You are able to contest the landlord’s claim on either basis, or on the basis of discrimination or disability.</p>

<p>In order to serve a valid section 8 notice, your landlord must have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Completed the section 8 notice correctly.</strong> The notice will not be valid if it doesn’t include your name, the address of the property, the grounds for possession (why your landlord wants you to leave), and the date the notice ends.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Provided a valid reason for the eviction.</strong> The section 8 notice should explain what grounds your landlord is using to evict you (numbered 1-17), and why the landlord is using the grounds for possession. If you think that the ground your landlord is using doesn’t apply, you can state this in your defence. You could, for example, explain that you have paid off rent arrears that you previously owed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The type of ground(s) which the landlord is using to evict you will affect how much discretion the court has as to whether to grant possession:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Grounds 1 to 8 are mandatory grounds. This means that the court must grant possession if the grounds can be proven.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grounds 9 to 17 are discretionary grounds. This means that the judge is not bound to give possession even if the ground is met. The court will decide whether they agree that is reasonable for the eviction to proceed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your landlord can use both mandatory and discretionary grounds. The court will look first at whether the mandatory grounds which your landlord has listed are valid. If these cannot be proven, the court will then look at the discretionary grounds in order to make a decision.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is unlawful for a landlord to seek to end your tenancy based on your gender, ethnicity, disability, or any other protected characteristic. In some circumstances, it may be possible to prevent the eviction if you feel that the landlord has discriminated against you based on who you are (for example because of your gender, or if they have refused to make changes for a disability you may have), or if you feel that you are being evicted because you complained about discrimination before (this is known as victimisation). You may also be able to challenge an eviction if you feel that it is connected to your disability.</p>

<p>More information about discrimination is available from the Citizens’ Advice website:</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>However, you should always seek legal advice before challenging an eviction notice based on disability and/or discrimination.</p>

<h4>If you are served with a section 21 notice</h4>

<p>Section 21 notices apply to assured shorthold tenancies only.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>In England</strong></p>

<p>From 1 October 2021, all notice periods returned to their pre-pandemic lengths. This means that a Section 21 notice served by your landlord on or after this date must provide you with at least 2 month’s notice.</p>

<p>However, if you were served a Section 21 notice by your landlord between 26 March 2020 and 30 September 2021, the notice period required was longer due to coronavirus (COVID-19) Regulations. The length of notice required was dependant on the date on which the notice was served, as set out below. You can find more information in our our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-and-renting-guidance-for-landlords-tenants-and-local-authorities/technical-guidance-on-eviction-notices">Technical guidance on eviction notices</a>.</p>

<p><strong>26 March 2020 to 28 August 2020</strong></p>

<p>From 26 March 2020 to 28 August 2020, the minimum notice period that your landlord was required to provide when serving a section 21 notice was 3 months.</p>

<p><strong>29 August 2020 to 31 May 2021</strong></p>

<p>From 29 August 2020 until 31 May 2021 the minimum section 21 notice period was 6 months.</p>

<p><strong>1 June 2021 to 30 September 2021</strong></p>

<p>From 1 June 2021 until 30 September 2021, the minimum section 21 notice period was 4 months.</p>

<p><strong>In Wales</strong></p>

<p>If your landlord served you notice between 26 March 2020 and 23 July 2020, the notice period must have been at least 3 months.</p>

<p>If your landlord served or serves you notice on or after 24 July 2020 until at least 24 March 2022, the notice period must be at least 6 months.</p>
</div>

<p>In limited circumstances, you might be able to challenge the claim for possession and stay longer in your home. However, you should think carefully before doing this because you may have to pay court costs if your landlord issues court proceedings. It is important to get legal advice about this.</p>

<p>It is unlawful for a landlord to seek to end your tenancy based on your gender, ethnicity, disability, or any other protected characteristic. In some circumstances, it may be possible to prevent the eviction if you feel that the landlord has discriminated against you based on who you are (for example because of your gender, or if they have refused to make changes for a disability you may have), or if you feel that you are being evicted because you complained about discrimination before (this is known as victimisation). You may also be able to challenge an eviction if you feel that it is connected to your disability.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>However, you should always seek legal advice before challenging an eviction notice on the basis of disability and/or discrimination.</p>

<h4>Checking if the section 21 notice is valid</h4>

<p>When you receive a section 21 notice, you can check that the notice is valid. You can seek help from Shelter or Citizens Advice if you are unsure.</p>

<p>To serve a valid section 21 notice, the landlord must have completed the following steps, although not all of these will be relevant to every tenancy (see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/evicting-tenants/section-21-and-section-8-notices/" class="govuk-link">guide</a>.</p>

<p><strong>In England</strong>, your landlord must have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Given you the right amount of notice to leave. That is:.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>at least 2 months’ notice to leave if your landlord gave you notice on or after 1 October 2021.</li>
      <li>at least 4 months’ notice to leave if your landlord gave you notice on or after 1 June 2021 until 30 September 2021.</li>
      <li>at least 6 months’ notice to leave if your landlord gave you notice on or after 29 August 2020 until 31 May 2021.</li>
      <li>If your landlord served you with notice on or after 26 March until 28 August 2020, they must provide you with at least 3 months’ notice.</li>
      <li>If your landlord served you with notice before 26 March 2020, they must provide you with at least 2 months’ notice.</li>
      <li>If you have a periodic tenancy the minimum notice period may be greater than those set out above, you should check this in your tenancy agreement.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given you the notice not sooner than 4 months after your (first) tenancy of the property started.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Used Form 6A when giving notice. If your tenancy started after 1 October 2015, your section 21 notice will only be valid if your landlord used the right version of Form 6A (or a document setting out the same information as is required under that form).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Protected your deposit in a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tenancy-deposit-protection">government-approved deposit protection scheme</a> within 30 days of your most recent contract starting and given you information about where your deposit is held. Your landlord must provide you with certain details about the deposit known as ‘prescribed information’. This includes your landlord’s contact details and information, the details of where and how your deposit is being protected, information on how to resolve a dispute about your deposit and on how to get your deposit back when you leave.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obtained a licence for the property from the local authority, if the property needed one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Started court proceedings in time. Your landlord must generally have made a claim for possession in the court within 6 months of giving you the notice, if they gave you the notice on or after 31 October 2021.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Your landlord must generally have made a claim for possession in the court within 10 months of giving you the notice, if they gave you the notice between 29 August 2020 and 31 May 2021.</p>

<p>Your landlord must generally have made a claim for possession in the court within 8 months of giving you the notice, if they gave you the notice on or after 1 June.</p>

<p>If they gave you the notice on or before 28 August 2020, they must generally have made a claim for possession in the court within 6 months of giving you the notice.</p>

<p>However, if your tenancy is a periodic tenancy under which more than 4 months’ notice is required, your landlord can make the claim up to 4 months after the date specified in the notice as the date after which you must leave the property. You should note that landlords could still make claims while the stay on possession proceedings was ongoing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provided you with the right documents giving information about your home and your rights and responsibilities as a renter. This includes a valid gas safety certificate if there is a gas installation in in the property, an energy performance certificate, and the version of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-rent" class="govuk-link">How to rent guide</a> which was most up to date when your contract started or was renewed.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/retaliatory-eviction-and-the-deregulation-act-2015-guidance-note" class="govuk-link">complained about the condition of the property</a>, and your local authority has inspected and served an improvement notice or notice of emergency remedial action, your landlord cannot use a section 21 notice for 6 months and must complete the repairs.</p>

<p>Your landlord must not have charged any prohibited fees during your contract. The law says that your landlord is only allowed to take certain permitted payments. These are set out in the T<a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/819635/TFA_Tenant_Guidance_190722.pdf">enant Fees Act 2019 guidance for tenants</a>.</p>

<p><strong>In Wales</strong>, your landlord must have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Given you at least 6 months’ notice to leave,, if they serve or have served you the notice on or after 24 July 2020 until 24 March 2022, If they gave you notice from the 26 March to 23 July 2020 they must have given you at least to leave 3 months’ notice to leave. If they. If they served you notice before 26 March 2020, they must have given you at least 2 months’ notice to leave. The notice must be in writing.</li>
</ul>

<p>In a fixed term tenancy, your landlord can serve a section 21 notice at any time, but it cannot end until the end of the fixed term. In a periodic tenancy, notice can be given at any time, but the appropriate notice period must be given and the date specified in the notice as the date after which you must leave the property, must be the last day of a period of the tenancy.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Protected your deposit in a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tenancy-deposit-protection">government-approved deposit protection scheme</a> within 30 days of your most recent contract starting and given you information about where your deposit is held. Your landlord must provide you with certain details about the deposit known as ‘prescribed information’.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obtained other licences from the local authority, if the property needed one such as in HMO accommodation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Your landlord must not have charged any prohibited fees during your contract. The law says that your landlord is only allowed to take certain permitted payments. If you have paid a prohibited payment to your landlord, they cannot evict you using a section 21 notice until the money is repaid. The list of prohibited or allowable payments is set out in the <a href="https://gov.wales/sites/default/files/publications/2019-08/tenant-letting-fees-detailed-guidance.pdf" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Renting Homes (Fees Etc.) (Wales) Act 2019 guidance for landlords and agents</a>.</p>

<h3>Stage 2: If you stay in your home after the notice expires</h3>

<p>In many cases, if you are an assured shorthold tenant, leaving the property before your notice expires will be the most appropriate course of action. You may want to return the property to avoid legal proceedings and becoming liable for your landlord’s court costs. Your landlord may also be prepared to write off arrears if you leave by agreement, although this should be discussed with your landlord.</p>

<p>Before moving out, always:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>obtain legal advice so that you are clear about the legal position.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contact your local authority for advice about your housing options, especially if you are struggling to find somewhere to live.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>inform your landlord and return the keys.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you remain in your home and your landlord wishes to proceed with court action to evict you, the court will send you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>copies of the landlord’s claim documents.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a copy of the landlord’s notice to the court about the effects of the pandemic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a defence form for you to complete.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If your landlord applied for possession before 3 August 2020, they must make an application to the court if they want to continue with the claim. You will receive a copy of their application. If you want to challenge your landlord’s application, you will receive instructions from the court on how to do this.</p>

<p>The landlord may use the standard possession procedure, in which a court hearing will take place. If this is the case, you will receive any further directions with regard to the court hearing, the address of the court where the case will be heard, and date of the court hearing.</p>

<p>You can find the contact details for the court at which your hearing is being held at on the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://courttribunalfinder.service.gov.uk/search/address">Courts and tribunal finder wwebiste</a>.</p>

<p>The court will also send you details about how to obtain free advice on your circumstances, if you have not already done so. We would strongly advise that you take advantage of this opportunity to obtain advice and assistance.</p>

<p>Court hearings for possessions are usually held in the county court that covers the area where your home is. You should let the court know as soon as possible if you have any special requirements, for example if you need extra assistance to access the building.</p>

<p>You or your landlord can ask the judge to consider whether the hearing takes place remotely, by putting a request in writing and sending it to the court. Both parties will need to agree that the hearing can take place remotely, however it will be the judge who makes the final decision as to how the hearing proceeds.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You should not come to any of our court and tribunal buildings if you have coronavirus symptoms, if you have tested positive for coronavirus, or if you have been instructed by the NHS to self-isolate. Please contact the court or tribunal before you are due to attend so that they can make appropriate arrangements for your hearing.</p>
</div>

<p>Alternatively, the landlord can apply to the court using the accelerated possession procedure that does not require a court hearing, if they used a section 21 notice and they are not claiming rent arrears. They do not need to provide a reason for repossession if they use the Section 21 process. It is important that you file a defence if you feel that that there is a legal reason why your landlord may not be entitled to possession or if you want possession to be postponed due to extreme hardship. <strong>For accelerated possession claims, there will only be a hearing if the judge considers that the legal position requires clarification, or if the judge considers that you may need extra time (up to a maximum of 6 weeks) to move out due to extreme hardship.</strong></p>

<h4>The defence form</h4>

<p>The court will provide you with instructions on how you can get advice about defending the possession claim.</p>

<p>The defence form enables you to contest the landlord’s claim for possession because they have not followed the correct procedures in evicting you and/or the reasons the landlord provides for the eviction (where applicable) are not valid, for example, if you have paid off any rent arrears which you previously owed.</p>

<p>If you have difficulty filling in the form which has been sent to you, you can send the court a short statement explaining your circumstances, including any difficulties which you have faced as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, and why a possession order should not be made.</p>

<p>The possession process which the landlord uses will affect how you can defend your case, based on your circumstances. If the landlord is using the section 21 process, they do not have to provide a reason to evict you.</p>

<p>Some of the situations in which you may wish to challenge a possession claim are set out above (‘What to do if you are served with notice seeking or requiring possession’). Your personal circumstances may have changed since the notice was first issued, for example, and you may now be in a position to pay off rent arrears. If this is the case, you may wish to describe on the defence form how your circumstances have changed and why you feel that the landlord should no longer be able to obtain possession of your home.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, where your landlord is using the section 8 process, you may consider making a counterclaim. For example, a claim for compensation if your tenancy deposit wasn’t protected or if repairs needed at the property were not carried out.</p>

<p>You need to return the defence form to the court as soon as possible. You can return your defence to the landlord’s claim at the email or postal addresses provided, or via Possession Claims Online.</p>

<p>It is important that you seek advice and return the defence form, or a statement outlining your circumstances, to the court. This is because you may have to pay extra court fees if you do not provide information in the defence form and this results in a delay to your court case.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Important:</strong> If your landlord is using the accelerated possession process, the defence form may be your only opportunity to contest the landlord’s claim for possession.</p>
</div>

<h4>Defence forms and COVID-19</h4>

<p>When making a claim for possession, the landlord must provide information setting out, to the best of their knowledge, how you and your dependants have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>This must include any information they have about how you and your dependants (for example, any children living in your home with you) have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic in a way which is relevant to the claim, for example if you have suffered a loss of income as a result of the coronavirus pandemic which has led to the accrual of rent arrears.</p>

<p>However, when filling out the defence form, you can also tell the court whether your circumstances have been affected by COVID-19 and how this is relevant to the landlord’s possession claim.. For example, you may wish to record:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>whether there were arrears outstanding before March 2020</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether you were placed on the government’s Coronavirus Job Retention scheme (furlough), and whether you have offered or paid a related proportion of rent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether you have obtained Universal Credit since March 2020, and whether you have offered or paid a related proportion of rent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if you have been unable to earn by reason of COVID-19</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if you have been shielding, were asked to self-isolate by NHS Test, Track and Trace or if you were required to quarantine under travel restrictions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>what proposals you have to pay the rent</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Where relevant, it may be helpful to collate evidence, demonstrating how the coronavirus pandemic has affected your personal circumstances. This could include, for example, the letter you will have received from the NHS or your GP confirming that you previously had clinically extremely vulnerable status, if applicable, or confirmation from your employer that you were placed on furlough. This may assist the judge when making a decision in your case. You should discuss this with your adviser.</p>

<p>Misleading the court is a criminal offence. You should only indicate that your case has been affected by COVID-19 if you have been affected by the pandemic in a way which is relevant to your landlord’s possession claim - principally, if this has affected your ability to pay your rent.</p>

<h4>How to seek advice on filling out your defence form</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You may qualify for legal aid to assist you in your case. Legal aid can help meet the costs of legal advice, and representation in a court or tribunal. Legal aid may also protect you from paying your landlord’s court costs if you lose the case. You can also seek advice from Citizens Advice or Shelter.</p>
</div>

<p>When you receive your defence form, you will receive a leaflet with information on how to apply for legal aid to help you to complete and file a defence.</p>

<h3>Stage 3: What you need to do before the hearing</h3>

<p>It is important that you follow the instructions provided in the papers sent to you by the court as there may be further directions.</p>

<p>Before the possession hearing, you should take the opportunity to seek legal advice on your case. Where possible and appropriate, you and your landlord should try to reach a settlement before the hearing; for example, you may wish to reach an agreement under which you can stay in your home as long as you repay any outstanding rent arrears through a monthly repayment plan. A legal adviser may be able to help you to reach a settlement wih your landlord ahead of the court hearing.</p>

<p>Before the court hearing, you should receive a copy of all the documents relating to the case, including the landlord’s claim form and the Covid Notice, setting out what information they have on the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on you and your dependants. The landlord is required to submit this information when they make a claim. If you have not received these documents, you should let the duty advisor, or the judge, know on the day of the hearing. If your landlord did not provide you with the correct information about the case before the hearing, the hearing may be adjourned until this has been provided. However, if the landlord can prove that they made reasonable attempts to serve you with the relevant documents relating to the case, the hearing may proceed.</p>

<h3>Stage 4: The possession hearing</h3>

<h4>Attending a hearing</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Before attending court, it is important that you check the website on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/what-to-expect-coming-to-a-court-or-tribunal">what to expect when coming to a court or tribunal</a>. This contains information about the additional measures which are in place during the coronavirus pandemic, including details about when you should avoid attending court in order to prevent the spread of the virus.</p>
</div>

<p>If you have not previously done so, it is important you take independent legal advice on your circumstances before you attend the full possession hearing. You should seek legal advice (for example, from <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://england.shelter.org.uk/get_help">Shelter</a> or <a rel="external" href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/about-us/contact-us/contact-us/contact-us/" class="govuk-link">Citizens Advice</a>) on how to proceed with your case. You will also have the opportunity to get advice from a duty solicitor on the day of the court hearing (see below).</p>

<p>At a county court possession hearing, a judge decides whether the landlord should be granted possession of the property.</p>

<p>It is important that you attend the court hearing wherever possible. This will enable the judge to hear from both your landlord and you. The hearing is for 15 minutes, with additional time between hearings for COVID-19 safety procedures. See more <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/what-to-expect-coming-to-a-court-or-tribunal" class="govuk-link">guidance on attending a court or tribunal</a>.</p>

<p>If you are attending the hearing in person, you should bring your hearing letter with your case number, which will help you to find where you need to go in the building. You should also bring any evidence you have to the hearing. This could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>bank statements showing money in your bank account</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a letter about a new job or an increase in the hours you work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a copy of your tenancy agreement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where applicable, the letter you will have received from the NHS or your GP confirming you had clinically extremely vulnerable status, or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>confirmation from your employer that you were placed on furlough</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You and your landlord can attend the hearing. You can both bring people to help represent you, such as a solicitor or adviser. If you do not attend your court hearing, it is very likely the judge will decide to award possession to the landlord.</p>

<p>Your case is heard by a judge who will make a decision based on the evidence provided by you and your landlord and on what the law says. Whilst they will consider all of the evidence which has been submitted, if the landlord has made a claim for possession using the section 21 process or is using the mandatory grounds under section 8, the judge may have no or limited discretion to dismiss or adjourn the case if the claim has been made correctly and, for mandatory section 8 grounds, the reason for applying for possession can be proven.</p>

<p>When you go into the hearing room you will be told who will speak and when. You will be given time to ask any questions that you have and give evidence in your case. If you have a solicitor or barrister, they will ask questions for you. The judge may also ask you or your landlord questions. You can take notes to help you, but you must not take photos or videos.</p>

<h4>The Housing Possession Court Duty Scheme</h4>

<p>If you have not received advice before the hearing, you can get free legal advice and representation in court on the day of the hearing, through the Housing Possession Court Duty scheme. Contact your local council or the court where your case is being heard.</p>

<p>If the scheme is not available in your area, check with the court whether there are other advice services on offer.</p>

<h4>Decisions which the judge could make</h4>

<p>The judge could:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>dismiss the court case - no order will be made and the hearing ends</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>adjourn the hearing - the hearing will be delayed until later, as the judge feels a decision cannot be made on the day</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make a possession order. If the judge makes an outright order, this means you will have to vacate the property by a date they set. If they make a suspended order, you will have to vacate the property if you do not comply with certain conditions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The judge will dismiss the case if there’s no reason you should be evicted. This might happen if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>your landlord has not followed the correct procedure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>your landlord or their representative do not attend the hearing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you’ve paid any rent arrears</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the judge dismisses the case, you can stay in your home. If you have incurred any legal costs, you can ask the judge to order the landlord to pay your costs. If the landlord still wants possession of the property, they’ll have to restart the court process from the beginning.</p>

<h4>Types of possession order</h4>

<p>If the judge makes a possession order, it will either be an ‘outright’ order or a ‘suspended’ order.</p>

<h4>Outright possession order</h4>

<p>This means you must leave the property before the date given in the order.</p>

<p>The date will usually be 14 or 28 days after your court hearing. If you are in an exceptionally difficult situation, the judge may agree to delay possession for up to 6 weeks. The judge may consider the information which has been submitted about how you have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic when making this decision.</p>

<p>If you do not leave your home by the date given, your landlord can ask the court to evict you by asking for a ‘Warrant of possession’ under which the court bailiff will carry out an eviction (see note below).</p>

<h4>Suspended and postponed orders for possession</h4>

<p>This means if you make the payments, or obey the conditions, set out in the order, you can stay in your home.</p>

<p>Suspended possession orders include a date on which you must leave the property If, at any time after that date passes, you breach the conditions set out in the order, your landlord can ask the court for a Warrant of possession (see note below).</p>

<p>Postponed possession orders do not include a specific date for when you must leave the property. If you breach the terms of a postponed possession order, the landlord can make an application to the court to get a fixed eviction date. The court decides whether there will be another hearing.</p>

<h4>Possession orders with a money judgment</h4>

<p>A judge can add a money judgment to any of the possession orders. This means you owe a specific amount of money, usually made up of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>your rent arrears</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>court fees</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>your landlord’s legal costs</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The money judgment will not be enforceable against you so long as you pay your arrears and the amount set out in a suspended possession order.</p>

<p>However, if you do not pay, the landlord can apply to enforce the possession order and the money judgement. This means that the landlord can ask county court bailiffs to evict you from your home (see below), and also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/respond-to-court-claim-for-money">recover the money owed in a separate court process</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>In England and in Wales, legislation which restricted bailiffs from enforcing evictions has now been lifted. This was in place in England from 17 November 2020 until 31 May 2021 and in Wales from 11 December 2020 until 30 June 2021. Therefore, orders can now be enforced where the landlord has a valid warrant of possession.</p>

<p>However, bailiffs must provide 14 days’ notice of an eviction and have been asked not to carry out an eviction if they are made aware that anyone living in the property has COVID-19 symptoms or is self-isolating.</p>

<h4>Appealing the judge’s decision</h4>

<p>You can only appeal the judge’s decision if you have proper legal grounds – for example, if you can show that the decision was wrong because of a serious mistake or because the procedure was not followed properly. You’ll need to ask the judge for permission to appeal at the end of the hearing. If permission is refused by the district judge, you can apply to the circuit judge for permission. You will need to set out your grounds of appeal. You should seek legal help to do this.</p>

<p>If you get permission to appeal, you’ll have to apply for an appeal hearing very soon afterwards. You’ll have to pay a court fee of up to £151, unless you qualify for help.</p>

<p>You will need to get legal advice.</p>

<h3>Stage 5: Warrant for possession and bailiffs</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Important:</strong> It is strongly recommended that you do not wait until you are about to be evicted by bailiffs before seeking advice.</p>
</div>

<p>If you remain in the property after the date specified in an outright possession order has passed, or if you have breached the conditions of a suspended possession order, the landlord can apply for a warrant for possession.</p>

<p>When the court issues a warrant for possession, you will be sent an eviction notice giving a date by when you must leave. If you do not leave, you will be evicted by a county court bailiff or High Court Enforcement Officer.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Legislation which restricted warrants of possession from being enforced, which was in place in England from 17 November 2020 until 31 May 2021, and in Wales from 11 December 2020 until 30 June 2021, has now lifted. This means that county court bailiffs and High Court Enforcement Officers are now able to carry out an eviction where the landlord has a valid warrant of possession. However, 14 days’ notice of an eviction must be provided, and bailiffs have been asked not to carry out an eviction if they are made aware that anyone living in the property has COVID-19 symptoms or is self-isolating.</p>
</div>

<p>A date for the eviction will be scheduled with a minimum of 14 days’ notice. You may be able to apply to suspend the eviction.</p>

<p>A notice of eviction form (form N54) will be delivered to your address at least 14 days before the repossession (eviction) is due to take place.</p>

<p>However, in both England and Wales bailiffs will not carry out an eviction if they are made aware that you or anyone you live with has coronavirus symptoms, has tested positive for COVID-19 or are waiting for a test result, has been instructed by the NHS to self-isolate (including if you are quarantining in accordance with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">international travel rules</a>). If this applies to you, you should inform the bailiff using the contact details provided on the N54 Notice of Eviction. You should explain when the symptoms started and/or how long the period of self-isolation will last.  The eviction will be rescheduled with a minimum of 14 days’ notice.</p>

<p>The bailiff will follow the latest public health guidance issued at the time of the eviction. They will conduct the eviction using Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and maintain social distancing. They should ask if anybody in the household has symptoms, or is self-isolating (including if they are quarantining in accordance with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">international travel rules</a>). If that is the case, or if the enforcement agent observes any visible symptoms of Covid-19, then they can  withdraw from the property at their own discretion. The eviction will be rescheduled with a minimum of 14 days’ notice.</p>

<p>In some circumstances you may be able to prevent or delay an eviction by a county court bailiff. You can apply to suspend a warrant of possession by filling in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-n244-application-notice" class="govuk-link">Form N244</a>. This will cost £14, unless you qualify for help. There will be a new hearing, at which the judge may delay the eviction or let you stay in your home if you can make payments again. However, <strong>the judge will not automatically agree to suspend the warrant.</strong></p>

<p>The circumstances in which a warrant for possession may be suspended include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>If you got a section 21 notice but there was no court hearing</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The court may set aside a possession order if the landlord used accelerated possession proceedings and served an invalid section 21 notice.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>If you couldn’t attend the original court hearing</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You can apply for the court decision to be set aside if you</p>

<p>a.	had a good reason for missing the court hearing</p>

<p>b.	applied to have the order set aside as soon as you knew that the court had made a possession order, and</p>

<p>c.	would have had a good chance of persuading the court not to make the possession order if you had attended.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>If suspending the bailiff’s warrant is reasonable</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If you are being evicted on a discretionary ground, the court can suspend the bailiff’s warrant if they decide it is reasonable to do so.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>If your landlord agrees to let you stay</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If, after discussion with your landlord they decide not to pursue the eviction and let you stay in your home, you can ask them to withdraw their application for a warrant of possession.</p>
