<h2>Who is this guide for?</h2>

<p>This guide is for local authority and Private Registered Providers of social housing/Registered Social Landlords (PRPs/RSLs) that are pursuing, or considering pursuing, possession proceedings against their tenants.</p>

<p>This guide is intended to help you to understand the new arrangements introduced following the lifting of the suspension of possession cases in the county court on 21 September 2020.</p>

<p>This guide focuses on new arrangements rather than existing eviction processes. For more information on notices, possession orders and evictions, see the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/council-housing-association-evictions">Council and housing association evictions</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/evicting-tenants" class="govuk-link">Evicting tenants</a>.</p>

<p>This guide does not cover leasehold properties.</p>

<p>This guidance is intended as information rather than legal advice.</p>

<h2>An overview of the changes to the possession action process</h2>

<p>If you made a claim for possession in the county court on or before 20 September which has not concluded, see Part 1 below.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 1: Serve a notice seeking or requiring possession</strong></p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Due to coronavirus (COVID-19):</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>In England</strong>
<br><br>
For notice given at any time on or after 29 August 2020 until 31 May 2021, the minimum period of notice that can be given is 6 months unless one of the exceptions below applies.  The exceptions are where possession is being sought on grounds of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rent being in arrears by at least 6 months</li>
  <li>anti-social behaviour</li>
  <li>domestic abuse</li>
  <li>obtaining the tenancy by fraud (false statement)</li>
  <li>death of the tenant (housing association landlords only)</li>
  <li>no right to rent due to immigration status (housing association landlords only)</li>
</ul>

<p>For more detailed information about new notice periods, see <a href="#annex-a-minimum-notice-period-lengths-for-tenancies-in-england" class="govuk-link">Annex A</a>. 
<br><br>
<strong>In Wales</strong>
<br><br>
If you serve notice at any time on or after 29 September 2020, the length of the notice period you are required to give is a minimum of 6 months unless you are seeking possession on grounds of anti-social behaviour and/or domestic violence, in which case the pre-Coronavirus Act arrangements re-apply.<br><br>
If you served notice at any time from 26 March 2020 to 23 July 2020, the length of the notice period you were required to give was a minimum of 3 months in all cases. If you served notice at any time from 24 July to 28 September 2020, against an assured or assured shorthold tenant the notice period must be at least 6 months, other than for grounds relating to anti-social behaviour which remained at 3 months. The minimum notice period to be given to tenants, including introductory tenants, under the secure tenancy regime from 24 July to 28 September 2020, was 3 months.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Stage 2: Make a possession claim</strong></p>

<p>You must attach a new notice giving information as to how, to your knowledge, the coronavirus pandemic has affected your tenant and your tenantâs dependants. See further information at the âCoronavirus notice and COVID-19 markingâ section.  Where PCOL is used, a hearing will not be provided at the point of issue.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 3: Be available on the Review date</strong></p>

<p>You will be sent a date when the judge will review the court file in addition to a date and time for the substantive hearing.  Notice of the appointment and hearing may be sent upon issue of the claim or at a later date. You will be given at least 21 daysâ notice of the date at which the judge will review the file. You should be available for the Review as it might be possible to resolve the case at this stage. The substantive hearing will be at least 28 days after the Review if no agreement is reached.</p>

<p>At least 14 days before the Review, you will need to confirm to the court that you will be contactable on that date, send the court an electronic copy of all of the case documents and confirm that you have also provided these to your tenant. See Part 3 below.</p>

<p>On the date of the Review, there will be duty scheme advice arrangements in place to assist the tenant and promote settlement. You should ensure that an officer is available to discuss the case with your tenant/adviser and where possible reach a settlement with them without the case progressing to a substantive hearing. At Review, if both parties agree and the case is suitable, the case will also be referred for mediation, in which a qualified, independent person will assist you and your tenant to reach an agreement without the case progressing to a full possession hearing. The government is funding a pilot mediation service which is free to use for landlords and tenants. Where you and your tenant reach an agreement, the case will not proceed to a substantive hearing.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 4: Attend the possession hearing</strong></p>

<p>There will be a possession hearing 28 days after the Review if no agreement is reached. You are asked to consider making arrangements for only 1 or 2 housing officers to attend at court on any day to deal with all cases you may have in the list.  There will be duty scheme advice arrangements in place.</p>

<p>You must bring to the court 2 copies of a new notice dealing with Pre-Action Protocol and COVID-19 information.  See Part 2.  You must serve a copy of the notice on the tenant at least 14 days before the hearing.</p>

<p>Practice will vary locally but approximately 15 minutes will be allowed for each hearing, with additional time between hearings for COVID-19 safety procedures.</p>

<p>You can request that a hearing takes place remotely. However, this will only go ahead if the Judge agrees to this, and your tenant also agrees</p>

<p><strong>Stage 5: Apply for a warrant of possession</strong></p>

<p>In listing bailiffsâ appointments, the court will allow for a period of at least 14 days between service of notice of eviction upon the tenant and the eviction date.  If, after receiving notice of eviction, the tenant makes an application for a stay or suspension, the court will ensure that this is listed prior to the eviction taking place.  Safety procedures and policies will be provided to tenants at enforcement.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Legislation is in place to ensure bailiffs do not serve eviction notices, except in the most serious circumstances. These circumstances are illegal occupation, false statement, anti-social behaviour, perpetrators of domestic abuse, where a property is unoccupied following death of a tenant in relation to assured and assured shorthold tenancies, and serious rent arrears of 6 monthsâ rent or more. The legislation will be extended until the end of 31 May 2021 and given that 14 daysâ notice is required before an eviction can take place, no evictions are expected before mid-June except in the most serious circumstances.
<br><br>
In Wales, subject to a periodic three week review, bailiffs are not allowed to enforce evictions until 31 March 2021, except in cases relating to, illegal occupation, anti-social behaviour, eviction of perpetrators of domestic abuse where the victim is housed elsewhere, and where the property is unoccupied following the death of a tenant.
<br><br>
If you have an outstanding Warrant of Possession, or if you have an outstanding Order of Possession and wish to apply for a Warrant, you will need to follow a set process to inform the court that your case falls within these exceptions and you want the eviction to proceed, unless the exemption has already been considered by the court and recorded on the Possession Order.  If you have a Warrant of Possession which falls outside of these exceptions, this will be executed when evictions can be enforced again. You are also able to apply for a Warrant of Possession if you have a Court Order which falls outside of these exceptions; this will also be executed when evictions are able to proceed. 
<br><br>
See below Part 5 warrants for possessions and bailiffs for more information.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Claims for possession made on or before 20 September which have not concluded</h2>

<h3>Claims for possession made before 3 August 2020</h3>

<h4>If you have made a claim but have not yet had a court hearing</h4>

<p>If you made a claim for possession before 3 August 2020, it is up to you to inform the court if you wish to proceed with your claim. You must do this by sending a completed reactivation notice to the court and delivering a copy to your tenant. This applies to both accelerated and standard possession claims.</p>

<p>If you do not inform the court that you wish to continue, your case will not proceed. If you do not serve a reactivation notice your case will be automatically stayed and you will need to make a formal application to restore it.</p>

<p>The reactivation notice must include any information you have about how the tenant and any dependants, such as children, living with the tenant have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic.  For example, if they have suffered a loss of income as a result of the pandemic or if they have been shielding.  If your claim concerns outstanding rent arrears, you must also provide an updated rent account for the past 2 years. You must provide the reactivation notice, and information about the effects of the pandemic, in order for your claim to proceed.</p>

<p>You should first check the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://courttribunalfinder.service.gov.uk/search/address">Court and tribunal website</a> to see if the court to which you sent your claim is open and will be processing cases.</p>

<p>You should send your reactivation notice to the court via email if possible.</p>

<p>Her Majestyâs Courts and Tribunal Service have drafted a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reactivation-notice-for-property-possession" class="govuk-link">template reactivation notice</a> which you may wish to use.</p>

<p>You can request that a hearing takes place remotely. However, this will only go ahead if the Judge agrees to this, and your tenant also agrees.  You or your tenant can ask the judge to consider whether the hearing takes place remotely, by putting a request in writing and sending it to the court. Both parties will need to agree that the hearing can take place remotely, however it will be the judge who makes the final decision as to how the hearing proceeds.</p>

<p>If you have multiple claims at the same court, you must provide a reactivation notice for each individual claim but can file them alongside a covering letter detailing all of the cases which are in train at that court centre and provide the following details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>all issued and suspended cases by case number</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hose cases you wish to be listed and those which you are content to be further suspended or dismissed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a ranking of the cases you wish to be listed in categories of priority (high, medium, low)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When listing cases, the court will give priority to claims issued before the stay commenced, but that will be subject to priority given to types of case as set out below in Part 4.</p>

<p>If you made a claim for possession before 3 August 2020 and do not inform the court that you wish to continue, your case will not proceed. If you do not serve a reactivation notice your case will be stayed automatically and you will need to make a formal application to restore it.</p>

<h4>If the court has made case management directions in your case (for example at an initial hearing)</h4>

<p>If you have received case management directions, you will need to file a reactivation notice (see above). However, you will also need to attach either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a draft order setting out additional or alternative directions (including proposing a new hearing date) which are required; or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a statement in writing that no new directions are required and that an existing hearing date can be met</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can also provide a statement in writing setting out whether the case is suitable for a remote hearing.</p>

<h3>Claims for possession made on or after 3 August 2020</h3>

<p>If you made a claim for possession on or after 3 August 2020, it will be processed in due course. You will not need to provide a reactivation notice, but you should provide information about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on your tenant to the court (see below Coronavirus notice and COVID-19 Case Marking). If you have not yet done so, you should provide this information to the court as soon as possible.</p>

<p>As with claims for possession made before 3 August 2020, you or your tenant can ask the judge to consider whether the hearing takes place remotely, by putting a request in writing and sending it to the court. Both parties will need to agree that the hearing can take place remotely, however it will be the judge who makes the final decision as to how the hearing proceeds.</p>

<h3>How long will the court process take?</h3>

<p>Due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic many cases will have built up which the courts need to process, and the courts will not be operating at their full capacity. Therefore, it is very likely to take longer than the usual 8 weeks for your claim to be heard by a judge. You will receive a minimum of 21 daysâ notice of the date on which the Review will take place and the substantive hearing (if needed) will be a minimum of 28 days after this. We ask for your patience during this time. We would encourage you to continue to engage with the tenant to explore what can be achieved in terms of assisting the tenant to access benefits, or a discretionary housing payment, or agreeing a repayment plan, as appropriate.</p>

<p>The government is also funding a new mediation pilot, which will contact parties who agree to engage with the service in between the Review and substantive hearing. If you choose to make use of this service, this will not make the possession process any longer but will help to resolve issues and to sustain the tenancy where this is appropriate. Where mediation is unsuccessful, the substantive hearing will go ahead on the original date.</p>

<p>You can find more information about the mediation pilot in the Review section of this guidance, below.</p>

<p>As the courts and bailiff procedures resume, you may have to wait for a bailiff appointment slot to become available if a warrant of possession has been issued. It is important that you communicate to the court if you no longer need the appointment, for example in circumstances where your tenant has agreed in writing to vacate the property and returned their keys.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Claims for possession made on or after 21 September 2020</h2>

<h3>Pre-Action Protocol for possession claims by social landlords</h3>

<p>In a claim to which the Pre-Action Protocol applies, you must provide a notice confirming that you have complied with the Protocol and setting out how you have done so.</p>

<p>You will need to bring to the hearing 2 copies of this notice as well as the notice setting out how your tenants (and their dependants) have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic (see below). See further information on the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/protocol/pre-action-protocol-for-possession-claims-by-social-landlords">Pre-Action Protocol for possession claims by social landlords</a>.</p>

<h3>Coronavirus notice and COVID-19 case marking</h3>

<p>When making a claim for possession, you must also provide a notice setting out how your tenant and any dependants have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. You should attach this notice to your claim.</p>

<p>If you have no knowledge of your tenantsâ circumstances you should make this clear, including information about any attempts made to discuss matters with them.</p>

<p>You should send this information to the court with your claim for possession. This applies to both standard and accelerated possession claims. If you do not provide this information, your claim will be delayed.</p>

<p>Your tenant can choose to mark the claim as a COVID-19 case when completing their defence form. To do so, they would need to provide brief details of any hardship they have faced, and indicate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether there were material arrears outstanding before March 2020</li>
  <li>whether they have been placed on the governmentâs Job Retention (furlough) scheme, and whether the tenant offered or paid a related proportion of rent</li>
  <li>whether they have obtained universal credit since March 2020, and whether they have offered or paid a related proportion of rent</li>
  <li>whether they have been unable to work because of COVID-19</li>
  <li>whether they are clinically extremely vulnerable to COVID-19 and have been shielding</li>
  <li>what proposals they have to pay the rent</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be able to see whether the tenant has marked your possession claim as a COVID-19 case when you are provided with a copy of the defence form. If the tenant marks the case as a COVID-19 case, this could also affect the order in which it is listed for a hearing. It may also affect the judgeâs decision at a Possession Hearing, in those cases where they have discretion.</p>

<p>If a tenant has marked your possession claim as a COVID-19 case, you should give careful consideration about how you want to proceed.</p>

<p>Given the information they have provided, you may wish to review whether an acceptable arrangement can be reached with your tenant to avoid taking the proceedings further.  For example, it might be reasonable to consider deferring commencement of collection of the arrears.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> The Review</h2>

<p>For cases where the landlord is using the standard possession procedure (ie not the accelerated possession procedure), you will receive a communication providing the date of the Review and the date of the substantive possession hearing. You will be allocated a Review at least 28 days before the possession hearing.</p>

<p>At least 14 days prior to the review, you will be required to email the court at the address provided. The email must include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>An electronic bundle of all case documents to the court, including the claim form and particulars of claim, information about how your tenant has been affected by coronavirus and the tenantâs defence, including whether they have marked the case as being affected by COVID-19. (A hard copy bundle can be provided as an alternative.) You must confirm that you have provided relevant information about your tenantâs circumstances to the court. This includes information about the effect of the pandemic on your tenant and his or her dependents, and about their vulnerability, disability and welfare benefit position, with specific reference to those who may have been shielding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confirmation that you have provided a hard copy of all of the bundle to the tenant, and an electronic copy if they have provided their email address.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confirmation that you are available on the day of the Review to discuss the case (by telephone or face-to-face), with the tenant or duty scheme (or other) adviser.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you provide this information, and the tenant also confirms that they can attend, a meeting will be arranged on the date of the Review between your tenant and their duty solicitor or adviser. You and your legal representative (if you have one) should be available (on the telephone if necessary) so that your tenant and their adviser can contact you to discuss the case. Where possible, you should seek to agree a settlement without the case progressing to a full possession hearing. For example, you could agree to a rent repayment plan to pay off any outstanding arrears. You may also be asked if you would like to make use of the new mediation service which is being funded by the government. This means that a qualified, independent person, or mediator, from the Society of Mediators will help you and your tenant to settle your case in a way that you are both happy with and agree to.</p>

<p>If both you and the tenant agree and the case is considered suitable, the case will be referred to the pilot mediation service, which is free for all parties to use. A mediator will get in touch with you to arrange a suitable time for the mediation to take place. There will be telephone calls between all parties to discuss the situation and to try to reach a resolution. The mediator cannot provide legal advice but will help you and your tenant to work out a way forward which avoids further court action.</p>

<p>If an agreement is reached during mediation, then the mediator will ask both parties to sign an agreement and will inform the court of the outcome. If an agreement is not reached, then the substantive hearing will take place on the date specified. Agreeing to mediation will not make the court possession process any longer but will help to resolve issues and sustain tenancies.</p>

<p>On the day of the Review, the case will be considered by a judge without either you or your tenant present. The judge will be able to provide directions on your case based on the paperwork submitted and also on what has been discussed and agreed upon by you and your tenant earlier in the day. They could make an order if an agreement has been reached between you and your tenant.</p>

<p>If an agreement has not been reached and your paperwork is in order, the judge is likely to make an order setting out the steps to be taken by you and by your tenant, to provide the court and each other with the evidence and information necessary to allow the substantive hearing to take place. However, they could also adjourn the substantive hearing or dismiss the case if they feel that adequate information has not been provided to the court or that the relevant legal requirements  have not been met.</p>

<p>If your case has been referred to the independent mediation service, a substantive possession hearing will be listed but the mediator will be able to inform the court if an agreement has been reached and this is no longer required.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> The possession hearing</h2>

<p>Judges are responsible for listing cases for a hearing in court. As a guide the following types of case will be listed with priority:</p>

<p>(a)	cases with allegations of anti-social behaviour</p>

<p>(b)	cases with extreme alleged arrears accrued, that is, arrears equal to at least 12 monthsâ rent</p>

<p>(c)	cases involving alleged squatters, illegal occupiers, or persons unknown</p>

<p>(d)	cases involving an allegation of domestic violence where the claimant is a Social Landlord and possession of the property is alleged to be important for particular reasons which are set out in the claim form (and with domestic violence agencies alerted)</p>

<p>(e)	cases with allegations of fraud or deception</p>

<p>(f)	cases with allegations of unlawful subletting</p>

<p>(g)	cases with allegations of abandonment of the property, non-occupation or death of defendant; and</p>

<p>(h)	cases concerning what was allocated by an authority as âtemporary accommodationâ and is specifically needed by the authority for reallocation as âtemporary accommodationâ.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Warrants for possession and bailiffs</h2>

<h3>If you have an outstanding warrant of possession</h3>

<p>If you have a warrant of possession but no longer require an eviction to be carried out you should let the court know as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>If you have a possession order and the date on which the tenant was due to give up possession has passed, but you have not yet applied for a warrant of possession</h3>

<p>In the light of the coronavirus pandemic and the effect that this may have had on your tenants, you should carefully consider whether you wish to proceed with the eviction. You are still able to apply for a Warrant of Possession.</p>

<p>You do not need to take any steps if you decide not to seek an eviction at once and you will still be able to rely on the Possession Order if you decide to take your property back at a later date. You can apply for a Warrant of Possession at any time during the period of 6 years after the date a Possession Order is made.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Legislation is in place to ensure bailiffs do not serve eviction notices, except in the most serious circumstances. These circumstances are illegal occupation, false statement, anti-social behaviour, perpetrators of domestic abuse, where a property is unoccupied following death of a tenant in relation to assured and assured shorthold tenancies, and serious rent arrears of 6 monthsâ rent or more. The legislation will be extended until the end of 31 May 2021. Given that 14 daysâ notice is required before an eviction can take place, no evictions are expected before mid-June except in the most serious circumstances.
<br><br>
In Wales, subject to a periodic three week review, bailiffs are not allowed to enforce evictions until 31 March 2021, except in cases relating to, illegal occupation, anti-social behaviour, eviction of perpetrators of domestic abuse where the victim is housed elsewhere, and where the property is unoccupied following the death of a tenant.</p>
</div>

<h3>Important information about Warrants and Writs of Possession</h3>

<p>At the current time, outstanding Warrants or Writs of Possession can only be enforced in England if the court is satisfied they relate to an order for possession within one of the exemptions in Regulation 2 of the Public Health (Coronavirus) (Protection from Eviction) (England) (No. 2) Regulations 2021](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/164/introduction/made) or in Wales, if the court is satisfied they relate to an order for possession within one of the exemptions in Regulation 2 of the <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/wsi/2021/12/contents/made" class="govuk-link">Public Health (Protection from Eviction) (Wales) (Coronavirus) Regulations 2021</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a Warrant of Possession which falls outside of these exceptions, this will be executed when evictions can be enforced again. You are also able to apply for a Warrant of Possession if you have a Court Order which falls outside of these exceptions; this will also be executed when evictions are able to proceed.</p>

<p>If you have a Possession Order from the county court and wish to proceed to eviction, the Order must have explicitly been made on one of the grounds listed as an exemption in Regulation 2. These include specific grounds under Schedule 2 to the Housing Act 1985, Section 84A to the Housing Act 1985 and under Schedule 2 of the Housing Act 1988.</p>

<p>You should seek legal advice if you are unsure.</p>

<p>If you have a Possession Order from the county court, which was made on the grounds of one of the serious circumstances listed above, and you want to proceed to eviction they will need to take different steps depending on a) which grounds the Possession Order was made and b) the date on which the Possession Order was made. This is explained in further detail below. However, you should take legal advice on your individual circumstances.</p>

<h3>Possession Orders made on rent arrears grounds</h3>

<p>In England, if you have an outright Possession Order on the basis of rent arrears (made under Grounds 8, 10 or 11 of the Housing Act 1988 or on Ground 1 in Schedule 2 to the Housing Act 1985), or if the tenant has breached the conditions set out in a suspended Possession Order that was made under these grounds and you wish to proceed with an eviction on the basis of the rent arrears exemption (at least an equivalent of six monthâs rent arrearsâ accrued) you may need to make an application to the Court (if you have not done so earlier on the basis of nine monthsâ rent arrears pre-dating 23 March 2020).</p>

<p>You will not need to make an application if the exemption had already been considered by the court.</p>

<p>Possession Orders made in England between 17 November 2020 and 11 January 2021â¯on the basis ofâ¯rent arrears under Grounds 8, 10 or 11 of the Housing Act 1988 or on Ground 1 in Schedule 2 to the Housing Act 1985â¯will have been marked as suitable for proceeding to eviction if more than nine monthsâ rent arrears pre-dating 23 March 2020 were outstanding. Since 11 January 2021, Possession Orders made under Grounds 8, 10 or 11 of the Housing Act 1988 or on Ground 1 in Schedule 2 to the Housing Act 1985â¯ have been marked as suitable for eviction where the court has certified that at least 6 monthsâ rent arrears have accrued.</p>

<p>If this applies to your case, you will be able toâ¯apply for a Warrantâ¯if the tenant does not apply to challenge the Possession Order by the date listed in the Possession Order.</p>

<p>However, if you have a Possession Order made on rent arrears grounds and the above conditions do not apply, you will need toâ¯submit an applicationâ¯to the county court which handled your claim. See below, âMaking an application to court to proceed with an evictionâ.â¯</p>

<p>In Wales, there are no exemptions to the ban on enforcement for rent arrears, therefore no new or existing Possession Orders made on the basis of rent arrears in Wales can proceed to enforcement until the relevant Regulations are no longer in force.</p>

<h3>Possession Orders made on other exempted grounds</h3>

<p>In England, if you have a Possession Order made on the basis of one of the other exemptions listed in the Regulations (illegal occupation, anti-social behaviour, domestic abuse, death of a tenant in relation to assured or assured shorthold tenancies or false statement), made from 17 November 2020 onwards, the Order will have been marked as suitable for proceeding to enforcement and you will not need to make an application in order to proceed. In Wales, the Possession Order will have been marked as suitable for proceeding to enforcement if it was made on the basis of illegal occupation, anti-social behaviour, eviction of perpetrators of domestic abuse where the victim is housed elsewhere, or death of a tenant, from 11 December 2020 onwards.  If the tenant does not vacate the property by the date listed in an Outright Possession Order or breaches the terms of a Suspended Possession Order, you will be able to apply for a Warrant and the case will proceed to enforcement, by using Form N325 and paying the fee.</p>

<p>If you have a Possession Order which was made before 17 November 2020 (or 11 December 2020 in Wales) and wish to proceed with an eviction on the basis of one of the other exemptions listed in the Regulations you will need to make an application to the court to proceed to eviction. See below, âMaking an application to court to proceed with an evictionâ</p>

<h3>Making an application to court to proceed with eviction (where an applicable exemption exists which is not identified on the Possession Order)</h3>

<p>Where a landlord has an existing possession order and an exemption is not identified on it, if the landlord believes that an exemption applies, they should apply to the court by filing in and submitting <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-n244-application-notice">Form N244</a>. This application should request that the court:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">declare itself satisfied of the following matter set out at [specify which paragraph of Regulation 2], namely [specify the matter].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The landlord must provide the defendant with a copy of the application. There is no fee to make this application. The application should be sent to the court that made the original possession order.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of the application, the court will list a hearing and both you and your tenant can attend. At the hearing, the court will declare whether it is satisfied that the possession order was made wholly or partly on one of the exempted grounds, and therefore whether the eviction can proceed. If you are making an application on the grounds of extreme rent arrears (equivalent to 6 monthsâ or more rent), you will need to produce to the court and defendant a detailed assessment of the alleged arrears. This exemption only applies in England.</p>

<h3>Enforcement</h3>

<p>When evictions are able to be enforced, a notice of the eviction appointment will be sent to both landlord and tenant. Appointments will be scheduled with a minimum of 14 daysâ notice and the tenant may be able to apply to suspend the eviction. However, bailiffs will not carry out an eviction if they are made aware that the tenant or anyone they live with has Coronavirus, is self-isolating or has been identified as Clinically Extremely Vulnerable. The tenant can inform the court if this applies to them, explaining when the symptoms started and/or how long they have been in self-isolation for. The appointment will be rescheduled for a later date with a minimum of 14 daysâ notice.</p>

<p>Bailiffs will also not carry out an eviction if there are occupants in the property and the possession order was issued on the ground that the property was unoccupied following the death of the tenant in relation to assured or assured shorthold tenancies. In these circumstances, the bailiff must be satisfied that the property is empty otherwise they cannot proceed with the eviction.</p>

<p>When an eviction is able to be carried out, the bailiff will follow the latest Public Health England and government guidance. They will conduct the eviction wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and maintain social distancing.  They should ask if anybody in the household has symptoms, is self-isolating or shielding. If that is the case, or if the enforcement agent observes any visible symptoms of Covid-19, then they should withdraw from the property immediately.</p>
