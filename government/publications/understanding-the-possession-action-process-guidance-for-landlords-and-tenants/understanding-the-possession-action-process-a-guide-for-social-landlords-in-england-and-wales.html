<h2>Who is this guide for?</h2>

<p>This guide is for local authority and Private Registered Providers of social housing/Registered Social Landlords (PRPs/RSLs) that are pursuing, or considering pursuing, possession proceedings against their tenants.</p>

<p>This guide is intended to help you to understand the new arrangements introduced following the lifting of the suspension of possession cases in the county court on 21 September 2020.</p>

<p>This guide focuses on new arrangements rather than existing eviction processes. For more information on notices, possession orders and evictions, see the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/council-housing-association-evictions" class="govuk-link">Council and housing association evictions</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/evicting-tenants">Evicting tenants</a>.</p>

<p>This guide does not cover leasehold properties.</p>

<p>This guidance is intended as information rather than legal advice.</p>

<h2>An overview of the changes to the possession action process</h2>

<p>If you made a claim for possession which is already in the court system, see Part 1 below.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 1: Serve a notice seeking or requiring possession</strong></p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Due to coronavirus (COVID-19):</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>In England</strong>
<br><br>
For notice given at any time on or after 29 August 2020 until 31 May 2021, the minimum period of notice that can be given is 6 months, with exemptions for certain serious cases.<br><br></p>

<p>From 1 June 2021 the minimum notice period that can be given is 4 months. <br><br></p>

<p>Certain exceptions to this apply  where possession is being sought on grounds of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rent being in arrears by at least 6 months</li>
  <li>anti-social behaviour</li>
  <li>domestic abuse</li>
  <li>obtaining the tenancy by fraud (false statement)</li>
  <li>death of the tenant (housing association landlords only)</li>
  <li>no right to rent due to immigration status (housing association landlords only)</li>
</ul>

<p>From 1 August 2021, where there are arrears of less than 4 months, the minimum notice period will reduce to 2 months.</p>

<p>For more detailed information about notice periods, see <a href="#annex-a-minimum-notice-period-lengths-for-tenancies-in-england" class="govuk-link">Annex A</a>. 
<br><br>
<strong>In Wales</strong>
<br><br>
If you serve notice at any time on or after 29 September 2020, the length of the notice period you are required to give is a minimum of 6 months unless you are seeking possession on grounds of anti-social behaviour and/or domestic violence, in which case the pre-Coronavirus Act arrangements re-apply.<br><br>
If you served notice at any time from 26 March 2020 to 23 July 2020, the length of the notice period you were required to give was a minimum of 3 months in all cases. If you served notice at any time from 24 July to 28 September 2020, against an assured or assured shorthold tenant the notice period must be at least 6 months, other than for grounds relating to anti-social behaviour which remained at 3 months. The minimum notice period to be given to tenants, including introductory tenants, under the secure tenancy regime from 24 July to 28 September 2020, was 3 months.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Stage 2: Make a possession claim</strong></p>

<p>You must attach a new notice giving information as to how, to your knowledge, the coronavirus pandemic has affected your tenant and your tenant’s dependants. See further information at the ‘Coronavirus notice and COVID-19 marking’ section.  Where PCOL is used, a hearing will not be provided at the point of issue.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 3: Be available on the Review date</strong></p>

<p>You will be sent a date when the judge will review the court file in addition to a date and time for the substantive hearing.  Notice of the appointment and hearing may be sent upon issue of the claim or at a later date. You will be given at least 21 days’ notice of the date at which the judge will review the file. You should be available for the Review as it might be possible to resolve the case at this stage. The substantive hearing will be at least 28 days after the Review if no agreement is reached.</p>

<p>At least 14 days before the Review, you will need to confirm to the court that you will be contactable on that date, send the court an electronic copy of all of the case documents and confirm that you have also provided these to your tenant. See Part 3 below.</p>

<p>On the date of the Review, there will be duty scheme advice arrangements in place to assist the tenant and promote settlement. You should ensure that an officer is available to discuss the case with your tenant/adviser and where possible reach a settlement with them without the case progressing to a substantive hearing. At Review, you may also be asked if you would like to make use of the Rental Mediation Service which is being funded by the government. Where you and your tenant reach an agreement, the case will not proceed to a substantive hearing.</p>

<p>See more information on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/housing-possession-mediation-service" class="govuk-link">mediation service</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 4: Attend the possession hearing</strong></p>

<p>There will be a possession hearing 28 days after the Review if no agreement is reached. You are asked to consider making arrangements for only 1 or 2 housing officers to attend at court on any day to deal with all cases you may have in the list.  There will be duty scheme advice arrangements in place.</p>

<p>You must bring to the court 2 copies of a new notice dealing with Pre-Action Protocol and COVID-19 information.  See Part 2.  You must serve a copy of the notice on the tenant at least 14 days before the hearing.</p>

<p>Practice will vary locally but approximately 15 minutes will be allowed for each hearing, with additional time between hearings for COVID-19 safety procedures.</p>

<p>You can request that a hearing takes place remotely. However, this will only go ahead if the Judge agrees to this, and your tenant also agrees</p>

<p><strong>Stage 5: Apply for a warrant of possession</strong></p>

<p>In listing bailiffs’ appointments, the court will allow for a period of at least 14 days between service of notice of eviction upon the tenant and the eviction date.  If, after receiving notice of eviction, the tenant makes an application for a stay or suspension, the court will ensure that this is listed prior to the eviction taking place.  Safety procedures and policies will be provided to tenants at enforcement.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Legislation  has been in place until the end of May 2021 to ensure bailiffs do not serve eviction notices or carry out evictions but there were exceptions for the most serious circumstances that presented the most strain on landlords. These circumstances were illegal occupation, false statement, anti-social behaviour, perpetrators of domestic abuse, where a property is unoccupied following death of a tenant and serious rent arrears greater than six months’ rent.<br><br>Restriction on bailiff enforcement will not apply from the end of 31 May 2021, reflecting the improved public health situation and easing national restrictions. Bailiffs will be able to send out notices of eviction and enforce evictions from 1 June 2021. Given the requirement to provide 14 days’ notice, no evictions are expected until mid-June, except in the most egregious cases and bailiffs have been asked not to carry out an eviction if anyone living in the property has Covid-19 symptoms or is self-isolating.</p>

<p><br><br>
In Wales, subject to a periodic three week review, bailiffs are not allowed to enforce evictions up to the end of 30 June 2021, except in cases relating to, illegal occupation, anti-social behaviour, eviction of perpetrators of domestic abuse where the victim is housed elsewhere, and where the property is unoccupied following the death of a tenant.
<br><br>
If you have an outstanding Warrant of Possession, or if you have an outstanding Order of Possession and wish to apply for a Warrant, you will need to follow a set process to inform the court that your case falls within these exceptions and you want the eviction to proceed, unless the exemption has already been considered by the court and recorded on the Possession Order.  If you have a Warrant of Possession which falls outside of these exceptions, this will be executed when evictions can be enforced again. You are also able to apply for a Warrant of Possession if you have a Court Order which falls outside of these exceptions; this will also be executed when evictions are able to proceed. 
<br><br>
See below Part 5 warrants for possessions and bailiffs for more information.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Claims already in the court system</h2>

<h3>Claims for possession made before 3 August 2020</h3>

<h4>If you have made a claim but have not yet had a court hearing</h4>

<p>For landlords, most property possession claims received by the court before 3 August 2020 must be reactivated. A reactivation notice must be sent to the court dealing with your case and to the other party - you have until 4pm on 30 April 2021 to submit the notice.</p>

<p>If you brought your claim before 3 August 2020, did not file a Reactivation Notice before 4pm on 30 April 2021 but you now want to progress your claim, you must complete an N244 application and submit it to the court where your possession claim was filed accompanied by the relevant fee.</p>

<p>You should first check the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://courttribunalfinder.service.gov.uk/search/address">Court and tribunal website</a> to see if the court to which you sent your claim is open and will be processing cases.</p>

<p>You can request that a hearing takes place remotely. However, this will only go ahead if the Judge agrees to this, and your tenant also agrees.  You or your tenant can ask the judge to consider whether the hearing takes place remotely, by putting a request in writing and sending it to the court. Both parties will need to agree that the hearing can take place remotely, however it will be the judge who makes the final decision as to how the hearing proceeds.</p>

<h3>Claims for possession made on or after 3 August 2020</h3>

<p>If you made a claim for possession on or after 3 August 2020, it will be processed in due course. You must 
 provide information about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on your tenant to the court (see below Coronavirus notice and COVID-19 Case Marking). If you have not yet done so, you must provide this information to the court as soon as possible.</p>

<p>You or your tenant can ask the judge to consider whether the hearing takes place remotely, by putting a request in writing and sending it to the court. Both parties will need to agree that the hearing can take place remotely, however it will be the judge who makes the final decision as to how the hearing proceeds.</p>

<h3>How long will the court process take?</h3>

<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic many cases will have built up which the courts need to process, and the courts will not be operating at their full capacity. Therefore, it is very likely to take longer than the usual 8 weeks for your claim to be heard by a judge. You will receive a minimum of 21 days’ notice of the date on which the Review will take place and the substantive hearing (if needed) will be a minimum of 28 days after this. We ask for your patience during this time. We would encourage you to continue to engage with the tenant to explore what can be achieved in terms of assisting the tenant to access benefits, or a discretionary housing payment, or agreeing a repayment plan, as appropriate.</p>

<p>The government is also funding a mediation pilot, which will contact parties who agree to engage with the service in between the Review and substantive hearing. If you choose to make use of this service, this will not make the possession process any longer but will help to resolve issues and to sustain the tenancy where this is appropriate. Where mediation is unsuccessful, the substantive hearing will go ahead on the original date.</p>

<p>Find out more information about the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/housing-possession-mediation-service" class="govuk-link">mediation pilot</a>.</p>

<p>You can find more information about what mediation is and how it works at the <a href="http://www.civilmediation.justice.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Civil Mediation Council’s website</a>.</p>

<p>As the courts and bailiff procedures resume, you may have to wait for a bailiff appointment slot to become available if a warrant of possession has been issued. It is important that you communicate to the court if you no longer need the appointment, for example in circumstances where your tenant has agreed in writing to vacate the property and returned their keys.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Making a possession claim</h2>

<h3>Pre-Action Protocol for possession claims by social landlords</h3>

<p>In a claim to which the Pre-Action Protocol applies, you must provide a notice confirming that you have complied with the Protocol and setting out how you have done so.</p>

<p>You will need to bring to the hearing 2 copies of this notice as well as the notice setting out how your tenants (and their dependants) have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic (see below). See further information on the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/protocol/pre-action-protocol-for-possession-claims-by-social-landlords">Pre-Action Protocol for possession claims by social landlords</a>.</p>

<h3>Coronavirus notice and COVID-19 case marking</h3>

<p>When making a claim for possession, you must also provide a notice setting out how your tenant and any dependants have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. You should attach this notice to your claim.</p>

<p>If you have no knowledge of your tenants’ circumstances you should make this clear, including information about any attempts made to discuss matters with them.</p>

<p>You should send this information to the court with your claim for possession. This applies to both standard and accelerated possession claims. If you do not provide this information, your claim will be delayed.</p>

<p>Your tenant can choose to mark the claim as a COVID-19 case when completing their defence form. To do so, they would need to provide brief details of any hardship they have faced, and indicate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether there were material arrears outstanding before March 2020</li>
  <li>whether they have been placed on the government’s Job Retention (furlough) scheme, and whether the tenant offered or paid a related proportion of rent</li>
  <li>whether they have obtained universal credit since March 2020, and whether they have offered or paid a related proportion of rent</li>
  <li>whether they have been unable to work because of COVID-19</li>
  <li>whether they have been shielding in the past</li>
  <li>what proposals they have to pay the rent</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be able to see whether the tenant has marked your possession claim as a COVID-19 case when you are provided with a copy of the defence form. If the tenant marks the case as a COVID-19 case, this could also affect the order in which it is listed for a hearing. It may also affect the judge’s decision at a Possession Hearing, in those cases where they have discretion.</p>

<p>If a tenant has marked your possession claim as a COVID-19 case, you should give careful consideration about how you want to proceed.</p>

<p>Given the information they have provided, you may wish to review whether an acceptable arrangement can be reached with your tenant to avoid taking the proceedings further.  For example, it might be reasonable to consider deferring commencement of collection of the arrears.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> The Review</h2>

<p>For cases where the landlord is using the standard possession procedure (ie not the accelerated possession procedure), you will receive a communication providing the date of the Review and the date of the substantive possession hearing. You will be allocated a Review at least 28 days before the possession hearing.</p>

<p>At least 14 days prior to the review, you will be required to email the court at the address provided. The email must include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>An electronic bundle of all case documents to the court, including the claim form and particulars of claim, information about how your tenant has been affected by coronavirus and the tenant’s defence, including whether they have marked the case as being affected by COVID-19. (A hard copy bundle can be provided as an alternative.) You must confirm that you have provided relevant information about your tenant’s circumstances to the court. This includes information about the effect of the pandemic on your tenant and his or her dependents, and about their vulnerability, disability and welfare benefit position, with specific reference to those who may have been shielding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confirmation that you have provided a hard copy of all of the bundle to the tenant, and an electronic copy if they have provided their email address.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confirmation that you are available on the day of the Review to discuss the case (by telephone or face-to-face), with the tenant or duty scheme (or other) adviser.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you provide this information, and the tenant also confirms that they can attend, a meeting will be arranged on the date of the Review between your tenant and their duty solicitor or adviser. You and your legal representative (if you have one) should be available (on the telephone if necessary) so that your tenant and their adviser can contact you to discuss the case. Where possible, you should seek to agree a settlement without the case progressing to a full possession hearing. For example, you could agree to a rent repayment plan to pay off any outstanding arrears. You may also be asked if you would like to make use of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/housing-possession-mediation-service">new mediation service</a> which is being funded by the government.</p>

<p>On the day of the Review, the case will be considered by a judge without either you or your tenant present. The judge will be able to provide directions on your case based on the paperwork submitted and also on what has been discussed and agreed upon by you and your tenant earlier in the day. They could make an order if an agreement has been reached between you and your tenant.</p>

<p>If an agreement has not been reached and your paperwork is in order, the judge is likely to make an order setting out the steps to be taken by you and by your tenant, to provide the court and each other with the evidence and information necessary to allow the substantive hearing to take place. However, they could also adjourn the substantive hearing or dismiss the case if they feel that adequate information has not been provided to the court or that the relevant legal requirements have not been met.</p>

<p>If your case has been referred to the independent mediation service, a substantive possession hearing will be listed but the mediator will be able to inform the court if an agreement has been reached and this is no longer required.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> The possession hearing</h2>

<p>Judges are responsible for listing cases for a hearing in court. As a guide the following types of case will be listed with priority:</p>

<p>(a)	cases with allegations of anti-social behaviour</p>

<p>(b)	cases with extreme alleged arrears accrued, that is, arrears equal to at least 12 months’ rent</p>

<p>(c)	cases involving alleged squatters, illegal occupiers, or persons unknown</p>

<p>(d)	cases involving an allegation of domestic violence where the claimant is a Social Landlord and possession of the property is alleged to be important for particular reasons which are set out in the claim form (and with domestic violence agencies alerted)</p>

<p>(e)	cases with allegations of fraud or deception</p>

<p>(f)	cases with allegations of unlawful subletting</p>

<p>(g)	cases with allegations of abandonment of the property, non-occupation or death of defendant; and</p>

<p>(h)	cases concerning what was allocated by an authority as ‘temporary accommodation’ and is specifically needed by the authority for reallocation as ‘temporary accommodation’.</p>

<p>Subject to the above, priority will be given to claims issued before the court suspended possession claims in March 2020</p>

<h3>If you have an outstanding warrant of possession</h3>

<p>If you have a warrant of possession but no longer require an eviction to be carried out you should let the court know as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>If you have a possession order and the date on which the tenant was due to give up possession has passed, but you have not yet applied for a warrant of possession</h3>

<p>In the light of the coronavirus pandemic and the effect that this may have had on your tenants, you should carefully consider whether you wish to proceed with the eviction. You are still able to apply for a Warrant of Possession.</p>

<p>You do not need to take any steps if you decide not to seek an eviction at once and you will still be able to rely on the Possession Order if you decide to take your property back at a later date. You can apply for a Warrant of Possession at any time during the period of 6 years after the date a Possession Order is made.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Legislation has been  in place until the end of 31 May 2021 to ensure bailiffs do not serve eviction notices or carry out evictions but there were exceptions for the most serious circumstances that presented the most strain on landlords. These circumstances were illegal occupation, false statement, anti-social behaviour, perpetrators of domestic abuse, where a property is unoccupied following death of a tenant and serious rent arrears greater than six months’ rent.<br><br>
Restriction on bailiff enforcement will not apply from the end of 31 May 2021, reflecting the improved public health situation and easing national restrictions. Given the requirement to provide 14 days’ notice, no evictions are expected until mid-June, except in the most egregious cases and bailiffs have been asked not to carry out an eviction if anyone living in the property has Covid-19 symptoms or is self-isolating.
<br><br>
In Wales, subject to a periodic three week review, bailiffs are not allowed to enforce evictions up to the end of 30 June 2021, except in cases relating to, illegal occupation, anti-social behaviour, eviction of perpetrators of domestic abuse where the victim is housed elsewhere, and where the property is unoccupied following the death of a tenant.</p>
</div>

<p>If you have a Possession Order from the county court and wish to proceed to eviction before  30 June in Wales, the Order must have explicitly been made on one of the grounds listed as an exemption in Regulation 2. These include specific grounds under Schedule 2 to the Housing Act 1985, Section 84A to the Housing Act 1985 and under Schedule 2 of the Housing Act 1988.</p>

<p>You should seek legal advice if you are unsure.</p>

<p>If you have a Possession Order from the county court in Wales, which was made on the grounds of one of the serious circumstances listed above, and you want to proceed to eviction they will need to take different steps depending on a) which grounds the Possession Order was made and b) the date on which the Possession Order was made. This is explained in further detail below. However, you should take legal advice on your individual circumstances.</p>

<h3>Enforcement</h3>

<p>A notice of the eviction appointment will be sent to both landlord and tenant. Appointments will be scheduled with a minimum of 14 days’ notice and the tenant may be able to apply to suspend the eviction. However, bailiffs will not carry out an eviction if they are made aware that the tenant or anyone they live with has coronavirus symptoms, has tested positive for COVID-19 or are waiting for a test result, has been instructed by the NHS to self-isolate. The tenant can inform the court if this applies to them, explaining when the symptoms started and/or how long they have been in self-isolation for. The appointment will be rescheduled for a later date with a minimum of 14 days’ notice.</p>

<p>The bailiff will follow the latest Public Health England and government guidance. They will conduct the eviction wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and maintain social distancing.  They should ask if anybody in the household has symptoms or is self-isolating. If that is the case, or if the enforcement agent observes any visible symptoms of Covid-19, then they should withdraw from the property immediately.</p>

<h3>If you have an outstanding warrant of possession which has expired, or is nearing its expiry date</h3>

<p>The restrictions on evictions are due to be lifted on 1 June 2021 in England and 1 July 2021 in Wales (subject to any further legislation).</p>

<p>Warrants of possession are valid for 12 months from date of issue. If you have been unable to proceed to enforcement due to restrictions introduced as a result of the response to the coronavirus pandemic and your warrant has subsequently expired, you must complete a N244 (general application form) and send it to the court. The N244 must ask the court to ‘extend the life of the warrant for a further 12 months as it expired due to Covid19’ and must include any change of circumstances of yourself (the landlord) and details of any communication with or change in circumstances for the tenant. The application will then be considered by a District Judge, you may be required to attend a hearing if the Judge deems it appropriate.</p>

<p>Applications to extend the life of an expired warrant which are filed within the 3 month window of 1 June 2021-31 August 2021 will not require the payment of a fee. This applies to properties in both England and Wales. Any new application to extend the life of a warrant issued outside of the dates above will incur the application fee of either £100 (without notice to the defendant) or £255 (with notice to the defendant).</p>

<p>If your warrant is due to expire within 3 months after the possession restrictions have lifted, you must complete an N244 (general application form) requesting that the life of the warrant be extended and send it to the court.  The application must ask the court to ‘extend the life of the warrant for a further 12 months as the bailiff is unable to conduct an eviction prior to the expiry date of the warrant as a result of the restrictions introduced in response to the coronavirus pandemic’ and must include any change of circumstances of yourself (the landlord) and details of any communication with or change in circumstances for the tenant. The application will then be considered by a District Judge, you may be required to attend a hearing if the Judge deems it appropriate.</p>

<p>Applications to extend the life of a warrant which is due to expire which are filed within the 3 month window of 1 June 2021-31 August 2021 will not require the payment of a fee. This applies to properties in both England and Wales. Any new application to extend the life of a warrant issued outside of the dates above will incur the application fee of either £100 (without notice to the defendant) or £255 (with notice to the defendant).</p>

<p>The fee waive will only be applicable to possession warrants issued AFTER 16 March 2020 (the start of the first lockdown). Possession warrants which were issued or expired prior to this date will require an application and fee to extend the life of the warrant.</p>

<p>Bailiffs will re-commence the enforcement of valid possession warrants  from 1 June 2021 in England. In Wales bailiffs are currently expected to re-commence enforcement of valid possession warrants on 1 July 2021. Where practicable, bailiffs will work in date order of when the warrant of possession was issued to ensure older warrants are actioned first. The only exception to this will be cases issued under anti-social behaviour grounds or for cases involving squatting, or where there are operational reasons to action a newer warrant first. In the majority of cases, the bailiff will serve a 14-day notice period on the defendant ahead of any eviction.</p>
