<h2>Who is this guide for?</h2>

<p>This guide is for local authority and Private Registered Providers of social housing/Registered Social Landlords (PRPs/RSLs) that are pursuing, or considering pursuing, possession proceedings against their tenants.</p>

<p>This guide is intended to help you to understand the new arrangements introduced following the lifting of the suspension of possession cases in the county court on 21 September 2020.</p>

<p>This guide focuses on new arrangements rather than existing eviction processes. For more information on notices, possession orders and evictions, see the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/council-housing-association-evictions" class="govuk-link">Council and housing association evictions</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/evicting-tenants" class="govuk-link">Evicting tenants</a>.</p>

<p>This guide does not cover leasehold properties.</p>

<p>This guidance is intended as information rather than legal advice.</p>

<h2>An overview of the changes to the possession action process</h2>

<p>If you made a claim for possession which is already in the court system, see Part 1 below.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 1: Serve a notice seeking or requiring possession</strong></p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Due to coronavirus (COVID-19) there have been alterations to the length of notice periods when serving notices in England and Wales since 26 March 2020:</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>In England</strong>
<br><br>
From 1 October 2021 all notice periods returned to their pre-pandemic lengths.
<br><br>
However, if you served a notice between 26 March 2020 and 30 September 2021, the notice periods were as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From 26 March 2020 to 28 August 2020, a minimum notice period of three months was required in all cases.</li>
  <li>From 29 August 2020 to  31 May 2021, a minimum notice period  of6 months was required in most cases, with exemptions for certain serious cases including anti-social behaviour, serious rent arrears, domestic abuse and fraud.</li>
  <li>From 1 June 2021 to 30 September 2021 a minimum notice period of 4 months was required in most cases, with exemptions for certain serious cases including anti-social behaviour, serious rent arrears, domestic abuse and fraud.</li>
  <li>From 1 August 2021 to 30 September 2021, for cases involving arrears of less than 4 months, the minimum notice period reduced to 2 months.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more detailed information about notice periods in England including exemptions, please see <a href="#annex-a-minimum-notice-period-lengths-for-tenancies-in-england" class="govuk-link">Annex A</a>. 
<br><br>
<strong>In Wales</strong>
<br><br>
From 26 March 2020 to 23 July 2020 notice periods were a minimum of 3 months in all cases.
<br><br>
From 24 July 2020 to 28 September 2020, notice periods for assured or assured shorthold tenancies were a minimum of 6 months, other than for grounds relating to anti-social behaviour which were a minimum of 3 months.  The minimum notice period to be given to tenants, including introductory tenants, under the secure tenancy regime from 24 July to 28 September 2020, was 3 months.
<br><br>
If you serve notice at any time on or after 29 September 2020 to at least 31 December 2021, the length of the notice period you are required to give is a minimum of 6 months unless you are seeking possession on grounds of anti-social behaviour and/or domestic violence, in which case the pre-Coronavirus Act arrangements re-apply.<br><br>
For more detailed information about notice periods in Wales including exemptions, please see <a href="#annex-b-minimum-notice-period-lengths-for-tenancies-in-wales" class="govuk-link">Annex B</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Stage 2: Make a possession claim</strong></p>

<p>You must attach a new notice giving information as to how, to your knowledge, the coronavirus pandemic has affected your tenant and/or their dependants. See further information at the ‘Coronavirus notice and COVID-19 marking’ section. Where PCOL is used, a hearing will not be provided at the point of issue.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 3: Before the hearing</strong></p>

<p>The court will give you a date for the hearing and provide you with any further directions as necessary. Notice of the appointment and hearing may be sent upon issue of the claim or at a later date.</p>

<p>You will need to send the court an electronic copy of all of the case documents and confirm that you have also provided these to your tenant, including the notice setting out the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on your tenant and/or their dependants. See Part 3 below.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 4: Attend the possession hearing</strong></p>

<p>There will be a possession hearing if no agreement is reached. You are asked to consider making arrangements for only 1 or 2 housing officers to attend at court on any day to deal with all cases you may have in the list.  There will be duty scheme advice arrangements in place.</p>

<p>You must bring to the court 2 copies of a new notice dealing with Pre-Action Protocol and COVID-19 information.  See Part 2.  You must serve a copy of the notice on the tenant at least 14 days before the hearing.</p>

<p>Practice will vary locally but approximately 15 minutes will be allowed for each hearing, with additional time between hearings for COVID-19 safety procedures.</p>

<p>You can request that a hearing takes place remotely. However, this will only go ahead if the Judge agrees to this, and your tenant also agrees</p>

<p><strong>Stage 5: Apply for a warrant of possession</strong></p>

<p>In listing bailiffs’ appointments, the court will allow for a period of at least 14 days between service of notice of eviction upon the tenant and the eviction date.  If, after receiving notice of eviction, the tenant makes an application for a stay or suspension, the court will ensure that this is listed prior to the eviction taking place.  Safety procedures and policies will be provided to tenants at enforcement.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Important:</strong> In England and in Wales, legislation which restricted bailiff enforcement of evictions, has now been lifted. This was in place in England from 17 November 2020 until 31 May 2021 and in Wales from 11 December 2020 until 30 June 2021. Therefore, orders can now be enforced where the landlord has a valid warrant of possession.

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Claims already in the court system</h2>

<h3>How long will the court process take?</h3>

<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic many cases will have built up which the courts need to process, and the courts will not be operating at their full capacity. Therefore, it is very likely to take longer than the usual 8 weeks for your claim to be heard by a judge. We ask for your patience during this time. We would encourage you to continue to engage with the tenant to explore what can be achieved in terms of assisting the tenant to access benefits, or a discretionary housing payment, or agreeing a repayment plan, as appropriate.</p>

<p>As the courts and bailiff procedures resume, you may have to wait for a bailiff appointment slot to become available if a warrant of possession has been issued. It is important that you communicate to the court if you no longer need the appointment, for example in circumstances where your tenant has agreed in writing to vacate the property and returned their keys.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Making a possession claim</h2>

<h3>Pre-Action Protocol for possession claims by social landlords</h3>

<p>In a claim to which the Pre-Action Protocol applies, you must provide a notice confirming that you have complied with the Protocol and setting out how you have done so.</p>

<p>You will need to bring to the hearing 2 copies of this notice as well as the notice setting out how your tenants (and their dependants) have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic (see below). See further information on the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/protocol/pre-action-protocol-for-possession-claims-by-social-landlords">Pre-Action Protocol for possession claims by social landlords</a>.</p>

<h3>Information you must provide to the court on how your tenant has been affected by COVID-19 (The Covid Notice)</h3>

<p>When making a claim for possession, you must also provide a Covid notice setting out how your tenant and any dependants have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. This could include information about your tenant’s vulnerability, disability and welfare benefit position, with specific reference to those who may have been required to shield. You should attach this notice to your claim.</p>

<p>If you have no knowledge of your tenants’ circumstances you should make this clear, including information about any attempts made to discuss matters with them.</p>

<p>You should send the Covid Notice detailing this information to the court with your claim for possession. This applies to both standard and accelerated possession claims. This information should be clearly provided in Section 7 of the Particulars of Claim and/or a further information can be provided on a written note attached to the form if needed.</p>

<p>This applies to both standard and accelerated possession claims. The court may not progress your case until you provide the required Covid Notice.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> What you need to do before the hearing</h2>

<p>For cases where the landlord is using the standard possession procedure (ie not the accelerated possession procedure), you will receive the date of the possession hearing and any further directions as necessary.</p>

<p>At least 14 days prior to the hearing, you will be required to email the court at the address provided. The email must include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>An electronic bundle of all case documents, including the claim form and particulars of claim, information about how your tenant has been affected by coronavirus and the tenant’s defence. (A hard copy bundle can be provided as an alternative.) You must confirm that you have provided a Covid Notice about your tenant’s circumstances to the court. This should include information about the effect of the pandemic on your tenant and his or her dependents, and about their vulnerability, disability and welfare benefit position, with specific reference to those who may have been shielding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confirmation that you have provided a hard copy of all of the bundle to the tenant, including the Covid Notice, and an electronic copy if they have provided their email address.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If an agreement has not been reached and your paperwork is in order, the judge is likely to make an order setting out the steps to be taken by you and by your tenant, to provide the court and each other with the evidence and information necessary to allow the substantive hearing to take place. However, they could also adjourn the substantive hearing or dismiss the case if they feel that adequate information has not been provided to the court or that the relevant legal requirements have not been met.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> The possession hearing</h2>

<p>Judges are responsible for listing cases for a hearing in court. As a guide the following types of case will be listed with priority:</p>

<p>(a)	cases with allegations of anti-social behaviour</p>

<p>(b)	cases with extreme alleged arrears accrued, that is, arrears equal to at least 12 months’ rent</p>

<p>(c)	cases involving alleged squatters, illegal occupiers, or persons unknown</p>

<p>(d)	cases involving an allegation of domestic violence where the claimant is a Social Landlord and possession of the property is alleged to be important for particular reasons which are set out in the claim form (and with domestic violence agencies alerted)</p>

<p>(e)	cases with allegations of fraud or deception</p>

<p>(f)	cases with allegations of unlawful subletting</p>

<p>(g)	cases with allegations of abandonment of the property, non-occupation or death of defendant; and</p>

<p>(h)	cases concerning what was allocated by an authority as ‘temporary accommodation’ and is specifically needed by the authority for reallocation as ‘temporary accommodation’.</p>

<p>Subject to the above, priority will be given to claims issued before the court suspended possession claims in March 2020</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Warrants for possession and bailiffs</h2>

<h3>If you have an outstanding warrant of possession</h3>

<p>If you have a warrant of possession but no longer require an eviction to be carried out you should let the court know as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>If you have a possession order and the date on which the tenant was due to give up possession has passed, but you have not yet applied for a warrant of possession</h3>

<p>In the light of the coronavirus pandemic and the effect that this may have had on your tenants, you should carefully consider whether you wish to proceed with the eviction. You are still able to apply for a Warrant of Possession.</p>

<p>You do not need to take any steps if you decide not to seek an eviction at once and you will still be able to rely on the Possession Order if you decide to take your property back at a later date. You can apply for a Warrant of Possession at any time during the period of 6 years after the date a Possession Order is made.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>In England and in Wales, legislation which restricted bailiff enforcement of evictions, has now been lifted. This was in place in England from 17 November 2020 until 31 May 2021 and in Wales from 11 December 2020 until 30 June 2021. Therefore, orders can now be enforced where the landlord has a valid warrant of possession.<br>
<br>
However, bailiffs must provide 14 days’ notice of an eviction and have been asked not to carry out an eviction if they are made aware that anyone living in the property has COVID-19 symptoms or is self-isolating.</p>
</div>

<h3>Enforcement</h3>

<p>A notice of the eviction appointment will be sent to both landlord and tenant. Appointments will be scheduled with a minimum of 14 days’ notice and the tenant may be able to apply to suspend the eviction. However, bailiffs will not carry out an eviction if they are made aware that the tenant or anyone they live with has coronavirus symptoms, has tested positive for COVID-19 or are waiting for a test result, or has been instructed by the NHS to self-isolate (including if they are quarantining in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england">international travel rules</a>). The tenant can inform the court if this applies to them, explaining when the symptoms started and/or how long the period of self isolation will last. The appointment will be rescheduled for a later date with a minimum of 14 days’ notice.</p>

<p>The bailiff will follow the latest Public Health England and government guidance. They will conduct the eviction wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and maintain social distancing. They should ask if anybody in the household has symptoms or is self-isolating (including if they are quarantining in accordance with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england" class="govuk-link">international travel rules</a>). If that is the case, or if the enforcement agent observes any visible symptoms of Covid-19, then they should withdraw from the property at their own discretion. The eviction will be rescheduled with a minimum of 14 days notice.</p>

<h3>If you have an outstanding warrant of possession which has expired, or is nearing its expiry date</h3>

<p>The restrictions on evictions were lifted on 31 May 2021 in England and 30 June 2021 in Wales.</p>

<p>Warrants of possession are valid for 12 months from date of issue. If you have been unable to proceed to enforcement due to restrictions introduced as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and your warrant has subsequently expired or is due to expire and you wish to apply to extend the life of the warrant, then you must complete a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-n244-application-notice" class="govuk-link">N244 (general application form)</a> and send it to the court.</p>

<p>The N244 must ask the court to ‘extend the life of the warrant for a further 12 months as it expired due to COVID-19 / or give your reasons as to why you require the life of the warrant to be extended’. The application must include any change of circumstances of yourself (the landlord) and details of any communication with or change in circumstances for the tenant. The application will then be considered by a District Judge. You may be required to attend a hearing if the Judge deems it appropriate. Any application to extend the life of a warrant will incur a general application fee of £108 (without notice to the defendant) or £275 (with notice to the defendant). This is applicable in England and Wales.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if the warrant has expired, you can apply to issue a new warrant of possession (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-n325-request-for-warrant-for-possession-of-land" class="govuk-link">form N325</a>). A fee of £130 is chargeable.</p>

<h3>If you have a valid warrant of possession</h3>

<p>Bailiffs have re-commenced enforcement of valid possession warrants. Where practicable, bailiffs will work in date order of when the warrant of possession was issued to ensure older warrants are actioned first. The only exception to this will be cases issued under anti-social behaviour grounds or for cases involving squatting, or where there are operational reasons to action a newer warrant first. In the majority of cases, the bailiff will serve a 14-day notice period on the defendant ahead of any eviction.</p>
