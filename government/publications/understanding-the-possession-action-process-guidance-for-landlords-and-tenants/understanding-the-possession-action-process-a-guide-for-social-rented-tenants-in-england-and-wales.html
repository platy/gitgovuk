<h2>What has changed</h2>

<p>The government has announced that the measures put in place under Plan B in England will be lifted.</p>

<p>This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The government is no longer asking people to work from home if they can. People should now talk to their employers to agree arrangements to return to the office.</li>
  <li>From 20 January: Face coverings will no longer be advised for staff and pupils in secondary school and college classrooms.</li>
  <li>From 27 January: Face coverings will no longer be advised for staff and pupils in communal areas of secondary schools, nor for staff in communal areas of primaries.</li>
  <li>From 27 January: There is no longer a legal requirement to wear a face covering. The government suggests that you continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet.</li>
  <li>From 27 January: Venues and events will no longer be required by law to check visitorsâ NHS COVID Pass. The NHS COVID Pass can still be used on a voluntary basis.</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance will be updated shortly to include more information on these changes. You should continue to follow all of the guidance on this page to keep yourself and others safe.</p>
</div>

<h2>Who is this guide for?</h2>

<p>This guide is for tenants who are renting a house or flat from a local authority (council) or a Private Registered Provider of Social Housing/Registered Social Landlord (referred to in this guidance as âa housing associationâ).</p>

<p>This guide is designed to assist tenants who have been served with a notice by their landlord indicating that the landlord will be taking legal action to obtain possession of their home. See the overview of the possession process below.</p>

<p>This guidance also provides useful advice for tenants who are in rent arrears or who otherwise feel that they may be at risk of being served with notice by their landlord.</p>

<p>Being served with notice can be a worrying or stressful experience. This guide will help you to understand your rights, and the options which are available to you. However, this guidance is intended as information rather than legal advice. It is important that you access legal and money advice and support tailored to your individual circumstances as early as possible.</p>

<h2>An overview of the possession process</h2>

<p>If there is any change in your circumstances which means that you will have problems keeping to the terms of your tenancy, you should let your landlord know as soon as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 1: Notice</strong></p>

<p>Your landlord will give you a notice setting out its intention to seek possession. The notice will specify a date after which possession proceedings may be commenced. If you receive a notice, contact your housing officer (or rent officer) immediately to see what can be done to stop the process going any further.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>From 1 October 2021 all notice periods returned to their pre-pandemic lengths.</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>In England</strong>
<br><br>
However, if you were served a notice between 26 March 2020 and 30 September 2021, the notice periods were as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From 26 March 2020 to 28 August 2020, a minimum notice period of three months was required in all cases.</li>
  <li>From 29 August 2020 to 31 May 2021, a minimum notice period of 6 months was required in most cases, with exemptions for certain serious cases, including anti-social behaviour, serious rent arrears, domestic abuse and fraud.</li>
  <li>From 1 June 2021 to 30 September 2021 a minimum notice period of 4 months was required in most cases, with exemptions for certain serious cases, including anti-social behaviour, serious rent arrears, domestic abuse and fraud.</li>
  <li>From 1 August 2021 to 30 September 2021, for cases involving arrears of less than 4 months, the minimum notice period reduced to 2 months.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information about new notice periods, see <a href="#annex-a-minimum-notice-period-lengths-for-tenancies-in-england" class="govuk-link">Annex A</a>.
<br><br>
<strong>In Wales</strong>
<br><br>
If your landlord gives you notice at any time on or after 29 September 2020 to at least 24 March 2022, the minimum period of notice you can be given is 6 months unless your landlord is seeking possession on grounds of anti-social behaviour and/or domestic violence. 
<br><br>
If you have an Introductory or Demoted Tenancy (used by local authorities), for cases concerning anti-social behaviour and domestic violence, a 4-week notice period will be required; otherwise, notice periods for Introductory and Demoted Tenancies will be 6 months.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Stage 2: If you stay in your home after the notice expires</strong></p>

<p>Once the date specified in the notice has passed, your landlord can issue a claim for possession in the local county court. As well as asking the court for a possession order, your landlord will usually ask the court to order that you pay any rent arrears and that you pay the landlordâs legal costs. Your landlord will have to provide the court with a Covid Notice informing the court, to the best of your landlordâs knowledge, of what the effect of the pandemic has been on you and your dependants.</p>

<p>The Covid Notice should be detailed on Section 7 of the Particulars of Claim and/ or on a written note attached to that form. The Particulars of Claim sets out the legal basis upon which the landlord claims to be entitled to possession for example arrears of rent.</p>

<p>You will be sent a copy of the landlordâs claim documents. You will be allowed a stated period of time to file a defence and to provide your own statement about how you have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic (where this is relevant to the possession claim). You will also receive information on where to obtain legal advice to help you with your case.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 3: Before the hearing</strong></p>

<p>You will be notified by the court of the date for the hearing and the court would provide you with any further directions as necessary. Your landlord will need to provide you with all the case documents including the Covid Notice setting out the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on you and/or your dependants.</p>

<p>Before the hearing, you and your landlord should attempt to reach a settlement, for example agreeing a plan to repay rent arrears. A legal adviser may be able to help you to reach a settlement with your landlord. Your landlord should inform the court if a settlement has been reached and a hearing is no longer required.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 4: The possession hearing</strong></p>

<p>If a settlement cannot be agreed, there will be a possession hearing, at which a judge will decide whether to make a possession order.</p>

<p>If you are an assured shorthold tenant and your landlord is using the section 21 possession process, the court may make a decision without a hearing taking place, as it may be clear, on the papers submitted, that your landlord is entitled to a possession order.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 5: Warrant of possession and bailiffs</strong></p>

<p>If an outright possession order is granted at the hearing and you do not leave your home by the date specified in the order, your landlord can apply for a Warrant of Possession, which enables a county court bailiff to evict you. If a suspended possession order is granted, and you do not keep to its terms, your landlord can apply for a warrant of possession. You can apply to suspend the warrant. However, if you do not make an application or if the court does not agree to suspend the warrant, a county court bailiff will enforce the warrant and evict you from your home.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Important:</strong> In England and in Wales, legislation which restricted bailiff enforcement of evictions, has now been lifted. This wasâ¯in place in Englandâ¯fromâ¯17â¯November 2020â¯untilâ¯31 May 2021 and in Wales from 11 December 2020 until 30 June 2021. Therefore, orders can now be enforced whereâ¯the landlord has a valid warrant of possession. However, bailiffs must provide 14 daysâ notice of an eviction and have been asked not to carry out an eviction if they are made aware that anyone living in the property has COVID-19 symptoms or is self-isolating.</p>
</div>

<h2>Claims already in the court system</h2>

<h3>If your landlord has made a claim for possession, but a hearing has not yet taken place</h3>

<p>If your landlord applied for possession before 3 August 2020, they must make an application to the court if they want to continue with the claim. You will receive a copy of their application. If you want to challenge your landlordâs application, you will receive instructions from the court on how to do this.</p>

<h3>If your landlord has an outstanding warrant of possession</h3>

<p>In England and in Wales, legislation which restricted bailiff enforcement of evictions, has now been lifted. This wasâ¯in place in Englandâ¯fromâ¯17â¯November 2020â¯untilâ¯31 May 2021 and in Wales from 11 December 2020 until 30 June 2021. Therefore, orders can now be enforced whereâ¯the landlord has a valid warrant of possession. However, bailiffs must provide 14 daysâ notice of an eviction and have been asked not to carry out an eviction if they are made aware that anyone living in the property has COVID-19 symptoms or is self-isolating.</p>

<p>You will receive a ânotice of evictionâ form (form N54), which states that a Warrant has been issued giving bailiffs the authority to evict you</p>

<p>However, bailiffs will not carry out an eviction if they are made aware that you or anyone you live with has coronavirus symptoms, has tested positive for COVID-19 or is waiting for a test result, or has been instructed by the NHS to self-isolate (including if you are quarantining in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england">international travel rules</a>). If this applies to you, you should inform the court at the address provided on the N54 form explaining when the symptoms started and/or how long you have been in self-isolation for. You should explain when the symptoms started and/or how long the period of self-isolation will last. The appointment will be rescheduled for a later date with a minimum of 14 daysâ notice.</p>

<p>When you receive notice of an eviction, you should consider whether to make an application to the court for a suspension of the warrant â seek advice about whether an application would have any real prospect of success. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#_Stage_5:_Warrant">Stage 5</a> for more information about the circumstances under which a suspension may be granted. This costs Â£14. You should follow the instructions on the notice if you wish to make an application to suspend the warrant.</p>

<h2>If you are worried about rent arrears</h2>

<p>It is important that you contact your landlord as soon as possible if you are worried about meeting your rental payments. An early conversation with your landlord can help you to agree a plan if you are struggling to pay the rent. This can include agreeing that your landlord does not seek possession action for a period of time and instead accepts a lower level of rent from you. You may also reach an agreement to pay off arrears at a later date.</p>

<p>If you have suffered a loss of income or other changes to your financial circumstances, you should let your housing officer or rent officer know the details and any plan you have for addressing the situation. If you think you may be entitled to benefits, you can ask your housing officer or rent officer for advice or assistance in making a claim. They can also help you to work out an affordable plan for paying your arrears.  If you agree a plan, do your best to keep to it and, if problems arise, make contact to let your landlord know.</p>

<p>If you and your dependants have been affected by the pandemic in a way that has affected your ability to pay the rent, or to keep to your tenancy agreement, let your landlord know the details.</p>

<h3>Financial support</h3>

<p>If you fall into financial difficulties due to a change in your employment or earnings you may qualify for Universal Credit. Find more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/how-to-claim-universal-credit">Universal Credit</a>.</p>

<p>Local authorities can provide support for tenants to stay in their homes. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">Ask your council</a> about Discretionary Housing Payments.</p>

<h3>Pre-action Protocol for possession claims by social landlords</h3>

<p>The Courts have published a Pre-Action Protocol for possession claims by social landlords  which sets out the procedures that social landlords should follow before issuing possession claims. The protocol aims to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>encourage more pre-action contact and exchange of information between landlords and tenants</li>
  <li>if possible, enable landlords and tenants to avoid litigation and settle disputes out of court</li>
  <li>if court proceedings are inevitable, enable an effective use of courtâs time and resources</li>
</ul>

<p>The protocol provides specific guidance on handling claims for rent arrears and cases where the court must grant possession if the landlord proves the case â mandatory grounds.</p>

<p>If the landlord unreasonably fails to comply with the terms of the protocol the court can take this into account when making any order for costs, adjourn the case, or where the claim is brought on discretionary grounds strike out the claim.</p>

<p>If the tenant does not comply with the terms of the protocol the court can take this into account in considering whether it is reasonable to make an order for possession.</p>

<p>More detail about the protocol is in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-c-pre-action-protocol">Annex C</a>.</p>

<h2>Stage 1: The possession notice</h2>

<h3>Local authority tenants</h3>

<p>If you are a local authority tenant you are likely to have one of the following tenancies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a secure periodic tenancy</li>
  <li>an introductory tenancy</li>
  <li>a flexible fixed term tenancy (England only)</li>
</ul>

<p>This guide deals with the possession process in respect of each of these 3 tenancy types.</p>

<h4>Secure tenants</h4>

<p>Most local authority tenancies are secure periodic tenancies, often known as âlifetimeâ tenancies.  They are granted for an indefinite period with the rent being due on a periodic basis, for example weekly or monthly.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 1: What to do when you are served with a notice seeking possession under section 83 or section 83ZA of the Housing Act 1985</strong></p>

<p>If you have a secure periodic tenancy you can only be evicted if your landlord can prove to the court that certain legal reasons apply.  These reasons are called grounds for possession. Grounds for possession are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>discretionary - the court has to decide whether it is reasonable for you to be evicted; or</li>
  <li>mandatory - the court must order you to leave if the local authority can prove that the ground applies</li>
</ul>

<p>Most possession grounds are discretionary and include, for example, rent arrears, damage to the property, and causing a nuisance to neighbours (anti-social behaviour).</p>

<p>The mandatory grounds include where the local authority plans to demolish your home or needs to carry out major works which cannot be done while you are living there.  There is also a mandatory ground for anti-social behaviour, where you or a member of your household has already been convicted of anti-social behaviour in the courts. In most cases, where the local authority is relying on mandatory grounds, they will have to offer another council or housing association home for you to move into. Your landlord does not have to offer you anywhere else to live if you are being evicted because of anti-social behaviour.</p>

<p>Your landlord can use both mandatory and discretionary grounds. The court will look first at whether the mandatory grounds which your landlord has listed are valid. If these cannot be proven, the court will then look at the discretionary grounds in order to make a decision.</p>

<p>Your landlord must give you written notice that it intends to go to court to seek possession. You can receive a notice at any time during your tenancy.</p>

<p>The type of notice that you are given will depend on whether the landlord is relying on the mandatory anti-social behaviour ground or whether they are relying on any of the other possession grounds. 
If the landlord wishes to start possession proceedings, they must apply to court within a year of the date specified in the notice as being the date after which possession proceedings may be begun. If they donât, the notice will expire and the landlord cannot use it.</p>

<p><strong>When you receive a section 83 Housing Act 1985 notice</strong></p>

<p>The notice must specify the grounds your landlord will be relying on for seeking possession and the date after which the possession proceedings may be begun.</p>

<p>The type of ground(s) which the landlord is using to evict you will affect how the case is dealt with by the court:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Grounds 1 to 8 and 12 to 15A are discretionary grounds. Before the court will grant an order on any of these grounds, they must be satisfied that it is reasonable to require you to leave.  This means that, if one of these grounds is set out in the notice, you will be able to argue at the hearing in Court that it is not reasonable that you should have to leave, even if you accept that the ground applies.  If the Court decides that it is reasonable to grant a possession order, it will go on to consider whether it is reasonable to suspend the effect of that order.  The Court has power to suspend the Order indefinitely in these discretionary cases, but it will usually make the suspension conditional upon you abiding by certain terms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the Court grants an order on any of the Grounds 9 to 15A, it must be satisfied that there will be suitable alternative accommodation for you when you have to leave. This may be either a council or housing association tenancy.  In deciding whether the accommodation is suitable, the court will consider various factors such as how near it is to where you work, and the sort of housing that other people with similar needs are offered.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are some steps which you should take promptly to avoid the risk of losing your home:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Check that the landlord has given the notice correctly. The notice will not be valid if it doesnât include your name, the address of the property, the grounds for possession (the reasons why your landlord wants you to leave), and the date the after which court proceedings can be brought (the date on which the notice ends).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check that you have been given the correct amount of notice. In England from 1 October 2021 all notice periods returned to their pre-pandemic lengths. For section 83 Housing Act 1985 notices in England this is usually a minimum of 4 weeks. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-a-minimum-notice-period-lengths-for-tenancies-in-england">Annex A</a> for details of the new notice periods.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As a result of coronavirus (COVID-19) longer notice periods were introduced:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In England, if your landlord served you notice on or after 29 August 2020 until 31 May 2021, the notice period had to be at least 6 months for most grounds, with exceptions for certain serious cases. From 1 June 2021 until 30 September 2021, the minimum notice period was 4 months unless your landlord was relying on one of the following serious grounds: you are in arrears of rent by at least 4 months, you are alleged to be responsible for anti-social behaviour or rioting, you are alleged to be responsible for domestic abuse, you are alleged to have obtained your tenancy by making a false statement. From 1 August 2021 until 30 September 2021, where you were in arrears of rent of less than 4 months, the minimum notice period was 2 months.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Wales the minimum notice period is 6 months unless your landlord is relying on one of the following serious grounds: anti-social behaviour or domestic violence, in which case a notice period of one month or less will apply.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check that the reason for eviction your landlord gave in the notice is valid. The notice should explain what grounds your landlord is using to evict you (numbered 1-15A), and why the landlord is using the grounds for possession.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contact your housing officer as soon as possible to discuss the situation.  See whether you can reach an agreement about steps that you will take to let your landlords see that there is no need for them to take possession proceedings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If your housing officer does not reassure you that possession proceedings will not be commenced at this stage, seek legal advice.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When the mandatory anti-social behaviour ground for possession applies you will receive a notice under section 83ZA of the Housing Act 1985</strong></p>

<p>The notice must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>set out the reasons why your landlord wants to evict you</li>
  <li>inform you that you that you have the right to request a review of the landlordâs decision to evict you</li>
  <li>if your landlord is seeking possession on other grounds as well, set out those grounds</li>
  <li>inform you that, if you need help or advice about the notice, and what to do about it, you should take it immediately to a Citizensâ Advice Bureau, a housing aid centre, a law centre or a solicitor.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the landlord is seeking to evict you because you, someone living with you or someone visiting you have committed a relevant offence, the notice must also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>state the conviction on which your landlord proposes to rely</li>
  <li>be served within 12 months of the conviction, or if the conviction is appealed, within 12 months of the appeal being determined, abandoned or withdrawn</li>
</ul>

<p>If the landlord is seeking to evict you because you have breached a relevant injunction under s.1 of the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014, the notice must also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>set out the findings on which the landlord proposes to rely</li>
  <li>be served within 12 months of the finding, or if there is an appeal against the finding, within 12 months of the appeal being determined, abandoned or withdrawn</li>
</ul>

<p>If the landlord is seeking to evict you because your property is or has been subject to a closure order, the notice must also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>state the relevant closure order and</li>
  <li>be served within 3 months of the closure order being made, or if there is an appeal against the order, within 3 months of the appeal being determined, abandoned or withdrawn</li>
</ul>

<p>Following the review, your landlord must inform you in writing whether it will let you keep your tenancy or whether it intends to start possession proceedings.  If your landlord decides to start possession proceedings, it must tell you the reasons why.</p>

<p>If you do not leave at the end of the notice period, your landlord will be able to apply to repossess the property through the county court.</p>

<p>You might be able to challenge your eviction and stay longer in your home but, in most cases, if a section 83ZA has been served and your landlord has followed the procedure correctly, your landlord will be entitled to possession. It is important to get legal advice about this.  You and your adviser should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Check that the landlord has given you the correct period of notice to leave. In England from 1 October 2021 all notice periods returned to their pre-pandemic lengths. For section 83ZA, Housing Act 1985 notices in England this is at least 4 weeks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Longer notice periods were introduced due to coronavirus (Covid-19). In England, from 26 March 2020 to 28 August 2020, the minimum notice period was 3 months, and from 29 August 2020 until 30 September 2021  the minimum notice period was 4 weeks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Wales, from 26 March 2020 to 28 September 2020 the minimum notice period was 3 months, and from 29 September 2020 until at least 24 March 2022 the minimum notice period is 4 weeks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Check that the landlord has given the correct notice and included all of the required information.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Check that the review was carried out correctly.</strong>  The court may refuse to grant possession if your landlord failed to carry out a review which you asked for within the time limits, or if the decision on the review is wrong in law.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Your legal adviser will also be able to consider whether there may be any reasonable prospect of defending the claim based on discrimination, disability, public law or public sector equality duty factors.</p>

<h4>Introductory tenancies</h4>

<p>An introductory tenancy is a probationary or trial tenancy granted to a new tenant that allows the local authority landlord to decide if you are a good tenant. Not all local authorities give introductory tenancies to new tenants. The trial period lasts for 12 months but can be extended for a further 6 months.</p>

<p>At the end of the trial period, unless the local authority landlord seeks possession of the property, the tenant will be given either a secure periodic tenancy or a flexible fixed term tenancy.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 1: What to do when you are served with a notice under section 128 of the Housing Act 1996</strong></p>

<p>If you have an introductory tenancy, you can be evicted for breaches of your tenancy, such as rent arrears or anti-social behaviour.  Your landlord does not have to prove to the court that you have breached your tenancy but they must follow the correct legal process.</p>

<p>Your landlord must give you written notice (under s.128 of the Housing Act 1996) that it intends to go to court to seek possession.</p>

<p>The notice must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>set out the reasons why your landlord wants to evict you</li>
  <li>inform you that you that you have the right to request a review of the landlordâs decision to evict you</li>
  <li>inform you that if you need help or advice about the notice, and what to do about it, you should take it immediately to a Citizensâ Advice Bureau, a housing aid centre, a law centre or a solicitor.</li>
</ul>

<p>You have 14 days from the date the notice is delivered to ask for a review.</p>

<p>This is your opportunity to tell your landlord why you should not be evicted. You can either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attend a review hearing, with or without an adviser present</li>
  <li>set out your reasons in writing, including any relevant evidence</li>
</ul>

<p>Following the review, your landlord must inform you in writing whether it will let you keep your tenancy or whether it intends to start possession proceedings.  If your landlord decides to start possession proceedings, it must tell you the reasons why.</p>

<p>If you do not leave at the end of the notice period, your landlord will be able to apply to repossess the property through the county court.</p>

<p>You might be able to challenge your landlordâs claim for possession and stay longer in your home but, with an introductory tenancy, the bases for bringing a legal challenge are very limited. It is important to get legal advice about this.</p>

<p>If the landlord wishes to start possession proceedings, they must usually apply to court within a year of the start date of your introductory tenancy. If the landlord has extended the trial period of your introductory tenancy (the maximum extension allowed is 6 months) they must apply to the court before the end of the extended period, if they want to obtain possession.  If they do not, they will not be entitled to possession as the introductory period will have finished and your tenancy will have become secure.</p>

<p><strong>When you receive a section 128 Housing Act 1996 notice</strong></p>

<p>You might be able to challenge your eviction and stay longer in your home but, in most cases, if a section 128 has been served and your landlord has followed the procedure correctly, your landlord will be entitled to possession. It is important to get legal advice about this.  You and your adviser should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Check that the landlord has given you the required period of notice to leave.</strong> In England from 1 October 2021 all notice periods returned to their pre-pandemic lengths. For section 128 Housing Act 1996 notices in England this is at least 4 weeks. See Annex A for details of the new notice periods.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Longer notice periods were introduced due to coronavirus (COVID-19).  In England, from 26 March 2020 to 28 August 2020, the minimum notice period was 3 months. From 29 August 2020 until 31 May 2021 the minimum notice period was 6 months except for cases involving anti-social behaviour, rioting or domestic abuse as one of the reasons for claiming possession, in which case the notice period was 4 weeks. In England from 1 June 2021 until 30 September 2021, the minimum notice period was 4 months, except for cases involving anti-social behaviour, rioting, domestic abuse, false statement or rent arrears of at least 4 months, as one of the reasons for claiming possession, in which case the notice period is 4 weeks. From 1 August 2021, where there were rent arrears of less than 4 months, the minimum notice period was 2 months.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Wales, from 26 March 2020 to 28 September 2020, the minimum notice period was 3 months and from 29 September 2020 the minimum notice period is 6 months except, if the landlord specifies anti-social behaviour  and/or domestic violence as one of the reasons for claiming possession, in which case the notice period is 4 weeks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Check that the landlord has given the correct notice and included all of the required information.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Check that the review was carried out correctly.</strong>  The court may refuse to grant possession if your landlord failed to carry out a review which you asked for within the time limits, or if the decision on the review is wrong in law.</p>

<h4>Flexible tenancies (applies to England only)</h4>

<p>A flexible tenancy, is a type of fixed-term secure tenancy. The fixed term is usually for a minimum of 5 years, but may be for a minimum of 2 years in exceptional circumstances. A local authority landlord must serve the tenant with prior written notice that a tenancy will be a flexible tenancy.</p>

<p>At the end of the fixed term, your landlord may decide to grant a further flexible tenancy or a secure periodic tenancy, or ask you to leave.  If your landlord does not take any action, either to give you a new tenancy or to ask you to leave, your tenancy will become a secure periodic tenancy.</p>

<p>Different rules apply depending on whether your landlord is seeking to evict you at the end of the fixed term or during the fixed term.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 1: What to do when you are served with a notice of seeking termination of tenancy and recovery of possession under section 83 of the Housing Act 1985</strong></p>

<p>This applies where your landlord is seeking possession during the fixed term of your flexible tenancy.  Possession will only be granted by the court if your landlord can prove that one of the legal reasons (grounds) for possession provided for in the Housing Act 1985 applies in your case.</p>

<p>The notice must specify the grounds your landlord will be relying on for seeking possession and the date after which the possession proceedings may be begun.</p>

<p>The type of ground(s) which the landlord is using to evict you will affect how the case is dealt with by the court:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Grounds 1 to 8 and 12 to 15A are discretionary grounds. Before the court will grant an order on any of these grounds, they must be satisfied that it is reasonable to require you to leave.  This means that, if one of these grounds is set out in the notice, you will be able to argue at the hearing in Court that it is not reasonable that you should have to leave, even if you accept that the ground applies.  If the Court decides that it is reasonable to grant a possession order, it will go on to consider whether it is reasonable to suspend the effect of that order.  The Court has power to suspend the Order indefinitely in these discretionary cases, but it will usually make the suspension conditional upon you abiding by certain terms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the Court grants an order on any of the Grounds 9 to 15A, it must be satisfied that there will be suitable alternative accommodation for you when you have to leave. This may be either a council or housing association tenancy.  In deciding whether the accommodation is suitable, the court will consider various factors such as how near it is to where you work, and the sort of housing that other people with similar needs are offered.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the landlord wishes to start possession proceedings, they must apply to court within a year of the date specified in the notice as being the date after which possession proceedings may be begun. If they donât, the notice will expire and the landlord cannot use it.</p>

<p>There are some steps which you should take promptly to avoid the risk of losing your home:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Check that the landlord has given the notice correctly.</strong> The notice will not be valid if it doesnât include your name, the address of the property, the grounds for possession (the reasons why your landlord wants you to leave), and the date the after which court proceedings can be brought (the date on which the notice ends).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Check that you have been given the correct amount of notice.</strong> In England from 1 October 2021 all notice periods returned to their pre-pandemic lengths. For section 83 Housing Act 1985 notices in England this is usually a minimum of 4 weeks. See <a href="#annex-a-minimum-notice-period-lengths-for-tenancies-in-england" class="govuk-link">Annex A</a> for details of the new notice periods.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Longer notice periods were introduced due to coronavirus (COVID-19). Between 1 June 2021 and 30 September 2021 the minimum notice period was 4 months unless your landlord was relying on one of the following serious grounds: you are in arrears of rent by at least 4 months, you are alleged to be responsible for anti-social behaviour or rioting, you are alleged to be responsible for domestic abuse, you are alleged to have obtained your tenancy by making a false statement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Check that the reason for eviction your landlord gave in the notice is valid.</strong> The notice should explain what grounds your landlord is using to evict you (numbered 1-15A), and why the landlord is using the grounds for possession.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Contact your housing officer as soon as possible to discuss the situation.</strong> See whether you can reach an agreement about steps that you will take to let your landlords see that there is no need for them to take possession proceedings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If your housing officer does not reassure you that possession proceedings will not be commenced at this stage, seek legal advice.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Stage 1: What to do when you are served with a notice under section 107D of the Housing Act 1985</strong></p>

<p>This applies where you landlord decides to take possession, rather than giving you another tenancy, after the fixed term has ended. Your landlord does not have to prove to the court that you have breached your tenancy but it must follow the correct legal process.</p>

<p>To be able to obtain a possession order from the court, your landlord must take the following 2 steps:</p>

<p>(1) Your landlord must give you written notice that they do not intend to grant a further tenancy not less than 6 months before the end of the fixed term.</p>

<p>The notice must set out the landlordâs reasons for not granting a further tenancy, and inform you of your right to review the decision.</p>

<p>You have 21 days to ask for a review. You do not need to put your request in writing.</p>

<p>Your landlord must have a policy which sets out the circumstances in which it may or may not grant another tenancy at the end of the fixed term (either in the same or another property). In carrying out the review, your landlord must consider whether its decision not to grant a further tenancy is consistent with that policy.</p>

<p>Your landlord must notify you, in writing, of the outcome of the review. If your landlord decides to uphold the original decision, they must give you the reasons for the decision.</p>

<p>You must be notified of the review decision before the date on which your landlord can start possession proceedings, ie before the date specified in the notice of seeking possession (see below).</p>

<p>(2) Your landlord must give you written notice (under section 107D of the Housing Act 1985) that they intend to go to court to seek possession.</p>

<p>The notice must be given on or before the date of expiry of the fixed-term of the tenancy. There is no prescribed form for the notice.</p>

<p>If you do not leave at the end of the notice period, your landlord will be able to apply to repossess the property through the county court.</p>

<p><strong>When you receive a notice under section 107D</strong></p>

<p>You might be able to challenge your eviction and stay longer in your home but, in most cases, if a section 107D notice has been served and your landlord has followed the procedure correctly, your landlord will be entitled to possession. It is important to get legal advice about this.  You and your adviser should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Check that the landlord has given you the required period of notice to leave.</strong> In England from 1 October 2021 all notice periods returned to their pre-pandemic lengths. For section 107D notices in England this is a minimum of 2 months. See Annex A for details of the new notice periods.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Longer notice periods were introduced due to coronavirus (COVID-19). In England, from 26 March 2020 to 28 August 2020, the minimum notice period was 3 months, from 29 August 2020 until 31 May 2021, it was 6 months, and from 1 June 2021 until 30 September it was 4 months</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Check that the landlord has given the correct notice and included all of the required information.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Check that the review was carried out correctly.</strong> The court may refuse to grant possession if your landlord failed to carry out a review which you asked for within the time limits, or if the decision on the review is wrong in law.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Your legal adviser will also be able to consider whether there may be any reasonable prospect of defending the claim based on discrimination, disability, public law or public sector equality duty factors.</p>

<h3>Housing association tenants</h3>

<p>Most housing association tenants have an assured tenancy.</p>

<p>Some housing association tenants have assured shorthold tenancies. This will be the case if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are a new tenant with a starter tenancy</li>
  <li>you have a fixed term assured shorthold tenancy of at least 2 years</li>
  <li>your tenancy has been demoted because of anti-social behaviour</li>
</ul>

<p>If you live in supported housing your tenancy may be assured or it may be an assured shorthold.</p>

<p>Tenants with assured tenancies have greater rights to remain in their home than those with assured shorthold tenancies.</p>

<p>If you have been a housing association tenant since before 15 January 1989, it is likely that you will have a secure tenancy.  See the section on âSecure tenanciesâ above.</p>

<h4>Assured tenancies</h4>

<p>Assured tenancies are granted for an indefinite period with the rent being paid on a periodic basis, for example weekly or monthly.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 1: What to do when you are served with a notice of seeking possession under section 8 of the Housing Act 1988</strong></p>

<p>If you have an assured tenancy you can only be evicted if your landlord can prove to the court that certain legal reasons apply. These reasons are called grounds for possession. These include, for example, rent arrears, damage to the property and causing a nuisance to neighbours (anti-social behaviour).</p>

<p>The type of ground(s) which the landlord is using to evict you will affect how they are used court:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Grounds 1 to 8 are mandatory grounds. This means that the court will accept the landlordâs reasons for eviction if these can be proven.</li>
  <li>Grounds 9 to 17 are discretionary grounds. This means that your landlord will have to show the court that the grounds for possession are appropriate to the circumstances. The court will decide whether they accept your landlordâs grounds and whether they agree that is reasonable for the eviction to proceed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your landlord can use both mandatory and discretionary grounds. The court will look first at whether the mandatory grounds which your landlord has listed are valid. If these cannot be proven, the court will then look at the discretionary grounds in order to make a decision.</p>

<p>Your landlord must give you written notice that it intends to go to court to seek possession. This is called a Section 8 notice or a notice of seeking possession. You can receive a Section 8 notice at any time during your tenancy.</p>

<br><br>
<strong>In Wales</strong>
<br><br>
If your landlord gives you notice at any time on or after 29 September 2020 until at least 24 March 2022, the minimum period of notice you can be given is 6 months unless your landlord is seeking possession on grounds of anti-social behaviour and/or domestic violence in which case a notice period of one month or less may be given, depending on the type of tenancy and ground used.
<br><br>
If your landlord gave you notice from 26 March to 23 July 2020, the notice period should have been at least 3 months for all types of notice. If your landlord served you notice from the 24 July to 28 September 2020, the notice period should have been at least 6 months, other than for grounds relating to anti-social behaviour where a 3 monthsâ notice period applied.</p>
</div>

<p>If you do not move out and the landlord wishes to start possession proceedings, they must apply to court within a year of giving you the notice. If they donât, the notice will expire and the landlord cannot use it.</p>

<p><strong>When you receive a notice of seeking possession under section 8 of the Housing Act 1988:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Check that the landlord has given your section 8 notice correctly. The notice will not be valid if it doesnât include your name, the address of the property, the grounds for possession (why your landlord wants you to leave), and the date the notice ends.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Check that the landlord has given you the correct period of notice to leave.</strong> In England from 1 October 2021 all notice periods returned to their pre-pandemic lengths. See <a href="#annex-a-minimum-notice-period-lengths-for-tenancies-in-england" class="govuk-link">Annex A</a> for details of the new notice periods.</p>

    <p>In Wales, from 26 March until 23 July 2020, the minimum notice period was 3 months. From 24 July to 28 September 2020 the minimum notice period was 6 months, except for cases of anti-social behaviour where a 3 month notice period applied.  As from 29 September 2020 until at least 24 March 2022 the minimum notice period is 6 months except where your landlord is seeking possession on grounds of anti-social behaviour and/or domestic violence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Check that the reason for eviction your landlord gave in the section 8 notice are valid.</strong> The Section 8 notice should explain what grounds your landlord is using to evict you (numbered 1-17), and why the landlord is using the grounds for possession.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Contact your housing officer as soon as possible to discuss the situation.</strong> See whether you can reach an agreement about steps that you will take to let your landlords see that there is no need for them to take possession proceedings.</p>

<h4>Starter tenancies</h4>

<p>If you are a new housing association tenant, you may have a starter tenancy. This is a probationary, or trial, tenancy which allows your landlord to decide whether you are a good tenant. A starter tenancy is a type of assured shorthold tenancy. It usually lasts for 12 months but can be extended for a further 6 months, if there are problems such as rent arrears or anti-social behaviour in the first year.   At the end of the trial period your landlord may give you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an assured tenancy</li>
  <li>a fixed term assured shorthold tenancy of at least 2 years</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Stage 1: What to do when you are served with a notice requiring possession under section 21 of the Housing Act 1988</strong></p>

<p>During your starter tenancy you may be evicted if you break the rules of your tenancy, for example if have rent arrears, you have damaged the property, or you have caused a nuisance to neighbours (anti-social behaviour). 
Your landlord does not need a reason to evict you but they must follow the correct procedure.</p>

<p>Your landlord must give you a written notice that it intends to go to court to seek possession. This is a Section 21 notice and must be on the appropriate form (a Form 6A).  Your landlord cannot give you a Section 21 notice within the first 4 months of your tenancy.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to ask for a review of your landlordâs decision to evict you. Check your landlordâs policy, or ask your landlord directly if necessary. A review gives you the opportunity to say which you should be allowed to stay.  For example, you may be able to come to an arrangement to pay off any rent arrears.</p>

<p><strong>When you receive a section 21 notice</strong></p>

<p>You might be able to challenge your eviction and stay longer in your home but, in most cases, if a section 21 notice has been served and your landlord has followed the procedure correctly, your landlord will be entitled to possession. It is important to get legal advice about this. You and your adviser should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Check that the landlord has given you the required period of notice to leave. In England from 1 October 2021 all notice periods returned to their pre-pandemic lengths. This means that a Section 21 notice must provide at least two monthâs notice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Longer notice periods were introduced due to coronavirus (COVID-19). In England, from 26 March 2020 to 28 August 2020, the minimum notice period was 3 months, from 29 August 2020 until 31 May 2021 the minimum notice period was 6 months, and from 1 June 2021 the minimum notice period was 4 months.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Wales, as from 26 March 2020 until 23 July 2020, the minimum notice period was 3 months, and as from 24 July 2020 until at least 24 March 2022 the minimum notice period is 6 months.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Check that the landlord has given the correct notice and included all of the required information.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Check that the review was carried out correctly.</strong> The court may refuse to grant possession if your landlord failed to carry out a review which you asked for within the time limits, or if the decision on the review is wrong in law.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Your legal adviser will also be able to consider whether there may be any reasonable prospect of defending the claim based on discrimination, disability, public law or public sector equality duty factors.</p>

<h4>Assured shorthold tenancies for a fixed term of 2 years or more (applies to England only)</h4>

<p>You may have a fixed term assured shorthold tenancy. Since 1 April 2012, some housing associations landlords give new tenants fixed term assured shorthold tenancies instead of assured tenancies. These tenancies are usually for at least 5 years, but may be for a minimum of 2 years in exceptional circumstances.  You may have been given a starter tenancy beforehand. Your landlord must have a policy setting out the circumstances in which it will grant different types of tenancies.</p>

<p>At the end of the fixed term, your landlord may decide to grant a further fixed term tenancy, an assured tenancy, or ask you to leave.  If your landlord does not take any action, either to give you a new tenancy or to ask you to leave, your tenancy will become a statutory periodic assured shorthold tenancy which will have all the same terms as your previous fixed term tenancy.</p>

<p>Your landlord must give you notice in a certain way if you have a fixed-term assured shorthold tenancy of 2 years or more. The type of notice that you are given will depend on whether the landlord asks you to leave during the fixed term or at the end of the fixed term.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 1: What to do when you are served with a notice of seeking possession under section 8 of the Housing Act 1988</strong></p>

<p>During the fixed term, your landlord can only evict you for certain reasons. These reasons are called grounds for possession. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rent arrears</li>
  <li>damage to the property</li>
  <li>causing a nuisance to neighbours (anti-social behaviour)</li>
</ul>

<p>Your landlord must give you written notice that it intends to go to court to seek possession. This is called a Section 8 notice. You can receive a Section 8 notice at any time during your tenancy.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Due to coronavirus (COVID-19) there have been alterations to the length of notice periods when serving notices in England and Wales, since 26 March 2020:</strong>

<p><strong>Stage 1: What to do when you are served with a notice requiring possession under section 21 Housing Act 1988</strong></p>

<p>At the end of the fixed term, your landlord may decide to take possession of the property, rather than to grant you a further tenancy.</p>

<p>Your landlord does not need a legal reason (ground) to obtain possession.  As long as they have given you the correct notices, they can apply to the court for a possession order if you do not leave by the date your landlord has asked you to.</p>

<p>If your landlord asks you to leave at the end of the fixed term, they will serve you with a Section 21 notice. This must be on the appropriate form (a Form 6A).You cannot be served with a Section 21 notice any earlier than 2 months before the end of your fixed term.</p>

<p>In addition to serving a valid Section 21 notice, your landlord must give you written  notice not less than 6 months before the end of the fixed term stating that the landlord does not propose to grant you another tenancy. The notice must inform you how to obtain help or advice on the notice.</p>

<p>There is no statutory right of review of the landlordâs decision not to grant another tenancy, but you may be entitled to a review under your landlordâs policies.  Your landlord should inform you if you can ask for a review.</p>

<p><strong>When you receive a Section 21 notice</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Check if the notice informing you that the landlord does not propose to grant another tenancy is valid.</strong> Check that you have received the notice no later than the end of the fixed term of your tenancy and that the information in it is correct.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Check that the landlord has given you the required period of notice to leave.</strong> In England from 1 October 2021 all notice periods returned to their pre-pandemic lengths. This means that a Section 21 notice must provide at least two monthâs notice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Longer notice periods were introduced due to coronavirus (COVID-19). In England, from 26 March 2020 to 28 August 2020, the minimum notice period was 3 months, from 29 August 2020 until 31 May 2021 the minimum notice period was 6 months, and from 1 June to 30 September the minimum notice period was 4 months.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Check if the Section 21 notice is valid.</strong> When you receive a Section 21 notice, you can check that the notice is valid.  You should seek help from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://england.shelter.org.uk/get_help" rel="external">Shelter</a> or <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/">Citizens Advice</a> if you are unsure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Consider seeking legal advice.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To serve a valid Section 21 notice, the landlord must have completed the following steps, although not all of these will be relevant to every tenancy (a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/evicting-tenants/section-21-and-section-8-notices/" class="govuk-link">guide to these is available</a>.</p>

<p>Your landlord must have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Given you 4 monthsâ notice to leave</strong> if your landlord gave you notice at any time on or after 1 June 2021 up until 30 September 2021. This is because of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Given you 6 monthsâ notice to leave</strong> if your landlord gave you notice at any time on or after 29 August 2020 up until 31 May 2021. This is because of coronavirus (COVID-19)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Given you 3 monthsâ notice to leave</strong> if your landlord gave you notice at any time on or after the 26 March up until 28 August 2020. This is because of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Used Form 6A when giving notice.</strong> If your tenancy started after 1 October 2015 your section 21 notice will only be valid if your landlord used the right version of Form 6A (or otherwise provided in writing all of the information required by that form).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Started court proceedings in time.</strong> Your landlord must generally have made a claim for possession in the court within 10 months of giving you the notice, if they gave you the notice  between 29 August 2020 and 31 May 2021.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your landlord must generally have made a claim for possession in the court within 8 months of giving you the notice, if they gave you the notice on or after 1 June.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they gave you the notice before 28 August 2020, they must have made a claim for possession in the court within six months of giving you the notice. However, if your tenancy is a periodic tenancy under which more than 6 monthsâ notice is required, your landlord can make the claim up to 4 months after the date specified in the notice as the date after which you must leave the property. You should note that landlords could still make claims while the stay on possession proceedings was ongoing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Provided you at the start of the tenancy with</strong> a valid gas safety certificate, if there is a gas installation in in the property, and an energy performance certificate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Given you the notice not sooner than 4 months after your (first) tenancy of the property started.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you have complained about the condition of the property,</strong> and your local authority has inspected and served an improvement notice or notice of emergency remedial action, your landlord cannot use a section 21 eviction for 6 months and must complete the repairs.</p>

<h2>Stage 2: If you stay in your home after the notice expires</h2>

<p>Social housing tenants usually choose to stay in their home after the notice expires as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They may be able to come to an agreement with the landlord and the landlord may decide not to issue possession proceedings.</li>
  <li>They may have a defence to the claim for possession which they can put forward to the court.</li>
  <li>If the claim for possession is based on discretionary grounds, even if a judge finds that the landlord has established the ground, the judge may decide to suspend the possession order to give the tenant an opportunity to keep the tenancy.</li>
</ul>

<p>In cases where the landlord is known to be entitled to possession, however, e.g. because you are assured shorthold tenant of a housing association or you are a local authority tenant with an introductory tenancy or a flexible tenancy which has expired, you may want to return the property to avoid legal proceedings and becoming liable for your landlordâs court costs.  Your landlord may also be prepared to write off arrears if you leave by agreement.</p>

<p>Before moving out, always:</p>

<ul>
  <li>obtain legal advice so that you are clear about the legal position</li>
  <li>consider making a homelessness application to your local authority, especially if you have children or you, or a household member, suffers from a disability - the local authority may advise you to stay put for it to be able to help you</li>
  <li>inform your landlord and return the keys</li>
</ul>

<h3>Claims for possession started before 3 August 2020</h3>

<p>If your landlord applied for possession before 3 August 2020, they must make an application to the court if they want to continue with the claim. You will receive a copy of their application. If you want to challenge your landlordâs application, you will receive instructions from the court on how to do this.</p>

<p>The court will send you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>copies of the landlordâs claim documents</li>
  <li>a copy of the landlordâs Covid Notice to the court about the effects of the pandemic</li>
  <li>a defence form for you to complete</li>
</ul>

<p>The landlord may use the standard possession procedure, in which a court hearing will take place. If this is the case, you will receive any further direction with regard to the court hearing, the address of the court where the case will be heard, and the date of the court hearing.</p>

<p>You can find the contact details for the court at which your hearing is being held at on the <a rel="external" href="https://courttribunalfinder.service.gov.uk/search/address" class="govuk-link">Court and tribunal finder website</a>.</p>

<p>The court will also send you details about how to obtain free advice on your circumstances, if you have not already done so. We would strongly advise that you take advantage of this opportunity to obtain advice and assistance.</p>

<p>Court hearings for possession are usually held in the county court that covers the area where your home is.</p>

<p>You should let the court know as soon as possible if you have any special requirements, for example if you need extra assistance to access the building.</p>

<p>Before attending court, it is important that you check the website on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/what-to-expect-coming-to-a-court-or-tribunal" class="govuk-link">what to expect when coming to a court or tribunal</a>. This contains information about the additional measures which are in place during the coronavirus pandemic, including details about when you should avoid attending court in order to prevent the spread of the virus.</p>

<p>If your landlord is a housing association and you have an assured shorthold tenancy, your landlord may use the courtâs accelerated procedure to claim possession. If that happens, there will only be a hearing if the judge considers that the legal position requires clarification, or if the judge considers that you may need extra time (up to a maximum of 6 weeks) to move out due to extreme hardship.</p>

<h3>The defence form</h3>

<p>The court will provide you with instructions on how you can get advice about defending the possession claim.</p>

<p>The defence form enables you to contest the landlordâs claim for possession because they have not followed the correct procedures in evicting you and/or the reasons the landlord provides for the eviction (where applicable) are not valid, for example, if you have paid off any rent arrears which you previously owed.</p>

<p>If you have difficulty filling in the form which has been sent to you, you can send the court a short statement explaining your circumstances, including any difficulties which you have faced as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, and why a possession order should not be made.</p>

<p>The possession process which the landlord uses will affect how you can defend your case, based on your circumstances.  Your landlord may not have to provide a reason to evict you.</p>

<p>Some of the situations in which you may wish to challenge a possession claim are set out in the possession notice section above. Your personal circumstances may have changed since the notice was first issued, for example, and you may now be in a position to pay off rent arrears. If this is the case, you may wish to describe on the defence form how your circumstances have changed and why you feel that the landlord should no longer be able to obtain possession of your home.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, you may consider making a counterclaim. For example, a claim for compensation if repairs needed at the property were not carried out.</p>

<p>You need to return the defence form to the court as soon as possible. You can return your defence to the landlordâs claim at the email or postal addresses provided, or via Possession Claims Online.</p>

<p>It is important that you seek advice and return the defence form or a statement outlining your circumstances, to the court. This is because you may have to pay extra court fees if you do not provide information in the defence form and this results in a delay to your court case.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Important:</strong> If your landlord is a housing association and is using the accelerated possession process, the defence form may be your only opportunity to contest the landlordâs claim for possession.</p>
</div>

<h4>Defence forms and COVID-19</h4>

<p>When filling out the defence form, you can also tell the court whether your circumstances have been affected by COVID-19, and how this is relevant to the landlordâs possession claim.</p>

<p>For example, you may wish to record:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether there were arrears outstanding before March 2020</li>
  <li>whether you were placed on the governmentâs Coronavirus Job Retention (furlough) Scheme, and whether you have offered or paid a related proportion of rent</li>
  <li>whether you have obtained Universal Credit since March 2020, and whether you have offered or paid a related proportion of rent</li>
  <li>if you have been unable to earn by reason of COVID-19</li>
  <li>if you have been shielding, were asked to self-isolate by NHS Test, Track and Trace or if you were required to quarantine under travel restrictions</li>
  <li>what proposals you have to pay the rent</li>
</ul>

<p>Where relevant, it may be helpful to collate evidence, demonstrating how the coronavirus pandemic has affected your personal circumstances. This could include, for example, the letter you will have received from the NHS or your GP confirming you had clinically extremely vulnerable status, if applicable, or confirmation from your employer that you were placed on furlough. This may assist the judge when making a decision in your case. You should discuss this with your adviser.</p>

<p>Misleading the court is a criminal offence. You should only indicate that your case has been affected by COVID-19 if you have been affected by the pandemic in a way which is relevant to your landlordâs possession claim - principally, if this has affected your ability to pay your rent.</p>

<h4>How to seek advice on filling out your defence form</h4>

<p><strong>Legal aid</strong></p>

<p>You may qualify for legal aid to assist you in your case.  Legal aid can help meet the costs of legal advice, and representation in a court or tribunal. Legal aid may also protect you from paying your landlordâs court costs if you lose the case.</p>

<p>When you receive your defence form, you will receive a leaflet with information on how to apply for legal aid to help you to complete and file a defence.</p>

<p><strong>Other sources of advice</strong></p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/" class="govuk-link">Citizens Advice</a> may be able to help you with filling in forms and/or provide sessions with local solicitors free of charge.  <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://england.shelter.org.uk/get_help">Shelter</a> / <a rel="external" href="https://sheltercymru.org.uk/" class="govuk-link">Shelter Cymru</a> may also be able to provide you with advice and assistance free of charge.</p>

<h2>Stage 3: Before the hearing</h2>

<p>It is important that you follow the instructions provided in the papers sent to you by the court as their may be further directions.</p>

<p>Before the possession hearing, you should take the opportunity to seek legal advice on your case. Where possible and appropriate, you and your landlord should try to reach a settlement before the hearing; for example, you may wish to reach an agreement under which you can stay in your home as long as you repay any outstanding rent arrears through a monthly repayment plan. A legal adviser may be able to help you to reach a settlement with your landlord ahead of the court hearing.</p>

<p>Before the court hearing, you should receive a copy of all the documents relating to the case, including the landlordâs claim form and the Covid Notice, setting out what information they have on the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on you and your dependants. The landlord is required to submit this information when they make a claim. If you have not received these documents, you should let the duty advisor, or the judge, know on the day of the hearing.</p>

<p>If your landlord did not provide you with the correct information about the case before the hearing, the hearing may be adjourned until this has been provided. However, if the landlord can prove that they made reasonable attempts to serve you with the relevant documents relating to the case, the hearing may proceed.</p>

<h2>Stage 4: The possession hearing</h2>

<p>If you have not previously done so, it is important you take independent legal advice on your circumstances before you attend the substantive possession hearing. You should seek legal advice (for example, from  Shelter / Shelter Cymru or Citizens Advice) on how to proceed with your case. You will also have the opportunity to get advice from a duty solicitor on the day of the court hearing (see below).</p>

<p>At a county court possession hearing, a judge decides whether the landlord should be granted possession.</p>

<p>It is important that you attend the court hearing. This will enable the judge to hear from both your landlord and you. The hearing is for 15 minutes, with additional time between hearings for COVID-19 safety procedures. See more <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/what-to-expect-coming-to-a-court-or-tribunal" class="govuk-link">guidance on attending a court or tribunal</a>.</p>

<p>If you are attending the hearing in person, you should bring your hearing letter with your case number, which will help you to find where you need to go in the building. You should also bring any evidence you have to the hearing. This could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bank statements showing money in your bank account</li>
  <li>a letter about a new job or an increase in the hours you work</li>
  <li>a copy of your tenancy agreement</li>
  <li>where applicable, the letter you will have received from the NHS or your GP confirming you had clinically extremely vulnerable status, or confirmation from your employer that you were placed on furlough</li>
</ul>

<p>You and your landlord can attend the hearing. You can both bring people to help represent you, such as a solicitor or adviser. If you do not attend your court hearing, it is very likely the judge will decide to award possession to the landlord.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Before attending court, it is important that you check the website on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/what-to-expect-coming-to-a-court-or-tribunal" class="govuk-link">what to expect when coming to a court or tribunal</a>. This contains information about the additional measures which are in place during the coronavirus pandemic, including details about when you should avoid attending court in order to prevent the spread of the virus.</p>
</div>

<h3>The Housing Possession Court Duty Scheme</h3>

<p>If you have not received advice before the hearing, you can get free legal advice and representation in court on the day of the hearing, through the Housing Possession Court Duty scheme. Contact the court where your case is being heard.</p>

<p>If the scheme is not available in your area, check with the court whether there are other advice services on offer.</p>

<h3>At the court hearing</h3>

<p>Your case is heard by a judge who will make a decision based on the evidence provided by you and your landlord and on what the law says. Whilst they will consider all of the evidence that has been submitted, in certain circumstances the judge may have no or limited discretion to dismiss or adjourn the case if the claim has been made correctly and/or if the reason for applying for possession can be proven.</p>

<p>For <strong>local authority tenants</strong> this will be relevant for introductory, flexible and demoted tenancies, the section 83ZA ground, and grounds 9 to 15A of schedule 2 to 1985 Housing Act. For <strong>housing association tenants</strong> this will be relevant where a landlord has made a claim for possession using the section 21 process or is using the mandatory grounds under section 8.</p>

<p>When you go into the hearing room you will be told who will speak and when. You will be given time to ask any questions that you have and give evidence in your case. If you have a solicitor or barrister, they will ask questions for you. The judge may also ask you or your landlord questions. You can take notes to help you, but you must not take photos or videos.</p>

<p>At the court hearing the judge might:</p>

<ul>
  <li>adjourn the hearing - it will be moved to a later date</li>
  <li>dismiss the landlordâs claim â the claim will have been unsuccessful for reasons which the judge should make clear</li>
  <li>make a possession order â which may either be âoutrightâ, âsuspendedâ or âpostponedâ, depending on the grounds on which the order is made and the circumstances of the case as assessed by the judge. This may ultimately mean you have to leave your home.</li>
</ul>

<p>The judge may adjourn the case if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the judge decides that there is insufficient time to hear the case on the day</li>
  <li>the judge decides that more information is needed</li>
  <li>the tenant is unable to attend court for valid reasons e.g. a hospital admission</li>
</ul>

<p>The judge may dismiss the case if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the landlord has not followed the correct procedure</li>
  <li>the landlordâs housing officer or legal representative does not attend the hearing</li>
  <li>the judge decides that the grounds for possession have not been proved</li>
  <li>you have paid any rent that was owed</li>
</ul>

<p>You can stay in your property if the judge dismisses the case.  The landlord may be ordered to pay your legal costs.  Depending on the reason for dismissal, the landlord may be able to continue to seek possession, but would have to start a fresh court process.</p>

<h3>Possession Orders</h3>

<p>The judge can make different kinds of possession order.</p>

<h4>Outright possession order</h4>

<p>This form of order requires you to leave your property by a date specified in the order â the deadline for leaving is midnight on the specified date unless stated otherwise within the order.</p>

<p>The date will usually be 14 to 28 days after the court hearing, although it could be shorter or longer, up to a maximum of 6 weeks in cases where the judge considers that your situation is one of extreme hardship.</p>

<p>If you do not leave your property on or before the date given in the order, the landlord can request the court to issue a warrant of possession under which the court bailiff will carry out an eviction.</p>

<h4>Suspended possession order</h4>

<p>This form of order specifies a date for possession, but it also sets out conditions which you must abide by.  For example, a condition might be that you pay the rent plus a stated amount towards the arrears each month. So long as you keep to the conditions, the landlord will not be able to evict you. If you breach the conditions, the landlord can request the court to issue a warrant of possession and the court bailiff will then arrange to carry out an eviction.</p>

<h4>Postponed possession order</h4>

<p>Postponed possession orders do not include a specific date for when you must leave the property. If you breach the terms of a postponed possession order, the landlord can make an application to the court to get a fixed eviction date. The court decides whether there will be another hearing.</p>

<h4>Possession orders with a money judgment</h4>

<p>A judge can add a money judgment to any of the possession orders. This means you will owe a specific amount of money under the order.  The amount is usually made up of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the rent arrears</li>
  <li>court fees</li>
  <li>your landlordâs legal costs</li>
</ul>

<p>The money judgment will not be enforceable against you so long as you pay your arrears and the amount set out in a suspended possession order.</p>

<p>However, if you do not pay, the landlord can apply to enforce the possession order and the money judgement. This means that the landlord can ask county court bailiffs to evict you from your home (see below), and also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/respond-to-court-claim-for-money">recover the money owed in a separate court process</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In England and in Wales, legislation which restricted bailiff enforcement of evictions, has now been lifted. This was in place in England fromâ¯17 November 2020 untilâ¯31 May 2021 and in Wales from 11 December 2020 until 30 June 2021. Therefore, orders can now be enforced whereâ¯the landlord has a valid warrant of possession. However, bailiffs must provide 14 daysâ notice of an eviction and have been asked not to carry out an eviction if they are made aware that anyone living in the property has COVID-19 symptoms or is self-isolating.</p>

<h3>Appealing against the decision</h3>

<p>You may be able to appeal to a higher court if the county court judge made mistakes in the possession hearing.  If you think this is the case at the end of the hearing, you should ask the judge for the reasons for the decision made and for permission to appeal.  If the judge gives you permission, or if you continue to be concerned, you should seek legal advice urgently.  Any appeal must usually be made no more than 21 days after the date of the order complained of.  A solicitor who specialises in housing should be able to advise you whether you have grounds for an appeal and whether it is worth pursuing. You will have to pay a court fee of up to Â£151 for bringing an appeal, unless you qualify for help.</p>

<h2>Stage 5: Warrants of possession and bailiffs</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Important:</strong> It is strongly recommended that you do not wait until you are about to be evicted by bailiffs before seeking advice</p>
</div>

<p>If you remain in the property after the date specified in an outright possession order has passed, or if you have breached the conditions of a suspended possession order, the landlord can apply for a warrant of possession.</p>

<p>When the court issues a warrant of possession, you will be sent an eviction notice giving a date by when you must leave. If you do not leave, you will be evicted by a county court bailiff or High Court Enforcement Officer.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>In England and in Wales, legislation which restricted bailiff enforcement of evictions, has now been lifted. This wasâ¯in place in Englandâ¯fromâ¯17â¯November 2020â¯untilâ¯31 May 2021 and in Wales from 11 December 2020 until 30 June 2021. Therefore, orders can now be enforced whereâ¯the landlord has a valid warrant of possession.However, bailiffs must provide 14 daysâ notice of an eviction and have been asked not to carry out an eviction if they are made aware that anyone living in the property has COVID-19 symptoms or is self-isolating.</p>
</div>

<h4>Possession orders</h4>

<p>A date for the eviction will be scheduled with a minimum of 14 daysâ notice. You may be able to apply to suspend the eviction (see below âIf the landlord makes an application to proceed with an eviction).â¯</p>

<p>â¯A notice of eviction formâ¯(form N54) will be delivered to your addressâ¯at leastâ¯14 days before the repossessionâ¯(eviction)â¯is due to take place.â¯â¯ â¯â¯</p>

<p>However, in both England and Wales bailiffs will not carry out an eviction ifâ¯they are made aware thatâ¯you or anyone you live with has coronavirus symptoms, has tested positive for COVID-19 or are waiting for a test result, has been instructed by the NHS to self-isolate (including if you are quarantining in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england">international travel rules</a>). â¯If this applies to you,â¯youâ¯should inform the bailiff using the contact details provided on the N54 Notice of Eviction. You should explain when the symptoms started and/or how long the period of self-isolation will last. The eviction will be rescheduled with a minimum of 14 daysâ notice.</p>

<p>The bailiff will follow the latest public health guidance issued at the time of the eviction. They will conduct the eviction using Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and maintain social distancing. They should ask if anybody in the household has symptoms or is self-isolating (including if they are quarantining in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england">international travel rules</a>). If that is the case, or if the enforcement agent observes any visible symptoms of Covid-19, then they can withdraw from the property at their own discretion. The eviction will be rescheduled with a minimum of 14 days notice.</p>

<p>In some circumstances you may be able to prevent or delay an eviction by a county court bailiff. You can apply to suspend a warrant of possession by filling in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-n244-application-notice" class="govuk-link">Form N244</a>. This will cost Â£14, unless you qualify for help.</p>

<p>There will be a new hearing, at which the judge may delay the eviction or let you stay in your home if you can make payments again. However, the judge will not automatically agree to suspend the warrant.</p>

<p>The circumstances in which a warrant of possession may be suspended include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>If you couldnât attend the original court hearing</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You can apply for the court decision to be set aside if you:</p>

<p>(a)	had a good reason for missing the court hearing
(b)	applied to have the order set aside as soon as you knew that the court had made a possession order, and 
(c)	would have had a good chance of persuading the court not to make the possession order if you had attended.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>If suspending the bailiffâs warrant is reasonable</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If you are being evicted on a discretionary ground, the court can suspend the bailiffâs warrant if they decide it is reasonable to do so.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>If your landlord agrees to let you stay</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If, after discussion with your landlord they decide not to pursue the eviction and let you stay in your home, you can ask them to withdraw their application for a warrant of possession.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>If you got a Section 21 notice but there was no court hearing</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The court may cancel a possession order if the landlord used accelerated possession proceedings, and served an invalid section 21 notice.</p>

<h2>Annex C: Pre-Action Protocol</h2>

<h3>Information</h3>

<p>The protocol requires that the landlord should take reasonable steps to ensure that the tenant understands any information provided. The landlord should be able to demonstrate what steps have been taken to this effect.</p>

<p>If the landlord is aware that the tenant is particularly vulnerable, the landlord should consider at an early stage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether the tenant has the necessary mental capacity to defend a possession claim and, where appropriate, apply to appoint a litigation friend under Part 21 of the Civil Procedure Rules</li>
  <li>whether there are any discrimination issues under the Equality Act 2010</li>
  <li>if the landlord is a local authority, whether there is a need for a community care assessment.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rent arrears</h3>

<h4>Initial contact</h4>

<p>The protocol advises landlords, as soon as possible after the tenant falls in rent arrears, and before serving a notice of seeking possession, to do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the tenant to discuss the reason for the arrears, the tenantâs financial circumstances, any entitlement to benefits, and repayment of the arrears</li>
  <li>try to agree with the tenant an affordable arrangement for paying the arrears with any arrangement to be confirmed in writing</li>
  <li>provide quarterly rent statements showing rent outstanding and paid in the last 13 weeks</li>
  <li>assist the tenant with any claim for benefits, including housing benefit, the housing element of universal credit, and/or discretionary housing payments</li>
  <li>if the tenant meets the criteria, arrange for direct payments of arrears to be made to the landlord from the tenantâs benefits</li>
  <li>not start possession proceedings when the tenant has provided all the necessary evidence to support a benefit claim, there is a reasonable expectation that the tenant will be entitled, and the tenant has paid other sums due that are not covered by benefits.</li>
  <li>establish effective liaison with the benefit department and/or the Department for Work and Pensions.</li>
  <li>advise the tenant to seek independent advice, recognising that the tenant may have a general debt problem</li>
</ul>

<h4>After service of notice</h4>

<p>After serving the statutory notice of seeking possession, and before issuing possession proceedings, landlords should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make reasonable efforts to contact the tenant to discuss: the amount and cause of the arrears, repayment of the arrears, and the position regarding benefits. The landlords should send to the tenant a copy of the protocol</li>
  <li>agree to postpone the court proceedings for as long as the tenant is complying with an agreement to pay current rent plus an amount towards the arrears</li>
  <li>warn the tenant who has stopped complying with a repayment agreement of the intention to bring possession proceeding, giving clear time limits within which to comply</li>
</ul>

<h4>Alternative dispute resolution</h4>

<p>The protocol advises parties to consider whether it is possible to resolve the issues by discussion and negotiation without recourse to the courts, and advises that they may be required to provide evidence that they have considered alternative means of resolving the dispute.</p>

<h4>Court proceedings</h4>

<p>Not less than ten days before the court hearing, landlords must provide the tenant with an up-to-date rent statement, and disclose to the tenant what information they have about her/his housing benefit or universal credit position.</p>

<p>Landlords should also inform the tenant of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the date and time of the court hearing</li>
  <li>the order they will apply for</li>
  <li>the need to attend the hearing</li>
</ul>

<p>If after issuing proceedings the tenant has been complying with an agreement to pay, landlords should agree to an adjournment, as long as the tenant sticks to the agreement. If the tenant subsequently fails to comply, landlords should advise the tenant that they intend to go back to court, providing clear time limits for compliance.</p>

<h3>Claim on mandatory grounds</h3>

<p>In cases where the court must grant possession if the landlord proves the case, before issuing any possession claim landlords should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>write to the tenants/occupiers explaining why they currently intend to seek possession and ask them to notify the landlord in writing of any personal circumstances or other matters which they wish to be taken into account, giving clear time limits for responses - such a letter could accompany any notice to quit; and</li>
  <li>consider any representations received, and if they decide to proceed with a claim for possession give brief written reasons for doing so.</li>
</ul>

<p>If they decide to proceed with the possession claim, landlords should include in the particulars of claim, or in any witness statement, a schedule giving a summary of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether they have (by statutory review procedure or otherwise) invited the tenants/occupiers to disclose any personal circumstances or other matters which they wish to be taken into account before they issue possession proceedings</li>
  <li>whether they have considered any representations made by the tenants/occupiers</li>
  <li>why they are bringing possession proceedings, and</li>
  <li>any relevant documents (attaching copies) which they wish the court to consider in relation to the proportionality of their decision to bring proceedings</li>
</ul>
