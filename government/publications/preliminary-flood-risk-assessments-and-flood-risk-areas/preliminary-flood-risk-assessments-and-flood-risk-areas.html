<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Preliminary flood risk assessments and flood risk areas</h2>

<p>Preparing preliminary flood risk assessments and flood risk area maps is the first stage in a 6 year planning cycle to manage flood risk.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Preliminary flood risk assessments (<abbr title="preliminary flood risk assessments">PFRAs</abbr>)</h3>

<p>A <abbr title="preliminary flood risk assessment">PFRA</abbr> is an assessment of floods that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have taken place in the past</li>
  <li>could take place in the future</li>
</ul>

<p>The Environment Agency and lead local flood authorities (<abbr title="lead local flood authorities">LLFAs</abbr>) use <abbr title="preliminary flood risk assessments">PFRAs</abbr> to identify areas that are at risk of flooding. These areas are called flood risk areas (FRAs).</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="preliminary flood risk assessment">PFRA</abbr> for main rivers, the sea and reservoirs</h4>

<p>The Environment Agency is responsible for the <abbr title="preliminary flood risk assessment">PFRA</abbr> and identifying flood risk areas in England for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>main rivers</li>
  <li>the sea</li>
  <li>reservoirs</li>
</ul>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/preliminary-flood-risk-assessment-for-england"><abbr title="preliminary flood risk assessment">PFRA</abbr> report for main rivers, sea and reservoirs in England</a>.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="preliminary flood risk assessments">PFRAs</abbr> for local sources of flood risk</h4>

<p><abbr title="lead local flood authorities">LLFAs</abbr> are responsible for the <abbr title="preliminary flood risk assessment">PFRA</abbr> and identifying FRAs for local sources of flood risk in their administrative areas. Local sources of flood risk are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>surface water</li>
  <li>groundwater</li>
  <li>small watercourses</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 152 <abbr title="lead local flood authorities">LLFAs</abbr> in England. Their <abbr title="preliminary flood risk assessments">PFRAs</abbr> are grouped by river basin district.</p>

<p>See a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/river-basin-district-map">map of the river basin districts</a>.</p>

<h5>Solway Tweed River Basin District <abbr title="lead local flood authority">LLFA</abbr> <abbr title="preliminary flood risk assessments">PFRAs</abbr>
</h5>

<p>Most of the Solway Tweed River Basin District is in Scotland.</p>

<p>You can find information about flood risk planning in Scotland on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sepa.org.uk/environment/water/flooding/developing-our-knowledge/" rel="external">SEPA website</a>.</p>

<p>The English parts of the Solway Tweed River Basin District are the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eden, Waver and Wampool catchments, which drain into the Solway Firth</li>
  <li>River Till in the River Tweed catchment</li>
</ul>

<p>Information on these areas is included in the <abbr title="lead local flood authority">LLFA</abbr> <abbr title="preliminary flood risk assessments">PFRAs</abbr> for:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Flood risk areas</h3>

<p>The Environment Agency identified flood risk areas for rivers and the sea. We do this by using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/preliminary-flood-risk-assessment-for-england">preliminary flood risk assessment published in 2018</a>.  <abbr title="lead local flood authorities">LLFAs</abbr> identify FRAs for local sources of flood risk through their <abbr title="preliminary flood risk assessments">PFRAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="preliminary flood risk assessment">PFRA</abbr> shows the potential risk of flooding from rivers and the sea, and surface water for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>people</li>
  <li>the economy</li>
  <li>the environment, including cultural heritage</li>
</ul>

<p>For each flood risk area, the Environment Agency or <abbr title="lead local flood authority">LLFA</abbr> must prepare:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a flood hazard map and a flood risk map</li>
  <li>a flood risk management plan (<abbr title="flood risk management plan">FRMP</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Mapping flood hazard and risk</h2>

<p>Flood hazard maps show the probability or likelihood of flooding occurring in a location.</p>

<p>View the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-long-term-flood-risk">long term flood risk information</a> to see the likelihood of flooding in a particular area or postcode.</p>

<p>Flood risk maps show what is potentially at risk of flooding such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>people</li>
  <li>the economy</li>
  <li>the environment, including cultural heritage</li>
</ul>

<p>The Environment Agency and <abbr title="lead local flood authorities">LLFAs</abbr> use the flood hazard maps and flood risk maps to prepare the flood risk management plans (<abbr title="flood risk management plans">FRMPs</abbr>). The maps must be reviewed and updated every 6 years.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/river-basin-districts-flood-risk-maps">flood risk maps published in 2013</a> were used to prepare the <abbr title="flood risk management plans">FRMPs</abbr> from 2015 to 2021.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/flood-risk-maps-2019">flood risk maps published in 2019</a> will be used to prepare the <abbr title="flood risk management plans">FRMPs</abbr> from 2021 to 2027.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Flood risk management plans</h2>

<p><abbr title="flood risk management plans">FRMPs</abbr> set out how organisations, stakeholders and communities will work together to manage flood risk. They explain the risk of flooding from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rivers</li>
  <li>the sea</li>
  <li>surface water</li>
  <li>groundwater</li>
  <li>reservoirs</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<abbr title="flood risk management plans">FRMPs</abbr>: 2015 to 2021</h3>

<p>Following a public consultation, the Environment Agency published the first <abbr title="flood risk management plans">FRMPs</abbr> in March 2016. They describe actions to manage flood risk across England between 2015 and 2021.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/flood-risk-management-plans-frmps-2015-to-2021"><abbr title="flood risk management plans">FRMPs</abbr>: 2015 to 2021</a>.</p>

<h3>Updating <abbr title="flood risk management plans">FRMPs</abbr>
</h3>

<p><abbr title="flood risk management plans">FRMPs</abbr> must be reviewed by the environment Agency and <abbr title="lead local flood authorities">LLFAs</abbr> every 6 years. This is a requirement of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/3042/contents/made" rel="external">Flood Risk Regulations 2009</a></p>

<p>A 3-month public consultation on the draft <abbr title="flood risk management plans">FRMPs</abbr> for 2021 to 2027 ran from 22 October 2021 to 21 January 2022.</p>

<p>Following a review of the consultation responses, we produced a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/draft-flood-risk-management-plans-frmps-2021-to-2027">summary of responses</a></p>

<p>Responders had the option to indicate whether they would agree to their consultation response being published. All responses we have permission to publish are now available to view on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.environment-agency.gov.uk/fcrm/draft-second-cycle-flood-risk-management-plans/" rel="external">another website</a>.</p>

<h3>Next steps</h3>

<p>Responses received will now be analysed further to:
* identify actions to take as result of the consultation
* implement any changes needed in the <abbr title="flood risk management plans">FRMPs</abbr> and to the associated Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA)</p>

<p>We are also producing the Habitats Regulations Assessment and the SEA Statement of Environmental Particulars. We will publish the final <abbr title="flood risk management plans">FRMPs</abbr> and accompanying materials in the autumn of 2022.</p>
