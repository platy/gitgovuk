<h2><span class="number">2	Cover </span></h2>

<p>2.1	If the Insured sustains a loss as a result of:</p>

<p>(a)	    the failure of the Buyer to pay any Sum Due under an Insured Contract for a period of [six] months after the Due Date; or</p>

<p>(b)	    any act or omission of the Buyer in breach of any other obligation under an Insured Contract which terminates, or results in the termination of, the Insured’s obligation to supply any Goods and/or Services; or</p>

<p>(i)  	act, decision or legislative or administrative measure of the government or courts of any country (including the non-renewal or cancellation of an export or import licence but excluding a refusal or failure to grant a United Kingdom export licence or other United Kingdom authorisation required as at the date of the Insured Contract for its performance); or</p>

<p>(ii) 	war, civil war, revolution, or insurrection</p>

<p>which, in either case, renders illegal or impossible the performance of any obligation under an Insured Contract,</p>

<p>UKEF will, subject to Clause 2.3 and 2.4 and the other provisions of this Policy, pay to the Insured the Insured Percentage of the amount determined in accordance with Clause 3.</p>

<p>2.2	The period of [six] months in Clause 2.1(a) shall be reduced so as to expire on the date of any intervening court order falling within Clause 2.1(c), or the provision of evidence satisfactory to UKEF of the insolvency of the Buyer, which prevents the Buyer from paying the Sum Due.</p>

<p>2.3	As regards Clause 2.1(a), where a dispute exists between the Buyer and the Insured concerning or affecting the Buyer’s obligation to pay the sum in question (including one involving any set-off or cross-claim), UKEF shall (unless and to the extent that it may otherwise agree in writing) have no liability unless and in so far as the Insured has obtained (at its own expense and risk) an Arbitration Award or Judgment determining that the Buyer is obliged to pay the sum and is not justified in refusing or failing to do so.</p>

<p>2.4	As regards Clause 2.1(b), UKEF shall (unless and to the extent that it may otherwise agree in writing) have no liability unless and in so far as the Insured has obtained (at its own expense and risk) an Arbitration Award or Judgment determining that the act or omission in question occurred and constituted a breach of an obligation under the relevant Insured Contract.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3 Amount </span> of indemnifiable loss</h2>

<p>3.1 	In respect of any loss sustained by the Insured as a direct result of any failure referred to in Clause 2.1(a) UKEF will, subject to Clause 3.6, pay the Insured Percentage of the amount of any Sum Due remaining unpaid by the Buyer, a Surety or any third person.</p>

<p>(a)	    any costs which the Insured has incurred wholly and necessarily for the purpose of supplying any Goods and/or Services which, in consequence, it has not supplied, such amount not to be in excess of the amount which would have been payable by the Buyer under the Insured Contract in respect of those Goods and/or Services, less:</p>

<p>(b)	    any advance payment paid or accrued payable which is attributable to such Goods and/or Services (other than that which the Insured returns to the Buyer under the terms of the Insured Contract, as a result of the non-renewal or cancellation of any United Kingdom export licence or other authorisation required for the supply to the Buyer of the Goods and/or Services), and</p>

<p>(c)	    the value of any Goods and/or Services available for resale and any other benefit which the Insured may have received by not supplying such Goods and/or Services.</p>

<p>3.3	Upon receipt of any amount from the Buyer which is not appropriated to a specific debt the Insured will apply such amount in the following order of priority in or towards satisfaction of the following:</p>

<p>(a)	    any Sum Due which forms the subject of a claim under this Policy; 
(b)	    any other Sum Due under the Insured Contract; 
(c)	    any other amount payable, but not then due, under the Insured Contract;
and the Sum Due remaining unpaid shall be calculated on the basis that such application has been made, whether or not that is the case.</p>

<p>3.4	Regardless of any act or legislation of any country other than the United Kingdom, any payment in a currency other than that specified by the Contract shall not be considered as payment for the purposes of this Policy unless, and to the extent that, it is accepted by the Insured.</p>

<p>3.5	For the avoidance of doubt, UKEF shall be under no obligation to make any payment whose purpose is or whose effect would be to reimburse or indemnify the Insured in respect of any legal costs expended on or incurred or occasioned by obtaining or attempting to obtain any Arbitration Award or Judgment referred to in Clause 2.3 or 2.4.</p>

<p>3.6	The aggregate amount payable by UKEF under this Policy shall in no circumstances exceed the Maximum Liability.</p>
