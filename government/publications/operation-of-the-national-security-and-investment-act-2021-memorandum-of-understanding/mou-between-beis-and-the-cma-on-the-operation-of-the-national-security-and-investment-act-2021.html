<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The National Security and Investment Act 2021 (<abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21) will operate alongside a number of other statutory and regulatory regimes. It is likely that some acquisitions being assessed by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>) may also be scrutinised by the Competition and Markets Authority (<abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>) under its powers in Part 3 of the Enterprise Act 2002 (<abbr title="Enterprise Act">EA</abbr> 02).</p>

<p>This Memorandum of Understanding (<abbr title="Memorandum of understanding">MoU</abbr>) establishes a framework for cooperation, coordination and information sharing in the operation of the <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21 between the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>, collectively referred to as “the parties” throughout this document.</p>

<p>This <abbr title="Memorandum of understanding">MoU</abbr> sets out the legal framework and broad principles for collaboration on the timing of investigations, interim measures, remedies and the sharing of relevant information between the parties. The shared aims of this <abbr title="Memorandum of understanding">MoU</abbr> are to enable closer working between the parties to assist them in effectively discharging their respective regulatory functions.</p>

<p>This <abbr title="Memorandum of understanding">MoU</abbr> is a statement of intent which will guide and be taken into account by the relevant staff and does not give rise to legally binding obligations on the part of either the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> or <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>. The arrangements set out in this <abbr title="Memorandum of understanding">MoU</abbr> are subject to what is required or permitted by law.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Under the <abbr title="Enterprise Act">EA</abbr> 02, the Secretary of State has powers to intervene in mergers and acquisitions that raise public interest concerns in relation to national security, stability of the UK financial system and public health emergencies. The power to intervene in relation to media plurality is exercised by the <abbr title="Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport">DCMS</abbr> Secretary of State. The national security public interest consideration will be removed from the <abbr title="Enterprise Act">EA</abbr> 02 at the commencement of the <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21 creating two distinct regimes, one focusing on national security concerns, the other, under the <abbr title="Enterprise Act">EA</abbr> 02, covering competition and non-national security public interest considerations.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21 gained Royal Assent on the 29 April 2021 and will come into force on 4 January 2022. The <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21 modernises government’s powers to investigate and intervene in potentially hostile foreign direct investment, while advancing the UK’s world-leading reputation as an attractive place to invest.  </p>

<h2>The role and function of the Investment Security Unit (<abbr title="Investment Security Unit">ISU</abbr>)</h2>

<p>The Investment Security Unit (<abbr title="Investment Security Unit">ISU</abbr>) sits within <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> and is responsible for the operation of the <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Investment Security Unit">ISU</abbr> will be responsible for coordinating cross-government investment screening activity and for the end-to-end management of national security risks arising from domestic and international economic interactions. The <abbr title="Investment Security Unit">ISU</abbr> will make use of existing expertise within all relevant organisations, including specific sector teams. The <abbr title="Investment Security Unit">ISU</abbr> will draw on input from relevant teams to inform recommendations to the Secretary of State. </p>

<h2>The role and function of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> is a non-ministerial department, established under the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> works to promote competition for the benefit of consumers, both within and outside the UK, to make markets work well for consumers, businesses and the economy. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>

<p>The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>’s statutory responsibilities, in so far as relevant to the matters that are the subject of this <abbr title="Memorandum of understanding">MoU</abbr>, include the review of mergers under Part 3 of the <abbr title="Enterprise Act">EA</abbr> 02.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> has a duty to refer for an in-depth ‘phase 2’ investigation any relevant merger situation where it believes that it is or may be the case that the merger has resulted or may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition (<abbr title="substantial lessening of competition">SLC</abbr>) in a UK market. Following a reference for a phase 2 investigation, the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> conducts a more detailed analysis to determine whether: (i) there is a relevant merger situation falling within the UK merger control regime; (ii) that relevant merger situation has resulted, or may be expected to result, in an <abbr title="substantial lessening of competition">SLC</abbr>, and (iii) it should take action to remedy any <abbr title="substantial lessening of competition">SLC</abbr> identified.</p>

<p>Although the treatment of national security public interest matters has changed as a result of the <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21, public interest intervention grounds relating to media plurality, financial stability and public health emergencies remain under the <abbr title="Enterprise Act">EA</abbr> 02. This means that the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>’s merger control role may intersect with both the <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21 and the public interest intervention regime. This could involve processes concerning two directorates/units within <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> (national security and other public interest areas), but also the potential for a merger to be of interest to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> and a third government department, such as <abbr title="Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport">DCMS</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Principles of information sharing</h2>

<p>Section 54(1) <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21 empowers a public authority to disclose information to the Secretary of State for the purpose of facilitating the exercise by the Secretary of State of functions under <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21. Section 54(2)(a) empowers the Secretary of State to disclose information received under the <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21 for the purpose of facilitating the exercise by the Secretary of State of functions under the <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21.</p>

<p>Section 241 of the <abbr title="Enterprise Act">EA</abbr> 02 empowers public authorities to disclose information for the purpose of facilitating the exercise by the authority of any function it has under the Enterprise Act. Both parties have market monitoring capabilities, and it is not envisaged that either will rely on the other to identify transactions of interest to either statutory regime.</p>

<p>However, both parties may seek to share information on transactions being considered under the <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21 or the <abbr title="Enterprise Act">EA</abbr> 02, or both, to enable effective coordination and alignment by the authority of any function it has under the <abbr title="Enterprise Act">EA</abbr> 02 or <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21.</p>

<p>This <abbr title="Memorandum of understanding">MoU</abbr> sets out example circumstances in which the parties may consider disclosing information to each other, and the principles and processes which will typically be applicable. It may not always be appropriate to share information, such as for reasons of national security.</p>

<h3><abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr></h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> will continue to engage on an informal basis with <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> in relation to mergers which are notified to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> or which the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> becomes aware of which might be relevant to the <abbr title="Investment Security Unit">ISU</abbr>.</p>

<p>In addition, where the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> is informed that an acquisition has been called in by the <abbr title="Investment Security Unit">ISU</abbr>, it will endeavour, as soon as reasonably practicable and providing advance notice where it is able, to notify (and update, as appropriate) the <abbr title="Investment Security Unit">ISU</abbr> on the status of a particular merger. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the merger is called in by the Mergers Intelligence Committee or notified to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>when the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> intends to launch its Phase 1 investigation</li>
  <li>if the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> identifies potential competition concerns and intends to proceed to a case reference meeting (<abbr title="case reference meeting">CRM</abbr>)</li>
  <li>when the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> makes its Phase 1 decision</li>
  <li>if the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> launches a Phase 2 investigation</li>
  <li>when the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> issues its Phase 2 provisional findings and any notice of possible remedies</li>
  <li>when the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> makes its final Phase 2 decision, including on any remedies</li>
  <li>if the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> issues a notice of extension in relation to an investigation</li>
  <li>if the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> intends to accept undertakings at Phase 1 in lieu of a reference or if it intends to impose or accept remedies at Phase 2 to address competition concerns</li>
  <li>if the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> intends to issue an interim order and/or to take any steps under that order (eg whether to grant a derogation, appoint a monitoring trustee or issue directions)</li>
</ul>

<h3><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr></h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Investment Security Unit">ISU</abbr> will continue to engage on an informal basis with the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>, where appropriate, in relation to acquisitions which are notified to the <abbr title="Investment Security Unit">ISU</abbr> or which the <abbr title="Investment Security Unit">ISU</abbr> becomes aware of, which the <abbr title="Investment Security Unit">ISU</abbr> considers may be considered by the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> at the same time.</p>

<p>In addition, where the <abbr title="Investment Security Unit">ISU</abbr> is informed that an acquisition is being reviewed by the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>, it will endeavour, as soon as reasonably practicable and providing advance notice where it is able, to notify (and update, as appropriate) the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>of the status of the <abbr title="Investment Security Unit">ISU</abbr>’s investigation, including:
    <ul>
      <li>when the initial period begins and ends</li>
      <li>when the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> issues an additional period notice</li>
      <li>if the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> and the parties agree to an additional voluntary period</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>if the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> intends to issue an interim order and/or to take any steps under that order (e.g. to grant a derogation, appoint a monitoring trustee or issue directions)</li>
  <li>if the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> intends to impose remedies or accept undertakings</li>
  <li>if the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> intends to use other powers under the <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21 (in particular under section 56 <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21 (duty to provide information and assistance) and section 31 <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21 (interaction with <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> functions))</li>
</ul>

<p>This information will be disclosed through established points of contact (see below).</p>

<h2>Requests for Information and Assistance</h2>

<p>Under section 56 of the <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21, the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> has a duty to provide such information in its possession and any other assistance as the Secretary of State may by direction reasonably require to enable the Secretary of State to exercise his functions under the Act.</p>

<p>Where possible, prior to formally issuing a request under section 56, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will engage with the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> to discuss the content and timing of the request, taking into account the extent of the request, the resourcing implications for the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> and whether the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> already has possession of the information.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will aim to give the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> at least five working days to respond to a request under section 56. Depending on the complexity of the request, a longer time period may be reasonable. Where information is required urgently, agreed arrangements should be followed in order to maximise the chance of successful contact.</p>

<p>The types of information and assistance may include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>information on current or historical <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> cases</li>
  <li>information the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> may hold on competition within a given sector</li>
  <li>information on existing interim orders, derogations, final orders or undertakings; or</li>
  <li>information on requests to issue or amend a derogation</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the information outlined above will be available in the public domain and <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will not seek information from the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> that can be obtained through public sources or can be obtained through its own resources.</p>

<h2>Remedies</h2>

<p>Prior to issuing interim orders, final orders or final notifications under <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21 in cases where the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> is likely to have an interest, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will seek to inform the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> ahead of time and consider any representations from the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Similarly, prior to issuing interim orders, derogations, accepting undertakings or issuing final orders under <abbr title="Enterprise Act">EA</abbr> 02 in cases where <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> is likely to have an interest under <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21, the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> will seek to inform <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> ahead of time and consider any representations from <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Through engagement in case meetings and directly with other government departments, appropriate remedies will be developed to mitigate national security risks. Where appropriate, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> might seek advice on remedies from the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>.</p>

<p>In order to avoid potential conflicts between remedies imposed (or accepted) under the <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21 and <abbr title="Enterprise Act">EA</abbr> 02, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will, where appropriate, consider aligning the review processes of <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> and the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> should it be judged helpful in certain cases, by requesting a voluntary extension period with the merger parties to ensure that remedies are effective and that <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> and <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> avoid any clash in remedies. This will in general follow the application of an interim order. For national security reasons, it may not always be appropriate to align review processes.</p>

<p>Where a potential conflict may arise between remedies being sought by <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> and the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>, this will be escalated to SCS1 level within both <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> and the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> for resolution, with further escalation to SCS2 level, (which would include the inquiry group if the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> is undertaking a phase 2 investigation), if necessary.</p>

<p>Any decisions made under <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21 must be taken on the basis of national security. Where multiple remedies are available to mitigate national security risks, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> officials will consider representations from the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> as to their relative impact on any competition concerns identified by the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Interaction with <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Functions Under Part 3 of the <abbr title="Enterprise Act">EA</abbr> 02 (<abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21, Section 31)</h2>

<p>Section 31 <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21 provides for situations where a trigger event considered under the Act for national security reasons is also subject to consideration by the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> under the merger control regime in Part 3 of the <abbr title="Enterprise Act">EA</abbr> 02.</p>

<p>Section 31 <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21 gives the Secretary of State the power, if a final order is in force or a final notification has been given under the <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21, to direct the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> to do, or not to do, anything under the merger control regime in relation to the trigger event if the Secretary of State reasonably considers that the direction is necessary and proportionate for the purpose of preventing, remedying or mitigating a risk to national security.</p>

<p>Where there are multiple directions available, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> officials will consider representations from the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> as to their relative impact on any competition concerns identified by the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Engagement with the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> will be an important part of this assessment. The required consultation with the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> prior to the Secretary of State giving a direction under section 31 of the <abbr title="National Security and Investment Act">NSIA</abbr> 21 will be facilitated through agreed points of contact at the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>. <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will seek to give the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> as much advanced notice as possible of a direction by the Secretary of State.</p>

<h2>Review Period</h2>

<p>The parties will maintain regular communication on the functioning of this <abbr title="Memorandum of understanding">MoU</abbr> through the points of contact. Minor changes to the <abbr title="Memorandum of understanding">MoU</abbr> may be agreed in writing between the parties. If, through regular communication, it becomes clear the <abbr title="Memorandum of understanding">MoU</abbr> requires substantive changes, the <abbr title="Memorandum of understanding">MoU</abbr> will be revised.</p>
