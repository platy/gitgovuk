<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction to the online form</h2>

<p>This guide explains how to complete and submit the budget forecast return (<abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr>) to the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA).</p>

<p>The BFRO and BFR3Y forms are now permanently combined into a single financial return called the <abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr>. For more information about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-budget-forecast-return"><abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr> returns, see our main page</a>. This also includes details for the weekly MS Teams dial-ins and webchats where you can ask us any queries about your return.</p>

<p>The academies budget forecast return (<abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr>) is now live. The <strong>deadline for the <abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr> to be submitted is 26 July 2022</strong>. To access the form use the link below:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>
<abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr> form structure</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr> form is split into two sections, the table below shows the periods where the detailed actuals and forecasts are required.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Period</th>
      <th scope="col">Prior year</th>
      <th scope="col">Prior year</th>

<p>If your trust completed the BFR2021 then the period âSep 20 - Mar 21â will be pre-populated with the data your trust returned.</p>

<p>The other section covers the summary level forecasts for the years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2022/23 (will be automatically summarised from the data already entered in the form)</li>
  <li>2023/24</li>
  <li>2024/25</li>
</ul>

<p>You can read more about the details of what is included in <a class="govuk-link" href="#Three-year-forecast">three year forecasts here</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Who should complete this return?</h3>

<p>All established academy trusts active as at 30 April 2022 are required to complete the <abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr> and will need to complete on an accruals and prepayments basis.</p>

<p>Throughout this document and the associated return, the terms âacademy trustsâ and âacademyâ include the following entities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sponsored academies</li>
  <li>academy converters</li>
  <li>free schools</li>
  <li>university technical colleges</li>
  <li>special schools</li>
  <li>studio schools</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that for new trusts or trusts with academies having joined or left, data should be included for the period the trust has been open and include academies for the period that they have been part of that trust.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Updates to the <abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr> form</h2>

<p>The main changes to the <abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr> 2022 form:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is now only one <abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr> form, the old BFRO and BFR3Y forms have been permanently merged into a single <abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr> form</li>
  <li>refreshed the <abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr> dashboard to make it easier to use</li>
  <li>updated guidance on how the form will only become available to complete once the introduction section has been completed</li>
  <li>weâve included additional help text as a result of feedback and queries raised last year</li>
  <li>we have made some help text static to help users complete the form</li>
  <li>we have removed finance questions 5 and 6 from the form (these relate to the RPA and covid-19)</li>
  <li>we have included a new section for academy trust revenue reserves that are 20% and over the total revenue income</li>
</ul>

<p>This year we had introduced a new section to the <abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr> to comply with a Public Accounts Committee (PAC) request. The ESFA have been asked to investigate the variation in the financial health of academy trusts.</p>

<p>If your trust has 20% or more revenue reserves based on your 2022 total revenue income, you will be asked some follow up questions. If you donât have a reserves balance of 20% or more, then you will not need to complete this section of the form. The calculation is based upon total revenue income (line 298) and the total revenue carry forward (line 430) for August 2022.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>GAG pooling</h3>

<p>There is a GAG pooling option for users - this is a âyesâ or ânoâ option. Selecting âyesâ will allow users to confirm that your reserves are pooled. This will remove the need to input a balance for each academy. If you answer ânoâ youâll be required to enter an individual balance on each academy line for your trust in the lines 800s.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Dashboard</h3>

<p>The dashboard page shows the overall status of your return. From this page, you can drill into each section of the form, look at the activity history, access guidance and download your reports.</p>

<p>This is the main navigation page in the form and once youâve completed the âOverviewâ section youâll be able to access the rest of the return.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Information for multi-academy trusts (MATs)</h3>

<p>MATs preparing aggregated financial statements comprising of more than one academy must submit a consolidated return, which aggregates the budgets of each of its academies.</p>

<p>The front page of the form contains the name of the academy trust, UPIN and a checked list of all academies that are on the ESFA data set as being part of the trust.</p>

<p>If you notice any errors or omissions contact the ESFA using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish%3A%2F%2FAF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468%2FAF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992%2Fdefinition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen&amp;utm_source=EM_Letter_MAr19" rel="external">ESFA enquiry form</a> so we can make any necessary changes.</p>

<p>MATs will be asked to tell us the names of the academies included in the return. If any academies have left then, untick those academies that wonât be included for the timescales covered by the return. If you untick you will be asked for an explanation for why this has happened.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>Queries and feedback</h3>
<p>Any queries should be directed to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish%3A%2F%2FAF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468%2FAF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992%2Fdefinition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen&amp;utm_source=EM_Letter_MAr19" rel="external">ESFA enquiry form</a>. Your query should be titled with â<abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr>â and quote your trust UPIN so it is efficiently triaged.</p>

<p>We also value your feedback. If you would like to send us some feedback, then headline your form with â<abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr> user feedbackâ.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span>External preparer</h3>

<p>As with previous <abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr> returns if you have an external preparer who will prepare, but not submit, your <abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr> form and enter their details here.</p>

<p>If they must have fully registered if new before you can enter their details in your form. Either the academy preparer or approver can add the details. Once youâve added their details the screen will look like this:</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="BFR external preparer details" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/100817/resized_BFR3Y_exprep.jpg"></div>
<figcaption><p>This shows an example of the completed BFR form external preparer details.</p></figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>If you donât have an external preparer to prepare your <abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr> form, you must âMark as completeâ the page with no users added</strong>. Marking the page as complete will enable the rest of the form to be completed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.7 </span>Finance questions</h3>

<p>This section of the form is used to clarify if your trust needs to complete later sections of the form.</p>

<p>This will be in line with how your form has been prepopulated from the previous submission. For example, if you had an outstanding loan in your BFR3Y 2021 submission, the answer to FQ2 and loans will be âyesâ and you wonât be able to change the page. Youâll need to update the data and answer the validation in the âOther Itemsâ section of the form. Finance questions 5 and 6 have been removed from the <abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.8 </span>Downloads and reports</h3>

<p>On the dashboard, thereâs an option on the right of the screen to download reports of your return. These are in PDF or Excel formats. The format of the excel has been amended to ensure that it prints in landscape and accommodates all columns on the width of one page. This can be accessed at any time during the completion of the return. It is recommended to print the submitted version of the return for your records.</p>

<p>When you first start completing your return, you can download to get a copy of all the pre-populated numbers. This will help you to prepare if you donât already know the details of the last <abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr> return submitted to the DfE. The pre-population only covers the âSep 20 â Mar 21â column of your return.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.9 </span>Forecasting assumptions</h3>

<p>We want to understand trusts forecasts, so we can more effectively support a financially healthy sector. The return provides us with an assurance that trusts are undertaking strategic budget planning, following best practice, and help the ESFA understand which trusts may benefit from further support.</p>

<p>All trusts must complete the three year forecast section, providing commentary on your underlying assumptions.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr> is a combination of actuals and forecast for 2020/21, 2021/22 and forecasts for 2022/23 in detail and in summary for 2023/24 and 2024/25. These should be consistent with your own current planned forecast at the time of completing the return.</p>

<p>Some trusts may be forecasting a deficit for later years and currently preparing plans to address this.  If this is the case, your <abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr> forecast should take into account decisions taken to date. We understand that forecasts are subject to change because of decisions taken over time by the trust to address any deficit. We expect trusts to submit to us your latest and most accurate forecasts available and we understand that this is a snapshot at the time of submission</p>

<p>We appreciate that financial forecasting involves a degree of volatility and that you will need to make some assumptions about future patterns of income and expenditure. Assumptions will depend on individual circumstances, strategic aims and approach to financial planning.</p>

<p>You should ensure that your forecast best reflects your own likely future circumstances. Assumptions are best determined locally as you have the detailed operational knowledge of your own particular circumstances. This will include, for example, local area trends and local authority planning for pupil numbers. We would expect that assumptions used in forecasts would be based upon trends of pupil numbers, also knowledge of any investment plans going forward</p>

<p>ESFA cannot give advice on how trusts should set their own assumptions. This is for the trust to decide and is a critical element of your trustâs financial governance and risk management arrangements.  In some areas a future funding policy may not be known, in such cases trusts will need to reflect what they consider to be sensible assumptions.</p>

<p>Trusts may wish to make use of any advice or guidance provided by representative bodies however, the final decisions remain the responsibility of the Trustees. We ask that your return is consistent with what is provided to your internal Board.</p>

<p>It is especially important to comment on your overall net surplus or deficit over the forecast period.  The department will not make the assumption, based on the <abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr> alone, that a forecast deficit implies poor financial management.  It is imperative that trusts provide genuine forecasts that provide a realistic future picture.</p>

<p>The trust board must agree and support any assumptions included in the forecasts. Here are some general planning assumptions that may help you construct your forecast:</p>

<p><strong>Income</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>forecast pupil numbers</li>
  <li>estimated National Funding Formula funding per pupil with a baseline including minimum funding guarantees</li>
  <li>changes in pupil premium funding and mix of pupils with special needs</li>
  <li>mix of weighting factors including area cost adjustment</li>
  <li>other income assumptions such as, commercial income and investment income</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Expenditure</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>pay awards for all staff (national rates or locally determined rates)</li>
  <li>staff turnover estimates and future staff grade ratios</li>
  <li>TPS contribution rates (indications of national rates)</li>
  <li>LGPS contribution rates (varies according to region)</li>
  <li>non-staff cost inflation- could apply a flat rate or variable one subject to different rates depending on specific costs</li>
  <li>utilities and building running costs</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are forecasting a deficit then include a description of any mitigating actions that you are undertaking. If these are already approved, then the forecast should reflect the impact of these plans.</p>

<p>For any transfers between revenue and capital (line 255) this should be the planned transfer from revenue reserves or income to the capital budget to spend on capital items. This should normally be a negative figure. However, occasionally a capital grant is spent as per the grant conditions, but the expense has been classified as revenue (for example, roof repair). In this case there may be a need to make a transfer from capital to revenue and it will generate a positive transfer to revenue from capital (i.e. negative in contra to line 585).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.10 </span>Academy trust reserves</h3>

<p>The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has asked DfE to investigate the variation in the financial health of academy trusts, determine the underlying causes and decide whether some schools or local areas need extra support from 2022-23 to be sustainable.</p>

<p>This year weâll request additional information for any academy trust with reserves equivalent to more than 20% of their income. The calculation is a ratio of line 430 âc/f 31 Aug 2022â and line 298. This data will provide ESFA with information to assess the impact of financial pressures on schools at local level.</p>

<p>If you have a ratio of 20% or more, youâll be asked some follow up questions. Youâll be asked to provide more details about the minimum amount your trust would want to keep in reserves along with a narrative. To comply with PAC request, we need to ask specific details, including selecting the main purpose(s) your trust is holding its reserve balance for. This information is requested to try and minimise further queries later in the year.</p>

<p>You must select at least one from this list of options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>âspecific building/estates projectsâ (site development or maintenance e.g. new classrooms, sports facilities, CIF contributions)</li>
  <li>âother non-building capital expenditureâ (curriculum development, ICT infrastructure)</li>
  <li>âstaff retention and developmentâ (planned training commitments)</li>
  <li>âstrategic development of the trustâ (increase in schools, conversions or transfers in)</li>

<span class="number">4.4 </span>Capital income totals</h3>

<p>Line 585 Transfer between revenue from capital - this should be the contra to line 255 - normally there are revenue transfers to capital and this line should be a positive figure. Transfers from capital funding to revenue reserves is usually not allowed. However, on occasion for the reasons described in line 255, a reverse transfer may be necessary, in which case funds may flow from capital to revenue and the balance in this line would become negative. In this circumstance, youâll need to add an explanation to provide the context of this.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span>Capital expenditure</h3>

<p>Land and buildings additions are shown in lines 601-620. This will include the cost of land acquisition including all fees and charges associated. This will include the cost of new construction, including fees, cost of conversions and renovations and cost of extension to existing premises.

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="An example of an academy trust's GAG statement" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/121520/GAG_-_resized.jpg"></div>
<figcaption><p>This shows an example of the GAG statements received by academies</p></figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Section 1</strong> â Post opening Grant (Start up Grant) both elements should be allocated to line 105 of the <abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr>.</p>

<p><strong>Section 3</strong> â Breakdown of post 16-19 allocation (which is also shown on the 16-19 allocation statement) â only put the element that relates to the Academy Post 16 Bursary Funding (included as part of the Student financial support) in line 103 of the <abbr title="Budget forecast return deadline 26 July 2022">BFR</abbr>.</p>

<p><strong>The Total allocation</strong> (1+2+3) excluding the 2 specific allocations above should be included in line 102 as the GAG funding</p>
