Neither Her Majesty’s Government nor its staff take any responsibility for the accuracy of the information, nor accept liability for any loss, costs, damage or expense that you might suffer as a result of relying on the information.

<h2>Botswana: bereavement information</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>When a relative or friend dies abroad, the different procedures, laws or language can cause additional distress. You may be uncertain about what to do or who to contact.</p>

<p>This country specific information is designed to help you through some of the practical arrangements you may need to make. It supplements the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coping-with-death-abroad">general information on death abroad</a> produced by the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office, which applies to all countries.</p>

<p>Please note, as each country has its own laws and customs when a death occurs, it may not be possible to make the arrangements that you prefer, or at the time you would like.</p>

<h2>How to contact the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office</h2>

<p>There is a lot of information below, but you may have questions. You can speak to someone by phone 24/7, any day of the year by contacting the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London on 0207 008 5000.</p>

<p>If you are not in the UK, you can find the contact details of the nearest <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies">British embassy, high commission or consulate</a>.</p>

<p>The priority of the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office is to provide assistance to British nationals overseas who need the most help. The level and type of assistance they can offer is tailored to the individual circumstances of each case.</p>

<h2>Next of kin</h2>

<p>The next of kin of the person who died will usually need to make decisions and practical arrangements. The next of kin can sometimes appoint another person to act on their behalf.</p>

<p>If you are not the next of kin, they will need to be informed. If required, the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office can help you do this.</p>

<p>There is no legal definition of next of kin in the UK. Please note that if there is a disagreement over who is the next of kin, or the person who died did not choose a next of kin, this can cause additional complications.</p>

<p>In Botswana, next of kin can be the spouse, siblings, parents, adult children, or any adult considered to be a close relative to the deceased. If the next of kin is in the UK or a third country, the police will usually notify the British High Commission. The High Commission will do whatever they can to trace the next of kin as soon as possible and would normally ask the UK police to pass on the sad news.</p>

<h3>Release of information to next of kin</h3>

<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office will try to obtain as much information as possible after your relative or friend has died abroad. Some of this may be only available to next of kin. Consular officers may be able to obtain this themselves, or they may put you in touch directly with the authorities overseas. They may be able to provide you with details of others who can advocate on your behalf such as lawyers, charities, or other organisations.</p>

<p>If it is determined to be a natural death, the police will release the information to the next of kin as soon as they have confirmed the person’s identity. For suspicious deaths, the police may withhold information if they judge that such a release may hinder their investigations. The information will be released to the next of kin once the investigations have been concluded.</p>

<h2>Insurance</h2>

<p>It is very important to check if the person who died had insurance. If they had insurance, contact the insurance company as soon as possible. They may have a list of approved funeral directors to help you make arrangements, or be able to cover some of the costs.</p>

<p>If the person who died did not have insurance, the next of kin will usually have to appoint a funeral director and will usually be responsible for all costs. The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office cannot help with these costs.</p>

<h2>Appointing a funeral director</h2>

<p>If you decide to bring the deceased to the UK for the funeral or cremation, you may only need to appoint an international funeral director. The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office produces a <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-funeral-directors-in-the-uk">list of international funeral directors based in the UK</a>.</p>

<p>If you decide to hold a funeral or cremation in Botswana, you can find a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/botswana-list-of-funeral-directors">list of funeral directors in Botswana</a>.</p>

<p>A relative or a formally appointed representative must instruct a local funeral director in Botswana or an international funeral director in the UK for a body to be repatriated to the UK, or buried or cremated in Botswana.</p>

<p>However if the deceased was insured you should immediately contact the insurance company to establish if they are able to cover for the repatriation expenses and make the necessary arrangements. Funeral directors are usually very helpful in explaining and handling the whole process, including all steps involved for a local burial, cremation and repatriation.</p>

<h2>Registering the death and obtaining a death certificate</h2>

<p>You will need to register the death with the local authorities in the country where the person died. Sometimes a funeral director can do this for you. You will usually need documents about you and the person who has died, which include information such as full name, date of birth and passport number.</p>

<p>The local authorities will need to be told if the person suffered from an infectious condition such as hepatitis or HIV so they can take precautions against infection.</p>

<p>You do not need to register the death with the UK authorities. The local death certificate can usually be used in the UK for most purposes, including probate. If it is not in English, you will need to obtain and pay for an official translation.</p>

<p>In order to register a death in Botswana and receive the death certificate, you must submit a death notification tear-off from the certificate of the cause of death which is given by the doctor who initially certified the death.</p>

<p>There are branches of the National Registration Offices at every government hospital. Death certificates are printed in English and can be collected the same day during working hours (07h30 - 16h30). Funeral directors can do this on your behalf if they have written authorisation from you to act on your behalf along with your notarised form of identity.</p>

<p>You can approach a local notary or commissioner of oaths to get your identity notarised. Please see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/botswana-list-of-lawyers">list of lawyers</a>. UK documents that are certified by a UK notary can be used in Botswana. More information on the death registration process is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.bw/civil-registration/death-registration" rel="external">gov.bw</a>  website.</p>

<h2>Consular death registration</h2>

<p>You do not have to register the death of a British national that occurs overseas with the UK authorities. You can sometimes apply for a consular death registration. This is not mandatory and cannot be used instead of a death certificate from the country where the person died. It is only available in some countries. If you wish to do this, you can <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/register-a-death">find more information on registering a death and apply online</a>.</p>

<h2>Post mortem examinations (autopsies)</h2>

<p>Post-mortem examinations are conducted for all deaths that require a cause of death to be established. These can either be forensic (criminal investigations) or clinical (medical causes). Where the cause of death is certain they may not be necessary.</p>

<p>They are performed in government hospitals that provide access to pathologists and the process usually takes a week. However, delays can occur as there is a shortage of pathologists in Botswana. There is a booking system in place at the hospitals but they also use a triaging system and evaluation is on a case by case basis, with traumatic deaths given the priority.</p>

<p>Forensic post mortems are usually done for free. There is a charge of P2500 that the next of kin is expected to pay for clinical post mortems conducted on non-citizens or non-residents.</p>

<p>Next of kin can request the post mortem and usually they are not refused unless in instances where cause of death is very clear to medical staff and the procedure deemed unnecessary by the attending medical team. The post mortem request form requires written consent by both next of kin and the pathologists of investigating body eg police. Whole organs are not retained, but a small amount of tissue from organs may be removed in case the pathologist wishes to do further analysis.</p>

<p>These tissues are not returned but are discarded as clinical material.  A written request for the preliminary report should be done with the medical/ forensic team preferably at the time of request for a post mortem. The report will be made available to the next of kin by the attending pathologist and is written in English. There is no extra cost for the report. The report is usually available within a week of the examination unless further testing is pending.</p>

<p>The same process described above applies for neonates and still births.</p>

<h2>Mortuary facilities</h2>

<p>The deceased will normally be cared for initially by the hospital morgue, before being passed into the care of your funeral director. The next of kin will need to present themselves to the morgue to secure release of the body, although a nominated designate or an appointed local funeral director may do this on their behalf with written permission from the next of kin.</p>

<h2>Burial, cremation, repatriation</h2>

<p>The next of kin of the person who has died will usually need to decide between a local burial, cremation or bringing the person home, which is known as repatriation.  Your funeral director will usually be able to explain the options available, the costs, and help you make arrangements.</p>

<p>If the person who has died was covered by travel insurance, the insurance company will normally have a standing agreement with an international funeral director in Britain to arrange repatriations. If they are not covered by insurance, the next of kin will need to appoint an international undertaker in the UK.</p>

<p>Few local undertakers in Botswana are equipped to carry out repatriation procedures. Working with the international undertaker, a local undertaker will arrange a Botswanan death certificate, a certificate of embalming, and a certificate giving permission to transfer the person who has died to the UK, which are required to ship the deceased. Repatriation will be delayed if the police determine that a post-mortem is required. The Police will authorise release of the body after post-mortem takes place.</p>

<p>Local burials can be arranged through the local undertakers. Botswana law stipulates that foreigners may only be buried in Botswana with the permission of their country of nationality. In practice, this requires the next of kin to obtain a letter from the British High Commission. If family or friends cannot pay for a funeral, the government of Botswana can arrange a pauper’s burial.</p>

<p>The local council will engage an undertaker, set a date for the funeral and inform next of kin. The grave will be marked with a number and family can thereafter mark the grave with the names of the person who has died. Family are allowed to attend the funeral and can arrange for someone to say a prayer if they so wish. Funerals usually take place during the week.</p>

<p>Cremation facilities are available in Botswana. If the next of kin choose to have a local cremation and wish to take the ashes back to the UK themselves, the next of kin should discuss arrangements with their funeral director and the airline they will be travelling with to arrange the necessary paperwork.</p>

<p>Please note if a local burial or cremation takes place, then an inquest in the UK will not be possible. For more information on inquests, see the information on UK coroners and inquests.</p>

<h2>Return of personal belongings</h2>

<p>The police will return any personal effects that are in their care to the next of kin or nominated person. If personal effects need to be returned to the UK and next of kin are not present in Botswana, the High Commission can assist with making arrangements by commercial means.</p>

<p>If the person who died had insurance, check with the insurance company if this covers the return of their personal belongings.</p>

<p>Please note, the British High Commission cannot take responsibility for the personal belongings of the person who died.</p>

<h2>Steps to take in the UK</h2>

<p>You can find more information on the steps to take in the UK online. This includes information on arranging the funeral, telling the government about the death, UK pensions and benefits, and dealing with the estate of the person who died. There is a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/when-someone-dies">step-by-step guide about what to do when someone dies</a>.</p>

<h2>British passport cancellation</h2>

<p>In order to avoid identity fraud, the passport of the person who died should be cancelled with Her Majesty’s Passport Office (HMPO). To do this, you will need to complete a “D1 form”.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/what-to-do-with-a-passport-when-the-passport-holder-has-died">form and instructions on where to send the passport is available online</a>.</p>

<p>If you plan to repatriate the person who died to the UK, you may require their passport to do this. In these circumstances, you should cancel the passport after they have been repatriated.</p>

<h2>Child deaths</h2>

<p>There are no separate procedures for deaths involving children. If there are any investigations that need to be carried into the death of a child, the procedure would be similar to deaths of adults.</p>

<h2>Deaths in road traffic accidents</h2>

<p>Police at the scene will investigate how the accident occurred by questioning witnesses to the accident and record their accounts. The suspect(s) will be prosecuted if the police establish that there was a traffic offence(s) committed.</p>

<h2>Deaths investigated as murder or manslaughter</h2>

<p>If the local police have confirmed that they are investigating the death as a murder or manslaughter a dedicated team within the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office will be available to provide support, including by referring you to a specialised organisation. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/helping-british-people-abroad-murder-and-manslaughter">find more about how the FCDO can help with murder and manslaughter abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If a death is regarded as suspicious the police will conduct an investigation. If an offender is identified and sufficient evidence gathered, they will be prosecuted by the Directorate of Public Prosecutions.</p>

<p>You should note that if the deceased is repatriated to parts of the UK a coroner or procurator fiscal may decide to hold an inquest. See the section on UK coroners and inquests below.</p>

<h2>UK coroners and inquests</h2>

<p>If you repatriate the person who died to England and Wales, there may be an inquest. The decision on when to hold an inquest is made by Her Majesty’s Coroner. Please note, an inquest will usually only happen in certain situations, for example, when someone has died in suspicious, unnatural, and violent circumstances or whilst in detention. If the person who died is cremated and only their ashes are brought home, there will not be an inquest.</p>

<p>If you repatriate the person who died to Scotland, the Procurator Fiscal may decide to call for a Fatal Accidents or Injuries Inquiry.</p>

<p>If you repatriate the person who died to Northern Ireland, there will be no coronial inquest or further inquiry.</p>

<p>Please note, Procurators Fiscal and Coroners do not have jurisdiction in another country, nor do they seek to apportion blame to a named individual.</p>

<p>You can find more information on Coroners and the Procurator Fiscal in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coping-with-death-abroad">FCDO guide on death abroad</a></p>

<h2>Legal Aid</h2>

<p>There is no legal aid in Botswana for non-citizens. Under certain circumstances, such as a suspicious death, you may wish to engage the services of a local lawyer to represent your interests should a trial be necessary. Should you wish to have detailed feedback from court proceedings, you may wish to engage a lawyer before the case passes to the public prosecutor. Please see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/botswana-list-of-lawyers">list of lawyers</a> or speak to <a class="govuk-link" href="www.government.co.bw/home/company/672685#">the law society of Botswana</a></p>

<h2>Compensation</h2>

<p>Dependents of any person who is killed in a road crash at any place in Botswana where the general public has access to may be eligible to compensation. This only applies to residents of Botswana. You are not eligible for compensation if you stay outside Botswana. Compensation normally covers funeral expenses, loss of earnings, loss of support and incidental expenses. You can contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mvafund.bw" rel="external">Motor Vehicle Accident Fund</a> for more information.</p>

<p>You can find information on <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/compensation-victim-terrorist-attack">UK compensation for victims of terrorism overseas</a></p>

<h2>Translation and Interpretation</h2>

<p>English is widely spoken in Botswana, so you are less likely to need a translator or an interpreter.</p>

<h2>Additional support</h2>

<h3>Local support organisations</h3>

<p>As far as we are aware, there are no organisations established in Botswana with the specific purpose of providing grief counselling or other bereavement support. Local churches may provide support or advice to bereaved families.</p>

<h3>Support organisations in the UK</h3>

<p>In the UK, there are many organisations that can help bereaved families. Some of these are <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coping-with-death-abroad">listed in the guide coping with death abroad</a>.</p>
