<h2>Context</h2>

<p>Promoting equality and addressing health inequalities are at the heart of NHS England’s values. Throughout the development of the policies and processes cited in this document, we have given due regard to the need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>eliminate discrimination, harassment and victimisation</li>
  <li>advance equality of opportunity</li>
  <li>foster good relations between people who share a relevant protected characteristic (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/equality-act-2010-guidance">as cited under the Equality Act 2010)</a> and those who do not share it</li>
  <li>reduce inequalities between patients in access to, and outcomes from, healthcare services</li>
  <li>ensure services are provided in an integrated way where this might reduce health inequalities</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>

<h3>Preventing radicalisation</h3>

<p>Healthcare staff will meet and treat people who may be vulnerable to being drawn into terrorism, and all staff have a responsibility to safeguard vulnerable individuals of all ages that they come into contact with. Preventing radicalisation sits alongside long-established duties on professionals to safeguard vulnerable children, young people and adults from exploitation from a range of other harms such as drugs, gangs and physical and sexual exploitation.</p>

<p>Radicalisation is a process by which an individual or group adopts increasingly extreme political, social, or religious ideals and aspirations that reject or undermine the status quo or undermine contemporary ideas and expressions of freedom of choice. Radicalisation is comparable to other forms of exploitation. It is a safeguarding issue that staff working in the health sector must be aware of.</p>

<p>Under the Prevent duty, the health sector is required to ensure that healthcare workers are able to identify early signs of an individual being drawn into radicalisation. Additionally, any provider commissioned using the NHS Standard Contract has a wider contractual safeguarding responsibility which includes Prevent. Staff must be able to recognise key signs of radicalisation and be confident in referring individuals to their organisational safeguarding lead thus enabling them to receive the support and intervention they require.</p>

<h3>Prevent duty</h3>

<p>Prevent is part of the government <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/contest">counter-terrorism strategy CONTEST</a> and aims to reduce the threat to the UK from terrorism by stopping people becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism.</p>

<p>The objectives of Prevent are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tackle the causes of radicalisation and respond to the ideological challenge of terrorism</li>
  <li>identify, safeguard and support those most at risk of radicalisation through early identification, intervention and support</li>
  <li>enable those who have already engaged in terrorism to disengage and rehabilitate</li>
</ul>

<p>Prevent focuses on all forms of terrorism and the Prevent strategy centres on safeguarding individuals by providing support and re-direction to individuals at risk of, or in the process of, being groomed and/or radicalised into terrorist activity, before any crime is committed.</p>

<p>Section 26 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/6/contents/enacted" rel="external">Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015</a> places a duty on certain bodies in the exercise of their functions to have “due regard to the need to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism”. The health specified authorities in schedule 6 of the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an NHS trust established under section 25 of the National Health Service act 2006</li>
  <li>an NHS foundation trust within the meaning given by section 30 of the National Health Service act 2005</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prevent-duty-guidance">The Prevent duty</a> requires all specified authorities to ensure that there are mechanisms in place to enable health staff to understand the risk of radicalisation how to seek appropriate advice and support.</p>

<p>Further relevant legislation can be found in the section ‘References and relevant guidance’ below.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Prevent training and competencies framework has been developed to encourage a consistent approach to training and competency development in respect of Prevent and to ensure that NHS trusts and foundation trusts meet their legislative responsibilities to equip people to work effectively to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, young people and adults in relation to Prevent.</p>

<p>This document will also support NHS provider organisations, NHS commissioners and organisations providing services on behalf of the NHS, to meet contractual obligations in relation to safeguarding training, as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/nhs-standard-contract/" rel="external">NHS Standard Contract</a>.</p>

<p>To ensure consistency in training and competency development, the framework should be used in conjunction with the intercollegiate documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rcn.org.uk/Professional-Development/publications/adult-safeguarding-roles-and-competencies-for-health-care-staff-uk-pub-007-069" rel="external">adult safeguarding: roles and competencies for healthcare staff</a> (Royal College of Nursing, 2018) (2018)</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rcn.org.uk/professional-development/publications/pub-007366" rel="external">safeguarding children and young people: roles and competencies for healthcare staff</a> (2019)</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rcn.org.uk/professional-development/publications/rcn-looked-after-children-roles-and-competencies-of-healthcare-staff-uk-pub-009486" rel="external">looked after children: roles and competencies for healthcare staff</a> (2020)</li>
</ul>

<p>This document provides a clear framework which identifies the competencies required for all healthcare staff, as well as setting out minimum training requirements. This framework uses the 6 levels of competence as outlined in the intercollegiate documents and gives examples of groups that fall within each of these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>level 1: all staff working in healthcare settings, including non-clinical managers and staff</li>
  <li>level 2: all clinical and non-clinical staff who have regular contact with patients, their families or carers, or the public</li>
  <li>level 3: all clinical staff working with adults, children, young people and/or their parents or carers, who could potentially contribute to assessing, planning, intervening and/or evaluating the health needs of a service user</li>
  <li>level 4: specialist roles – named professionals</li>
  <li>level 4 and 5: Prevent lead</li>
  <li>level 5: specialist roles – designated professionals</li>
  <li>level 6: and board level: chief executive officers, trust and health board executive and non-executive directors and/or members, commissioning body directors</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance framework provides best practice advice and is not statutory guidance.</p>

<h2>Training needs analysis</h2>

<p>Different staff groups require different levels of competence depending on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their role</li>
  <li>their level of contact with patients or service users</li>
  <li>the nature of their work</li>
  <li>their level of responsibility</li>
</ul>

<p>As a minimum, all staff working in a healthcare setting must know what to do if there is a safeguarding concern regarding radicalisation and the referral procedure for this concern, which includes knowing whom to contact within their organisation to communicate their concerns or seek advice.</p>

<p>In line with the intercollegiate safeguarding documents, this framework identifies 6 levels of competence, and gives examples of groups that fall within each of these. Each level builds upon the competencies, knowledge and skills of the proceeding levels within the framework. Those requiring competencies at levels 1 to 5 should also possess the competencies at each of the preceding levels. It is important for practitioners to be aware of the overarching content of the framework in addition to any specific section related to their role.</p>

<p>It is at the discretion of the organisational lead for Prevent to conduct training needs analysis and they may decide that certain roles have additional responsibilities that require a higher level of training than stated below.</p>

<p>Staff groups are identified at each level, but these are not exhaustive lists and the staff groups identified are examples of the types of role which correspond to the stated level. Any reference to roles or sectors that are not subject to the Prevent duty (for example, clinical commissioning groups (<abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr>) or integrated care systems (<abbr title="integrated care systems">ICSs</abbr>) (except those with additional clinical roles), general practitioners (<abbr title="general practitioners">GPs</abbr>) and social care) are included as best practice. However, any provider commissioned under the NHS Standard Contract (section 32: safeguarding), including independent and private providers, should be adhering to the below guidance for training needs analysis and training and competencies.</p>
