<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p><strong>1</strong>. This guidance is primarily for local authorities, to help them comply with the requirement to identify for each mainstream school in their area a notional amount to guide schools in their spending  to meet the costs of additional support for the school’s pupils with special educational needs (<abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr>). Although this is an indicative amount, it is important that it is sufficient for the reasonable additional costs that may be incurred by schools. The guidance will also help schools understand how the amount has been calculated and when it might be appropriate to seek additional resources.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong>. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/6/contents/enacted" rel="external">Children and Families Act 2014</a> secures the general presumption in law that children and young people with <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> should be educated in mainstream education settings. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/send-review-right-support-right-place-right-time"><abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr> and alternative provision green paper</a>, published in March 2022, confirms that meeting <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> should remain a core part of mainstream schools’ role in future, and makes proposals on how schools and their teachers will be supported in that role. The green paper also points to changes to the notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budget in future: this guidance is based on the existing roles and responsibilities of local authorities and schools.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong>. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25">The <abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr> Code of Practice</a>, which is statutory guidance to which schools must have regard, sets out more information on mainstream schools’ current legal duties in relation to their pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr>. Those duties include that schools must use their best endeavours to secure that the special educational provision called for by a pupil’s special educational needs is made.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>The notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budget</h2>

<p><strong>4</strong>. Mainstream maintained schools and academies (“schools”) are notified each year of a clearly identified but notional budget, within their overall budget allocation, towards the costs of fulfilling their duty to use their ‘best endeavours’ to secure that special educational provision for their pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr>. Using funds from the schools block of the dedicated schools grant (DSG), local authorities are responsible for calculating the amount of this notional budget using their local mainstream schools funding formula factors.</p>

<p><strong>5</strong>. The requirement to identify this budget for their schools is set out in regulation 11(3) of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2022/27/contents/made" rel="external">School and Early Years Finance (England) Regulations 2022</a> (which is similar to the equivalent regulation for previous years and which we intend will be included in the regulations for 2023 to 2024). That regulation says that “the local authority must identify within each budget share an amount calculated by reference to the requirements, factors and criteria specified in Part 3 [that is, the various elements of the local schools funding formula] which are relevant to pupils with special educational needs; such amount must be calculated using a threshold sum of £6,000 per pupil below which the school will be expected to meet the additional costs of pupils with special educational needs from its [annual] budget share”.</p>

<p><strong>6</strong>. The notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budget is not a budget that is separate from a school’s overall budget. It is an identified amount within a maintained school’s delegated budget share or an academy’s general annual grant. It is intended as a guide for a school’s spending decisions, and is neither a target nor a constraint on a school’s duty to use its ‘best endeavours’ to secure special provision for its pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr>.</p>

<p><strong>7</strong>. In discharging that responsibility, amongst other expectations set out in the <abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr> Code of Practice, mainstream schools are expected to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meet the costs of special educational provision for pupils identified as on <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> Support in accordance with the <abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr> Code of Practice; and</li>
  <li>contribute towards the costs of special educational provision for pupils with high needs (most of whom have education, health and care (EHC) plans), up to the high needs cost threshold set by the regulations (currently £6,000 per pupil per annum). This cost threshold is calculated by reference to the additional costs of provision, above the costs of the basic provision for all pupils in the school. High needs top-up funding is provided above this threshold on a per-pupil basis by the local authority that commissions  or agrees the placement.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>8</strong>. It is important to note that the notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budget is not intended to provide £6,000 for every pupil with <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr>, as most such pupils’ support will cost less than that. Nor is the notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budget intended to provide a specific amount per pupil for those with lower additional support costs, even though the local authority may make reasonable assumptions about what those costs might be for the purpose of ensuring that their schools’ notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budget calculation is realistic.</p>

<p><strong>9</strong>. In making assumptions about costs, it is important that local authorities are transparent in their assessment of what provision their mainstream schools should make as part of the local offer of provision for children with <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> and those who are disabled (<abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr>). They should identify the resources necessary for schools to deliver both an inclusive environment for their pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr> and any more specialist support that is needed. Local authorities must set out in their <abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr> Local Offer information about the arrangements the authority has for funding children and young people with <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr>, including any agreements about how schools will use any budget that has been delegated to them by the local authority. This statement is relevant to decisions that the local authority makes as to whether it is necessary to issue an <abbr title="education, health and care plan">EHC plan</abbr>.</p>

<p><strong>10</strong>. All schools are expected to make reasonable adjustments for pupils with disabilities, in accordance with their duties under the Equality Act 2010, whether or not they have <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr>. Where a reasonable adjustment is special educational provision, the revenue cost of that adjustment may be met from the school’s <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budget.</p>

<p><strong>11</strong>. Schools have a duty to designate a teacher to be the <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> co-ordinator (SENCo). We would expect the SENCo to be aware of their school’s notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budget and to be actively engaged with the senior leadership of the school in deciding what to spend on <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> support and provision.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Calculating the notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budget</h2>

<p><strong>12</strong>. As the next step in the movement towards a direct schools national funding formula (NFF), in 2023 to 2024 local authorities will only be allowed to use NFF factors in their local funding formulae and must use all NFF factors, except any locally determined premises factors. Local authorities will also be required to move their local formulae factors 10% closer to the NFF values, compared to where they were in 2022 to 2023, unless they are already mirroring the NFF. This may mean that local authorities need to review how their schools’ notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budgets are calculated. There is currently no national approach to the calculation of schools’ notional budget for pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> through the NFF. Local authorities, working with their schools, should therefore continue to use the local formula factor values in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<p><strong>13</strong>. Most local authorities calculate their schools’ notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budget using a combination of funding from the basic entitlement factor<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>, the deprivation factors, and the low prior attainment factors in the local funding formula. Depending on how the local formula is constructed and the overall weighting of the different formula factors, we would expect the calculation of the notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budget to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a small part of the basic entitlement funding;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a larger part of deprivation funding, reflecting the higher prevalence of lower-level <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> amongst disadvantaged pupils, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the majority or whole of the low prior attainment factor funding, as this is the best proxy we currently have for pupils with low-cost, high-incidence <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>14</strong>. Other elements of the funding formula may also be used – for example to reflect the prevalence of <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> amongst particular groups of pupils such as those who frequently move between schools, as captured by the mobility factor. A proportion of the lump sum could reflect any fixed costs of making <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> provision that would apply to all local schools or diseconomies of scale relevant to small schools. In local authorities with a large number of schools that receive a significant element of their funding through the minimum funding guarantee (MFG) element of the local formula, it may be appropriate to include a proportion of this funding in the notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budget calculation. This element should be kept under regular review, however, as this element of funding usually reduces over time, but could increase in some areas as local authorities move their local formula closer to the national funding formula.</p>

<p><strong>15</strong>. Local authorities should decide, following discussions and consultation with schools, including in the local schools forum, how big the notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budget should be. Nevertheless, comparisons with other local authorities’ calculations may be helpful. Local formulae data for 2022 to 2023 can be found at: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/schools-block-funding-formulae-2022-to-2023/schools-block-funding-formulae-2022-to-2023-analysis-of-local-authorities-schools-block-funding-formulae#notional-special-educational-needs-sen">Schools block funding formulae 2022 to 2023: analysis of local authorities’ schools block funding formulae</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Targeted funding to supplement the notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budget</h2>

<p><strong>16</strong>. A formulaic calculation of schools’ notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budgets, based on indicators of need used in the formula, is unlikely to be a precise match for the costs of support provided by teachers and other professionals for the pupils they identify as having <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr>.</p>

<p><strong>17</strong>. Any significant mismatch may be an indication that a school’s approach to identifying pupils’ <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> differs markedly from other schools’ practice. In some schools pupils not identified as having <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> would be so identified elsewhere. Other schools would too readily identify pupils as having <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> when their needs should be met within the normal teaching and learning environment <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>18</strong>. In some cases, however, a significant mismatch between the notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budget and actual costs of <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> support may be because the school has a disproportionate number of pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> in relation to its size, phase and characteristics, or has pupils with needs of a particular kind that are not captured by the formula factors used. In other cases a significant mismatch may be because a school’s small size creates diseconomies of scale in making provision for pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr>.  The local authority can provide targeted funding from its high needs budget to schools in such exceptional circumstances. This funding would supplement the school’s notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budget as calculated under the local funding formula.</p>

<p><strong>19</strong>. Local authorities should consider carefully the criteria for allocating such supplementary targeted funding; simply relying on how schools identify their pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> could lead to perverse incentives. With appropriate criteria in place, however, such funding could be particularly helpful. For example, it might enable a local school to meet the needs of more children with more complex needs instead of them being referred to a more distant special school.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Illustrative examples</h2>

<p><strong>20</strong>. In figures 1 and 2 below we have provided two examples to assist local authorities in reviewing their approach to the calculation of their schools’ notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budget. They are examples that show the calculation of the budget for a primary school of 300 pupils and a secondary school of 1,000 pupils. In these examples we have assumed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>that the schools have proportions of pupils on <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> Support and with high needs that are 12% and 4% respectively. These assumptions are, for illustrative purposes, based on percentages close to the national average. In practice, local authorities should consider the range of percentages in their local schools, as well as the averages across all local schools, in developing their approach, to ensure that schools are given assurance through the notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budget that they are receiving sufficient funding for their pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr>;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the costs of special educational provision for a pupil on <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> Support are, on average, £3,000 per annum, and the costs of supporting a pupil with high needs is £6,000 per annum. In practice, local authorities should consider what are the local average costs of additional special provision for pupils on <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> Support. As noted above, additional high needs top-up funding should be made available to the school for costs that exceed the £6,000 per pupil high needs threshold; such costs should not, therefore, be factored into decisions on the notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budget.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>21</strong>. These examples are illustrative only – we do not expect local authorities to use the exact calculations below. In developing these illustrative examples, we have considered what level of notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budget would be appropriate (given the profile of need and cost assumptions as above) and have based the proportionate contribution of the various formula factors broadly on existing local authority practice. As noted above, in setting their own notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budget, local authorities should consider the specific profile of need across schools in their local area.</p>

<p><strong>22</strong>. The examples use 2023 to 2024 NFF factor values, before the application of the area cost adjustment (ACA). The notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budget contribution percentages should be consistently applied across each phase of education.</p>
