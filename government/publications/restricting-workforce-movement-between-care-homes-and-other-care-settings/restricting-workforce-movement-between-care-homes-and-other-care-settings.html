<p>This guidance is being updated, but is still applicable.</p>
</div>

<p>Since the beginning of the pandemic we know that most care home providers have taken steps to minimise the movement of workforces to reduce the risk of asymptomatic transmission of the virus. These steps have been taken in addition to routine systems of infection control and, where appropriate, use of personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>).</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-coronavirus-covid-19-winter-plan-2020-to-2021" class="govuk-link">winter plan for social care</a> confirmed that stopping staff movement in and between care settings is critical to minimise the risk of infection of COVID-19. Care home providers should continue to limit all staff movement between settings unless absolutely necessary to help reduce the spread of infection. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>staff who work for one provider across several care homes</li>
  <li>staff who work on a part-time basis for multiple employers in multiple care homes or other care settings</li>
  <li>agency or other temporary staff</li>
</ul>

<p>The only exceptions to this are where staff movement is unavoidable in order to meet the needs of people using the service and keep them safe at all times. We recognise that where a care provider has exceptionally high levels of staff absence, including where there is a large outbreak, providers may need to rely on mutual aid from the local care system or use agency staff. This may involve staff who have recently worked at another regulated setting. This guidance sets out mitigations that should be taken to reduce transmission risks in these exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>This guidance sets out expectations of providers on limiting the routine movement of staff, and how to manage the risks of deploying individuals who work in multiple settings in those exceptional circumstances where it is the only remaining mechanism to ensure enough staff are available to care for service users safely.</p>

<h2>Restricting routine staff movement</h2>

<p>To reduce the risk of infections and outbreaks in care homes, providers should not deploy staff to provide nursing care or personal care if those individuals are also providing a regulated activity in another setting. This is for both permanent and temporary staff, including agency and bank staff, staff who work across multiple sites for the same employer and staff who work for more than one health and social care provider. Staffing requirements should be planned so routine movement is not necessary to maintain safe staffing levels. Mitigations such as block booking should be used to further minimise staff movement where agency or other temporary staff are needed.</p>

<p>Should a provider need to deploy an individual who usually attends 2 settings, the provider should ensure there is a 10-day interval between the individual attending the 2 settings and require a negative test result prior to the individual entering the home. This should be followed in all but exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>The Infection Control Fund (<abbr title="Infection Control Fund">ICF</abbr>) is provided to support adult social care providers, including those who do not hold a contract with the local authority, to reduce the rate of COVID-19 transmission within and between care settings. This includes compensating staff whose normal hours are reduced due to restrictions on their movement. Further detail and guidance on how the <abbr title="Infection Control Fund">ICF</abbr> can be used to compensate staff can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-infection-control-fund-round-2/adult-social-care-infection-control-fund-round-2-guidance" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Infection Control Fund">ICF</abbr> round 2 guidance</a>.</p>

<p>The government has recently announced a new £120 million fund for local authorities to support staffing capacity for provision of adult social care in their areas. The fund can be used to support providers to restrict staff movement by, for example, supporting providers to access additional staffing resource to minimise deployment of those who work in multiple settings. This can include incentivising the take-up of additional hours of existing social care staff by using the funding to, for example, pay overtime rates to encourage staff to work shifts additional to their usual or contracted hours, or cover childcare costs to allow staff to take on hours they would usually be unable to work due to child caring responsibilities. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workforce-capacity-fund-for-adult-social-care">Workforce Capacity Fund for adult social care</a>.</p>

<p>Care home providers are required by the Care Quality Commission (<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>) to ensure that all staff are fully <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> (infection prevention and control) trained and that risk assessments relating to the health, safety and welfare of people using services are completed and reviewed regularly by people with the qualifications, competence, skills, and experience to do so.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> continues to monitor staff movement and uses that information to help plan its inspection activity. Where information is received that unnecessary staff movement is taking place, the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> will inspect.</p>

<p>Where a provider uses agency or other temporary workers, it should take steps to ensure those agency workers have not attended another health or social care setting in the previous 10 days. For example, providers could consider using block bookings and exclusivity contracts with agencies to limit agency staff movement.</p>

<p>Block booking means that a provider agrees to give an agency worker a set number of guaranteed hours. For the purposes of this guidance, an exclusivity contract is when a provider agrees with an agency for an agency worker to solely work at one care setting. Exclusivity contracts and block bookings should be used in conjunction with one another wherever possible, to ensure that agency workers have a set number of guaranteed hours while they are working exclusively for one provider.</p>

<p>Restrictions on staff movement should also apply to care homes that have been assured by the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> to operate as a designated setting. Designated settings require a separate staff team in order to operate, and staff movement should be limited unless absolutely necessary, in accordance with this guidance. Please see section 3 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/designated-settings-for-people-discharged-to-a-care-home">designated settings guidance</a> for more detail on staffing requirements.</p>

<p>Where designated settings are a zoned setting within a care home (and not a ‘stand-alone unit’) providers should also ensure staff movement is limited between designated and non-designated areas in line with this guidance on restricting staff movement between care homes and other settings. For more guidance on designated settings and how to manage staff movement, please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/designated-settings-for-people-discharged-to-a-care-home">designated settings guidance</a> annex.</p>

<h2>Allowing staff movement in exceptional circumstances</h2>

<p>There are limited exceptional circumstances where, in order to ensure enough staff are available to provide care safely, care home providers may need to deploy people who are also working in another health or social care setting. These circumstances arise where a provider has planned its staffing requirements in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/guidance-providers/regulations-enforcement/regulation-18-staffing#guidance"><abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> fundamental standards</a>, and is actively taking steps to address any ongoing resourcing needs but is still unable to ensure sufficient staff are available to deliver care safely.</p>

<p>For example, when having taken all reasonable steps, a provider is unable to engage enough staff to cover specific shifts or perform specific duties and the need is urgent. Or when there are unplanned absences due to, for example, a significant proportion of staff self-isolating as a result of COVID-19 requirements, or other unforeseen circumstances that prevent staff from attending work (for example, school closure).</p>

<p>Providers deploying staff working in multiple locations in exceptional circumstances should ensure this is for as limited a period of time as possible and should only be for as long as is needed for the provider to resolve any staffing issues.</p>

<p>All providers should complete the Capacity Tracker question 1.2 on staff movement, in accordance with the required reporting arrangements. Where providers have some staff movement under the exceptional circumstances described in this guidance they should select the answer option, ‘No – we have some staff working between services/settings, but we have exhausted all reasonable steps to ensure we have sufficient staff to provide a safe service’. Where any movement between settings is not consistent with these exceptional circumstances providers should select answer option, ‘No – we have some staff working between services/settings’.</p>

<p>Providers should ensure temporary workers are tested before they begin their placement. They should also be included in routine testing during their placement and be tested using a lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) every time they return to the setting following working elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Further guidance on testing</h2>

<p>It is recommended that, in addition to the guidance in this document regarding testing, providers also read the government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/950192/Care_Home_Testing_Guidance_England_v06-01_3.pdf" rel="external">care home COVID-19 testing guidance for testing of staff and residents</a>.</p>

<p>The individual being deployed should have a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19 in the 7 days before starting the placement and have received a negative result. The individual should also be tested using an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> provided by the National Testing Programme on their first day before their first shift.</p>

<p>Where a provider deploys an individual, who is working in another setting, to help manage the risk of infection the individual should also be tested using an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> immediately before the shift every time they return to the care home after working elsewhere.</p>

<p>All staff deployed by the provider in a care home should be tested regularly as part of the provider's routine testing programme and should join the regular testing regime as soon as possible.</p>

<p>As with all regular testing, if someone tests positive with a PCR test, they should not be tested using PCR or rapid lateral flow for 90 days, unless they develop new symptoms during this time<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. For individuals who still fall into this 90-day window, these individuals should use evidence of their positive PCR result to show that they are currently exempt from testing until the 90-day period is over. Once the 90-day period is over, the individual should then continue to follow the relevant testing regime as set out above. Full details of the 90-day window policy can be found in the <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/963633/Care_Home_Testing_Guidance_England_v22-02_2.pdf" class="govuk-link">care home COVID-19 testing guidance for testing of staff and residents</a>.</p>

<p>Providers are reminded of the legal requirement for individuals to self-isolate following a positive COVID-19 test if advised to do so by NHS Test and Trace.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing before a shift as set out above, the same testing process should be followed as for testing care home staff. This <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test should be conducted immediately before an individual's shift and a negative result received before they start their shift. Only <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFDs</abbr> provided by the National Testing Programme should be used.</p>

<h2>Further guidance on staff movement</h2>

<p>While the safety of residents and staff is paramount, providers should, where possible, limit or ‘cohort’ staff to individual groups of residents or floors/wings, including segregation of COVID-positive and COVID-negative residents. This needs careful management and explicit agreement with staff, adherence to the latest guidance, robust implementation of routine infection prevention and control systems and appropriate use of relevant <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Providers should take steps to limit use of public transport by members of staff. Staff should avoid lift-sharing arrangements and travel solo in their own vehicle where possible. Where they do not have their own private vehicle, providers could use the <abbr title="Infection Control Fund">ICF</abbr> to provide private transport or encourage walking or cycling to and from work and support this with changing facilities or rooms. Further detail and guidance on how the <abbr title="Infection Control Fund">ICF</abbr> can be used to compensate staff can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-infection-control-fund-round-2" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Infection Control Fund">ICF</abbr> round 2 guidance</a>. In some instances, local taxi firms may be willing to provide fares to and from a care home at discounted rates.</p>
