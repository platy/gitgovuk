<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>A representative cross-section of volunteers tested themselves with swabs from 6 January to 22 January. Swabs were analysed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>Over the 17 days of the completed round of testing, out of 167,642 swab results, 2,282 were positive, giving a weighted prevalence of 1.57% (95% CI, 1.49%, 1.66%) or 157 people per 10,000 infected. This is the highest prevalence recorded by REACT-1 since it started in May 2020. Within round 8, the estimated R was at 0.98 (95% CI, 0.92, 1.04).</p>

<p>Regional prevalence is now highest in London at 2.83%; East of England at 1.78%; West Midlands at 1.66%; South East at 1.61%; North West at 1.38%; North East at 1.22%; East Midlands at 1.16%; Yorkshire and The Humber 0.80%; South West at 0.87%.</p>

<p>Prevalence is now highest in 18 to 24 year olds with a weighted prevalence of 2.44%, and prevalence in those aged 65 and over is at 0.93%.</p>

<p>Age-prevalence patterns vary substantially by region. London has the highest weighted prevalence nationally at greater than 2% in those aged 55 to 64 and those 65 years and over; and 4% in those aged 13 to 17 and 18 to 24 years.</p>

<p>Large household size, living in a deprived neighbourhood, and black and Asian ethnicity were all associated with increased prevalence. People living in neighbourhoods in the 2 most deprived quintiles had prevalence of 1.79% and 1.95% compared with 1.22% for those in the least deprived.</p>

<p>Participants of black and Asian ethnicity had increased prevalence at 3.07% and 2.80% respectively compared with 1.41% among white participants.</p>

<p>Both healthcare and care home workers, and other key workers, had increased odds of swab-positivity compared to other workers at 1.48 and 1.35 respectively.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>During the period 6 January to 22 January, infections remained high through the period with the SARS-CoV-2 virus circulating at a high prevalence with 157 in 10,000 infected.</p>

<p>Subsequent rounds of REACT-1 will allow further accurate assessment of trends in prevalence and transmission.</p>
