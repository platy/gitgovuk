<p>The Environmental Permitting (England &amp; Wales) Regulations 2016</p>

<h2>Introductory note</h2>

<p>This introductory note is a non-technical summary and does not form a part of these standard rules. Operators will need to check all the rules in detail to make sure they can comply with them at all times.</p>

<p>Any standard permit issued for these rules by the Environment Agency will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name a specific operator who can use the permit</li>
  <li>include a site plan showing where the facility is and its extent</li>
  <li>include a fire prevention plan in Schedule 3</li>
  <li>require the operator to comply with these rules</li>
</ul>

<p>The permit allows a named operator to operate a metal recycling site and permits the sorting, separation, grading, manual feed shearing, baling, compacting, and cutting (using hand-held equipment only) of ferrous metals and non-ferrous metals at a specified location.</p>

<p>No more than 5,000 tonnes of metal recycling waste may be accepted at the facility each year.</p>

<p>Burning of any wastes, either in the open, inside buildings or in any form of incinerator is not permitted.</p>

<p>The operations must be undertaken in accordance with the fire prevention plan in Schedule 3 of this permit.</p>

<p>These rules do not allow any point source emission into surface waters or groundwater. However, under the emissions of substances not controlled by emission limits rule:</p>

<ul>
  <li>liquids may be discharged into a sewer subject to a consent issued by the local water company</li>
  <li>liquids may be taken off-site in a tanker for disposal or recovery</li>
  <li>clean surface water from roofs, or from areas of the site that are not being used in connection with storing and treating waste, may be discharged directly to surface waters, or to groundwater by seepage through the soil through a soakaway</li>
</ul>

<p>The facility must be a minimum distance from certain types of sensitive site. It cannot be within:</p>

<ul>
  <li>200 metres of a European site, Ramsar, Site of Special Scientific Interest or Marine Conservation Zone</li>
  <li>50 metres of a National Nature Reserve, Local Nature Reserve, Local Wildlife Site, Ancient Woodland or Scheduled Ancient Monument</li>
  <li>50 metres of a site that has species or habitats protected under the Biodiversity Action Plan that the Environment Agency considers at risk to this activity</li>
  <li>a groundwater source protection zone 1, or where a source protection zone has not been defined, then not within 100 metres of any well, spring or borehole used for the supply of water for human consumption (including private water supplies)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> Interpretation</h3>

<p>4.3.1 In these standard rules the expressions listed in this rule (4.3) shall have the meaning given.</p>

<p>âaccidentâ means an accident that may result in pollution.</p>

<p>âancient woodlandâ means any area that has been wooded continuously since at least 1600 AD.</p>

<p>âauthorised officerâ means any person authorised by the Environment Agency under section 108(1) of The Environment Act 1995 to exercise, in accordance with the terms of any such authorisation, any power specified in Section 108(4) of that Act.</p>

<p>âbalingâ means baling that utilises a hydraulic machine that using compressive forces compacts various materials into regular-shaped dense bales (typically a cube). Bales may be belted with straps or steel wire to keep the bale in its compacted state; although for most metal bales this is not necessary. Baled scrap metal may be easier to handle, store and transport than loose scrap.</p>

<p>âcutting using hand-held equipmentâ means cutting typically utilising either an oxy-acetylene gas cutting torch or abrasive disc cutter tool to cut or resize large pieces of scrap metal into more manageable sizes; powder torches and plasma torches may be used to cut heat-resistant scrap (for example, pig iron, copper, bronze).</p>

<p>âdecanningâ means cutting open the metal casing surrounding the honeycomb centre of a catalytic converter.</p>

<p>âemissions of substances not controlled by emission limitsâ means emissions of substances to air, water or land from the activities, either from emission points specified in these standard rules or from other localised or diffuse sources, which are not controlled by an emission limit.</p>

<p>âEuropean Siteâ means Special Area of Conservation or candidate Special Area of Conservation or Special Protection Area or proposed Special Protection Area in England and Wales, within the meaning of Council Directives 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds and 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild flora and fauna and the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010. Internationally designated Ramsar sites are dealt with in the same way as European sites as a matter of government policy and for the purpose of these rules will be considered as a European Site.</p>

<p>âgradingâ means the sorting of metals to industry-agreed specifications ready for use, without the need for further treatment, by the end consumer to manufacture new metals.</p>

<p>âgroundwaterâ means all water, which is below the surface of the ground in the saturation zone and in direct contact with the ground or subsoil.</p>

<p>âhazardous wasteâ has the meaning given in the Hazardous Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2005 (as amended).</p>

<p>âimpermeable surfaceâ means a surface or pavement constructed and maintained to a standard sufficient to prevent the transmission of liquids beyond the pavement surface, and should be read in conjunction with the term âsealed drainage systemâ given in this rule.</p>

<p>âpollutionâ means emissions as a result of human activity which may:</p>

<p>(a) be harmful to human health or the quality of the environment
(b) cause offence to a human sense
(c) result in damage to material property, or
(d) impair or interfere with amenities and other legitimate uses of the environment</p>

<h2>Schedule 3: Fire prevention plan</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h3>

<p>Sites that store combustible wastes pose a risk from fires. Fires can cause impacts to receptors off site, for example from smoke plumes and from firewater runoff created by firefighting activities.</p>

<p>This fire prevention plan (<abbr title="fire prevention plan">FPP</abbr>) sets out requirements to meet the 3 objectives of the fire prevention plan guidance. The 3 objectives are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>minimise the likelihood of a fire happening</li>
  <li>aim for a fire to be extinguished within 4 hours</li>
  <li>minimise the spread of fire within the site and to neighbouring sites</li>
</ul>

<p>This plan and its requirements are in addition to any fire risk assessments required by The Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 or other legislation.</p>

<p>Further guidance on <abbr title="fire prevention plan">FPP</abbr> can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-prevention-plans-environmental-permits">Environment Agency guidance</a> available on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Management responsibilities</h3>

<p>The permit holder shall ensure the effective implementation of this fire prevention plan (<abbr title="fire prevention plan">FPP</abbr>). This includes:</p>

  <li>regularly reviewing the <abbr title="fire prevention plan">FPP</abbr> and revising its elements, such as staff training, to ensure that fire risks are appropriately managed</li>
  <li>maintaining and reviewing a fire safety procedure, which details the specific actions that will be taken in the event of a fire on site following a fire or near-miss of a fire, if advised by the Fire and Rescue Service or the Environment Agency</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Using this fire prevention plan</h3>

<h4>3.1 Testing the plan and staff training</h4>

<p>All staff and contractors working on site must be aware of this <abbr title="fire prevention plan">FPP</abbr> and where it is located. Training shall be given so everyone on site knows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how to prevent a fire occurring</li>
  <li>what they must do if there is a fire on site (including use of fire extinguishers, fire blankets, pollution prevention equipment, calling 999, evacuating affected areas and so on)</li>
  <li>the contents of this Fire Prevention Plan</li>
  <li>key people to contact</li>
</ul>

<p>Records of staff training shall be retained. Refresher training shall be provided on at least an annual basis, after any near miss or incident of fire on the site or where the objectives of this <abbr title="fire prevention plan">FPP</abbr> are no longer met.</p>

<p>This <abbr title="fire prevention plan">FPP</abbr> shall be periodically tested (every 6 months as a minimum) to ensure it is fit for purpose and is adapted to meet any changes in the operation of the site.</p>

<p>Site staff must immediately report to senior management any activity or events, including near misses, which could increase the risk of fire on the site.</p>

<h4>3.2 Record keeping</h4>

<p>All checks required by this <abbr title="fire prevention plan">FPP</abbr> shall be recorded and kept available for inspection by the Environment Agency (for example, in the site diary or management system records).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Site plans and maps</h3>

<p>The 3 plans specified in Schedule 2 form part of this permit and this fire prevention plan. The site activities shall be operated in accordance with these plans, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Environment Agency.</p>

<p>The plans shall be reviewed and updated if the activities carried out on site, the site layout, or the drainage and pollution control measures change.</p>

<p>As a minimum the sensitive receptor plan or plans shall be reviewed every 12 months to ensure they accurately reflect the nearby sensitive receptors.</p>

  <li>no hot works or cutting shall be carried out near vegetated or grassed areas during hot and dry weather periods</li>
</ul>

<h4>7.8 Waste acceptance procedures</h4>

<p>Only metal wastes listed in Schedule 1 to this permit shall be accepted. These metal wastes must not be contaminated with other non-metallic wastes (contrary materials) which would potentially increase the risk of fire and pollution. The following measures shall be put in place to reduce the risk of fire:</p>

<ul>
  <li>robust waste acceptance and rejection procedures to avoid receiving unwanted items</li>
  <li>if waste is accepted from third parties, they must understand only wastes listed in schedule 1 to this permit can be accepted</li>
  <li>loads containing contrary materials, including but not limited to, wood, plastic, paper, rubber, containers that are not empty or pressurised cylinders shall be rejected</li>
  <li>if waste is collected, the load must be checked before it is removed to ensure it does not contain contrary materials and if it contains contrary materials, it shall be rejected, or the contrary materials removed at the producer site</li>
  <li>any incidental materials that are found in loads of metal wastes when they are tipped shall be separated from the metal wastes</li>
  <li>these incidental materials and any residues from the processing of metal wastes shall be stored on an impermeable surface with sealed drainage either in a container, or a designated bay â this area must be sited a minimum of 6 metres away from the wastes that are being stored and processed in accordance with the permit</li>
  <li>these incidental materials and residues shall be removed from site and taken to a suitably permitted facility at least once a month, or before the quantity reaches 3m<sup>3</sup> whichever is the soonest</li>
  <li>if the incidental materials are lithium primary or lithium ion batteries, they must be removed within 5 days from the date when they were accepted on site</li>
</ul>

<h4>7.8.1 Unauthorised batteries</h4>

<ul>
  <li>if any batteries other than lead-acid batteries are discovered in, or amongst a load, they shall be immediately segregated from the waste and stored so that they cannot be damaged in a lidded water-tight container, or in a container within a building</li>
  <li>
    <p>unauthorised batteries shall be removed from site and taken to a suitably permitted facility at least once a month
If the unauthorised batteries are lithium primary or lithium ion batteries, they present a greater fire risk than other batteries. Fires can start if the battery is:</p>
  </li>
  <li>damaged</li>
  <li>exposed to moisture</li>
  <li>exposed to high temperatures</li>
</ul>

<p>To prevent fires occurring any battery that is, or is suspected to be, a lithium or lithium ion battery, shall be checked for damage and stored in a watertight, lidded container filled with sand or vermiculite. The container shall be capable of protecting the battery or batteries stored within it from damage. This container:</p>

<ul>
  <li>shall be located at least 6 metres away from any buildings, plant equipment, waste or combustible materials</li>
  <li>if the 6 metre distance cannot be achieved, it shall be stored within a fire resistant enclosure</li>
  <li>storage location shall be shown on the plan in schedule 3</li>
</ul>

<p>These batteries shall be removed from site as soon as practicable, or within 1 month.</p>

<ul>
  <li>the site must be immediately closed and cease accepting waste</li>
  <li>the Fire and Rescue Service shall be notified</li>
  <li>if safe to do so, a small fire may be tackled by site staff</li>
  <li>mobile plant and vehicles shall be moved from the areas adjacent to the fire to prevent the fire spreading and escalating</li>
  <li>where safe to do so, waste and items adjacent to the fire shall be moved to isolate the fire and minimise the amount of combustible materials and waste involved in the fire</li>
  <li>any drains on site shall be sealed off using clay mats or drain blockers</li>
  <li>fire water shall be prevented from leaving the site or entering ditches and roadside drainage systems</li>
  <li>the site shall remain closed to waste acceptance until declared safe to reopen by the emergency authorities</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">13. </span> Water supplies</h3>

<p>The available water supply required is 138,600 litres of water. One of the following water sources must be available for the site.</p>

<h4>Hydrant available</h4>

<p>A hydrant conforming to British Standard 750 or equivalent must be located within 100 metres of the site access and maintained by the Fire and Rescue Service or other competent maintenance organisation</p>

<h4>Hydrant not available</h4>

<p>Water must be available on site in a tank or other storage facility of not less than 20,000 litres. The coupling on the tank must be agreed with the local Fire and Rescue Service as compatible with their equipment. This tank or storage facility must be checked at least once a week to ensure it is holding 20,000 litres.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14. </span> Managing fire water</h3>

<p>You must ensure that fire water is contained and prevent it from reaching sensitive receptors or causing pollution. In a worst-case scenario this could be up to 138,600 litres of water. Fire water shall be contained using a combination of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>impermeable pavement, kerbing and areas of sealed drainage</li>
  <li>sandbags, polybooms or other equipment that can be used to contain firewater to within the site</li>
  <li>drain blockers and clay mats to protect drainage systems to surface water and foul sewer (unless the water company has agreed in writing that firewater from the site can be discharged to the foul sewer)</li>
  <li>a tanker company must be contracted with a callout arrangement of 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to recover firewater from contained areas and the drainage system</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">15. </span> During and after an incident</h3>

<h4>15.1 Clearing, decontaminating and making the site operational after a fire</h4>

<p>Following a fire and before any waste is accepted on to site the following actions shall be carried out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any waste burnt during a fire shall be removed from site and disposed of at a suitably authorised facility</li>
  <li>contaminated water within the drainage system shall be sampled, removed from site and taken to a suitably authorised facility</li>
  <li>the site hardstanding, impermeable pavement and sealed drainage system shall be inspected for damage and contamination and any damage shall be reported to the Environment Agency regarding sampling and further investigation</li>
  <li>any areas of hardstanding, impermeable pavement or sealed drainage that are damaged shall be repaired prior to receipt of waste on the site</li>
  <li>if any waste containing persistent organic pollutants (<abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr>) is involved in a fire, residues from that fire and the firewater may contain <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr> and must be treated in accordance with the <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr> Regulations</li>
  <li>the cause of the fire shall be investigated, and any lessons learnt and improvements made to site procedures shall be documented, communicated to all site staff and implemented</li>
</ul>
