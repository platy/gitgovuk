<p>This guidance sets out what to include in your site plans and maps.</p>

<h2>Plan 1 – activities at the site</h2>

<p>Plan 1 is the site specific plan (or plans) of activities at the site. These must include a site-specific plan (or plans) drawn to a scale that is large enough to clearly identify activities, buildings, working areas, plant and equipment that are critical to the safe operation of the site.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency will expect, as a minimum, the following to be shown on Plan 1:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the layout of buildings, bays, skips and yard areas</li>
  <li>the storage area or areas for wastes including the areas where the different types of wastes are stored and quantities stored in those areas</li>
  <li>the area or areas where treatment activities are carried out for example sorting, separation, grading of different metals, including the areas where metals are sheared, baled, compacted or cut</li>
  <li>the storage area for processed metals and quantities stored in those areas</li>
  <li>the storage area for fines and non-metal waste from the waste treatment activities and quantities stored in those areas</li>
  <li>quarantine area or areas that could be used during a fire</li>
  <li>quarantine area or areas for unauthorised waste</li>
  <li>the lead-acid battery storage area</li>
  <li>any areas where hazardous and flammable materials are stored on site (location of gas cylinders, oil and fuel tanks, welding and cutting gas cylinder storage areas)</li>
  <li>all possible ignition sources on your site such as cutting and welding areas</li>
  <li>the location of where any fixed plant or where mobile plant is stored when not in use</li>
  <li>location of fire hydrants or other water supplies that will be used</li>
  <li>location of fire extinguishers, sand and other firefighting measures</li>
  <li>main access routes for fire engines and any alternative access and any access points around the site perimeter to assist firefighting</li>
</ul>

<h2>Plan 2 – drainage and pollution control</h2>

<p>Plan 2 is the site specific plan (or plans) of drainage and pollution control at the site. It must include a site-specific plan (or plans) drawn to a scale that is large enough to clearly identify all aspects of drainage and pollution control at the site.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency will expect, as a minimum, the following to be shown on Plan 2:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the drainage runs and manholes on the site and where they flow to</li>
  <li>any sealed sumps and interceptors (including the capacity)</li>
  <li>areas of impermeable surface and areas of hardstanding</li>
  <li>pollution control features such as penstocks and drain closure valves on interceptors and drainage systems</li>
  <li>areas where fire water can be contained for example bunded or kerbed areas</li>
  <li>dry ditches and watercourses that may be impacted by fire water run-off</li>
  <li>location of any discharges to foul sewer</li>
  <li>location of any soakaways on site and the areas they drain, such as roof water soakaways</li>
  <li>the surface water drains on site and adjacent to the site</li>
  <li>the location any pollution control kit (for example deployable booms, sand bags, mats/covers to seal drains and any other kit you will use to contain firewater)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Plan 3 – Sensitive receptors near the site</h2>

<p>Plan 3 is the site specific plan of sensitive receptors within a 1km radius of the site. It must include a site-specific plan (or plans) drawn to a scale that is large enough to clearly identify all sensitive receptors located within a 1km radius of the site that could be affected by a fire.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency will expect, as a minimum, the following to be shown on Plan 3:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the site location</li>
  <li>a compass rose showing north and the prevailing wind direction</li>
  <li>schools, hospitals, nursing and care homes, residential, industrial and commercial areas</li>
  <li>roads, railways, bus stations, other public transport centres, pylons (on or immediately adjacent to the site), gas distribution sites, electricity substations, other utilities, airports</li>
