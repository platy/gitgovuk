<p>Government has announced new national measures in England from Thursday 5 November, to control the spread of Coronavirus. This means that Government is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Requiring people to stay at home, except for specific purposes.</li>
  <li>Preventing gathering with people you do not live with, except for specific purposes.</li>
  <li>Closing certain businesses and venues.</li>
</ul>

<p>The latest Government guidance can be found at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus" class="govuk-link">www.gov.uk/coronavirus</a>.</p>

<p>We are supporting this national effort and through these challenging times will continue to make protecting the safety of our customers and staff our top priority.</p>

<p>From Thursday 5 November Government therefore advises our boating customers to avoid non-essential travel on the waterways and not stay overnight aboard your boat unless it is your primary residence.
For advice on paddle sports please refer to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus" class="govuk-link">www.gov.uk/coronavirus</a>.</p>

<p>Our staff will continue to work, managing and maintaining our waterways within the safe ways of working we have implemented this year. This may include some asset closures for maintenance.</p>

<p>We will continue to maintain our essential services and facilities where we normally offer the service (i.e. water supply, refuse and sewage disposal) for those who live aboard their boats.</p>

<p>We will continue to provide assisted passage at locks where we normally offer this service at this time of year, for those boaters that need to make essential journeys.</p>

<p>We will lift time restrictions on the short stay moorings we own or manage, to assist those who live aboard their boats so they can access essential services.</p>

<p>The Boat Safety Scheme is expected to operate as it has done over the summer and examiners will undertake examinations where safe to do so by putting in place safe working procedures and appropriate risk assessments. Boaters are encouraged to use local examiners.</p>

<p>We will of course continue to keep you updated with advice and guidance as the national situation develops. We have written to boating and navigation groups regularly throughout the Coronavirus pandemic to provide updates on lockdown restrictions and changes on their waterways. We remain committed to doing this and making the information available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environment-agency-waterways-coronavirus-covid-19-update">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>As ever, the safety and wellbeing of the public, boaters, staff and volunteers is our primary concern so please follow the latest advice and social distancing to keep yourself and others safe.</p>
