<p>For latest Coronavirus guidance please visit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environment-agency-waterways-coronavirus-covid-19-update">Environment Agency waterways: Coronavirus (COVID-19) updates</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Following the Prime Minister’s announcement of the 4 step roadmap for lifting coronavirus restrictions, this is our updated guidance for boating customers, which we are issuing ahead of 8 March when the government begins to cautiously ease lockdown restrictions in England. Each step of the roadmap will continue for at least 5 weeks to allow the government to make an assessment before easing restrictions further. Further guidance on the government roadmap can be found here: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021">COVID-19 Response - Spring 2021</a>.</p>

<h2>What this means for our waterways</h2>

<p>For all steps of the government roadmap, those who live aboard their boats can continue to travel to access essential services and facilities.</p>

<p>All boating activity on our waterways should follow the guidance in <a class="govuk-link" href="#table-1">Table 1</a>. From 29 March, as part of the first step, ‘Stay at Home’ restrictions will be lifted, however government guidance instructs you to continue to stay local where possible and minimise travel throughout the first 3 steps of the roadmap. “Staying in your local area means stay in the village, town, or part of the city where you live.” (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">Coronavirus restrictions: what you can and cannot do</a>.)</p>

<p>This means that during the first step from 29th March, people should avoid travelling further than is reasonably necessary on board their boat or to take part in their waterway activity.</p>

<p>All references to permitted activities must still adhere to the latest social distancing rules. COVID-Secure guidance will also remain in place up to and including Step 3 (subject to a proposed review of social distancing rules ahead of Step 4).</p>

<p>Boats and businesses must not cater for groups larger than the legal limits at each step unless meeting the conditions for a permitted organised gathering. These will be reintroduced at Step 2 for outdoor gatherings and Step 3 for indoor gatherings.</p>

<p>Anyone making plans for later in the summer should follow government advice carefully and check <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">GOV.UK</a> to ensure you are keeping yourselves and others safe.</p>

<h2>Our service at this time</h2>

<p>We will continue to support this national effort through these challenging times and will, as always, make protecting the safety of our customers and staff our top priority.</p>

<p>Our staff continue to work, managing and maintaining our waterways within the safe ways of working we have implemented over the past year. As we start to follow the roadmap out of government restrictions, our operational priorities will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensuring safe navigation, by inspecting each reach of our waterways for obstructions and marking them accordingly</li>
  <li>a safe, phased approach to resume assisted passage in line with government advice that gives staff time to adjust to new ways of working</li>
  <li>recruitment of Environment Agency seasonal staff, aiming for their return on 1 April 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>As we start to move out of the current lockdown, some local restrictions may still be in place and assets could be subject to closures for maintenance. Our level of service may also be affected due to some staff who are vulnerable and still need to shield. This means some tasks may not be carried out straight away, including assisted passage at some locks, however wherever possible we will maintain essential services and facilities for those boaters who live aboard and who have to make essential journeys.</p>
