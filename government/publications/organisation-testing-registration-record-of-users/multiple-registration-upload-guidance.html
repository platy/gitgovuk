<h2>Purpose of this guidance</h2>

<p>This is a step-by-step guide on how to register multiple PCR and rapid lateral flow test kits at once on the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://organisations.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/register-organisation-tests">organisation registration portal</a>.</p>

<p>It covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the benefits of using multiple upload to register multiple test kits at once</li>
  <li>the information you’ll need to have to hand before you begin</li>
  <li>how to download the multiple upload spreadsheet, formerly known as the record-keeping spreadsheet</li>
  <li>how to fill in the multiple upload spreadsheet before testing</li>
  <li>how to upload the multiple upload spreadsheet to register or report test kits</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>A new version of the spreadsheet was introduced on 19 May. You can now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>input the test details at the beginning and directly on to the spreadsheet, saving time</li>
  <li>input both PCR and rapid lateral flow tests into the spreadsheet</li>
  <li>if registering a rapid lateral flow test, you’ll be able to add the result in the spreadsheet too</li>
  <li>check all the details before submitting, using the updated review page</li>
</ul>

<p>You must always use the most up-to-date version of the multiple upload spreadsheet</p>
</div>

<h3>The benefits of using the multiple upload feature to register test kits</h3>

<p>User research has shown that registering each PCR test kit one at a time is a time-consuming and resource-intensive process.</p>

<p>Multiple registration upload (bulk registration) has been developed to address this issue by allowing you to register up to 100 test kits at once.</p>

<p>Organisations are now able to register PCR and rapid lateral flow tests, and report rapid lateral flow test results, using a single spreadsheet. To do this, you will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>download the updated spreadsheet – do not add any sheets, rows or columns</li>
  <li>enter details for up to 100 tests at a time</li>
  <li>use separate spreadsheets for staff and residents</li>
  <li>save the completed spreadsheet then upload it</li>
</ul>

<p>When performed correctly, multiple registration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>significantly speeds up the registration process</li>
  <li>significantly reduces the administration effort required to register test kits</li>
  <li>gives those registering test kits significant time back to complete other tasks</li>
</ul>

<h3>What you’ll need to register test kits online</h3>

<p>1. You’ll need your unique organisation number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>).</p>

<p>This is 8 digits long, unique to your organisation and is used to access all the National Testing Programme’s online services. All users of the organisation registration portal will have been sent their <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> from <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk">organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<div role="note" class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information">
<p>If you need to be reminded of your UON, you can visit the <a href="https://organisation-number-lookup.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk" class="govuk-link" rel="external">UON lookup</a> or contact the National Testing Programme Contact Centre on 119.</p>
</div>

<p>2. You’ll need the personal information of all those who you are registering test kits for, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first and last name of staff member/non-staff member</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>gender</li>
  <li>ethnic group</li>
  <li>first line of address, country and postcode – for staff this should be their home address, for non-staff resident at your organisation this should be the organisation address</li>
  <li>NHS number</li>
  <li>working circumstances, area of work, occupation and employer</li>
  <li>email of the person who should receive the test result</li>
  <li>phone number of the person who should receive the test result</li>
  <li>symptoms status at the time the test was taken</li>
</ul>

<p>3. You’ll need to collect the 11-digit barcode number of each test and the date and time that each test was taken. Retain a record of which barcode relates to which person.</p>

<p>4. You’ll need the consent of anyone you are registering a test kit for, to do so on their behalf.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Agreement should be documented in writing and obtained in line with your usual policies and procedures</li>
  <li>Results should be returned to the persons you are registering test kits for using their email address and mobile phone number</li>
  <li>However, you can get test results sent to you (as a manger) or a generic email address for your organisation (where access is restricted to you, management or key personnel), if you have written consent from the persons you are registering. It is then your responsibility to communicate the results of each test in a timely manner</li>
</ul>

<h2>Multiple registration upload process overview</h2>

<p>1. Download the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/organisation-testing-registration-record-of-users" class="govuk-link">multiple upload spreadsheet</a></p>

<p>2. Pre-populate the personal details. Create separate master spreadsheets of up to 100 staff members and 100 non-staff members, and save these to be re-used every time you register tests. When individuals are not being tested on a particular day, their details should be removed from the spreadsheet and a new, dated copy saved for upload that day</p>

<p>3. Conduct testing. You are now able to input the details of tests kits directly into the spreadsheet. You no longer need to go back at the end to enter the test kit details in the portal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use the drop-down list in column A to choose the test type</li>
  <li>column B can be inputted by typing in the barcode number or by scanning in using the handheld scanner provided to you by NHS Test and Trace</li>
  <li>if registering a rapid lateral flow test, you can report the test result in column G</li>
  <li>If you select PCR as the test type in column A, the spreadsheet will automatically grey out the ‘test result’ in column G</li>
</ul>

<p>4. You must enter a new row of data for each individual test being registered. You can register both PCR and rapid lateral flow tests for the same staff member on the same spreadsheet. You must input each test on its own row</p>

<p>5. <a href="https://organisations.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/register-organisation-tests" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Upload the saved electronic copy of the pre-populated record-keeping spreadsheet onto the online portal</a></p>

<p>6. A new screen is introduced allowing you to check the details of rapid lateral flow and PCR tests. Error messages will appear if a user updates the ‘Test kit barcode’ field with the wrong type of test barcode</p>

<p>7. Confirmation page and an email confirmation sent. The service now sends a confirmation email that summarises test kits registered. This email will be sent to the email address we have on file for your account. If you do not have an email address on file, no confirmation email will be sent. If you do not think we have the right email address for your organisation, please call 119</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>Step 7 refers to confirmation emails only and does not refer to test results, which will still be sent to the email and phone number provided during the registration process.</p>
</div>

<h3>Pre-populating the multiple upload spreadsheet</h3>

<p>To get the most benefit from using multiple upload to register more than one test kit at once and maximise the time saved on every testing day, you should pre-populate the spreadsheet with your staff and residents’ personal details.</p>

<p>You may want to print a copy of each complete spreadsheet for ease of record-keeping. However, all required information can now be inputted directly into the spreadsheet.</p>

<p>You can use the handheld scanners provided to you by NHS Test and Trace to further speed up the registration process by scanning test kits barcodes directly into the spreadsheet.</p>

<h3>Tips</h3>

<p>Once master spreadsheets have been created and saved, the personal information they contain can be re-used every time you test to speed up the registration process.</p>

<p>On each subsequent testing day, open the master spreadsheets and created new, dated copies of each. Remove the personal details of any person not being tested on that day, and save the dated copy so it can be uploaded to the organisation registration portal to register completed test kits. Save a copy for your records.</p>

<p>When conducting both types of testing on the same day for the same person, you’ll need to create 2 separate rows on the spreadsheet – one for the PCR test and the other for the rapid lateral flow test.</p>

<p>You’ll have to remember to keep the master spreadsheet up to date by adding or removing people as they join or leave your organisation.</p>

<h3>Things to remember when populating the spreadsheet</h3>

<p>All tabs can now be populated on the spreadsheet directly. You can also use the handheld scanners to scan tests barcodes directly into the spreadsheet.</p>

<p>When filling out the postcode field, you must enter the residential postcode of the person being tested, not the postcode of the organisation (unless the person permanently resides at the organisation’s address). This postcode is used to match GP records and is an NHS mandated requirement.</p>

<p>When populating the spreadsheet please ensure that it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is complete and accurate for all individuals being registered</li>
  <li>only contains details for up to 100 people at a time</li>
  <li>is in the correct Excel file format (.xlsx)</li>
  <li>does not contain any extra sheets, rows or columns, as this may impact the data upload</li>
</ul>

<h3>Uploading the spreadsheet to the portal</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Check the boxes to confirm that you have consent to register each person and for results to be sent to the contact details entered for them. Select ‘continue’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter your 8-digit <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> and select ‘continue’ (if you are a school or prison you’ll be taken down a different journey at this point)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check your organisation details and select ‘continue’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For multiple registration, you’ll have to select the first option on this screen (‘use our spreadsheet to add a list of patients’). Select ‘continue’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select whether you are registering staff or non-staff and select ‘continue’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select ‘choose file’ to upload your completed record-keeping spreadsheet and once uploaded, select ‘upload’ to proceed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check rapid lateral flow tests details. An error message will appear if you update the ‘test kit barcode’ field with a PCR test kit barcode. To see details in full, select ‘view personal details’ under each name. Confirm the details are correct, then press ‘save and continue’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check PCR test details. An error message will appear if you update the ‘test kit barcode’ field with a rapid lateral flow test kit barcode. To see details in full, select ‘view personal details’ under each name. Confirm the details are correct, then press ‘save and continue’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check that the summary details are correct before selecting ‘save and continue’ to register your test kits</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complete the security check and submit your registration by selecting ‘continue’. You’ll be unable to amend any details after ‘continue’ has been selected</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your tests will now have been registered and a confirmation page will appear. You can select to register more test kits if needed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A summary email will be sent to the email address NHS Test and Trace has on record for your organisation</p>
  </li>
</ol>
