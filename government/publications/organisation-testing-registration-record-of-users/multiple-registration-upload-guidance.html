<h2>Purpose of this guidance</h2>

<p>This is a step-by-step guide to how to register multiple PCR test kits at once on the organisation registration portal.</p>

<p>It covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the benefits of using multiple upload to register multiple test kits at once</li>
  <li>the information you’ll need to have to hand before you begin</li>
  <li>how to download the record-keeping spreadsheet</li>
  <li>how to fill in the record-keeping spreadsheet before testing, and</li>
  <li>how to upload the record-keeping spreadsheet to register test kits</li>
</ul>

<h2>The benefits of using the multiple upload feature to register test kits</h2>

<p>User research has shown that registering each PCR test kit one at a time is a time-consuming and resource-intensive process.</p>

<p>Multiple registration upload (bulk registration) has been developed to address this issue by allowing you to register up to 100 test kits at once.</p>

<p>When performed correctly, multiple registration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>significantly speeds up the registration process</li>
  <li>significantly reduces the administration effort required to register test kits</li>
  <li>gives those registering test kits significant time back to complete other tasks</li>
</ul>

<h2>What you’ll need to register test kits online</h2>

<p>1. You’ll need your unique organisation number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>).</p>

<p>This is 8 digits long, unique to your organisation and is used to access all the National Testing Programme’s online services. All users of the organisation registration portal will have been sent their <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> from <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk">organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>If you need to be reminded of your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>, you can do so by visiting the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://organisation-number-lookup.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/"><abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> lookup</a> or by contacting the National Testing Programme Contact Centre on:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

119 in England, Northern Ireland and Wales
<br>0300 303 2713 in Scotland
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>2. You’ll need the personal information of all those who you are registering test kits for, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first and last name of staff member/non-staff member</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>gender</li>
  <li>ethnic group</li>
  <li>first line of address, country and postcode – for staff this should be their home address, for non-staff resident at your organisation this should be the organisation address</li>
  <li>NHS number</li>
  <li>working circumstances, area of work, occupation and employer</li>
  <li>email of the person who should receive the test result</li>
  <li>phone number of the person who should receive the test result</li>
  <li>symptoms status at the time the test was taken</li>
</ul>

<p>3. You’ll need to collect the 11-digit barcode number of each test and the date and time that each test was taken. Retain a record of which barcode relates to which person.</p>

<p>4. You’ll need the consent of anyone you are registering a test kit for, to do so on their behalf.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Agreement should be documented in writing and obtained in line with your usual policies and procedures</li>
  <li>Results should be returned to the persons you are registering test kits for using their email address and mobile phone number</li>
  <li>However, you can get test results sent to you (as a manger) or a generic email address for your organisation (where access is restricted to you, management or key personnel), if you have written consent from the persons you are registering. It is then your responsibility to communicate the results of each test in a timely manner</li>
</ul>

<h2>Multiple registration upload process overview</h2>

<p>1. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/organisation-testing-registration-record-of-users" class="govuk-link">Download the record-keeping spreadsheet</a></p>

<p>2. Pre-populate the personal details. Create separate master spreadsheets of up to 100 staff members and 100 non-staff members, and save these to be re-used every time you register tests. When individuals are not being tested on a particular day, their details should be removed from the spreadsheet and a new, dated copy saved for upload that day</p>

<p>3. Conduct testing. When testing, print out copies of the spreadsheet to manually fill in columns A and B, recording the barcode number and date and time of test. You can stick copies of the barcode onto the spreadsheet against each</p>

<p>4. <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.uk/register-organisation-tests">Upload the saved electronic copy of the pre-populated record-keeping spreadsheet</a> onto the online portal</p>

<p>5. Fill in the barcodes and time of tests when required in the organisation registration portal. Refer to the printed copies of the record-keeping spreadsheet for this info</p>

<h2>Pre-populating the record-keeping spreadsheet</h2>

<p>To get the most benefit from using multiple upload to register more than one test kit at once and maximise the time saved on every testing day:</p>

<p>1. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/organisation-testing-registration-record-of-users" class="govuk-link">Download a copy of the record-keeping spreadsheet</a></p>

<p>2. Create and save a master spreadsheet with complete personal details for all staff at your organisation. If you have more than 100 staff members, you will have to use multiple spreadsheets to cover all staff members</p>

<p>3. Repeat this to create a master spreadsheet of all non-staff</p>

<p>4. Print a copy of each complete spreadsheet so that when testing you can record the barcode/test kit URN of each test and the date and time the swab was taken for each person being tested. Please note that when printing, only the first seven columns of the spreadsheet will print</p>

<p>5. Upload the pre-populated spreadsheet into the portal and when promoted, enter the barcode and date and time of swab directly into the registration portal. If you have access to a handheld scanner you can use this to further speed up the registration process</p>

<h3>Tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Once master spreadsheets have been created and saved, the personal information they contain can be re-used every time you test to speed up the registration process</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On each subsequent testing day, open the master spreadsheets and created new, dated copies of each. Remove the personal details of any person not being tested on that day, and save the dated copy so it can be uploaded to the organisation registration portal to register completed test kits. Save for your record</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will have to remember to keep the master spreadsheet up to date by adding or removing people as they join or leave your organisation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Things to remember when populating the spreadsheet</h3>

<p>Some fields are mandatory, while others are optional. The status column indicates when the spreadsheet is complete and ready for upload – for example, that all mandatory information has been input correctly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A greyed out box will mean that the information requested is not mandatory</li>
  <li>Test kit barcode/URN and time of swab taken are for reference only – you will not be able to type them directly into the spreadsheet. You will need to enter these on the online portal to ensure absolute accuracy</li>
  <li>When filling out the postcode field, you must enter the residential postcode of the person being tested, not the postcode of the organisation (unless the person permanently resides at the organisation’s address). This postcode is used to match GP records and is an NHS mandated requirement</li>
  <li>When populating the spreadsheet please ensure that it:
    <ul>
      <li>is complete and accurate for all individuals being registered</li>
      <li>only contains details for up to 100 people at a time</li>
      <li>is in the correct Excel file format (.xlsx)</li>
      <li>does not contain any extra sheets, rows or columns, as this may impact the data upload</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Common issues to look out for when populating the spreadsheet</h3>

<p>When populating the record-keeping spreadsheet it’s important to look out for common mistakes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Date of birth is a field that is commonly filled in with incorrect dates, for example dates in the distant past or the future</li>
  <li>Some fields like ethnicity have pre-populated drop-downs. Where this is the case, use them, as manually filling in these boxes can cause errors</li>
  <li>Incorrect email addresses are often entered leading to results being sent to the wrong person or bouncing back</li>
  <li>Extra digits or not enough digits are often added into this field. This is not picked up by the validation on the spreadsheets but will be picked up by validation on the portal</li>
  <li>Check that email addresses and mobile numbers are correct and can receive messages – failure to do so is a breach of General Data Protection Regulation regulations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Uploading the spreadsheet: step-by-step process</h2>

<p>Once testing is completed, <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.uk/register-organisation-tests">register the test kits</a>. Complete registration as soon as possible after testing. Click ‘start now’.</p>

<p>1. Check the boxes to confirm that you have consent to register each person and for results to be sent to the contact details entered for them. Click ‘continue’</p>

<p>2. Enter your 8-digit <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> and click ‘continue’. (If you are a school or prison you will be taken down a different journey at this point)</p>

<p>3. For multiple registration, you will have to select the first option on this screen (‘use our spreadsheet to add a list of patients’). Click ‘continue’</p>

<p>4. Select whether you are registering staff or no staff and click ‘continue’</p>

<p>5. Click ‘choose file’ to upload your completed record-keeping spreadsheet and once uploaded, click ‘upload’ to proceed.</p>

<p>Ensure that your spreadsheet:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is complete and accurate for all individuals being registered</li>
  <li>only contains details for 100 people at a time</li>
  <li>is in the correct Excel file format (.xlsx)</li>
  <li>does not contain any extra sheets, rows or columns, as this may impact the data upload</li>
</ul>

<p>6. Select the correct date that the tests were performed and click ‘continue’. The portal will now automatically display the relevant personal details from the record-keeping spreadsheet uploaded. Before entering the barcode/URN and time of test for everyone, please do a quick check of personal details to ensure that they are correct. To see details in full, click view personal details under everyone’s name</p>

<p>7. Complete test details for each person – this comprises of the barcode/URN and the time of the swab test</p>

<p>8. Once you have checked that all personal details are correct and entered all the testing details, you should check the confirmation box and press ‘save and continue’</p>

<p>9. Check that the summary details are correct before clicking ‘confirm’ to register your test kits</p>

<p>10. Complete the security check and submit your registration by clicking ‘continue’. You will be unable to amend any details once continue has been clicked</p>

<p>11. Your tests will now have been registered and a confirmation page will appear. You can click to register more test kits if needed</p>

<p>12. You will receive a confirmation email</p>

<h2>Things to remember</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Record and remember your organisation’s 8-digit <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>. This will be your single organisation identifier for use across all the National Testing Programme’s platforms and services</li>
  <li>Continue to register your test kits as soon as possible after testing</li>
  <li>Ensure that the email address and mobile numbers entered are correct as this is how test results will be communicated</li>
  <li>Register staff and non-staff details separately when using the multiple registration online service to ensure the most accurate and robust records</li>
  <li>Save and re-use your record-keeping spreadsheet. Use the personal details recorded for re-testing. Individuals can simply be added to or removed from the spreadsheet as required. Take care to ensure any retained details are up to date when doing this as people join and leave your organisation</li>
  <li>The individual online registration service is still available. This may be more convenient if you are only registering a few individuals</li>
</ul>
