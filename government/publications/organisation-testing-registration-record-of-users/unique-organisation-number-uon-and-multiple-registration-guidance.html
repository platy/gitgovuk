<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>When registering test kits online, you will now be able to upload up to 50 test kits at once and you will be assigned a unique organisation number to use when using the national testing programme services. This document covers what these changes will look like and what these mean for you, and then walk you through the multiple registration upload portal.</p>

<h2>Unique organisation number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>)</h2>

<p>The National Testing Programme (<abbr title="National Testing Programme">NTP</abbr>) are assigning all of its users a single 8-digit unique organisation number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>) to use for all the programme’s services. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://request-testing.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk">ordering new test kits</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://testkitcollect.co.uk/" rel="external">booking a courier to collect completed kits</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.uk/register-organisation-tests" rel="external">registering completed test kits for results</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> is exclusive to an individual organisation (for example, a care home or GP surgery) and will allow us to have the most up-to-date records for organisations served by the <abbr title="National Testing Programme">NTP</abbr>. Existing users will be provided with UONs via email and will no longer be able to use any previous type of identification (for example <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> ID) when accessing <abbr title="National Testing Programme">NTP</abbr> services.</p>

<p>UONs mean better data quality, which will help inform an array of scientific research currently being undertaken to track the spread of coronavirus and regularly monitor how it is impacting organisations taking part in the testing programme.</p>

<p>You’ll also need to use your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> number when contacting us for support, including if you need to call the <abbr title="National Testing Programme">NTP</abbr> helpdesk or email our logistics mailbox.</p>

<p>If you need to be reminded of your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>, you can do so by visiting <a href="https://organisation-number-lookup.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Unique organisation number lookup</a> or by contacting the National Testing Programme Helpdesk on 119 in England, Northern Ireland and Wales, or 0300 303 2713 in Scotland.</p>

<h2>Multiple registration upload</h2>

<p>Multiple registration upload provides organisations with the ability to register up to 50 completed tests at once.</p>

<p>You will only input your organisation details once per upload, but to use this new feature you will need to download the new record keeping spreadsheet from the online service. This spreadsheet will allow you to input all of your staff and/or residents’ information at once in a way that allows the online service to read the information and register each person correctly.</p>

<p>You will still be able to register test kits individually if you need to, and individual barcodes will still be assigned to each test kit to know which individual has been tested, and who the results need to be returned to.</p>

<p>Visit the <a href="https://gov.uk/register-organisation-tests" class="govuk-link" rel="external">organisation registration service</a>.</p>

<p>Please complete registration as soon as possible after conducting your testing.</p>

<h3>Step 1: access the registration online service</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Look out for our email confirming your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>. This email will come from organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk with the subject title ‘COVID-19: Your new Unique Organisation Number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>)’</li>
  <li>Visit the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.uk/register-organisation-tests">organisation registration service</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2: download the record-keeping spreadsheet</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Once on the portal, please read all the instructions on this page before pressing the ‘Start now’ button</li>
  <li>Download the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://organisations.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/static/Register-organisation-test-template.xlsx">record-keeping spreadsheet</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>You need to register staff and non-staff on separate spreadsheets. Therefore, if you are testing both staff and non-staff, you will need to populate at least 2 spreadsheets</li>
      <li>Do not alter the spreadsheet layout or use any other spreadsheet other than the record-keeping spreadsheet provided via the online service to upload registrations. Trying to upload a different or altered spreadsheet will not work</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 3: populate the record-keeping spreadsheet</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Populate the spreadsheets with the details of the individuals you are testing that day. Again, please ensure all staff being tested are on a separate spreadsheet to non-staff</li>
  <li>For each person you are registering, it is important to enter the correct email address and phone number that you want the results for that individual to be sent to. Failure to do so is a breach of GDPR regulations</li>
  <li>You can get results sent to you (as a manager) or a generic e-mail address for your organisation (where access is restricted to you/management/key personnel) only if you have written consent from the people you are registering. The first 2 cells (‘Test kit <abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr> or barcode’ and ‘Time of swab taken’) will not accept data entry from your keyboard. You will be able to fill this information in after uploading your spreadsheet. Pre-populate personal information on this spreadsheet and print the spreadsheet so that ‘Test kit <abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr> or barcode’ and ‘Time of swab taken’ can be entered at the point of testing. Please note that when printing, only the first 8 columns of the spreadsheet will print</li>
  <li>The ‘Status’ cell in a row will be turn green and display ‘Details complete’ if all the mandatory cells are populated correctly in a row. It will turn red and display ‘Mandatory fields missing’ if some mandatory information is missed in a row</li>
  <li>You must enter the residential postcode of the person being tested, not the postcode of the organisation (unless the person permanently resides at the organisation’s address). This postcode is used to match GP records and is an NHS-mandated requirement</li>
  <li>To maximise administrative efficiencies when re-testing, rather than populate a new spreadsheet every time you test, you may want to create master spreadsheets of all staff and all non-staff. You can then create new copies for each new testing day, and simply remove the details of anybody not being tested on that day, and save the dated copy of each spreadsheet for your organisation’s records. Ensure that the personal details on the master spreadsheets are kept up to date, and remember to add new staff members and non-staff.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 4: confirmation of written consent</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Once you hit ‘Start now’ you will then need to confirm that you have written consent from each person to register them</li>
  <li>Confirm that you have got consent for the results to go to the contact details you have entered on the spreadsheet for each person</li>
  <li>Press ‘Continue’</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 5: select organisation type</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Choose which type of organisation you are</li>
  <li>Press ‘Continue’</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 6: enter your organisation number</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Enter your 8-digit organisation number provided to you by the National Testing Programme (for example, 12345678)</li>
  <li>Press ‘Continue’</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 7: select your registration method</h3>

<ol>
  <li>For multiple registration, select the first option (this will allow you to upload your prepopulated record-keeping spreadsheet)</li>
  <li>For individual registration, select ‘Add each person’s details one by one’</li>
  <li>Press ‘Continue’</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 8: select whether you are registering staff or non-staff</h3>

<p>Staff and non-staff testing is often completed at different times and following different processes. Having separate uploads ensures the accuracy and robustness of all records.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the ‘Staff’ option if you are registering staff</li>
  <li>Select the ‘Non-staff’ option if you are registering non-staff</li>
  <li>Press ‘Continue’</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 9: ipload your completed record-keeping spreadsheet</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Before you upload your spreadsheet, use the following checklist to ensure that your spreadsheet is accurate:
    <ul>
      <li>Check all individuals are accurate and mandatory fields on each row are complete</li>
      <li>Ensure your spreadsheet contains details for 50 people or less</li>
      <li>Ensure your spreadsheet is in the correct Excel file format (.xlsx)</li>
      <li>Ensure your spreadsheet does not contain any extra sheets, rows or columns, as this may impact the data upload</li>
      <li>Ensure the ‘Status’ cell on each populated row is green and displaying ‘Details complete’</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click on ‘Browse’ and choose your spreadsheet from your files that you would like to upload</li>
  <li>Press ‘Upload file’</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 10: select the date that you performed the tests</h3>

<p>This is to let the labs know when the test was taken so that they can ensure that the test is not void.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Enter the date from the 4 options given</li>
  <li>Press ‘Continue’</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 11: enter the test details for each person</h3>

<p>The online service will now automatically display the relevant personal details from the record-keeping spreadsheet upload.</p>

<p>Before entering the barcode/<abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr> (unique reference number) and time of test for each individual, please do a quick check of personal details to ensure that they are correct. To see details in full, click ‘View personal details’ under each individual’s name.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Complete test details for each person – this comprises the barcode/<abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr> and the time of the swab test. Test barcode/<abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr> details need to be entered twice to ensure accuracy. It is recommended that they are written manually rather than copied and pasted</li>
  <li>You can also review the personal details of each individual to ensure that all information has been uploaded correctly by clicking ‘View personal details’ underneath each individual’s name. Please take extra care to ensure that the email address and phone number is correct, as this is where test results will be sent</li>
  <li>When you are sure that all the details are correct, confirm this</li>
  <li>Press ‘Save and continue’</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 12: check that the summary details are correct</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Check your organisation type</li>
  <li>Check your organisation number</li>
  <li>Check your registration type (for example, staff or non-staff)</li>
  <li>Check your number of registrations</li>
  <li>Press ‘Continue’</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 13: complete the security check and submit your registration</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Complete the security check</li>
  <li>Press ‘Continue’ – pressing ‘Continue’ will complete your test kit registration. You will be unable to amend any details once this has been pressed</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 14: confirmation that your test kits are registered</h3>

<p>Your tests will have now been registered. The confirmation page also allows you to register more test kits should you need to, by pressing ‘Register more test kits’.</p>

<p>You will receive a confirmation email that the tests have been registered.</p>

<h2>Receiving results</h2>

<p>Results will be returned within 72 hours. Results will be returned to the email address and phone number that you used to register your test kits as part of the multiple registration upload.</p>
