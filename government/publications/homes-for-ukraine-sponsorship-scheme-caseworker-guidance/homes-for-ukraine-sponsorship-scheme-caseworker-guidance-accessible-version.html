<h3>Publication</h3>

<p>Below is information on when this version of the guidance was published:</p>

<ul>
  <li>version 2.0</li>
  <li>provided to Home Office staff on 29 April 2022</li>
</ul>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>This section tells you about use of this guidance in considering a person’s right to enter or stay in the UK on the basis of their application under the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme.</p>

<h3>Use of this guidance</h3>

<p>This guidance must be used for all decisions made under the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme.</p>

<h3>Other information about this guidance</h3>

<p>Within this guidance there are links to the Migration and Borders Guidance platform that are shown as an ‘internal link’ otherwise links are to the same guidance published on GOV.UK for external access.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Following the statement made by the Home Secretary to Parliament on 1 March 2022, the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme has been introduced to allow Ukrainian nationals and their family members to come to the UK if they have an approved sponsor under the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme.</p>

<p>This bespoke scheme provides a route to those who want to come to the UK who have someone here willing to provide them with a home. It will enable individuals, charities, community groups and businesses to volunteer accommodation and provide a route to safety Ukrainians and their family members.</p>

<p>Sponsors should provide accommodation for as long as they are able, but there is a minimum expectation of 6 months.</p>

<p>People arriving under this scheme will be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>live and work in the UK for up to three years</li>
  <li>access healthcare, benefits, employment support, education, and English language tuition</li>
</ul>

<p>The Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme (HFU) is included in the Immigration Rules under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-ukraine-scheme">Appendix Ukraine Scheme</a>. The Immigration Rules came into force on 30 March, before that the scheme operated outside the Immigration Rules.</p>

<h2>Applications made under both the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme and Ukraine Family Scheme</h2>

<p>Where the customer uses the deferred biometrics process and applies for both the Ukraine Family Scheme and Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme, the more recent application will be uploaded to Proviso. The applications will be routed to the team responsible for assessing the more recent application.</p>

<p>You should consider the more recent application first, unless there is any evidence to indicate this is not the applicant’s preference. Where the more recent application does not meet the requirements under that scheme, you must go on the consider the application under the alternative scheme. You will be responsible for processing and making decisions, when considering an application under the alternative scheme.</p>

<h2>Assessing new applications under both schemes</h2>

<p>If you are not satisfied that the application meets the requirements under the scheme in the most recent application, you must also consider the application against the requirements of the alternative scheme, whether or not the customer made a duplicate application.</p>

<h2>Assessing an application under the alternative scheme</h2>

<p>When assessing an application under the Ukraine Family Scheme (UFS), please refer to the  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukraine-scheme">Ukraine Family Scheme caseworker guidance</a>. You must review the original application, any supporting evidence and if you are satisfied the application will meet the requirement or might with additional supporting evidence, you must contact the customer to confirm that they wish to have their application considered in the alternative route.</p>

<p>If the applicant does not meet the requirements under UFS and HFU is being considered, the applicant must be advised to match with a sponsor before submitting an application.</p>

<h2>Validity requirements</h2>

<p>When assessing validity, you must be prepared to exercise evidential flexibility where possible. See the section on Supporting documents for more guidance.</p>

<p>The validity requirements for all applications on the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme are that the applicant must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have completed the specified application form</li>
  <li>have provided any required biometrics (biometrics are not required before the entry clearance application can be considered where the person has applied under the deferred biometrics process)</li>
  <li>have provided a passport or other document establishing identity and nationality</li>
  <li>be outside the UK on the date of the application</li>
  <li>have provided the name of a UK based sponsor who has offered them accommodation in the UK</li>
  <li>be aged 18 years old or over on the date of application, except where a child (under 18) is applying with, or to join in the UK, a parent or legal guardian in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>You must go on to consider all applications that meet all the validity requirements.</p>

<p>Assess all applications that do not meet all the validity requirements on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>If you are assessing an application from an unaccompanied child, you must refer to the DMC safeguarding lead who will escalate to the Central Services Team safeguarding lead.</p>

<p>Applications that are processed on ATLAS and deemed invalid should be rejected.</p>

<p>Case notes should identify the reason(s) why the application was invalid. Caseworkers should attach the rejection letter to the case record. Where an application is assessed on Proviso, instead of a validity/rejection function, you should use ‘Withdrawn.’</p>

<h3>Specified application form</h3>

<p>An application must be made on the ‘Ukraine Scheme’ application form.</p>

<h3>Fees and Immigration Health Surcharge</h3>

<p>This scheme is free for applicants. They are not required to pay an application fee or the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS). You must not reject an application for nonpayment of the fee or IHS.</p>

<h3>Biometrics and proof of identity</h3>

<p>In all cases, the applicant must satisfactorily establish their identity and nationality.</p>

<h4>Biometrics</h4>

<p>Since 15 March a Ukrainian national with a valid passport has been able to apply online for a Ukraine Scheme visa without the need to enrol their biometrics until after arrival in the UK. As part of the application process they must upload a scanned copy of the photograph page of their valid or expired Ukrainian international passport. If they are applying with an expired Ukrainian international passport, they must upload a copy of the page where the formal extension stamp issued by the Ukrainian government is shown.</p>

<p>All other applicants are required to attend a visa application centre (VAC) to give their biometrics. For applicants aged 5 years or over, this will be their fingerprints and a facial image. Applicants who are under 5 are not required to provide their fingerprints but must still provide a live scan facial image as a biometric. You must refer to the Operating Mandate (HO Sharepoint and FCDO Teams) for details of the checks you are required to undertake.</p>

<p>Children on a parent’s passport, or those without a valid Ukrainian passport must make a separate application and attend a VAC to submit their biometrics before you consider their application.</p>

<h4>Applicant’s identity and nationality documentation</h4>

<p>The best evidence of identity that applicants on the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme can provide is a valid international passport.</p>

<p>There must be an application and an individual travel document, or satisfactory evidence of identity and nationality, for each visa applicant including children.</p>

<p>In the absence of a valid passport, a Ukrainian applicant may provide one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a recently expired passport, which has not exceeded its expiry date by more than 10 years for applicants aged 25 and over, and for applicants aged under 25 years by no more than 5 years;</li>
  <li>a Ukrainian national identity card;</li>
  <li>a combination of other official documents, at least one of which has a facial image, which you are satisfied establishes their identity and nationality, for example a photo driving licence and a birth certificate;</li>
  <li>an emergency certificate issued by a Ukrainian authority since March 2022.</li>
</ul>

<p>Acceptable photographic documents are those that are recorded on a document image archive such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/prado/en/prado-documents/UKR/index.html" rel="external">Council of the European Union – PRADO</a>  or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.edisontd.nl/" rel="external">EdisonTD</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.edisontd.nl/" rel="external">.</a></p>

<h4>Third country nationals</h4>

<p>Third country nationals – non-Ukrainian passport holders – who are eligible to apply because they are an immediate family member of Ukranian citizen must provide their biometrics before they travel to UK and must apply, book a VAC appointment and give biometrics in the usual way.</p>

<h2>Suitability requirements</h2>

<p>You must consider only the following grounds for refusal under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-9-grounds-for-refusal">Part 9 of the Immigration Rules</a> when assessing applications under the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme:</p>

</ul>

<p>Grounds that should normally lead to refusal on suitability grounds but are not included for the purposes of this Scheme:</p>

<ul>
  <li>previous breach of immigration laws (Part 9 9.8.1)</li>
  <li>failure to provide required information (Part 9 9.9.1)</li>

  <li>rough sleeping (Part 9 9.21.1)</li>
  <li>crew members (Part 9 9.22.1)</li>
</ul>

<p>You must conduct Police National Computer (PNC) and Warnings Index (WI) checks on all applicants to support the suitability assessment. You must refer to the Operating Mandate page 28 for WI checks and page 30 for PNC checks (HO Sharepoint and FCDO Teams) for details of the checks you are required to undertake.</p>

<h2>Eligibility requirements</h2>

<p>To qualify for the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme an applicant must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be Ukrainian, or the immediate family member of a qualifying Ukrainian national</li>
  <li>have been residing in Ukraine immediately before 1 January 2022 (including those who have now left Ukraine) unless they are a child born on or after that date</li>
  <li>be outside the UK</li>
  <li>meet the suitability requirements</li>
  <li>have an Approved sponsor under the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme</li>
</ul>

<p>A family group applying together must have the same Approved sponsor under the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship scheme.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind the guidance above on supporting documents, where you are not satisfied the information provided shows an applicant meets the eligibility requirements set out in the Scheme, consider contacting the applicant or their sponsor to give them an opportunity to provide further evidence or explanation.</p>

<h2>Tuberculosis (TB) Testing</h2>

<p>It has been agreed to waive the TB requirement for the Home Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme. The UK Health Security Agency has confirmed it is content for us to waive the TB requirement for Ukrainians in view of the low risk from Ukraine and the current conflict.</p>

<h2>Supporting documents</h2>

<p>There are documentary requirements for both sponsors and applicants. The onus is on the applicant and their sponsor to provide sufficient evidence to prove their identity and nationality, and that they meet the requirements of the scheme.</p>

<p>You must be mindful of the difficulties that people may face in providing documentary evidence of their identity and relationship or the fact that it is subsisting. Those fleeing conflict zones or dangerous situations may not have time to collect supporting documents and may not realise they would be required, and it would not be reasonable to expect this.</p>

<p>Your starting position should be that the applicant has given honest answers in their application, and that you should consider requesting more information only where you have concerns. You must speak to an entry clearance manager (ECM) or senior caseworker (SCW) before contacting the applicant.</p>

<p>Although the burden of proof is on the applicant to show they meet the requirements of the Scheme the standard of proof is the balance or probabilities (as in, more likely than not) and you should take into account the current situation in Ukraine and the difficulty in obtaining documentary evidence when making your decision.</p>

<h3>No adequate documentation</h3>

<p>If the applicant does not have documentary evidence you may request further information about the application, but you must check with your line manager before doing so. Where the applicant does not have any documents, if they have not already done so in their application, you should ask them to explain why and give them an opportunity to provide any other documentation. You must speak to an ECM or SCW before contacting the applicant. If you are satisfied that this explanation and any additional documentation satisfactorily establishes their identity and nationality record this on the caseworking system.</p>

<p>If you have any doubts about the application and are not able to obtain further information, you made need to refer the case to the entry clearance manager (ECM) or senior caseworker (SCW)</p>

<p>You can find additional guidance on acceptable evidence in the Family reunion guidance.</p>

<h3>False documents and evidence</h3>

<p>You must consider suitability if you are satisfied false documents or evidence were submitted. This is covered in the grounds for refusal section of this guidance.</p>

<h2>Nationality requirements</h2>

<p>Applicants to the scheme must be Ukrainian nationals and Third Country Nationals (TCN) applying as part of a family group where there their immediate family member who is a Ukrainian national also qualifies under this scheme.</p>

<h2>Applicant must be outside of the UK</h2>

<p>An applicant must be outside of the UK on the date of application. Where a person was issued a permission to travel (PTT) letter they will need to register their details on ‘light touch’ Ukraine Scheme form to facilitate the collection on biometrics incountry during the validity of the LOTR grant from BF.</p>

<h2>Ordinarily resident in Ukraine</h2>

<p>To qualify for the scheme a person must have been ordinarily resident in Ukraine immediately before 1 January 2022 unless they are a child born after on or after that date.</p>

<p>The starting point for decision makers is to believe the applicant if they say they were resident in Ukraine on or immediately before 1 January 2022. The conflict may have significantly reduced an applicant’s ability to obtain documents proving residence.</p>

<p>Applicants who were resident in Crimea should be treated as meeting the residence requirements under the scheme.</p>

<p>If you believe an applicant was not resident in Ukraine immediately before 1 January 2022, you may request further information. You must speak to an ECM or SCW before contacting the applicant.</p>

<p>This is a non-exhaustive list of evidence an applicant can submit to confirm they were ordinarily resident in Ukraine immediately before 1 January 2022:</p>

<ul>
  <li>passport</li>
  <li>official documents issued by the Ukrainian authorities</li>
  <li>utility bills</li>
  <li>bank statements</li>
  <li>medical letters</li>
  <li>mortgage or tenancy agreements</li>
  <li>employment letters</li>
  <li>education letters</li>
</ul>

<p>Any applicant who was not ordinarily resident in Ukraine immediately before 1 January 2022, will not qualify under the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme.</p>

<h2>Non-Ukrainian nationals</h2>

<p>Unless they are the immediate family member of a Ukrainian national, non-Ukrainian nationals do not qualify under the Scheme. For example, a Nigerian national who was studying in Ukraine would not qualify unless they have an immediate family member who is a Ukrainian national who qualifies under the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme.</p>

<h2>Unaccompanied minors</h2>

<p>Unaccompanied children and orphans are not eligible to apply under the scheme.</p>

<p>Under 18s applying for the scheme must be applying with their parent or legal guardian, or to join them in the UK.</p>

<h2>Additional considerations relating to children</h2>

<p>Where an applicant is aged under 18 and they are travelling with a parent to the UK, they do not have to evidence parental consent. If they are joining (and not accompanying) a parent already in the UK, they must provide written consent from the parent in the UK who they are joining. The consent requirement can be waived if the caseworker is satisfied that it is reasonable in the circumstances to grant entry clearance or permission. Where you have reasons to believe there may be an issue with consent, for example, if the parent the child is joining does not usually live with or care for the child and you do not have consent from the parent who usually lives with and cares from them, you should seek further information. The written consent must confirm support for all of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the application</li>
  <li>that the applicant will live with the parent in the UK</li>
  <li>the applicant’s travel to, and reception arrangements in the UK</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship requirement</h2>

<p>To be eligible under the Homes for Ukraine Scheme at least one member of the family group must be a Ukranian national.</p>

<p>A non-Ukrainian who is an immediate family member of a Ukrainian national who qualifies under the Scheme also qualifies.</p>

<p>Immediate family member means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>partner of the Ukrainian national</li>
  <li>child aged under 18 on the date of application of the Ukrainian national or of their partner</li>
  <li>parent of a Ukrainian national child aged under 18 (where the child is applying under the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme)</li>
  <li>fiancé or fiancée or proposed civil partner of the Ukrainian national</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a non-Ukranian is applying as a partner, fiancé fiancée or proposed civil partner, the relationship must be genuine and subsisting and must have commenced before 1 January 2022.</p>

<p>You should refer to the section on Evidence in the Family reunion guidance for more help with assessing an application where documents are missing.</p>

<p>A parent may be able to provide a birth certificate to indicate relationship with a child. Children and parent sharing the same surname may also be an indication of relationship.</p>

<p>The onus is on the applicant to provide sufficient evidence to satisfy you they are related as claimed. You must consider whether, on the ‘balance of probabilities’, there is sufficient information to accept that applicants are related as claimed being mindful of the difficulties that people may face in providing documentary evidence of their relationship or the fact that it is subsisting. Those fleeing conflict zones or dangerous situations may not have time to collect supporting documents and may not realise they would be required.</p>

<h3>Relationship definitions</h3>

<p>Partner means a person’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>spouse</li>
  <li>civil partner</li>
  <li>unmarried partner, where the couple have been living together in a relationship similar to marriage or a civil partnership for at least 2 years</li>
</ul>

<p>Partners must meet the requirements of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-relationship-with-partner">Appendix Relationship with Partner</a>.</p>

<h2>Approved sponsor requirement</h2>

<p>To be eligible under the Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme the applicant must have an approved sponsor in the UK.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/homes-for-ukraine-sponsor-guidance">Eligibility and suitability requirements</a>  to be approved as a sponsor are published by the Department for Levelling Up, Community and Housing for the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme.</p>

<h3>Approved sponsor must be based in the UK</h3>

<p>Caseworkers must confirm that the approved sponsor’s address and the address of the proposed accommodation is in the UK.</p>

<h2>The Crown Dependencies</h2>

<p>The Isle of Man is the only Crown Dependency operating a comparable scheme which mirrors the UK’s Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme (HFU).</p>

<p>Individuals will apply for the Isle of Man’s HFU route using the same application form as those applying under the UK’s HFU Scheme and if granted, they will be issued with the same duration and conditions of stay.</p>

<p>Caseworkers must not process applications to Jersey and Guernsey under the HFU as they are not offering one.</p>

<h3>Identifying Crown Dependency applications</h3>

<p>Caseworkers can identify Isle of Man applications by checking the HFU Scheme application form for the sponsor address. Postcodes in the Isle of Man are in the same format as for the UK:</p>

<p>• Isle of Man postcodes begin ‘IM’</p>

<h4>Referral</h4>

<p>Caseworkers must refer all applications to the Isle of Man using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-travel-area">standard referral</a>  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-travel-area">form</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-travel-area">.</a></p>

<p>The CTA guidance (unredacted version) contains contact details for the Isle of Man.</p>

<p>Applications, where a sponsor address is not in the UK or Crown Dependencies address as described above should be refused.</p>

<h4>Granting entry clearance</h4>

<p>The Isle of Man’s immigration department will make a decision on the application. If they authorise you to issue, do so as follows:</p>

<h4>Deferred biometrics applications:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Main endorsement: Ukraine Scheme LOTR</li>
  <li>Cat D endorsement: Code 1A (Work permitted)</li>
  <li>Duration: 6 months</li>
  <li>BRP visa: No</li>
  <li>Destination: UNITED KINGDOM</li>
  <li>Permission to Travel (PTT) letter: Yes (we will issue the standard PTT letter and the Isle of Man will advise applicants separately on processes to follow once in their jurisdiction)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Biometrics enrolled applications</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Main endorsement: Ukraine Scheme LOTR</li>
  <li>Cat D endorsement: Code 1A (Work permitted)</li>
  <li>Duration: 3 years (36 months)</li>
  <li>BRP visa: No</li>
  <li>Destination: UNITED KINGDOM</li>
  <li>Permission to Travel (PTT) letter: No</li>
</ul>

<h3>Approved sponsor’s identification documentation</h3>

<p>To meet the requirement of approved sponsors they must provide evidence of their identity. This must be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK or Irish passport or Irish passport card</li>
  <li>a Biometric Residence Permit or Biometric Residence Card</li>
  <li>a refugee travel document</li>
  <li>a photo driving licence issued by the UK, Ireland, or the Crown Dependencies</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, if the sponsor or the adults the applicant will be living with have an eVisa you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/view-prove-immigration-status">enter their ‘share codes’ in the box</a>  on this page to check their identities. British citizen sponsors are asked to provide a copy of their biodata page of their passport, which may include a recently expired passport that has not been replaced. If this is not submitted, or you wish to verify authenticity ask your authorised Data Validation Application (DVA) user to make checks for you.</p>

<p>Holders of EU settled status must provide a copy of the front and back of their biometric residence card (BRC) if they hold one, or the identity document they used to register their online status, along with their date of birth.</p>

<p>Holders of other forms of immigration permission should submit a copy of both sides of their biometric residence permit, or other evidence if their permission was granted before BRPs were issued, such as a wet stamp or vignette.</p>

<p>Holders of eVisas, such as holders of EU Settlement Scheme leave, can submit the ‘something else’ purpose ShareCode, which starts with an ‘S’, alongside their date of birth, which can be generated using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/view-prove-immigration-status">View and prove your immigration status</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/view-prove-immigration-status">,</a> which remains valid for up to 90-days from when it was generated. Alternatively, they can provide a copy of their ‘Written notification of leave’ which was sent to them when their application was granted.</p>

<h3>Approved sponsor must have at least 6 months permission to be in the UK</h3>

<p>Caseworkers should use the identity document, or other information provided to confirm the sponsor’s immigration status. The six months must be from the date of the application.</p>

<p>Where you cannot verify the sponsor’s immigration status in the UK by supporting or identity documents, first check Home Office systems to confirm the sponsor’s UK immigration status. If you are unable to locate the sponsor on any systems, you should use the contact details of the sponsor to contact them directly, only after reference to an ECM or SCW.</p>

<h3>Sponsor can provide accommodation for at least 6 months</h3>

<p>A sponsor can offer accommodation for a period of at least 6 months under the scheme, at the UK address provided in the application form.</p>

<h3>WI/PNC checks</h3>

<p>Caseworkers must conduct both WI and PNC checks on all sponsors and on all adults aged 18 and over who will be living in the same household as the applicant. You must therefore carefully review the PNC and WI result to determine whether there is any information contained in it which is likely to mean sponsor does not meet the requirements for approval or which might raise safeguarding concerns regarding the welfare of the applicant.</p>

<p>Caseworkers do not need to carry out any other enrichment activities or assess the applications this will be done by the authorities in the Isle of Man. However, they should be alert to any potential safeguarding concerns and include these in their referral.</p>

<h2>Safeguarding and vulnerable persons</h2>

<p>Sponsors and all adults who will live in the same accommodation as the applicant will be subject to background checks by the Home Office (HO) and local authorities.</p>

<p>Following HO checks made as part of the visa application process, the local authority will also complete checks on the accommodation and living arrangements after the Ukrainian (and family) arrives. The local authority will also decide which type of Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks are required in line with government guidance.</p>

<p>A person of any age or circumstances may be at risk of trafficking into the UK. There may be other scenarios that are of concern to caseworkers. You must seek advice from an ECM or SCW or your safeguarding lead if in doubt.</p>

<p>If you and your management locally need further guidance, you can also refer to the Central Services Team safeguarding lead. A regional operations manager must agree upon referrals. Your referral must include the GWF from the application form reference(s) in the subject line, a summary of the application and your concerns, and what help you need.</p>

<h2>Granting entry clearance</h2>

<p>You must grant the same endorsement, conditions and duration both for applicants who used the deferred biometrics process, and those who gave biometrics at a VAC.</p>

<p>Note that applications will be uploaded to Proviso endorsed Ukraine Scheme – Partner and valid for one year. You must change this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Main endorsement: HOMES FOR UKRAINE SPONSORSHIP SCHEME –</li>
  <li>Cat D endorsement: Code 1A - Work permitted, study permitted subject to the Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS)</li>
  <li>for minor applications add endorsement – initial of parent and family name</li>
  <li>the BRP box must be unchecked/unchecked depending on whether the grant is a PTT or a EC/BRP</li>
  <li>Police registration: No</li>
  <li>Duration: 3 years (36 months)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applicants using the deferred biometrics process</h2>

<p>Issue a Permission to Travel letter which the applicant will present to a carrier to enable them to board transport to the UK, and at the UK primary arrivals control to present to a Border Force officer. If satisfied to grant permission to enter the Border Force officer will grant 6 months permission to enter outside the Rules. The Permission to Travel letter will advise them how to give biometrics and apply to regularise their stay once in the UK.</p>

<h2>Applicants who gave biometrics at a VAC</h2>

<p>Issue an entry clearance vignette in the usual way.</p>

<p>Applicants to the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme are not required to register with the police.</p>

<h3>Practicalities of issuing changes on Proviso</h3>

<p>Those who are travelling on a permission to travel letter must have the BRP box unchecked, to avoid BIDMU error cases. The Entry Clearance Officer will need to exit the case and then re-enter to save the change.</p>

<h2>Refusing an application</h2>

<p>If an applicant does not meet the requirements of the rules, you should refuse the application only with agreement of an ECM or SCW.</p>

<p>Overseas refusal: Ukraine Scheme Refusal_No ROA_No AR_OOC Proviso</p>

<p>See Annex A - The refusal notice template which should be used for all Ukraine Family Scheme (UFS) and Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme (HFU) refusals.</p>

<h2>Appeals and administrative review</h2>

<p>There is no right of appeal or administrative review.</p>

<p>If an applicant challenges a decision to refuse their application, advised them to apply again, fee free under the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme, or Ukraine Family Scheme if they believe they are eligible. There are no restrictions to the number of times a person can apply for the Schemes. A new application will ensure a further consideration of the applicant’s eligibility and will allow them to submit any additional evidence which was not submitted in their previous application.</p>

<p>If an applicant applies a second or more times, you must consider the application afresh, noting any changes to the original or previous applications. If nothing has changed you must still write a full notice of refusal; do not simply refuse on the grounds that there has been no change in the applicant’s circumstances.</p>
