<p>This page explains the mechanisms to manage the budget and expenditure on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-gas-support-scheme-ggss">Green Gas Support Scheme (<abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>)</a>, and the associated annual and quarterly publications. It provides information on scheme budget management for both applicants and investors.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> aims to encourage the use of anaerobic digestion biomethane plants to increase the injection of green gas into the gas grid, while providing value for money for billpayers. Green gas contributes to carbon emissions savings by reducing the emissions intensity of the UK’s natural gas supply, as well as reducing emissions from waste.</p>

<p>The key mechanisms explained below are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Budget Caps</li>
  <li>the Annual Tariff Review</li>
  <li>Degression</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 publications that <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> is required to publish regularly, and which are also explained below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-gas-support-scheme-ggss-expenditure-forecast-statements-and-tariff-change-notices">Expenditure Forecast Statements</a></li>
  <li>the Annual Tariff Review</li>
  <li>Tariff Change Notices</li>
  <li>Green Gas Levy: rates and exemptions</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> is also required to publish the scheme’s budget caps, and its estimates of inflation and quarterly production factors for new plants, all of which are available on this page.</p>

<h2>Budget Caps</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>To provide robust budget management for the scheme there are 2 separate budget caps which fulfil distinct functions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an annual Application Budget cap (<abbr title="Application Budget">AB</abbr>)</li>
  <li>an annual Overall Scheme Expenditure Budget cap (<abbr title="Overall Scheme Expenditure Budget">OSEB</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Overall Scheme Expenditure Budget">OSEB</abbr> is used to set the Green Gas Levy (<abbr title="Green Gas Levy">GGL</abbr>), which funds the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>, and will directly correlate to collection of funds through the Levy. It is designed to provide an overall budget cap against which actual levels of scheme expenditure will be tracked and monitored.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Application Budget">AB</abbr> limits estimated spend by acting as a cap against which all applications to the scheme will be checked. Applications will only be approved if there is unallocated <abbr title="Application Budget">AB</abbr> available to make payments based on their estimated production. Applications for additional capacity will also be checked against the <abbr title="Application Budget">AB</abbr>.</p>

<p>A differential is set between the <abbr title="Application Budget">AB</abbr> and the <abbr title="Overall Scheme Expenditure Budget">OSEB</abbr> to build in headroom to minimise the risk of a shortfall between funds collected through the Levy and payments made to producers. There is likely to be variation between the budget allocated to plants on application and actual spend. As the <abbr title="Green Gas Levy">GGL</abbr> rate is set annually, collection will be fixed for the financial year after the rate has been announced.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Application Budget">AB</abbr> cap is hit if there is insufficient budget available to fund the expected eligible production of an application in the current or any future year of the scheme. If this occurs, it will be placed into a queue. Applications will then be processed in the order they applied should additional budget become available either through other applications withdrawing or being rejected. Later applications may be processed should there be sufficient budget available for them, for example if their expected eligible production is lower than for applications higher up in the queue.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Application Budget">AB</abbr> and <abbr title="Overall Scheme Expenditure Budget">OSEB</abbr> can also be increased or decreased for current and future years upon review by the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Any change will take effect from one of 1 January, 1 April, 1 July or 1 October. Queued applications may then progress if additional budget is available.</p>

<p>Budgets will be announced annually by 31 December along with the announcement of the Levy rate for the following year.</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Application Budget">AB</abbr> will be set based on estimated eligible production and therefore estimated spend, using our forecast capacity, deployment, and production factors.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Overall Scheme Expenditure Budget">OSEB</abbr> sits above this to provide headroom should actual spend be higher than estimated. The differential between the 2 caps provides a risk threshold.</p>

<h4>Forecasting for deployment</h4>

<p>Budget caps aim to strike the balance between avoiding unnecessary collection through the <abbr title="Green Gas Levy">GGL</abbr> and ensuring that as far as possible projects can access the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> without being placed in a queue. They are set using deployment forecasts based on market intelligence to estimate the total scale of applications to the scheme in a given scheme year.</p>

<p>This process carries inherent uncertainty, particularly for scheme years 2021/2022 and 2022/2023 due to the significant time horizon between the opening of the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> and the end of the period that the first 2 levy rates cover (31 March 2023).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>’s budget caps for the 2021/2022 and 2022/2023 financial years were set before scheme launch on 30 November 2022 at a level that enables deployment levels that are consistent with the central/high deployment scenarios set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1018133/green-gas-impact-assessment.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> final stage Impact Assessment</a> across the remainder of 2021/2022 and 2022/2023 scheme years.</p>

<h4>Production factors used to estimate Application budget commitments</h4>

<p>The production factors used to estimate the <abbr title="Application Budget">AB</abbr> cap set out the proportion of total registered capacity we expect plants to use to produce biomethane eligible for <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> payments over time. The biomethane production factors that were used for the launch of the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>  are shown in Table 2.</p>

<p>Production factors may be refined as more data becomes available and separate production factors for additional capacity applications may be introduced if appropriate. <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> must publish estimated production factors for biomethane production under the requirements of Green Gas Support Scheme Regulations 2021.</p>

<h4>Inflation</h4>

<p>Inflation rates are used to uprate the tariff payments made through the scheme. Ofgem will uprate tariff rates using the December <abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr> inflation rate (published by <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> in January). In accordance with the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> regulations, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> is required to publish the inflation estimates Ofgem will use to do this; these estimates are also used to set the scheme budgets in accordance with the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> regulations.</p>

<p>The first initial <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> tariff, is estimated in 2021/2022 prices and therefore does not need to be uprated for 2021/2022. Inflation estimates for 2022/2023-2025/2026 are listed below in Table 3. They are drawn from the <abbr title="Office for Budget Responsibility">OBR</abbr> <abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr> Q4 inflation forecasts published in October 2021 <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. The Q4 forecast is the nearest available estimate to the December inflation rate.</p>

<h3>Differential between <abbr title="Application Budget">AB</abbr> and <abbr title="Overall Scheme Expenditure Budget">OSEB</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Following <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> modelling, a differential of 15% between the <abbr title="Application Budget">AB</abbr> and <abbr title="Overall Scheme Expenditure Budget">OSEB</abbr> has been determined as proportionate to balance the need to minimise underspend whilst ensuring sufficient funds are collected and deployment is not curtailed. This will remain under review and may be refined as improved data becomes available.</p>

<p>The modelling used to determine this differential has considered a range of factors that contribute to overall uncertainty regarding scheme spend. These include commissioning dates, production factors, potential variation between capacity at <abbr title="Tariff Guarantee">TG</abbr> application and registration, and potential interaction with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/renewable-transport-fuels-obligation">Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation</a>.</p>

<p>Spend is allocated to a producer at the point that a Tariff Guarantee is issued based on estimated annual payments. This is calculated based on the maximum injection capacity of the installation as per the Network Entry Agreement, the relevant tariff, a plant’s stated commissioning date, the estimate for inflation in that financial year in table 3 and the production factors in table 2. Applications for additional capacity are calculated using the same methodology, though only the additional capacity will be considered as opposed to the total maximum injection capacity of the installation.</p>

<p>As spend allocated during this process is estimated, there is likely to be a variation between these estimated annual payments and the actual payments made to a plant.</p>

<h3>Budget Caps</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> budget caps are set out here.</p>

<p>Note: Budget caps are cumulative caps on annual spend, rather than additive. They are flat across 2021/2022 and 2022/2023 (the period the first 2 levy rates cover), before increasing in line with projected deployment growth.</p>

<p>For scheme years 2023/2024 and onwards, budget caps will be refined and updated annually alongside the Levy rate setting process for the subsequent scheme year, with updates published by 31 December. The Secretary of State can also review and alter budget caps at other times. Any change can then take effect from 1 January, 1 April, 1 July or 1 October.</p>

<p>Ofgem publishes <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/environmental-and-social-schemes/green-gas-support-scheme-and-green-gas-levy/green-gas-support-scheme-and-green-gas-levy-applicants" rel="external">monthly updates on the number and progression of applications</a>, as well as <abbr title="Application Budget">AB</abbr> allocated based on applications received, and based on applications granted.</p>

<h2>Degression</h2>

<h3>Objective</h3>

<p>The government needs to ensure that the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> offers value for money to the billpayer, sufficiently incentivises biomethane production and provides certainty for industry investment.</p>

<p>Degression supports this balance by automatically reducing the tariffs available for new applicants if set expenditure thresholds are met. If forecasts show that we could be paying out more on the scheme than we expected to due to higher capacity deployment, this is a sign that tariffs could be too generous.</p>

<p>The Green Gas Support Scheme Regulations 2021 require <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> to publish an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-gas-support-scheme-ggss-expenditure-forecast-statements-and-tariff-change-notices">Expenditure Forecast Statement</a> every quarter, in which a forecast of expenditure over the year ahead is compared to the scheme Expenditure Threshold. If the Threshold is met and a degression occurs, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> must also publish a Tariff Change Notice detailing the reduction.</p>

<p>The Green Gas Support Scheme Regulations 2021 also set out the powers for the <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> Secretary of State to amend tariffs and degression thresholds through the <a class="govuk-link" href="#annual-tariff-review">Annual Tariff Review</a>.</p>

<h3>Effect</h3>

<p>When a degression occurs, this reduces by 10% the tariffs available to subsequent <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> applicants.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The GGSS degression process will act as follows:</p>

<p>Is the quarterly Expenditure Threshold for expenditure over the year ahead exceeded?</p>

<ul>
  <li>if yes - 10% degression</li>
  <li>if no - no degression</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>All applications to the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> require a Tariff Guarantee. Therefore, once a participant has a tariff awarded and is fully registered on the scheme, they will receive this tariff throughout the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> payment period, regardless of any future degressions.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>

<p>Each quarter that the scheme is open to new applicants, until 30 November 2025, the degression process goes through 4 stages set out below:</p>

<p>1. <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> forecasts <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> expenditure over the following 12 months based on data as of 31 January, 30 April, 31 July and 31 October each year. This will forecast expenditure for the year ahead from those dates and will be based on data from <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> applications made to Ofgem.</p>

<p>2. <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> publishes these quarterly forecasts in an Expenditure Forecast Statement by 1 March, 1 June, 1 September, and 1 December respectively. If the expenditure forecast exceeds the degression threshold, a degression will be triggered, and these will be accompanied by a Tariff Change Notice, advising that tariffs will be reduced by 10%.</p>

<p>3. Ofgem will publish new tariff rates by the 15th day of the month following the publication of the Expenditure Forecast Statement.</p>

<p>4. Any new tariff will come into effect for subsequent registrations on the first day of the following month.</p>

<p>In forecasting expenditure, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> looks ahead and forecasts the maximum potential expenditure commitment over the coming 12 months. This will be based upon applications made to Ofgem for a <abbr title="Tariff Guarantee">TG</abbr> which are beyond Stage 2 of the <abbr title="Tariff Guarantee">TG</abbr> application process, and applications which have been granted registration. The forecast will reflect the total expected value of the eligible capacity of these installations. The 12-month period rolls forwards every quarter, running from the end of the quarter.</p>

<p>As Ofgem receives more applications and they progress, over time the amount of committed spend under the scheme will increase. This is different to the forecasts used to set budget caps. The Expenditure Forecast Statement used for degression assessments is only based on existing post-Stage 2 applications at the time of assessment. Budget cap forecasts are based on actual expected spend, drawing on market intelligence as well as applications and using production factors rather than the total value of eligible capacity.</p>

<p>Further explanation of the process can be found in Expenditure Forecast Statements - see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-gas-support-scheme-ggss-expenditure-forecast-statements-and-tariff-change-notices">Green Gas Support Scheme (<abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>): expenditure forecast statements and tariff change notices</a>.</p>

<p>scheme will increase. This is different to the forecasts used to set budget caps. The Expenditure Forecast Statement used for degression assessments is only based on existing post-Stage 2 applications at the time of assessment. Budget cap forecasts are based on actual expected spend, drawing on market intelligence as well as applications and using production factors rather than the total value of eligible capacity. 
Further explanation of the process can be found in Expenditure Forecast Statements, accessed from the page Green Gas Support Scheme (<abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>): expenditure forecast statements and tariff change notices.</p>

<h3>Expenditure Forecast Statements and Tariff Change Notices</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> Expenditure Forecast Statements, as stated above, will be published by 1 March, 1 June, 1 September and 1 December each year that the scheme is open to new applicants, until 30 November 2025.</p>

<p>The Statement will compare the year-ahead expenditure forecast to the Expenditure Threshold. If the forecast meets or exceeds the threshold level for the quarter, then a degression will occur.</p>

<p>Tariff Change Notices announce new tariff levels if a degression has been triggered and will be published simultaneously with the relevant Expenditure Forecast Statement.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-gas-support-scheme-ggss-expenditure-forecast-statements-and-tariff-change-notices">Green Gas Support Scheme (<abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>): expenditure forecast statements and tariff change notices</a> for previous Statements and Notices.</p>

<h3>Expenditure Threshold Figures</h3>

<p>In accordance with the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> regulations, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> must publish expenditure threshold figures for each quarter. The threshold figures are reviewed as part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="#annual-tariff-review">Annual Tariff Review</a> and new thresholds will then be published by 1 September, taking effect from 1 October.</p>

<p>To set the Expenditure Threshold figures <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> takes deployment forecasts and sets the threshold level on the same basis as the expenditure forecast used in the Expenditure Forecast Assessment, based on the expected total eligible capacity of plants. The thresholds are set based on an application and deployment forecast which is above the central, expected level (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#table-1-ggss-deployment-scenarios-gwh-from-final-stage-impact-assessment">Table 1</a>), as they are intended to represent an unexpected surge.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>’ first 6 months does not have previous performance to compare with, therefore for this period degression will not be active and it will be covered by the Application budget cap (<abbr title="Application Budget">AB</abbr>) detailed above. The first degression process begins with <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> assessing forecast expenditure as at 30 April 2022, with an expenditure forecast statement, and if necessary a tariff change notice, published on 1 June 2022, and any change in tariff taking effect from 1 July 2022. We have published the scheme’s first assessment, prior to this, however, to provide greater transparency.</p>

<h3>Opening Tariffs</h3>

<p>Tariffs for biomethane injection at <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> launch are defined in regulations as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tier 1: Up to 60,000 <abbr title="megawatt hours">MWh</abbr> – 5.51 p/<abbr title="kilowatt hours">kWh</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Tier 2: the next 40,000 <abbr title="megawatt hours">MWh</abbr> – 3.53 p/<abbr title="kilowatt hours">kWh</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Tier 3: Above 100,000 <abbr title="megawatt hours">MWh</abbr> – 1.56 p/<abbr title="kilowatt hours">kWh</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>These tariff levels are informed by the costs and revenues of a typical reference biomethane plant. This understanding was modelled on a combination of desk-based research, market intelligence, ongoing engagement with industry and NNFCC (National Non-Food Crops Centre) research. The detailed evidence on costs underpinning the tariff setting methodology was set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1018133/green-gas-impact-assessment.pdf" rel="external">final stage Impact Assessment</a>.</p>

<p>Both the degression and Annual Tariff Review mechanisms will only affect the initial tier 1, 2 and 3 tariffs for subsequent applicants. The mechanisms will not alter the tariffs for applicants with properly made Stage 2 Tariff Guarantee applications.</p>

<h2>Annual Tariff Review</h2>

<p>The Annual Tariff Review (<abbr title="Annual Tariff Review">ATR</abbr>) process works in conjunction with the degression mechanism. Whereas degression is an automatic and rules-based process, the <abbr title="Annual Tariff Review">ATR</abbr> is more in-depth. This reflects their complementary functions, with degressions being designed to respond quickly within year to surges in deployment, while the <abbr title="Annual Tariff Review">ATR</abbr> has the broader function of ensuring production continues to be incentivised at the best value for money.</p>

<h3>Objective</h3>

<p>The Annual Tariff Review (<abbr title="Annual Tariff Review">ATR</abbr>) aims to ensure tariff payments are sufficient to incentivise deployment on the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>, whilst ensuring value for money for the billpayer. Tariff rates that are too high risk overcompensating producers and overburdening the billpayer. Rates that are too low risk decreasing deployment or lowering quality of equipment and feedstocks used, and therefore lowering contributions to carbon budgets.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Annual Tariff Review">ATR</abbr> will hold, increase or decrease the scheme tariffs for new applicants, with reference to our existing tariff setting methodology. The process will review scheme data, market intelligence, policy costs, degression expenditure forecasts and industry responses to a <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> call for evidence. The powers to review tariffs were set out in the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> regulations.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> Expenditure Thresholds used for degression will also be reviewed in the <abbr title="Annual Tariff Review">ATR</abbr> and may also subsequently be updated. They will be published as part of the review and updated on this page by 1 September. Any new threshold will come into effect from 1 October, and will therefore be active in the degression assessment for the quarter ending 31 October (published by 1 December; see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#expenditure-forecast-statements-and-tariff-change-notices">Expenditure Forecast Statement section</a>).</p>

<h3>Assessment</h3>

<p>Information assessed during the <abbr title="Annual Tariff Review">ATR</abbr> is expected to include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Detailed plant construction costs from applicants<br>
</li>
  <li>Cost impact from changes to other government policies<br>
</li>
  <li>Deployment incentivised through <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> to date, indicating extent of tariff alignment<br>
</li>
  <li>A call for evidence<br>
</li>
  <li>Additional market intelligence inputs; including plant costs and revenues, finance costs and required rates of return.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the <abbr title="Annual Tariff Review">ATR</abbr> Call for Evidence, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will seek to use a standardised survey, which could cover the above information and additional factors. We expect calls to adapt in future years to best reflect market conditions and the data available to Ofgem.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Annual Tariff Review">ATR</abbr> process will take place between May and September in 2022, 2023 and 2024. A call for evidence will be published by early June and will provide a minimum of 3 weeks for responses. Quarterly and monthly data provided by Ofgem will also be available to <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> for the review.</p>

<p>An Expenditure Forecast Statement will also be published on 1 September, at the same time as the <abbr title="Annual Tariff Review">ATR</abbr>. However, while the outcome of the assessment will be published, it will not be binding, as the <abbr title="Annual Tariff Review">ATR</abbr> decision takes precedence for setting tariff levels. The degression mechanism then acts as normal from the quarter following the <abbr title="Annual Tariff Review">ATR</abbr> decision, acting on whatever tariff level is set out in the <abbr title="Annual Tariff Review">ATR</abbr>.</p>

<p>During the <abbr title="Annual Tariff Review">ATR</abbr> assessment, analysts will re-run the tariff setting process as conducted for the final scheme impact assessment. Following consideration of this analysis, the <abbr title="Annual Tariff Review">ATR</abbr> announcement will be made on 1 September and come into effect a month later on 1 October.</p>
