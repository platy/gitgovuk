<h3>Changes due to coronavirus (COVID-19)</h3>

<p>To stop the spread of coronavirus HMRC has made <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/producing-hand-sanitiser-and-gel-for-coronavirus-covid-19">temporary changes to the use and supply of denatured alcohol and duty-free spirits</a>, to help businesses who produce hand sanitiser and gel.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> About this notice</h3>

<p>It tells you how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>receive spirits for use in manufacture or for medical or scientific purposes, to be used without payment of Excise Duty</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>apply to receive these spirits</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>meet our conditions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> What’s changed</h3>

<p>This notice has been updated to tell you about the changes which have resulted from the UK leaving the European Union.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> What the technical terms mean</h3>

<p>We explain most of the terms used in this notice either in the Glossary (please read <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec13">Section 13</a>) or in the main body of the notice itself.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span> Where to find the relevant law</h3>

<p>The main laws are the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1979/4" rel="external">Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979</a> (<abbr title="Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act">ALDA</abbr>), sections 7, 8 and 10, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Revenue Traders (Accounts and Records) Regulations 1992</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Under the provisions of sections 8 and 10 of <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1979/4" rel="external"><abbr title="Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act">ALDA</abbr></a>, the Commissioners of HMRC may remit the Excise Duty on spirits used either for medical or scientific purposes, or in certain manufacturing processes. This duty relief is subject to conditions, which are set out in this notice. Section 7 of <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1979/4" rel="external"><abbr title="Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act">ALDA</abbr></a> allows medicinal products which contain spirits to be imported, from warehouse, without a duty charge.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span> Whether spirits be free of customs duties and VAT</h3>

<p>This relief is for Excise duty on spirits only.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span>  Can I manufacture with Duty Free Spirits</h3>

<p>There is no exhaustive list of allowable processes. But, no spirits may remain in the final product unless it is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an ethyl ester or ether (and less than 1.2% abv)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a medicinal product</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Scientists may receive duty-free spirits for research, teaching or other laboratory use, but use for heating or lighting is not allowable. The use of duty-free spirits in scientific research is restricted to those products which do not contain spirits in the final saleable form, apart from the two exceptions above.</p>

<p>However, duty-free spirits can be used for specialised cleaning purposes if you can prove that denatured alcohol would be detrimental to the process or the presence of a denaturant would affect an end product. You must provide proof of the detrimental effects which using denatured alcohol would cause. Each case will be looked at individually and on its merits. Where necessary, consultation with the HMRC appointed analyst will be undertaken.</p>

<p>Authority to receive duty free spirits is not allowed for the making for sale:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>of any product which contains spirit in the final product, except as detailed above</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>or use any beverage, foodstuff (except vinegar), flavouring essence, perfumery or toilet preparation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Medical and scientific use</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> What qualifies as medical use</h3>

<p>There is no definitive list of allowable uses and we consider each case on its merits. General medical applications and uses for which duty-free spirits will be allowed are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>for the production of recognised medical products, drugs and pharmaceuticals (whether or not the final product contains spirits) including veterinary products — we’ll permit duty-free spirits to be used in the manufacture of any product (including herbal or homeopathic) which has a Medical Control Agency (<abbr title="Medical Control Agency">MCA</abbr>) product licence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>herbal or homeopathic remedies which do not have an <abbr title="Medical Control Agency">MCA</abbr> licence, but, they must be recognised by HMRC as having medicinal properties</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the manufacture of intermediate products used exclusively for the production of medical products</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for use in equipment or apparatus (for example, lasers) used for medical purposes by surgeons or other recognised medical practitioners</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for the production of hand sanitiser for use only in hospitals or care homes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for use in hospitals and, where applicable, dental and veterinary surgeries for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>fractional test meals</li>
      <li>sterilisation of instruments used in surgery</li>
      <li>inhalation therapy</li>
      <li>injections</li>
      <li>oral administration when used as a solvent for medicines (for example, administered to terminally ill patients)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We also permit duty-free spirits to be used in the manufacture of any product prescribed by a doctor to be made up by a pharmacist. This includes ‘specials’ which may be made up on behalf of a pharmacist and which may not have an <abbr title="Medical Control Agency">MCA</abbr> product licence.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Whether oral hygiene products and mouthwashes are eligible for duty-free spirits</h3>

<p>Mouthwashes and oral hygiene products (including breath freshener sprays) are only eligible for duty-free spirits authorisation if they contain proven medicinal ingredients at effective levels. Such ingredients include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>sodium fluoride at 0.05% minimum</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cetyl piridinium fluoride at 0.05% minimum</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>triclosan at 0.3%, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>chlorhexidine gluconate at 0.1% minimum</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The above list is not exhaustive. For further advice, you should contact the Excise and Customs helpline on Telephone: 0300 200 3700.</p>

<p>You should label the finished product with reference to its antiseptic or prophylactic qualities.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Whether homeopathic and herbal remedies are eligible for duty-free spirits</h3>

<p>Only remedies which have been recognised by HMRC as having medicinal properties are eligible to be manufactured using duty-free spirits. A list of approved remedies is available on request from your local office. If any of your tinctures or remedies are not on the list, then contact your local office. You’ll need to provide proof of each product’s medicinal properties. Please quote any reference manual or publication which shows your proposed tincture or remedy as having medical properties. If your remedy is not approved then you can appeal by writing to your local office giving details of your case.</p>

<p>You may prepare tinctures to any dilution, as directed by the reference work.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> If you import, or move within the UK, bulk consignments of herbal or homeopathic remedies</h3>

<p>In their bulk form, herbal and homeopathic medicines are not eligible for duty relief unless they are recognised by HMRC as having medicinal properties. (Please read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para23">paragraph 2.3</a>).</p>

<p>If you wish to import, or move your products within the UK, in bulk, that is not in their final packaged form, then please contact the Excise and Customs helpline on Telephone: 0300 200 3700 with details of each product you intend to move. They will advise you as to whether they can be moved without the spirits element of your product becoming liable to duty, or if a warehouse approval will be required to allow the receipt of duty suspended goods.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> If you vary specifications for approved medical products</h3>

<p>Provided that the medically effective element of the product is not diminished (for example, as specified in a pharmacopoeia), you do not need to seek any approval from HMRC before reformulating existing approved products.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you vary levels of inactive ingredients (for example, colours or sugar levels), you do not need to seek prior approval.</p>

<p>If you are in any doubt, contact your local office.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span> What uses HMRC do  not allow within the medical category of duty-free spirits</h3>

<p>We do not allow duty-free spirits to be authorised for the manufacture of products such as an energy drink or food supplement. No product can be approved for manufacture using duty-free  spirits if it is, or is implied to be, a beverage, alcoholic or otherwise,</p>

<p>However, if you want to manufacture food supplements or non-alcoholic beverages using alcohol as an ingredient, then you may be able to claim Alcoholic Ingredients Relief. Please contact the Excise and Customs helpline on  Telephone: 0300 200 3700 for more details.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.7 </span> What qualifies as scientific use</h3>

<p>Included in the scientific uses of duty-free spirits are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>analytical research or other laboratory purposes, or physical testing, please note: this does not include routine cleaning of work areas etc, you should apply to receive one of the denatured alcohol grades</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>teaching purposes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>commercial project research and development where small quantities of spirits only are required, please note: that if a pilot development is subsequently scaled up to commercial manufacture, you are still required by law to demonstrate that denatured alcohol is unsuitable for use in the manufacturing process. We advise you to take this into consideration before commencing trial work (please read <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec3">Section 3</a>)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.8 </span> Whether you can use duty-free spirits in the trial of new medicinal products</h3>

<p>You can, but you must be able to give an indication of how long the trial will last and the amount of spirits you’ll want to use.</p>

<p>If, at the end of the trial period you wish to continue the manufacture for sale, you must provide your local office with details of the trial results proving the product’s medicinal properties. Obviously, an <abbr title="Medical Control Agency">MCA</abbr> licence will suffice. However, if the new product does not have an <abbr title="Medical Control Agency">MCA</abbr> licence, for instance if it is a herbal or homeopathic medicine, you must provide proof of its medicinal properties. Prior to authorisation we may need to contact the HMRC appointed analyst for clarification.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Manufacturing use</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> When  duty-free spirits can be authorised for manufacturing purposes</h3>

<p>There is no definitive list of allowable uses, and we consider each case on its merits.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, however, we allow duty-free spirits for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>manufacturing and related processes in which the spirits act as a catalyst, or where they are converted into another substance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the manufacture of ethyl esters and ethyl ether</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a manufacturing process involving spirits where denatured alcohol is demonstrated to be unsuitable or detrimental to that process</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you can prove that the use of denatured alcohol in a manufacturing process is not suitable to that process, then an authorisation to use duty free spirits in that process may be granted. But, you must supply us with proof of the detrimental effects of using denatured alcohol in the specific process. Please attach your evidence to your application when you submit it to your local office. This will ensure a timely decision.</p>

<p>Each case is taken on its merits and, if authorisation is granted, strict controls on the storage of the duty free spirits and record keeping requirements are imposed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Whether spirits have to be denatured</h3>

<p>There is no automatic requirement for the duty-free spirits to be denatured. However, in certain circumstances you may be required to ‘partially’ denature the duty-free spirits as a condition of your authorisation. For instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if your record of compliance is not good</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is a risk of the spirits being diverted for other purposes during the actual process in which the duty-free spirits will be used</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>However, the process of ‘partially’ denaturing the duty-free spirits which you receive can be a very effective means of safeguarding stocks against pilfering. Therefore, if you wish to use a denaturant for security purposes, or to meet certain product specifications, then you can do so. Please provide details of the denaturant you wish to use. We’ll view this as part of your normal manufacturing process.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Denaturing</h3>

<p>We use the term denaturing to describe the addition of a substance(s) to alcohol which will make it unpalatable.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#sec11">Section 11</a> provides a list of acceptable ‘partial’ denaturants. However, this is not exhaustive and if you wish to use a denaturant which is not on the list, then please contact the Excise and Customs Helpline on Telephone: 0300 200 3700 with the details. They will advise whether your proposed denaturant meets our requirements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> duty-free spirits for cleaning</h3>

<p>Duty-free spirits cannot be used for general cleaning or other purposes.</p>

<p>As explained in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para16">paragraph 1.6</a> above, if you can prove that the use of denatured alcohol is unsuitable for the specialised cleaning operations you need to perform, then duty-free spirits may be used to carry out those specific cleaning operations. For example, duty-free spirits may be used to flush out pipework and other apparatus as an integral part of a manufacturing process, such as the manufacture of pharmaceuticals or fine chemicals.</p>

<p>We’ll also consider applications to use duty-free spirits for operations such as cleaning highly sensitive computer parts in the manufacture of integrated circuit chips for microelectronic technology. However, detailed proof must be supplied with your application for us to make a definitive decision.</p>

<p>Each case is taken on its merits and, if authorisation is granted, strict controls on the storage of the duty free spirits and record keeping requirements are imposed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span> Uses are specifically not permitted</h3>

<p>We do not permit duty-free spirits to be used for making for sale:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>any product which contains spirits (other than, subject to special conditions, ethyl esters and ethyl ethers)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>or use any beverage, foodstuff, flavouring essence, perfumery or cosmetic preparation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Different laws apply to duty relief on spirits used for such purposes. If you need further information, please read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-41-alcoholic-ingredients-relief">Notice 41: Alcoholic Ingredients Relief</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-473-production-distribution-and-use-of-denatured-alcohol">Notice 473: Production, Distribution and Use of Denatured Alcohol</a>.

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span> Further authorisation if you wish to manufacture other products</h3>

<h4>Medical use</h4>

<p>Authorisation to receive duty-free spirits  for the manufacture of recognised medical products (please read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para21">paragraph 2.1</a>) provides a general authority to produce any article holding an <abbr title="Medical Control Agency">MCA</abbr> product licence. You do not need to refer to HMRC if you intend to produce additional <abbr title="Medical Control Agency">MCA</abbr> licensed products (though you must seek our prior approval to increase your annual receipt of duty-free spirits).</p>

<h4>Herbal/Homeopathic remedies</h4>

<p>If you wish to be authorised for duty –free spirits to manufacture herbal or homeopathic remedies, contact your local office with the list of remedies you propose to manufacture. They will inform you of the eligibility of your remedies, if necessary after consultation with the HMRC appointed analyst.</p>

<h4>Manufacture</h4>

<p>If you wish to manufacture other products you must apply for additional approval. It is an offence to use duty-free spirits for an unauthorised purpose, and you may have to pay duty on any spirits so used.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span> Financial security</h3>

<p>You are not usually required to provide any form of security (for example, financial guarantee). However, we reserve the right to require such security from newly authorised users or users whose activities give cause for concern. If we exercise this right, your local office will tell you what you must do.</p>

<p>You have the right of appeal against a decision to require financial security. For further details, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec12">Section 12</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Disposal of spirits</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span> Ceasing trade or moving to new premises</h3>

<p>If you cease to trade, you must either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>return spirits to an Excise warehouse (either to your original supplier or to any other warehouse approved to receive spirits)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if you only have a small quantity of duty-free spirits, destroy the spirits subject to conditions set out by our Helpline</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you move premises, or wish to transfer spirits to another operation within your company, you may remove the spirits to those premises but must notify your local office and comply with any conditions imposed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span> Returning unused spirits to warehouse</h3>

<p>Unused spirits may be returned to an Excise warehouse. If you or the warehouse keeper are uncertain about how to arrange the transaction, you should contact the Helpline.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span> Removing used spirits for destruction</h3>

<p>Used spirits may be removed for destruction. But, when spirits have been used and are contaminated (even very heavily), they legally remain liable to the spirits duty charge.</p>

<p>If you wish to remove used, contaminated duty-free spirits for destruction (for example, to an incinerator’s premises) you should notify your local office. Our basic requirements are that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you record the strength and volume of the contaminated duty-free spirits intended for removal/destruction, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all records associated with the transaction, including commercial documentation, are readily available for our inspection</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You may also be required to provide financial security for the transaction, up to and including destruction of the spirits.</p>

<p>You’ll be required to provide proof that the spirits are unpotable.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.4 </span> Removing used spirits for recovery, laundering or denaturing</h3>

<p>Used spirits may be removed for recovery/laundering or denaturing. But you can only send used (contaminated) duty-free spirits to an Excise warehouse approved for rectification (re-distillation to purify the spirits).  The spirits may then be returned to you from the warehousekeeper as a normal delivery from warehouse (please read <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec6">section 6</a>). Alternatively, the spirits may be re-sold by the rectifier or warehousekeeper.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Records and returns</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span> Record keeping</h3>

<p>Generally, you must keep records as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-206-revenue-traders-records">Notice 206: Revenue traders records</a>.</p>

<p>Specifically, you must keep:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a stock account of all the spirits you receive and use, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>such other records as are either specified in your letter of authority, or are necessary to establish that the spirits have been put to the authorised use</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must also record all the checks you carry out on receipts, storage and use of the spirits. Your normal business records may be used for these purposes, provided there is a clear audit trail from receipt to final disposal. Otherwise, your local office will tell you what you must do.</p>

<p>You must keep your records up to date.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span> Balancing the stock account</h3>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>balance the stock account at the intervals required by your letter of authority, checking the physical stock and noting the result in your account, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>investigate promptly any apparent discrepancies, and immediately inform your local office of any you cannot resolve</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.3 </span> Retention ofrecords</h3>

<p>You must keep your records for at least 6 years.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.4 </span> Return</h3>

<p>There is no requirement for you to fill in a return.</p>

<p>If you wish to send the spirits for re-cycling by a denaturer (formerly a methylator), you must ensure that the denaturer is properly authorised to receive such spirits.</p>

<p>For removals for destruction you must notify your local office and comply with the requirements of <a class="govuk-link" href="#para83">paragraph 8.3</a> above.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> List of acceptable ‘partial’ denaturants</h2>

<p>The following list shows the denaturants you can add to your duty-free spirits, in order to make them unpotable. This may be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a requirement imposed by us if your operations or record-keeping give cause for concern</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>at your request to conform to a product’s specifications</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>at your request as a security measure to deter pilferage</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The list shows allowable ‘partial’ denaturants which will make the alcohol unpotable. However, a marker must be added to each of these as well as the denaturant. Recognised markers are Methanol or isopropyl alcohol.</p>

<p>This list is not exhaustive and you can apply to use a marker or denaturant which is not on the list. Please contact the Helpline with details of any proposed denaturant or marker you wish to use, which is not on the list.</p>

<p>Isopropyl alcohol can be used on its own as a joint denaturant and marker, but the minimum level must be 5% v/v.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span> Review and appeal procedures</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.1 </span> If you disagree with any decision you make about your affairs</h3>

<p>When we make a decision that you can appeal against, we’ll tell you and offer you a review. We’ll explain the decision and tell you what you need to do if you disagree.</p>

<p>For example with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the amount of an assessment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the issue of a civil penalty</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a decision specifically connected to the relevant duty</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll usually have three options. Within 30 days you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>send new information or arguments to the officer you have been dealing with</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have your case reviewed by a different officer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have your case heard by an independent tribunal</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A review will be handled by a different officer from the one who made the decision. If you prefer to have an independent tribunal hear your case, you must write directly to the Tribunals Service.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.2 </span> Time limits</h3>

<p>If you want us to review a decision, you must write to the person who issued the decision letter, within 30 days of the date of that letter. We’ll complete our review within 45 days, unless we agree another time with you.</p>

<p>You cannot ask the tribunal to hear your case until 45 days (or the time we agreed with you) has expired, or we have told you the outcome of the review.</p>

<p>If you are not satisfied with the review’s conclusion, you have 30 days within which to ask the tribunal to hear your case.</p>

<p>If we cannot complete our review within 45 days, or any time we agreed with you, we’ll ask you whether you are willing to agree to an extension so that we can complete the review. If you do not agree to an extension, the review is treated as concluding that the decision being reviewed is upheld.</p>

<p>We’ll write and tell you this: you then have 30 days from the date of that letter to ask the tribunal to hear your case.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.3 </span> What you must include in your request for review</h3>

<p>Your request should set out clearly the full details of your case, the reasons why you disagree with us and provide any supporting documentation. You should also state what result you expect from our review.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.4 </span> If you do not want a review</h3>

<p>If you do not want a review, you may appeal to the independent tribunal. You need to send your appeal to the Tribunals Service within 30 days of the date on the decision letter.</p>

<h3>
