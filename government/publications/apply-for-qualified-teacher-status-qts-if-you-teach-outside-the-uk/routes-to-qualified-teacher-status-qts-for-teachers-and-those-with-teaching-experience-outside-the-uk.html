<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This guidance explains how to apply for qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>) if you qualified to teach, or have gained teaching experience, outside the UK.</p>

<p>You may find it useful to refer to our related guidance for international teachers and trainees:</p>

</ul>

<h2>Qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>Qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>) is a legal requirement to teach in many English schools, and considered desirable for teachers in the majority of schools in England.</p>

<p>Schools in England where teachers can be employed without <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> include <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/academies">academies</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/free-schools">free schools</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/private-schools">private schools</a>.</p>

<p>However, even where <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> is not a legal requirement, many schools use <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> to assess the quality of candidates for teaching jobs.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> exemption for teachers from outside the UK</h2>

<p>Qualified teachers from outside the UK are allowed to teach in England for up to 4 years without <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> – even in schools where <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> is normally a legal requirement. You can learn more about this exemption, known as the ‘4-year rule’, from the school employing you.</p>

<p>To be eligible for the 4-year rule, you will need to have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>qualified as a teacher in a country outside the UK</li>
  <li>successfully completed a course of teacher training recognised by the organisation that regulates teachers in the country where you qualified</li>
</ul>

<p>The 4-year rule exemption does not apply to pupil referral units (PRUs), alternative provision academies, or alternative provision free schools, where <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> is required from the beginning of your employment.</p>

<h2>Apply for qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>There are 3 main routes to <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>, but your eligibility for each route will depend on where you qualified, and whether you already have teaching experience.</p>

<p>You can obtain <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>applying to the Teaching Regulation Agency (<abbr title="Teaching Regulation Agency">TRA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>undergoing an assessment to demonstrate you meet the standards for <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> (with no further training needed)</li>
  <li>completing a teacher training course in England</li>
</ul>

<p>This section explains the eligibility requirements for each route to <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> so you can choose the most relevant route for you.</p>

<h2>Apply to the Teaching Regulation Agency (<abbr title="Teaching Regulation Agency">TRA</abbr>)</h2>

<p>You can apply for <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> to the Teaching Regulation Agency (<abbr title="Teaching Regulation Agency">TRA</abbr>) if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you have a teaching qualification from:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr></a></li>
      <li>Gibraltar</li>
      <li>Australia</li>
      <li>Canada</li>
      <li>New Zealand</li>
      <li>Switzerland</li>
      <li>the USA</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>you can submit evidence that you are recognised as a teacher in the country where you qualified</li>
  <li>you are not prohibited or restricted from teaching by a professional sanction against you</li>
</ul>

<p>Evidence can include documents that show your official status as a teacher from the organisation that regulates teachers in the country where you qualified.</p>

<p>You will not need to do any further teacher training, or undergo an assessment, to get <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> via this route.</p>

<h3>Teachers with a special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) qualification only</h3>

<p>To gain <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>, you must be able to adapt your teaching to meet the needs of all pupils in all phases and age groups. Teachers with a qualification limited to SEND pupils are therefore not eligible to apply for <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> to the Teaching Regulation Agency, even if they qualified in the European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>), Gibraltar, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Switzerland or the USA.</p>

<p>However, SEND teachers can apply for <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> through the assessment only route, or by applying for a teacher training course in England. These routes are open to SEND teachers from anywhere in the world. You’ll find more information about these routes to <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> in this publication.</p>

<p>If you’re not sure whether you’re eligible to apply to the Teaching Regulation Agency for <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:qts.enquiries@education.gov.uk">qts.enquiries@education.gov.uk</a></p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://teacherservices.education.gov.uk/MutualRecognition/?" rel="external">Apply to the Teaching Regulation Agency for QTS</a></p>
</div>

<h2>Assessment only <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> to demonstrate you meet the standards for qualified teacher status</h2>

<p>If you have a teaching qualification from a country which is not part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>)</a>, and is not Gibraltar, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Switzerland or the USA, assessment only <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> may be the most appropriate route for you.</p>

<p>Assessment only <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> means experienced teachers with a degree can gain <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> without doing a teacher training programme. You can apply to a UK government-approved teacher training provider in England for an assessment showing you meet the standards for <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>. You do not need to visit the UK to be assessed and gain <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you come to England to teach under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/qualified-teacher-status-routes-to-qts-for-teachers-and-those-with-teaching-experience-outside-the-uk/qualified-teacher-status-routes-to-qts-for-teachers-and-those-with-teaching-experience-outside-the-uk#fouryearrule">the 4-year rule</a>, you’ll be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/assessment-only-providers" rel="external">apply to a teacher training provider offering assessment only <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> in the region of England where you work</a>. Your employing school can support you with this.</p>

<h3>Qualifications and experience you’ll need to be eligible for an assessment only <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>To apply for assessment only <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>, you do not need a formal teacher training qualification.</p>

<p>However, you must have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a minimum of 2 years’ teaching experience</li>
  <li>a first degree from a UK or non-UK university</li>
  <li>achieved a standard equivalent to grade 4 in GCSE English language and mathematics</li>
  <li>for teaching children aged 3 to 11 (English primary school), a standard equivalent to grade 4 in a GCSE science (biology, chemistry or physics) subject</li>
</ul>

<p>A GCSE is an academic qualification awarded for examinations in England, usually taken at age 16.</p>

<h4>Help with international qualifications</h4>

<p>If your qualifications come from a non-UK institution, your assessment only teacher training provider may want to see a ‘statement of comparability’ showing how they compare to UK qualifications.</p>

<p>You can call the Department for Education’s Get into Teaching website on 0800 389 2500 for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>guidance on the UK equivalents of your qualifications</li>
  <li>a free statement of comparability from UK ENIC once you’ve submitted your application, if your provider asks for this</li>
</ul>

<p>Your teaching experience must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consist of time spent teaching (as opposed to other responsibilities in a school)</li>
  <li>have taken place in 2 separate schools (not 2 classes within the same school or 2 school sites within the same organisation)</li>
  <li>demonstrate you’ve taught young people from a range of different backgrounds</li>
  <li>demonstrate you’re familiar with different approaches to teaching, learning and school management</li>
</ul>

<p>Your teaching experience can have been:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gained in any type of school (for example, international schools, schools teaching the International Baccalaureate, and state-maintained schools outside the UK)</li>
  <li>spent teaching a non-English curriculum (though you may need to show you have knowledge of the subjects taught in the English curriculum)</li>
  <li>divided between 2 school settings as long as you have 2 years teaching experience in total</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to apply for an assessment only <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Your application for assessment only <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> must be made to one of the UK government’s approved assessment only teacher training providers in England. You will not need to visit or train in England to do assessment only <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Assessment only costs</h4>

<p>Fees range from about £1,500 to £4,000, but vary between providers and may be substantially more if you are outside the UK. Check with individual providers for more details.</p>

<p>An assessment of your teaching will be carried out in person at your place of work by an examiner from your chosen teacher training provider.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">

</div>

<p>Before you apply, contact your chosen teacher training provider directly to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check they accept international applications for assessment only <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>check they can come to your country to do the assessment (if you are not in England)</li>
  <li>confirm your eligibility for assessment only</li>
  <li>learn more about their specific requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>If your application is successful, the assessment only provider will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>help you put together a portfolio of your teaching work, to demonstrate you meet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards">English Teachers’ Standards</a>
</li>
  <li>carry out an assessment of your teaching</li>
  <li>ask to see evidence of your qualifications</li>
  <li>potentially ask you to sit a test to demonstrate your written and spoken English is fluent, accurate and clear, and is equivalent to grade 4 in GCSE English language</li>
  <li>potentially ask you to sit a test to demonstrate your mathematics knowledge and, for primary school teaching, science knowledge is equivalent to grade 4 in GCSE mathematics or science</li>
</ul>

<p>You will also need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-assessment-only-route-to-qts/assessment-only-route-to-qts-criteria-and-supporting-advice#a13-suitability">have the health and physical capacity to train to teach</a></li>
  <li>undergo safeguarding checks to assess your suitability to teach, carried out by your assessment only provider</li>
</ul>

<p>If your assessment only provider is satisfied you’ve met the standards required to teach in England, you’ll be awarded <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> and will be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">apply for teaching jobs in England</a>.</p>

<p>If you fail to meet the standards required for assessment only <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>re-apply when you’ve gained more relevant skills and experience</li>
  <li>gain your <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> by training to teach in England</li>
</ul>

<h2>Countries outside the UK that recognise <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> as a teaching qualification</h2>

<p>Your English <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> will be recognised in many countries around the world. However, the application process for recognition in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland may have changed since 1 January 2021. Check with the organisation responsible for regulating teachers in the country where you want to teach.</p>

<h2>International teacher training courses that do not include <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>
</h2>

<p>International teacher training courses (for example the PGCEi) do not lead to <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> and will not qualify you to teach in English schools where <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> is a legal requirement.</p>

<p>A variety of international teacher training courses are offered by both English and non-English colleges and universities to candidates outside England.</p>

<p>These courses include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Postgraduate Certificate of Education International (PGCEi, sometimes called an International Postgraduate Certificate of Education, or iPGCE)</li>
  <li>Postgraduate Certificate of Education (PGCE)</li>
  <li>Postgraduate Diploma in Education (PGDE)</li>
</ul>

<p>After completing one of these courses, and depending on where you gained your experience and qualifications, you can apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#AO">for an assessment only <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr></a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#eng">to train to teach in England</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Get help from training providers in England</h3>

<p>Some English colleges and universities offering PGCEi and similar courses can also help with your application for assessment only <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>.</p>

<p>To check which training providers offer this support, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/explore-my-options/teacher-training-routes/specialist-training-options/assessment-only/ao-provider-list" rel="external">the UK government’s approved teacher training providers</a> in England and contact them for advice.</p>

<h3>Combined PGCE and <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> training courses</h3>

<p>Combined PGCE and <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> teacher training courses are only available if you study in England. Search the UK government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses">Find postgraduate teacher training</a> service for details.</p>

<h2>Early career teacher (<abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>) induction</h2>

<p>Having qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>) allows you to apply for paid teaching jobs in England, but many schools will also require you to complete an Early Career Teacher (<abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>) 2-year induction period.</p>

<p>During this time you’ll work and be assessed as a paid teacher in a school. This induction period is part of the UK government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework">Early Career Framework</a> for teachers. You’ll be expected to show you meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards">Teachers’ Standards</a> and you’ll also get training and support from a mentor.</p>

<h3>Induction for teachers working or training outside England</h3>

<p>If you are already working as a teacher outside England, and applying for an assessment only <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>, you may not need to complete an induction period in England. Check with your assessment only provider.</p>

<p>You can also complete your induction outside England in the country where you are now working or training. However the school where you complete your induction must have met requirements set by DfE in England. Check a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/british-schools-overseas-inspection-reports/british-schools-overseas-accredited-schools-inspection-reports">list of schools which have met these requirements</a>.</p>

<h2>Teacher training to English standards outside the UK</h2>

<p>You can continue to live and work outside the UK while:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gaining your 2 years’ teaching experience for assessment only <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>undergoing an assessment for assessment only <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>applying for <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> to the Teaching Regulation Agency (<abbr title="Teaching Regulation Agency">TRA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>completing your early career teacher (<abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>) induction period</li>
</ul>

<p>These routes to <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> suit candidates who wish to teach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in their home country</li>
  <li>internationally to English standards</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/explore-my-options/overseas-applicants" rel="external">in schools in England later</a></li>

<p>While <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> and <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> induction are not legal requirements for schools outside England, they will strengthen your application for teaching jobs in British international schools and many schools teaching in the English language.</p>

<p>If you are planning to teach outside the UK, you should always check the specific qualifications needed to teach in your chosen country and type of school before training or studying.</p>
