<p><strong>James Bowler - <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> Permanent Secretary</strong></p>

<p>The Department for International Trade (<abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>) is central to the government’s domestic and global agenda. <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s vision and mission is to champion open and fair global trading. This helps drives growth, attract investment, creates better jobs and higher wages, and improves living standards in this country and around the world. <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s analytical functions and analytical skillsets are critical to its mission and vision. Being accountable for taxpayers’ money and having evidence-based policies is essential to achieve our mission.</p>

<p>Policy should be guided by analysis, monitoring and evaluation; <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> is a learning organisation. Monitoring and evaluation are fundamental activities for any learning organisation that is keen to improve its performance. They help to foster a culture of innovation and learning. To my mind monitoring and evaluation have a crucial role to play at 3 stages within the policy cycle. These include programme design stage to inform and clarify objectives; at implementation stage to flag risks and enable adjustments; at exit stage to gather lessons learned. This strategy sets out how we intend to achieve this.</p>

<p><strong>Ceri Smith – Director General, Strategy and Investment</strong></p>

<p>This is a joint strategy that brings together our policy profession, operational delivery and analytical communities. Ultimately using evaluation to drive our performance is about making better policies and delivery strategies. Evaluation evidence informs policy design, helps set clear objectives to measure progress and builds in feedback loops and robust evaluation plans to address evidence gaps.</p>

<p>Since its creation our department has been focused on creating new trading opportunities and attracting investments. Now we have the first trade deals signed between the UK and international partners, it is more important than ever to embed monitoring and evaluation.  It will help us capture the impact of these trade deals for our businesses, consumers and trade flows. We have export and investment transformation programmes and need a coherent approach to understand their value to the UK economy, consumers, regions and trading partners. This evaluation strategy is a fantastic opportunity to understand more about our impact on trade and investment opportunities for UK businesses and the global community.</p>

<p><strong>Amanda Brooks – Director General, Trade Negotiations, Head of Policy Profession</strong></p>

<p>This strategy is for everyone in <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>. Accountability and learning are critical areas not only across all analytical professions but also crucial for the policy and project delivery professions.</p>

<p>As head of <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s policy profession I want to increase our understanding of monitoring and evaluation and show the value it brings to our policies. This strategy will complement the role of our existing structures that manage performance and ensure quality programme delivery. It will be particularly useful to support an organisational culture of learning and improvement. <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> has great opportunities for sharing learning and retaining longer-term institutional knowledge of what has and hasn’t worked in the past. We can play this learning back into strategic decisions on prioritisation of funding for future programmes and projects.</p>

<h2>Executive summary</h2>

<h3>The why</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> believes monitoring and evaluation will help achieve our vision: to create a UK that trades its way to prosperity, stability and security.</p>

<p>Timely performance data and insights on what works enable us to help more businesses export, import and attract inward and outward investment. It is also essential to help us negotiate market access and trade deals and champion free trade.</p>

<p>We see having a compelling evidence base as helping to avoid the risk of spending public money on activities that do not work as intended. We will use monitoring and evaluation to support policy and operational delivery, inform our interventions and guide decisions on whether to continue, stop or amend our interventions. For example, the UK is negotiating new free trade agreements as an independent trading nation. The insights from planned evaluations of the free trade agreements that we have already conducted and agreed will inform our negotiations with other countries. This will ensure <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> is focusing its resources where they add most value, maximising the impact and cost-effectiveness of our investment of taxpayers’ money.</p>

<h3>The how</h3>

<p>To deliver on this vision <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> will draw on its greatest asset – our people. Championed by senior leaders, we will use our expertise across policy and analytical professions, data scientists, project delivery and data, digital and technology, science and engineering communities.</p>

<p>Monitoring and evaluation is a critical tool to support policy delivery and inform decisions on whether to continue, stop or amend our interventions. We will embed monitoring and evaluation into <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> processes, making it a fundamental part of the policy/programme cycle. This will ensure <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> is focusing its resources where they add most value. Our analysts will make sure that evaluations in <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> are designed to the highest standards. This will ensure we provide the best evidence we can use to make a difference – in terms of timeliness, relevance and accessibility.</p>

<h3>The what</h3>

<p>Our strategy relies on effective use of budgets, resources, governance processes and operational tools to achieve our objectives. <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> is committed to resourcing evaluation staffing and budgets adequately to undertake high quality evaluations and proactively use results to inform our work.</p>

<p>For the 2022 to 2025 spending review period <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> will allocate a minimum 1% of its programme budgets to evaluation or 2% for transformation programmes. We will also ensure sophisticated and accessible presentation tools are in place to enable this work to be both usable and impactful.</p>

<h3>How we will measure success</h3>

<p>We will increase the volume of high-quality monitoring and evaluation (<abbr title="monitoring and evaluation">M&amp;E</abbr>) plans and demonstrate robust planning, commissioning and delivery and use of <abbr title="monitoring and evaluation">M&amp;E</abbr> activity. Creating enhanced recognition and understanding of monitoring and evaluation across the <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> community will enable us to demonstrate learning from our evaluation evidence base. It will also offer increased ability to account for our impact which we will share through publishing our evaluation findings. <a class="govuk-link" href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a> shows our guiding principles for monitoring and evaluation in <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> which are described in Section 2 of this document.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>Understanding performance is the foundation from which any organisation can aim to improve its services. Monitoring and evaluation support this by collecting systematic evidence of what has been achieved and the impact of our activities. This then illustrates the added value of our services, what works and what doesn’t work, how and why. Creating this evidence base can be supported by good quality management information as an important source of data to enable performance tracking over time.</p>

<h3>a. Purpose of the strategy</h3>

<p>This is <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s first monitoring and evaluation strategy since its launch in 2016. This strategy articulates the Department’s collective approach for the first time and most importantly, how we will implement the strategy over the next 3 years.</p>

<p>This strategy is for everyone in <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> and aims to embed the use of evidence to understand what works at the heart of <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s activities. It will touch on the work of many colleagues across all professions. Our commitments will help raise understanding of performance across the department by outlining how <abbr title="monitoring and evaluation">M&amp;E</abbr> will support our policy making and service delivery.</p>

<p>This evaluation strategy also supports our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/department-for-international-trade-outcome-delivery-plan">Outcome Delivery Plan</a>. The outcome indicators used in <abbr title="monitoring and evaluation">M&amp;E</abbr> frameworks will be aligned to our approach for departmental performance. Evaluation priorities will feed into <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dit-areas-of-research-interest"><abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s Areas of Research Interest</a> publication which communicates our evidence and research needs to external stakeholders.</p>

<h3>b. Why using monitoring and evaluation to understand performance is important for <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Monitoring and evaluation are essential to help us deliver on our vision and mission and keep us on track. Our vision is to champion open and fair global trade driving growth, better jobs and higher wages, and improving UK and global living standards. To achieve this, <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> aims to help businesses export and grow in global markets and overseas companies to grow in the UK. Evidence gathered via monitoring and performance reports and evaluations is therefore essential to prioritise our resources and efforts towards this. By understanding the performance of our policies and programmes, <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> can achieve its mission faster and better. We will be even more effective in helping UK businesses grow and facilitating economic growth and prosperity through increased trade and investment.</p>

<p>Evaluation can demonstrate impact of what we have achieved and show value for money of our work to the public. As stated in our export strategy, <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> tries not to offer services that the market is better placed to provide. Rather we focus on where markets fail and where we can add value<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. We also have to deal with matters that are essentially intergovernmental. To do that well, we need timely evidence of our progress and where we add value to fill evidence gaps and inform our future work. To provide the right mix of services to businesses we need to measure their relative effectiveness, return on investment and value added.</p>

<p>So, as a department, we are keen to build in an agile evaluative approach to inform our progress towards our goals. This could involve new ways of using existing data. For example, using export and investment transformation data can reduce the lag between insight and action to proactively guide intervention design.</p>

<p>We will use monitoring and evaluation to support policy delivery and inform our interventions and guide decisions on whether to continue, stop or amend our interventions. The UK is negotiating new free trade agreements as an independent trading nation and insights from these evaluations will inform negotiations with other countries. This will ensure <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> is focusing its resources where they add most value, maximising the impact and cost-effectiveness of our investment of taxpayers’ money. Strong <abbr title="monitoring and evaluation">M&amp;E</abbr> evidence also gives assurance to continuing initiatives, interventions and policies that are proven to work while informing decisions to deprioritise investments. To support these decisions, we aim to gather insights and evidence by using a combination of established and innovative approaches.</p>

<h3>c. Scope</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s monitoring and evaluation strategy covers all our programmes and operations globally and is informed by HMG <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-magenta-book">Magenta Book guidance on evaluation</a>. It excludes independent arm’s length bodies, such as Trade Remedies Authority, and UK Export Finance which is a separate government department. We will consider any commonalities between their work and <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s as needed in evaluating <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> activities and services.</p>

<p>The strategy covers externally commissioned and published evaluations, but not unpublished internal assessments with commercially sensitive content. The guiding principles also apply to internal evaluations with the caveat that publication must be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>The core principles and vision set out in this strategy will guide <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s approach to understanding our performance via monitoring and evaluation over the years to come. But we also recognise that departmental needs evolve, so we will review and update our detailed evaluation plans in 3 years’ time. This strategy covers the period financial year (FY) 2022 to 2023 to 2025 to 2026.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>What counts as evaluation in DIT</h3>

<p><strong>Focus on relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, value for money or impact</strong>: our evaluations will meet the minimum standards and use methods and evaluation design approaches recommended in the Magenta Book. These may include impact evaluation, economic, theory-based, or process evaluation and mixed designs where needed. We may also include identifying unintended consequences.</p>

<p><strong>Independent</strong>: delivered by individuals outside the team making the intervention to ensure findings are objective and impartial.</p>

<p><strong>Peer reviewed</strong>: independent quality assurance by external expert(s) where appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>External or internal</strong>: either externally commissioned or conducted internally. For internal evaluations, results should be externally peer reviewed where appropriate to ensure independence.</p>

<p><strong>Published</strong>: commissioned evaluation reports will be published by default on GOV.UK. For internal evaluations we will consider publications as appropriate.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Our vision for monitoring and evaluation that drives performance</h2>

<p>We will achieve <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s vision through our 6 guiding principles for using monitoring and evaluation to drive performance. These principles support <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> values<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> of being ‘Expert’ via focusing on quality <abbr title="monitoring and evaluation">M&amp;E</abbr> evidence and ‘Engaging’ and ‘Inclusive’ through making findings transparent and accessible. They support being ‘Enterprising’ via our ambition to use innovative techniques and drive learning through understanding performance.</p>

<p>To ensure we deliver on our commitments, <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> will resource evaluation adequately. We will ensure the department has the financial and staff resources needed to undertake quality evaluations and use them proactively to inform our work. For the 2022 to 2025 spending review period <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> will allocate a minimum 1% of its standard programme budgets to evaluation or 2% for transformation programmes.</p>

<h2>Principle 1: use of evidence and uptake of learning to design and implement policies and programmes</h2>

<h3>Why</h3>

<p>Many of our programmes already value the insight we get from customers and stakeholders to improve their delivery. But if we do not implement learning from monitoring and evaluation systematically, we will not reap the benefits of our investment.</p>

<h3>How</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> is committed to foster a culture of experimenting, learning and adapting. We will prioritise learning from pilots and monitoring and evaluation to inform all our programme and policy decisions and future interventions. We will view any negative findings as just as useful for learning as championing our work through success stories.</p>

<h3>What</h3>

<p>SROs and leaders will be expected to show how they are using learning from research, monitoring and evaluation to make decisions about their programmes. Learning from performance reports, monitoring dashboards or evaluations will feed into policy decisions on whether interventions should start, continue, be adapted, paused or stopped. We will use this learning to build a strong narrative of our successes and understand lessons from initiatives that failed or need improvement.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> will provide training and support to colleagues in using evidence to make decisions as needed via the policy profession network and the Central Analysis Team.</p>

<p>We will seek opportunities to apply principles of ‘test, learn, adapt’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> through pilots, trials and experimentation. This will help us to learn iteratively about what works through the policy design and delivery cycle.</p>

<h2>Principle 2: strong governance for focus on learning and results from <abbr title="monitoring and evaluation">M&amp;E</abbr>
</h2>

<h3>Why</h3>

<p>Embedding monitoring and evaluation into <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s DNA requires some supporting mechanisms which enable us to track our performance, accountability and exert control. Without this we may not be able to ensure that all parts of <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> are fully reaping the benefits of investing in <abbr title="monitoring and evaluation">M&amp;E</abbr>.</p>

<h3>How</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> will embed proportionate <abbr title="monitoring and evaluation">M&amp;E</abbr> arrangements (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#principle-5">Principle 5</a>) into existing departmental processes to ensure we learn from our evidence base, even in challenging circumstances. We will build opportunities for new programmes to learn from evidence at design, implementation and closure stage.</p>

<p>Monitoring and evaluation have a central role to play at multiple stages within the policy cycle (see also <a class="govuk-link" href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a>).</p>

<p>In the policy cycle:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at programme design stage they inform interventions and help clarify objectives</li>
  <li>at implementation stage, timely monitoring data and evaluation can flag risks and prompt adjustments</li>
  <li>at exit stage after a policy has been implemented, findings from evaluation activities can offer an opportunity to gather lessons learned for future interventions</li>
</ul>

<h3>What</h3>

<p>To ensure seamless integration of evidence on performance into departmental structures, <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> will further embed <abbr title="monitoring and evaluation">M&amp;E</abbr> into existing decision-making boards and processes. This will include delivery, investment and management boards at business case development and delivery stage for regular monitoring.</p>

<p>Our central committees will perform an audit function to ensure <abbr title="monitoring and evaluation">M&amp;E</abbr> planning, resourcing and delivery is adequate across all our areas of delivery. Through <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s existing processes for developing business cases we will ensure that proportionate monitoring and evaluation arrangements are planned for every new area of spend.</p>

<h2>Principle 3: capability building across the department</h2>

<h3>Why</h3>
<p>The need to grow evaluation expertise is common across government and <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> would benefit from a broader base of evaluation capability across our community. A recent report on evaluation in government found more effort is needed to increase capability in using evaluation among policy developers and decision makers.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup></p>

<h3>How</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> is already upskilling staff across the department including analysts, policy and decision-makers through externally commissioned training. <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> is committed to further building capability in using <abbr title="monitoring and evaluation">M&amp;E</abbr> for policy and project delivery colleagues by working with our policy profession network. We will use our governance mechanisms (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#principle-2">Principle 2</a> to ensure we have analytical monitoring and evaluation capacity and coverage across <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> is proportionate and prioritised.</p>

<h3>What</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> already helps staff from all professions learn about how <abbr title="monitoring and evaluation">M&amp;E</abbr> can inform our understanding of programme/service performance. We will continue to support and expand these activities.</p>

<p>Monitoring and evaluation training is part of the core curriculum for all analysts in the department. We use it to build the right skills for <abbr title="monitoring and evaluation">M&amp;E</abbr> plan development, managing evaluations, quality assuring results or supporting design of new interventions. The Central Analysis Team will expand the support we provide to reach more colleagues in our overseas network.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s Central Analysis Team coordinates capability building activities and produces guidance on monitoring and evaluation for the department in line with HMG guidance.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> It supports a network of <abbr title="monitoring and evaluation">M&amp;E</abbr> practitioners who peer review central guidance and provide practical support for ongoing <abbr title="monitoring and evaluation">M&amp;E</abbr> activities. We will work with this group to define further <abbr title="monitoring and evaluation">M&amp;E</abbr> skills needs and broker suitable solutions. These will ensure we are well placed to build understanding of the impact of our services.</p>

<p>The team has established an <abbr title="monitoring and evaluation">M&amp;E</abbr> Community, open to everyone in <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> across all professions. Its goal is to provide a platform for sharing learning across the department and encourage more people to champion use of learning from evaluations. We will seek to maximise engagement across all areas of <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> will continue to draw on insights and inspiration for good practice from across government and wider specialist networks to improve our capability. This will include supportive challenge from the Evaluation Taskforce and the Cross-Government Evaluation Group.</p>

<h2>Principle 4: transparency and accessibility of evidence on performance, monitoring and evaluation</h2>

<h3>Why</h3>

<p>Having easy access at the right time and in the right format to insights from monitoring and evaluation is critical. Without this the most important customers may not reap the benefits of learning from evidence. This applies to external as well as internal customers so everyone can learn and benefit from <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s monitoring and evaluation.</p>

<h3>How</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> is committed to make evidence about performance and evaluation easy to access including publishing externally commissioned evaluations by default on GOV.UK. There is a route to exemption if methodological or other sensitivities apply. The department will publish details of how recommendations and learning from published evaluations have been taken on board within 6 to 12 months.</p>

<h3>What</h3>

<p>Project managers of evaluations will distil and tailor their findings into the most appropriate formats to meet the needs of internal and external audiences. They will share and promote results widely across the department through a bespoke internal communications strategy. <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> will commit to meet HMT’s expectations by following the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-social-research-publication-protocols">Government Social Research Publication Protocol</a> and will support publication of evaluations by default on GOV.UK with an agreed process for considering exceptions on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>The Central Analysis Team will support colleagues through capability building to ensure core messages from evaluations are communicated clearly. We will work constructively with the Cabinet Office’s Evaluation Taskforce to maximise transparency of our evidence base.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> will not typically publish detailed process evaluations using for example internal management data of uncertain quality though these will be undertaken for continuous improvement.</p>

<p>We will use networks and online resources to share monitoring and evaluation evidence across the department ensuring it is easy to find and accessible for all teams.</p>

<h2>Principle 5: proportionate coverage for learning and accountability</h2>

<h3>Why</h3>

<p>Project and programme interventions vary hugely in characteristics such as size, novelty and risk. This means they require different levels of intensity and complexity in analysis to understand how successful they are.</p>

<h3>How: setting up clear criteria to identify and prioritise evidence generation for evaluation across <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>
</h3>

<p>At a minimum <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> will collect monitoring data for all programmes and services we deliver to businesses and investors.</p>

<p>Proportionate approach to evaluation: As outlined in the Magenta Book, not all activities will require the same effort and resources for evaluation. Large-scale, high profile, untested, complex or costly policies/programmes tend to require external evaluation so we can be confident in drawing conclusions about their success. Smaller, routine policies which have been already tested may only need light touch assessment.</p>

<p>To ensure <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s approach is pragmatic and proportionate, teams designing and analysing programmes will decide what is proportionate for every programme or area of spend. The criteria to be applied for every <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> policy area or service will make up a basket of measures to judge the level of effort that is needed.</p>

<p>They include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the scale of investment:
    <ul>
      <li>programmes below £1 million require as a minimum monitoring through SMART indicators</li>
      <li>small programmes ranging from £1 million to  £10 million are expected to have monitoring and consider using internal evaluation by <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> analysts as a minimum</li>
      <li>medium sized programmes ranging from £10 million to £50 million would normally consider external evaluation</li>
      <li>large programmes of at least £50 million require robust monitoring and independent assessment which by default would include external evaluation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>strategic imperative: high profile policies of strategic importance in areas of high media or public require external evaluation</li>
  <li>ability to influence delivery of the policy and ongoing roll-out is likely to increase the need for evaluation</li>
  <li>delivering statutory obligations may require evaluation even for smaller scale programmes</li>
  <li>degree of risk: innovative policies/programmes or activities delivered in highly uncertain contexts carry more risk. This requires using evaluation to understand how successful they are to justify continuation and use opportunities to adapt to maximise their impact</li>
  <li>need for evidence on what works: untested policies and services which are not yet supported by evidence of what works require evaluation. <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> will pilot these programmes where feasible and use monitoring and evaluation evidence to inform their development before scaling them up</li>
</ul>

<p>Much of <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> funding is used to deliver services across the world to promote trade and investment with partner countries. Activities such as influencing trading partners contribute to wider government objectives to increase the UK’s influence and global prosperity.</p>

<p>These objectives are shared with other departments such as the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. We will aim to understand <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s contribution to wider goals and where appropriate our teams will collaborate with other departments. This may include sharing data and undertaking joint analysis to identify what works in different contexts.</p>

<h3>What</h3>

<p>For every project, programme or service funded by <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>, project managers will work with analysts to help develop a proportionate <abbr title="monitoring and evaluation">M&amp;E</abbr> framework as part of their design. The quality of the evaluation plans is assessed by an internal independent analyst. <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s Project and Change Committee will require an <abbr title="monitoring and evaluation">M&amp;E</abbr> plan and proportionate resource to implement it to approve business cases. The framework or plan will aim to address evidence gaps and include an outline of research, evaluation and monitoring arrangements to plug them.</p>

<p>Our funding commitment: <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> is committed to ensuring it has sufficient staffing and allocated funds to undertake high quality evaluations and use their results to inform our work. For the 2022 to 2025 spending review period <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> will allocate a minimum 1% of its standard programme budgets to evaluation or 2% for transformation programmes. We will ensure these funds are used to deliver the evaluations we need using the scrutiny function of our central committees (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#principle-2">Principle 2</a>).</p>

<h2>Principle 6: high quality monitoring and evaluation</h2>

<h3>Why</h3>

<p>Drawing sound conclusions and making good decisions is dependent on having a compelling evidence base. Without ensuring high quality standards in all our monitoring and evaluation activities, we may make choices which are suboptimal or just plain wrong.</p>

<h3>How</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s approach to evaluation is informed by HM Treasury’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-green-book-appraisal-and-evaluation-in-central-governent">Green Book guidance on appraisal and evaluation</a> and its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-magenta-book">Magenta Book guidance on evaluation</a>.</p>

<p>Our research and analysis is informed by government social research guidelines<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-aqua-book-guidance-on-producing-quality-analysis-for-government">Aqua Book</a> and wider good practice.</p>

<p>We will follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/" rel="external">Government Statistical Service Code of Practice</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/project-delivery-functional-standard">project delivery standards</a> in generating and reporting on monitoring data. <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> is interested in understanding its performance and the added value of its work. We will aim to establish baseline data, performance metrics and points of comparison so we can understand the impact of our policies and programmes.</p>

<h3>What</h3>

<p>To generate evidence on programme and policy performance, we will choose the most appropriate evaluation methods for each project/programme.</p>

<p>All evaluations will have clear aims, be informed by a bespoke theory of change for each area and be designed to meet stakeholders’ needs. We will use a collaborative approach and will involve all stakeholders to agree an optimal set of questions to investigate.</p>

<p>Focus on impact and causality. For every programme we want to collect data on participating and non-participating organisations to understand how far we are making a difference. In line with the Magenta Book, we will aim to use experimental and quasi experimental approaches. Where this is not feasible, we will seek to understand how far <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> plausibly contributed to programme results. Every programme funded by <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> is expected to record activities and to assess outcomes and, where possible, impacts. Where assessing impact is not possible or appropriate, programmes will need to explain and justify this.</p>

<p>Across our work, we will aim to understand <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s contribution towards government priorities. In practice this mean better recording and breaking down data to allow detailed spatial or sub-group analysis where possible. This also means identifying relevant cross-cutting priorities and planning thematic evaluations aligned to strategic priorities.</p>

<p>Every intervention will have clear requirements to generate good quality data to monitor performance and to understand performance outcomes. We will drive up the quality and coverage of routinely collected data by developing consistent protocols and draw on departmental performance metrics. In line with <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s Data Strategy, our data scientists will use our digital infrastructure to gather information enabling us to monitor the progress of our work. We are reviewing our approach to collecting and reporting data on customer interactions to ensure it will help us systematically understand our performance. We will supplement primary research with secondary data and additional sources as necessary. We are collaborating with other government departments to expand the features of various trade data sets and will seek to avoid duplication and make use of data matching where possible.</p>

<p>In line with our funding commitment, <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> will allocate adequate analytic and project delivery resource to support the generation, collection and quality assurance of reliable performance monitoring data.</p>

<p>We will harness impartial perspectives through using external contractors where appropriate but due to the sensitivity of some of <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s work we will undertake some evaluation internally. For example we need to treat UK negotiating positions for trade agreements confidentially.</p>

<p>Build and maintain impartial and transparent quality assurance. This will ensure the quality and reliability of evaluations and will provide <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> and its partners with assurance in the findings. Quality standards and independence of internal evaluations will be maintained through quality assurance using HMG analysis profession standards.</p>

<p>We expect every evaluation conducted in <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> to be quality assured by:</p>

<p><strong>A steering group<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup></strong>: harnessing all principle stakeholders to ensure delivery and provide critical friend challenge. Stakeholders can provide valuable input throughout the evaluation from design stage to initial findings and final report prior to publication.</p>

<p><strong>Independent peer review</strong>: we will take a proportionate approach to using external and internal peer review of evaluations in <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> depending on size, scale, complexity and degree of risk. This will make best use of independent experts to support high quality evaluations at crucial stages of their development and delivery.</p>

<p><strong>Internal analytical quality assurance processes built into monitoring reports</strong>: <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> will embed quality assurance of relevant monitoring and performance data. This will enable progress tracking over time across programmes and priority areas and ensure data meets appropriate quality standards.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Rolling out our strategy in practice</h2>

<p>This evaluation strategy is an exciting opportunity for <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> to understand more about our potentially powerful impact on trade and investment opportunities for businesses. These may benefit firms in the UK and the wider global community.</p>

<p>We will communicate the strategy widely with our staff, partners and stakeholders and implement our commitments for evidence-based programmes through robust monitoring and evaluation plans. We will embed monitoring and evaluation in our policy and programming cycle to inform not just policy design but also drive delivery throughout implementation. <a class="govuk-link" href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a> shows how monitoring and evaluation can feed in throughout the whole of project and programme life cycles.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2: Embedding monitoring and evaluation in <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s policy and programme life cycle</strong></p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/154720/rationale-objectives-appraisal-monitoring-evaluation-and-feedback-policy-and-project-cycle-flow-diagram.svg"></div></figure>

<p>Figure 2 illustrates the ROAMEF (Rationale, Objectives, Appraisal, Monitoring, Evaluation and Feedback) policy and project cycle and how monitoring and evaluation supports this.</p>

<p>It shows that evaluation evidence is expected in developing the business case for intervention and stresses that objective setting should include considering what success looks like. It invites use of evidence about what works in considering options and using data to assess progress in delivery over time against anticipated results. Lastly, evaluation considers whether and why the policy or project achieved the desired impact and uses learning to improve future policy and service delivery.</p>

<p>The Central Analysis Team will review our progress against the actions we have committed to take in this strategy every 2 years.</p>

<p>This will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>establishing how far evidence about delivery and performance is being used well to reshape our services to better meet customer needs</li>
  <li>tracking how our plans to monitor accountability for <abbr title="monitoring and evaluation">M&amp;E</abbr> delivery through our governance structures are influencing plans across programmes, use of resources and investment decisions</li>
  <li>monitoring the take-up, coverage and application of learning and development support to build evaluation capability</li>
  <li>ensuring internal accessibility of learning from evaluations and tracking delivery of our commitment to external publication</li>
  <li>tracking external spend and staff resourcing against evaluation investment commitments</li>
  <li>mapping how well we are applying review and assurance processes to maximise evaluation quality</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s vision is to champion open and fair global trading that drives growth, creates better jobs and higher wages, and improves living standards in this country and around the world. To do this we need to help attract investment, give our exporters the tools, support and opportunities to succeed through global trade and help maintain fair trading systems across the world. Monitoring and evaluation is a powerful approach in our toolkit to drive our performance and through implementing this strategy, we will ensure the insights it can create are accessible to and useful for all <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s teams.</p>
