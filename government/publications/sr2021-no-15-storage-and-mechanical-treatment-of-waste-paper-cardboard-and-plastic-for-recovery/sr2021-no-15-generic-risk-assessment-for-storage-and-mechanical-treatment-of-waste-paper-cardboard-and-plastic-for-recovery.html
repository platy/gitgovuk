<p>The Environment Agency produces the generic risk assessments for all standard rules permits. These list the potential risks and how to manage them.</p>

<p>Check this generic risk assessment to understand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the potential risks of storing and treating waste paper, cardboard and plastic</li>
  <li>if your proposed activity has the same risks and can you apply for the standard rules permit</li>
  <li>how to manage the risks effectively</li>
</ul>

<p>Each risk comprises:</p>

<ul>
  <li>information about the source, pathway and receptor – and the potential harm to that receptor</li>
  <li>a judgement of the level of risk and justification of that judgement</li>
  <li>actions for managing the risk (through permitting) and a residual risk rating after managing it</li>
</ul>

<p>Risk management involves breaking or limiting the source-pathway-receptor linkage to reduce the risk. If we set minimum distances we explain the basis of the distance, for example by modelling.</p>

<p>We will control the residual risk (after risk management) when we assess compliance.</p>

<p>If you need to check the meaning of any terms we have used (in the context of this risk assessment), see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#terms">explanation of terms</a>.</p>

<h2>Risks to people living in close proximity to the site</h2>

<h3>Dust</h3>

<p>Dust travels through the air. We have assessed the potential harm as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>general worsening of air quality</li>
  <li>nuisance and harm to human health</li>
  <li>loss of amenity</li>
</ul>

<h4>Judgement of risk</h4>

<p>We have judged the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>likelihood of the hazard affecting the receptor as low</li>
  <li>overall severity of potential consequences as medium</li>
  <li>overall risk rating as medium</li>
</ul>

<p>The reasons for giving the activity this rating is because:
* the permitted waste types do not include those consisting solely or mainly of dusts, powders or loose fibres
* all waste treatment will be within a building
* the rule set does not allow any point source emissions to air</p>

<h2>Risks to local human population and local environment</h2>

<h3>Fire by arson or vandalism</h3>

<p>Fire can cause smoke to travel through the air and contaminated water to run-off over land.</p>

<p>We have assessed the potential harm of smoke as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>respiratory irritation, illness and nuisance</li>
  <li>injury to staff or fire fighters</li>
  <li>impact on air quality</li>
</ul>

<p>Contaminated run-off could cause:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pollution of the ground</li>
  <li>pollution of groundwater and surface water</li>
</ul>

<h4>Judgement of risk</h4>

<p>We have judged the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>likelihood of the hazard affecting the receptor as medium</li>
  <li>overall severity of potential consequences as medium</li>
  <li>overall risk rating as medium</li>
</ul>

<p>The reasons for giving the activity this rating is because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the risk of unauthorised access and arson is low</li>
  <li>all waste will be kept secure</li>
  <li>the fire prevention plan will set out control measures including security, fire prevention, fire detection and fire response</li>
  <li>there is a limit to maximum quantity of waste on site. In particular, waste plastics are limited to 500 tonnes at any one time.</li>
  <li>the site will not be located within a groundwater source protection zone 1, or within 50 metres of springs, wells or boreholes used for drinking water</li>
</ul>

<h4>Managing the risk</h4>

<p>To manage the risk we may request fire prevention plan improvements. Taking this action will control the risk and rate it as ‘low’.</p>

  <li>the fire prevention plan will set out control measures including fire prevention, detection and response</li>
</ul>

<h4>Managing the risk</h4>

<p>To manage the risk we may request fire prevention plan improvements. Taking this action will control the risk and rate it as ‘low’.</p>

<h2>Risk to surface waters</h2>

<p>These risks relate to surface waters close to and downstream of the site.</p>

<h3>Liquid spills and contaminated rainwater run-off</h3>

<p>This risk could cause water quality to deteriorate through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>run-off from the site across the ground</li>
  <li>surface water drains and ditches</li>
  <li>run-off through the soil</li>
</ul>

<h4>Judgement of risk</h4>

<ul>
  <li>likelihood of the hazard affecting the receptor as medium</li>
  <li>overall severity of potential consequences as medium</li>
  <li>overall risk rating as medium</li>
</ul>

<p>The reasons for giving the activity this rating is because:</p>

<h4>Managing the risk</h4>

<p>To manage the risk we may require an emissions management plan. Taking this action will control the risk and rate it as ‘low’.</p>

<h2>Risk to groundwater from liquid spills and contaminated rainwater run-off</h2>

<p>Liquid spills and contaminated rainwater run-off can travel through soil and groundwater. The water could then be abstracted from a borehole.</p>

<p>We have assessed the potential harm as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contamination of public or private water supplies – this would require treating the water or closing the borehole</li>
</ul>

<h4>Judgement of risk</h4>

<p>We have judged the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>likelihood of the hazard affecting the receptor as medium</li>
  <li>overall severity of potential consequences as medium</li>
  <li>overall risk rating as medium</li>
</ul>

<p>The reasons for giving the activity this rating is because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no liquid wastes can be accepted under the rule set</li>
  <li>all potentially polluting liquids will have secondary containment</li>
  <li>waste can only be stored outside if it is baled or in enclosed containers</li>

  <li>the fire prevention plan will contain measures for dealing with firewater</li>
</ul>

<h4>Managing the risk</h4>

<p>To manage the risk we may require an emissions management plan. Taking this action will control the risk and rate it as ‘low’.</p>

<h2>Risk to protected sites</h2>

<p>Protected sites include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty</li>
  <li>Marine Conservation Zones</li>
  <li>Sites of Special Scientific Interest</li>
  <li>Special Areas of Conservation</li>
  <li>Special Protection Areas</li>
  <li>Ramsar wetland sites</li>
</ul>

<p>There can be a risk to protected sites from any source and by any pathway.
We have assessed the potential harm to protected sites, they include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>toxic contamination</li>
  <li>nutrient enrichment</li>
  <li>smothering</li>
  <li>disturbance</li>
  <li>predation</li>
</ul>

<h4>Judgement of risk</h4>

<p>We have judged the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>likelihood of the hazard affecting the receptor as low</li>
  <li>overall severity of potential consequences as low</li>
  <li>overall risk rating as low</li>
</ul>

<p>The reasons for giving the activity this rating is because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sites are not allowed within a certain distance of these receptors</li>
  <li>dust and drainage controls are required as set out in other risks</li>
</ul>

<h4>Managing the risk</h4>

<p>To manage the risk we may require an emissions management plan. Taking this action will control the risk and rate it as ‘low’.</p>

<h2>Explanation of terms</h2>

<h3>Receptor</h3>

<p>The things at risk and that need protecting.</p>

<p>Receptors considered include: atmosphere, land, surface waters, groundwater, humans, wildlife and their habitats.</p>

<p>A single receptor may be at risk from several different sources and all must be addressed.</p>

<h3>Source</h3>

<p>The agent or process that has the potential to cause harm.</p>

<p>A contaminant or pollutant (a hazard) that has the potential to cause harm. For example, the activity or operation taking place for which a particular hazard may arise.</p>

<h3>Harm</h3>

<p>The harmful consequence to the receptor if the hazard is realised.</p>

<h3>Pathways</h3>

<p>The route or means by which a defined hazard may affect a receptor.</p>

<h3>Source-pathway-receptor linkage</h3>

<p>There has to be a link between the source, pathway and receptor for there to be a risk.</p>

<h3>Likelihood of exposure</h3>

<p>This is the likelihood of the receptors being exposed to the hazard. The meaning of the definitions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>high – exposure is probable – direct exposure is likely with no or few barriers between the hazard source and the receptor</li>
  <li>medium – exposure is fairly probable - feasible exposure is possible as the barriers to exposure are less controllable</li>
  <li>low – exposure is unlikely – several barriers exist between the hazard source and receptor to reduce exposure</li>
  <li>very low – exposure is very unlikely – effective, multiple barriers are in place to reduce exposure</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overall magnitude of potential consequence</h3>

<p>This is the severity of the consequence if the hazard is realised and may cause actual or potential harm.</p>

<p>This will have a high, medium, low or very low rating using attributes and scaling to consider ‘harm’.</p>

<h3>Risk rating</h3>

<p>We work out the risk rating by combining the likelihood of exposure with the magnitude of the potential consequences.</p>

<p>We assign these ratings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>high risk – requires additional assessment and active management</li>
  <li>medium risk – requires additional assessment and may need active management and, or monitoring (or both)</li>
  <li>low and very low risks will require a periodic review</li>
</ul>
