<p>The Environmental Permitting (England &amp; Wales) Regulations 2016 - Chapter 4 Standard rules</p>

<h2>Introductory note</h2>

<p>This introductory note is a non-technical summary and does not form a part of these standard rules. Operators will need to check all of the rules in detail to ensure they can comply with them at all times.</p>

<p>These rules allow a named operator to store, or store and treat waste paper, cardboard and plastic for the purpose of recovery.</p>

<p>Treatment is limited to sorting, shredding, cutting, separation, compaction, baling and bale-breaking.</p>

<p>You can accept no more than 120,000 tonnes of waste at the site each year.</p>

<p>No more than 2,400 tonnes of waste can be stored at any one time.</p>

<p>All waste must be treated indoors. Waste can only be stored outside if it is securely baled or in a fully enclosed container.</p>

<p>The site must be a minimum distance from certain types of sensitive areas and sites. It cannot be within:</p>

<ul>
  <li>200 metres of a European site, Ramsar, Site of Special Scientific Interest or Marine Conservation Zone</li>
  <li>50 metres of a National Nature Reserve, Local Nature Reserve, Local Wildlife Site, Ancient woodland or Scheduled Monument</li>
  <li>50 metres of a site that has species or habitats of principle importance (as listed in Section 41 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006) that the Environment Agency considers at risk to this activity, these are also often referred to as priority habitats and species</li>
  <li>50 metres of any well, spring or borehole used for the supply of water for human consumption, including private water supplies</li>
  <li>a groundwater source protection zone 1</li>
