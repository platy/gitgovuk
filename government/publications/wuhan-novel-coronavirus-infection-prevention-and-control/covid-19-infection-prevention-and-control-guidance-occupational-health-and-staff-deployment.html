<p>Prompt recognition of cases of COVID-19 among healthcare staff is essential to limit the spread.</p>

<p>Health and social care staff with symptoms of COVID-19 should not come to work. Refer to country specific testing requirements.</p>

<p>As a general principle, healthcare staff who provide care in settings for suspected or confirmed patients/individuals should not care for other patients. However, this has to be a local decision based on local epidemiology and the configuration of the organisation.</p>

<p>A risk assessment is required for health and social care staff at high risk of complications from COVID-19, or clinically extremely vulnerable groups, including pregnant and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (<abbr title="Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic">BAME</abbr>) staff. Guidance on carrying out risk assessments can be found by following the links to the country <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/introduction-and-organisational-preparedness" class="govuk-link">specific resources in Section 2.1</a>.</p>

<p>Employers should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>discuss with employees who are clinically extremely vulnerable, including those who are pregnant and of Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (<abbr title="Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic">BAME</abbr>) origin, the need to be deployed away from areas used for the care of those who have, or are clinically suspected of having, COVID-19; or, in primary care setting, clinics set up to manage people with COVID-19 symptoms</li>
  <li>ensure that advice is available to all health and social care staff, including specific advice to those at risk from complications</li>
</ul>

<p>Bank, agency and locum staff should follow the same deployment advice as permanent staff.</p>

<p>As part of their employer’s duty of care, providers have a role to play in ensuring that staff understand and are adequately trained in safe systems of working, including donning and doffing of personal protective equipment. A fit testing programme should be in place for those who may need to wear respiratory protection.</p>

<p>In the event of a breach in infection control procedures, staff should be reviewed by occupational health.</p>

<p>Occupational health departments should lead on the implementation of systems to monitor staff illness and absence and vaccination against COVID-19.</p>
