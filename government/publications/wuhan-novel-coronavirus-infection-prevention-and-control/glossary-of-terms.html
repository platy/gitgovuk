<h4>Aerosol generating procedures (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>)</h4>
<p>Certain medical and patient care activities that can result in the release of airborne particles (aerosols). <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> can increase the risk transmission of infections.</p>

<h4>Airborne transmission</h4>
<p>The spread of infection from one person to another by airborne particles (aerosols) containing infectious agents.</p>

<h4>Airborne particles</h4>
<p>Very small particles that may contain infectious agents. They can remain in the air for long periods of time and can be carried over long distances by air currents. Airborne particles can be released when a person coughs or sneezes, and during aerosol generating procedures (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>). ‘Droplet nuclei’ are aerosols formed from the evaporation of larger droplet particles (see droplet transmission). Aerosols formed from droplet particles in this way behave as other aerosols.</p>

<h4>Airborne precautions</h4>
<p>Measures used to prevent and control infection spread without necessarily having close patient contact via aerosols (less than or equal to 5μm) from the respiratory tract of one individual directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another individual. Aerosols can penetrate the respiratory system to the alveolar level.</p>

<h4>BS/EN standards</h4>
<p>Mandatory technical specifications created by either the British Standards Institute (BS) or European Standardisation Organisations (EN) in collaboration with government bodies, industry experts and trade associations. They aim to ensure the quality and safety of products, services and systems.</p>

<h4>Clinically vulnerable or extremely clinically vulnerable</h4>

<p>People who are defined as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19#cev" class="govuk-link">clinically extremely vulnerable</a> are at very high risk of severe illness from coronavirus.  Those included in this category will been identified by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>having one or more of conditions list, or</li>
  <li>a clinician or GP has added the individual to the Shielded Patient List</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cohort area</h4>
<p>An area (room, bay, ward) in which 2 or more patients (a cohort) with the same confirmed infection are placed. A cohort area should be physically separate from other patients.</p>

<h4>Contact precautions</h4>
<p>Measures used to prevent and control infections that spread via direct contact with the patient or indirectly from the patient’s immediate care environment (including care equipment). This is the most common route of infection transmission.</p>

<h4>Contact transmission</h4>
<p>Contact transmission is the most common route of transmission, and consists of 2 distinct types: direct contact and indirect contact. Direct transmission occurs when microorganisms are transmitted directly from an infectious individual to another individual without the involvement of another contaminated person or object (fomite). Indirect transmission occurs when microorganisms are transmitted from an infectious individual to another individual through a contaminated object or person (fomite) or person.</p>

<h4>COVID-19</h4>
<p>COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The disease was discovered in China in December 2019 and has since spread around the world.</p>

<h4>Droplet precautions</h4>
<p>Measures used to prevent and control infections spread over short distances (at least 1 metre or 3 feet) via droplets (greater than 5μm) from the respiratory tract of one individual directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another individual. Droplets penetrate the respiratory system to above the alveolar level. COVID-19 predominantly spread via this route and the precautionary distance has been maintained at 2 metres in care settings.</p>

<h4>Droplet transmission</h4>
<p>The spread of infection from one person to another by droplets containing infectious agents.</p>

<h4>Eye or face protection</h4>
<p>Worn when there is a risk from splashing of secretion (including respiratory secretions). Eye or face protection can be achieved by the use of any one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a surgical mask with integrated visor</li>
  <li>a full face visor or shield</li>
  <li>googles</li>
</ul>

<h4>Fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical face mask (<abbr title="fluid-resistant mask">FRSM</abbr>)</h4>
<p>A disposable fluid-resistant mask worn over the nose and mouth to protect the mucous membranes of the wearer’s nose and mouth from splashes and infectious droplets. FRSMs can also be used to protect patients.  When recommended for infection control purposes a ‘surgical face mask’ typically denotes a fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask.</p>

<h4>Fluid-resistant</h4>
<p>A term applied to fabrics that resist liquid penetration, often used interchangeably with ‘fluid-repellent’ when describing the properties of protective clothing or equipment.</p>

<h4>Frequently touched surfaces</h4>
<p>Surfaces of the environment which are commonly touched or come into contact with human hands.</p>

<h4>Healthcare or clinical waste</h4>
<p>Waste produced as a result of healthcare activities for example soiled dressings, sharps.</p>

<h4>Hierarchy of Controls</h4>

<p>The hierarchy of controls are used to identify the appropriate controls with Elimination, Substitution, Engineering Controls, Administrative Controls, Personal Protective Equipment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/default.html" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Hierarchy of Controls  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a></p>

<h4>High-flow nasal cannula (<abbr title="high-flow nasal cannula">HFNC</abbr>) therapy</h4>
<p><abbr title="high-flow nasal cannula">HFNC</abbr> is an oxygen supply system capable of delivering up to 100% humidified and heated oxygen at a flow rate of up to 60 litres per minute.</p>

<h4>Higher risk acute care area risk units</h4>
<p>Intensive care units, intensive therapy units, high dependency units, emergency department resuscitation areas, wards with non-invasive ventilation; operating theatres; endoscopy units for upper Respiratory, <abbr title="ear, nose and throat">ENT</abbr> or upper <abbr title="gastro-intestinal">GI</abbr> endoscopy; and other clinical areas where <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> are regularly performed. NB. Referred to as ‘AGP hot spots’.</p>

<h4>Incubation period</h4>
<p>The period between the infection of an individual by a pathogen and the manifestation of the illness or disease it causes.</p>

<h4>Induction of sputum</h4>
<p>Induction of sputum typically involves the administration of nebulised saline to moisten and loosen respiratory secretions (this may be accompanied by chest physiotherapy (percussion and vibration)) to induce forceful coughing.</p>

<h4>Infectious linen</h4>
<p>Linen that has been used by a patient who is known or suspected to be infectious and or linen that is contaminated with blood and or other body fluids, for example faeces.</p>

<h4>Long term health condition</h4>
<p>This covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchitis, emphysema or asthma</li>
  <li>heart disease</li>
  <li>kidney disease</li>
  <li>liver disease</li>
  <li>stroke or a transient ischaemic attack (TIA)</li>
  <li>diabetes</li>
  <li>lowered immunity as a result of disease or medical treatment, such as steroid medication or cancer treatment</li>
  <li>a neurological condition, such as Parkinson’s disease, motor neurone disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), cerebral palsy, or a learning disability</li>
  <li>any problem with the spleen, including sickle cell disease, or had spleen removed</li>
  <li>a BMI of 40 or above (obese)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>)</h4>
<p>Equipment a person wears to protect themselves from risks to their health or safety, including exposure to infection agents. The level of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> required depends on the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>suspected or known infectious agent</li>
  <li>severity of the illness caused</li>
  <li>transmission route of the infectious agent</li>
  <li>procedure or task being undertaken</li>
</ul>

<h4>Respiratory droplets</h4>
<p>A small droplet, such as a particle of moisture released from the mouth during coughing, sneezing, or speaking.</p>

<h4>Respiratory protective equipment</h4>
<p>Respiratory protection that is worn over the nose and mouth designed to protect the wearer from inhaling hazardous substances, including airborne particles (aerosols). There are 2 types of respiratory protection that can be used, tight-fitting disposable <abbr title="filtering face piece">FFP</abbr> respirators and loose-fitting powered hoods (TH2).</p>

<p><abbr title="filtering face piece">FFP</abbr> stands for filtering face piece. There are 3 categories of <abbr title="filtering face piece">FFP</abbr> respirator: FFP1, FFP2 and FFP3. FFP3 and loose-fitting powered hoods provide the highest level of protection and are recommended when caring for patients in areas where high risk aerosol generating procedures (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>) are being performed. Where the risk assessment shows an FFP2 respirator is suitable, they are recommended as a safe alternative.  N95 respirators are tested against different standards but are broadly equivalent to a FFP2.</p>

<h4>Respiratory symptoms</h4>
<p>Respiratory symptoms include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rhinorrhoea (runny nose)</li>
  <li>sore throat</li>
  <li>cough</li>
  <li>difficulty breathing or shortness of breath</li>
</ul>
