<p>This pathway applies to any emergency/urgent care facility where:</p>

<p>a) Untriaged individuals present for assessment or treatment (symptoms unknown*).</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>b) Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> positive patients are cared for.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>c) Symptomatic or suspected COVID-19 individuals including those with a history of contact with a COVID-19 case who have been triaged/clinically assessed and are waiting test results.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>d) Symptomatic individuals decline testing.</p>

<p>*Once assessed, if asymptomatic with no contact history, patients/individuals may move to the medium risk pathway awaiting test result.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10.1 </span> Patient placement</h2>

<p>If the patient/individual has symptoms or a history of contact/exposure with a case, they should be prioritised for single room isolation or cohorted (if an isolation room is unavailable) until their test results are known, for example use privacy curtains between bed spaces to minimise opportunities for close contact between patients/individuals. This should be locally risk assessed to ensure this does not compromise patient safety.</p>

<p>If single rooms are in short supply, priority should be given to patients with excessive cough and sputum production, diarrhoea or vomiting and to those in the high risk/extremely high risk of severe illness.</p>

<p>Local risk assessments and clinical decisions must be made regarding placement of patients/individuals with availability of single rooms taken into consideration.</p>

<p>†<abbr title="fluid resistant surgical face masks">FRSM</abbr> can be worn sessionally (includes eye/face protection) if providing care for COVID -19 cohorted patients/individuals.</p>

<p>††FFP3 can be worn sessionally (includes eye/face protection) in high risk areas where <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> are undertaken for COVID-19 cohorted patients/individual.</p>

<p>*NB. Consideration may need to be given to the application of airborne precautions where the number of cases of COVID-19 requiring <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> increases and patients/individuals cannot be managed in single or isolation rooms.</p>

<p>**Or if an unacceptable risk of transmission remains following rigorous application of the hierarchy of control, taking these controls into account, it may be necessary to consider the extended use of <abbr title="respiratory protective equipment">RPE</abbr> for patient care in this situation.</p>

<h3>Respiratory protective equipment (<abbr title="respiratory protective equipment">RPE</abbr>)/FFP3 (filtering face piece or hood)</h3>

<p>Respirators are used to prevent inhalation of small airborne particles arising from aerosol generating procedures (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>).</p>

<p>Respirators should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be well fitting, covering both nose and mouth</li>
  <li>always worn when undertaking an <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> on a COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patient/individual</li>
  <li>not be allowed to dangle around the neck of the wearer or hang from one ear after or between each use</li>
  <li>not be touched once put on</li>
  <li>be removed outside the patient’s/individual’s room or cohort area or COVID-19 ward</li>
  <li>respirators can be single use or single session use (disposable or reusable) and fluid-resistant</li>
  <li>all staff who are required to wear an FFP3 respirator must be fit tested for the relevant model to ensure an adequate seal or fit (according to the manufacturers’ guidance)</li>
  <li>where fit testing fails, suitable alternative equipment must be provided, or the healthcare worker (<abbr title="healthcare worker">HCW</abbr>) should be moved to an area where FFP3 respirators are not required</li>
  <li>fit checking (according to the manufacturers’ guidance) is necessary when a respirator is put on (donned) to ensure an adequate seal has been achieved</li>
  <li>respirators should be compatible with other facial protection used (protective eyewear) so that this does not interfere with the seal of the respiratory protection</li>
  <li>the respirator should be discarded and replaced and NOT be subject to continued use if the facial seal is compromised, it is uncomfortable, or it is difficult to breathe through</li>
  <li>reusable respirators can be utilised by individuals if they comply with Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) recommendations; reusable respirators should be decontaminated according to the manufacturer’s instructions</li>
</ul>

<p>N.B. Valved respirators are not fluid-resistant unless they are also ‘shrouded’. Valved non-shrouded FFP3 respirators should be worn with a full-face shield if blood or body fluid splashing is anticipated. Valved respirators should not be worn by an <abbr title="healthcare worker">HCW</abbr>/operator when sterility directly over the surgical field is required e.g.in theatres/surgical settings or when undertaking a sterile procedure, as the exhaled breath is unfiltered.</p>

<p>Examples of sterile procedures include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any surgical or invasive procedure that routinely requires maximal sterile barrier precautions to prevent infection, for expample sterile gowns, sterile gloves, face mask as required for surgical antisepsis/<abbr title="aseptic non-touch technique">ANTT</abbr> - these are commonly but not exclusively undertaken in operating theatres, critical care or emergency departments</li>
  <li>those sterile percutaneous or invasive procedures such as interventional radiology/cardiac catheterisation, <abbr title="aseptic non-touch technique">PICC</abbr> or other central venous catheter insertions</li>
</ul>

<p>NB. The ongoing use of valved respirators in theatres and surgical settings should be based on a local risk assessment. The risk of an asymptomatic <abbr title="healthcare worker">HCW</abbr> transmitting COVID-19 infection if wearing a valved respirator is considered ‘very small’, as the <abbr title="healthcare worker">HCW</abbr> would need to be excreting virus and the patient would need to be negative for COVID-19 (FFP3 use is when an <abbr title="healthcare worker">HCW</abbr> is managing a suspected/confirmed COVID-19 positive patient undergoing <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> in the medium or high risk pathway).</p>

<h3>Full body gowns or fluid repellent coveralls</h3>

<p>Full body gowns or fluid repellent coveralls must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>worn when there is a risk of extensive splashing of blood and/or body fluids</li>
  <li>worn when undertaking aerosol generating procedures</li>
  <li>worn when a disposable apron provides inadequate cover for the procedure or task being performed for example, surgery changed between patients/individuals and immediately after completing a procedure or task</li>
</ul>

<p>NB. Sessional or extended use of gowns must be minimised and only used in areas where cohorts of confirmed COVID-19 patients are managed and there is a lack of single rooms/isolation rooms.  If sessional use is required, an individual patient risk assessment must be undertaken and reviewed daily. Gowns are not required when moving around a unit or department.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10.3 </span> Safe management of care environment/equipment/blood and body fluids</h2>

<p>Please refer to information given in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-infection-prevention-and-control-guidance-medium-risk-pathway-key-principles">medium risk pathway</a>.</p>

<p>In addition if there are clusters or outbreaks of COVID-19 (2 or more cases linked by time and place) with significant respiratory symptoms in communal settings cleaning frequencies should be increased.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10.4 </span> Aerosol generating procedures (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>): procedures that create a higher risk of respiratory infection transmission and operating theatres</h2>

<h3>Critical care</h3>

<p>Droplet precautions would apply however, consideration may need to be given to the application of airborne precautions where the number of cases of COVID-19 requiring <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> increases and patients/individuals cannot be managed in single or isolation rooms.</p>

<h3>Operating theatres (including day surgery)</h3>

<p>Patients/individuals should be anaesthetised and recovered in the theatre if intubation/extubation (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>) is required using airborne precautions. This is not required for regional, neuraxial or local anaesthesia.</p>

<p>Ventilation in both laminar flow and conventionally ventilated theatres should remain in full operation during surgical procedures where patients/individuals have suspected/confirmed COVID-19. Air passing from operating theatres to adjacent areas will be highly diluted and is not considered to be a risk.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10.5 </span> Duration of precautions</h2>

<p>In general, patients with COVID-19 who are admitted to hospital will have more severe disease than those who can remain in the community, especially if they have been severely unwell or have pre-existing conditions such as severe immunosuppression. Therefore, it is recommended that these individuals should be isolated within hospital or remain in self-isolation on discharge for 14 days from their first positive SARS-CoV-2 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test.</p>

<p>Whilst in hospital patients/individuals should remain in isolation/cohort with <abbr title="transmission based precautions">TBPs</abbr> applied for at least 14 days after onset of symptoms and  should be 48 hours without a fever (without use of antipyretic medication) or respiratory symptoms. The decision to modify the duration of, or ‘stand down’ <abbr title="transmission based precautions">TBPs</abbr> (contact/droplet/airborne) should be made by the clinical team managing the individuals care.</p>

<p>For clinically suspected COVID-19 patients who have tested negative or have not been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and whose condition is severe enough to require hospitalisation, then the 14 day isolation period should be measured from the day of admission.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-initial-investigation-of-possible-cases/priority-for-sars-cov-2-covid-19-testing" class="govuk-link">Testing for virological clearance</a> is encouraged in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-stepdown-of-infection-control-precautions-within-hospitals-and-discharging-covid-19-patients-from-hospital-to-home-settings/guidance-for-stepdown-of-infection-control-precautions-and-discharging-covid-19-patients#immsupp" class="govuk-link">severely immunosuppressed</a> patients. For these patients, IPC measures should be continued unless either there is evidence of virological clearance prior to discharge or there has been a complete resolution of all symptoms. This is different to other advice sections but reflects the complex health needs of such patients and likelihood for prolonged shedding, with risk of spread in healthcare settings. Upon discharge such patients may be retested at first follow-up appointment to help inform actions at any next medical appointment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10.6 </span> Visitor guidance</h2>

<p>In this pathway, visiting should continue to be limited to only essential visitors, for example birthing partner, carer/parent/guardian. Hospitals/organisations will provide advice and guidance to support patients during these restrictions.Visitor guidance may differ between countries, refer to country specific resources.</p>

<p>Whilst facemasks/coverings are recommended the need for visitors to wear additional <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> will be individually assessed.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10.7 </span> Discharge or transfer</h2>

<p>Discharge from an inpatient facility can occur when the individual is well enough and the clinician has provided them with discharge such as advice to self -isolate for at least 14 days from the date of the positive SARS-CoV-2 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test (providing their symptoms resolve during this period). Refer to country <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/introduction-and-organisational-preparedness" class="govuk-link">specific resources in Section 2.1</a>.</p>

<p>Advice should include written information such as, patients with a cough or a loss of, or change in, normal sense of smell or taste (anosmia), may persist in some individuals for several weeks following COVID-19 recovery, and is not currently considered an indication of ongoing infection when other symptoms have resolved.</p>

<p>Prior to discharge (if the patient is within the 14 days) clinicians  should ascertain  if there are any clinically extremely vulnerable  individuals who live in the household and are currently not infected. If so, it is highly advisable for patients to be discharged to a different home until they have finished their self-isolation period. If these individuals cannot be moved to a different household, then ensure that the discharged patient is advised on infection prevention control measures as outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">Stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Advice on ongoing medical needs should be provided for patients who are discharged within their self-isolation period. If patients deteriorate at home or in a care setting, they or their carer should seek advice from <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://111.nhs.uk/">NHS 111 online</a> or by telephone, or through pre-existing services such as GP practice links with care homes. In an emergency, 999 should be called. In either case, they should inform the call attendant that they have been recently discharged from hospital with confirmed COVID-19.</p>

<p>Discharge information for patients/individuals to their own home should include an understanding of their need for any self-isolation, as well as their family members</p>

<p>Ambulance services and the receiving facilities must be informed of the infectious status of the individual and the ongoing need to continue with infection control precautions.</p>

<p>Discharge arrangements may differ between countries, as discharge to other areas is dependent on testing and/or isolation facilities available. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/introduction-and-organisational-preparedness" class="govuk-link">Refer to country specific resources in Section 2.1</a>.</p>

<p>In England, to ensure testing does not delay a timely discharge to a care home, patients who have tested negative should be re-tested for SARS-CoV-2 again 48 hours prior to discharge. All SARS-CoV-2 positive patients who are discharged within their 14 day self-isolation period will need to be discharged to a designated setting. The information from the test results, with any supporting care information, must be communicated and transferred to the relevant care home. No-one should be discharged from hospital directly to a care home without the involvement of the local authority.</p>
