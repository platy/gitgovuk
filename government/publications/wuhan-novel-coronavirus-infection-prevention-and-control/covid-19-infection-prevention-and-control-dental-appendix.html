<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>About this guidance</h2>

<p>This document is an appendix to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-guidance-for-maintaining-services-within-health-and-care-settings-infection-prevention-and-control-recommendations">Infection prevention and control for seasonal respiratory infections in health and care settings (including SARS-CoV-2) for winter 2021 to 2022</a> issued jointly by the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>), Public Health Wales (<abbr title="Public Health Wales">PHW</abbr>), Public Health Agency (<abbr title="Public Health Agency Northern Ireland">PHA</abbr>) Northern Ireland, NHS National Services Scotland, UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) and NHS England as official guidance.</p>

<p>This appendix has been updated in line with the revision of the <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> guidance for health and care settings. It has been revised to take account of advice from bodies such as <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the World Health Organisation (<abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>). The content of this document has been agreed by the four UK Chief Dental Officers.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> principles in this document apply to all dental settings, including those in the independent and private sector, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>general dental services</li>
  <li>community dental services</li>
  <li>public dental services</li>
  <li>armed forces dental services</li>
  <li>prison dental services</li>
  <li>dental teaching hospitals</li>
  <li>specialist dental services provided from primary care settings</li>
</ul>

<p>Hospital dental services (secondary care) should liaise with their trust or organisation to determine whether this appendix or the <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> guidance for health and care settings is most appropriate for their services.</p>

<p>When implementing this guidance practitioners must consider the specific conditions of their individual place of work and comply with all applicable legislation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Summary</h2>

<p>This section summarises the guidance. Refer to the relevant section for further detail. The two pathways are summarised in Figure 1. All patients should be screened for potential COVID-19 infection, ideally prior to attendance at the setting, using the <a class="govuk-link" href="#SCREENING">COVID-19 screening questions</a>. An example of COVID-19 screening questions can be found in <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1035192/Appendix_1_Sample_Screening_Tool.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Appendix 1</a>.</p>

<p>Based on screening the patient should be assigned to either a respiratory or non-respiratory pathway.</p>

<p>For patients on the non-respiratory pathway <a href="#SICPS" class="govuk-link">standard infection control precautions (<abbr title="Standard Infection Prevention Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr>) apply</a>. Testing for patients on the non-respiratory pathway should be in line with country specific requirements.</p>

<p>For patients on the respiratory pathway <a href="#TBPs" class="govuk-link">transmission-based precautions (<abbr title="Transmission-based precautions">TBPs</abbr>)</a> apply in addition to <abbr title="Standard Infection Prevention Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr>.</p>

<p>For patients on the respiratory pathway undergoing <a class="govuk-link" href="#AGPs">aerosol generating procedures (<abbr title="Aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>)</a>, post <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> downtime applies.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Diagram summarising pathways: plain text description</h3>

<p>Left top of chart begins with statement: ‘Patient or carer has answered yes to one or more screening questions?’</p>

<p>Move to: ‘Can appointment be re-scheduled until resolution of symptoms, end of isolation, negative test results or setting is able to administer the screening questions?’</p>

<p>Answer no: ‘Transmission-based precautions (<abbr title="Transmission-based precautions">TBPs</abbr>) should be applied in addition to <abbr title="Standard Infection Prevention Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr>. Post-<abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> downtime applies.’</p>

<p>Answer yes: ‘Reschedule the appointment’</p>

<p>Right top of the chart begins with statement: ‘Patient or carer has answered no to all screening questions’</p>

<p>Move to: ‘Complete appointment applying standard infection control precautions’</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Main messages</h2>

<p>The main changes from the previous version of this guidance include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>removal of the 3 distinct COVID-19 care pathways (high, medium and low)</li>
  <li>use of a screening tool to place patients on either a non-respiratory or a respiratory pathway</li>
  <li>for the non-respiratory pathway, guidance that physical distancing should be at least 1 metre in all areas where possible, for example when not providing direct clinical care. This should be increased to 2 metres whenever feasible</li>
</ul>

<p>What has not changed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>organisations and employers have a responsibility to assess, manage and monitor risk based on the measures prioritised in the hierarchy of controls</li>
  <li>all patients should be screened for COVID-19</li>
  <li>universal masking/face coverings to remain as an <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measure for staff and patients within dental settings across the winter period</li>
  <li>patients with suspected or confirmed respiratory infection should have non-urgent treatment deferred if it is considered clinically appropriate</li>
  <li>patients with symptoms of respiratory infection, or who have a confirmed respiratory infection, and whose treatment cannot be deferred, should be segregated or isolated, for example separated by space or time, from other patients</li>
  <li>continuation of 2 metres physical distancing for patients with suspected or confirmed respiratory infection (respiratory pathway)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Scope and purpose</h2>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic remains a threat (see COVID-19 alert levels) and as such there continues to be a need to be cautious in order to prevent and control transmission of the virus. New variants of SARS-CoV-2 remain a risk as do other respiratory infections, specifically influenza and <abbr title="respiratory syncytial virus">RSV</abbr> which are likely to present over winter 2021 to 2022.</p>

<p>Please note that this guidance is of a general nature and employers should consider the specific conditions of each individual place of work and comply with all applicable legislation and regulations, including the <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/37/contents" class="govuk-link">Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974</a>.  This guidance does not supersede existing legislation or regulations across the UK.</p>

<p>While this document seeks to ensure a consistent and resilient UK wide approach, some differences in operational details and organisational responsibilities may apply in the different UK nations.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Governance and responsibilities</h2>

<p>Employers and organisations are responsible for ensuring safe systems of work, including managing the risk associated with infectious agents through the completion of risk assessments. Further details on the organisational and employer responsibilities in relation to infection prevention and control can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-guidance-for-maintaining-services-within-health-and-care-settings-infection-prevention-and-control-recommendations">main <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> guidance</a>.</p>

<p>This national guidance outlines the recommended principles to support local decision making within individual organisations, practices, and settings. This guidance sets the minimum levels of <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> that settings should follow.</p>

<p>The pathways described assume that the dental setting has completed a risk assessment in line with the ‘hierarchy of controls’ and that the setting has implemented effective controls, based on the risk assessment, to reduce the spread of respiratory pathogens.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Hierarchy of controls</h2>

<p>Limiting transmission of infection in health and care setting requires a range of <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures. Included is the ‘hierarchy of controls’ which, if applied in order, are used to identify the appropriate controls. Safe systems of work outlined in the hierarchy of controls, including elimination, substitution, engineering, administrative controls and personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>), are an integral part of <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures. Organisations and employers, for example dental practice owners, have a responsibility to ensure risk assessments are undertaken in the context of managing infectious agents. Key areas and measures for assessment are outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-guidance-for-maintaining-services-within-health-and-care-settings-infection-prevention-and-control-recommendations">main <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Ventilation requirements</h2>

<p>All enclosed workplaces must be ventilated by natural or artificial means as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1992/3004/contents/made" rel="external">Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulation</a>. UK building regulations recommend whole building ventilation to be 10 l/s/person, and current healthcare guidance for new buildings and major refurbishments specifies that a treatment room should have at least 10 air changes per hour (<abbr title="air changes per hour">ACH</abbr>).</p>

<p>Ventilation is important to reduce the risk of aerosol contamination from potential airborne and droplet pathogens in dental settings. Clearance of infectious particles after an aerosol generating procedure (<abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>) is dependent on the ventilation and air change within the room. Specialist advice should be sought on how best to achieve the recommended air changes.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sdcep.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SDCEP-Ventilation-Information-for-Dentistry.pdf" rel="external">Further information on ventilation for dentistry is available</a>.</p>

<p>It is recognised that transitional arrangements may need to be in place to support dental practices where air changes are unknown or below this recommended level.</p>

<p>Prompt recognition of cases of respiratory infection among health and care staff is essential to limit transmission. Staff testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) who remain symptomatic of another respiratory infection should consider the risk to service users (particularly those who are immunosuppressed or at high risk of complications from respiratory infections) before returning to work. Once medically fit to return to work, if staff are in doubt about any risk they may pose to service users or colleagues, this should be discussed with their line manager in the first instance. Bank, agency and locum staff should follow the same deployment advice as permanent staff.</p>

<p>Staff should be vaccinated against respiratory infections, for example influenza and COVID-19, in line with country specific requirements.</p>

<p>Staff who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and are a close contact of a case of COVID-19 may be allowed to return to work without the need to self-isolate. There are country-specific variations on the requirements for <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) antigen testing and these policies are under continual review and subject to change.</p>

<p>A risk assessment is required for health and care staff who may be at high risk of complications from respiratory infections such as influenza and severe illness from COVID-19, for example, pregnant and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) staff.</p>

<p>Guidance on carrying out <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhsemployers.org/articles/risk-assessments-staff" class="govuk-link">risk assessments is available</a>.</p>

<p>As part of an employer’s duty of care, they have a role to play in ensuring that staff understand and are adequately trained in safe systems of working, including donning and doffing of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. A fit testing programme should be in place for those who may need to wear respiratory protection.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Use of masks</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span>Universal masking by staff, patients and visitors</h3>

<p>Universal masking (with face coverings or surgical masks (Type II or IIR)) to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infectious agents in dental settings should continue to be applied for all staff, patients and visitors.</p>

<p>For patients on the non-respiratory pathway face coverings are acceptable. Surgical facemasks should continue to be worn during the winter period 2021 to 2022 by staff in all areas within dental settings, except in staff areas when eating and drinking.</p>

<p>Patients with confirmed or suspected respiratory infection should be provided with a surgical facemask (Type II or Type IIR). The patient requirement to wear a surgical facemask must never compromise their clinical care.</p>

<p>Organisations in NHS Scotland should refer to <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-interim-guidance-on-the-extended-use-of-face-masks-in-hospitals-and-care-homes/">Coronavirus (COVID-19): Guidance on the extended use of facemasks and face coverings in hospitals, primary care and wider community care settings</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span>Surgical masks (Type IIR)</h3>

<p>Surgical masks can be either Type II or Type IIR. When worn as <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to protect against splash or spray, a fluid-resistant surgical mask (<abbr title="fluid-resistant surgical mask">FRSM</abbr>) (Type IIR) should be worn.</p>

<p>Surgical masks must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be well fitted covering both nose and mouth</li>
  <li>not be allowed to dangle around the neck after or between each use</li>
  <li>not be touched once put on</li>
  <li>be changed when they become moist or damaged</li>
  <li>be disposed of as single use</li>
  <li>be worn once and then discarded as healthcare (clinical) waste. Hand hygiene must always be performed after disposal</li>
</ul>

<p>Further information about hand hygiene, respiratory and cough etiquette, safe management of the care environment, waste and safe management of linen can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-guidance-for-maintaining-services-within-health-and-care-settings-infection-prevention-and-control-recommendations">main <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Screening for COVID-19</h2>

<p>Screening is a way of identifying apparently healthy people who may have an increased risk of a particular condition. In this guidance, screening is used to identify patients before or at entry to the care area who may have COVID-19 but who do not have any symptoms.</p>

<p>Patients attending for an appointment/admission who have been screened (and have answered ‘no’ to all screening questions), and have no clinical signs or symptoms of respiratory infection and have been tested (with a negative result) as per country or local testing strategies only require the application of standard infection control precautions (<abbr title="Standard Infection Prevention Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr>) at the point of care.</p>

<p>The application of <abbr title="Standard Infection Prevention Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr> during care delivery is determined by an assessment of risk to and from individuals and includes the task, level of interaction and/or the anticipated level of exposure to blood and/or other body fluids. <abbr title="Transmission-based precautions">TBPs</abbr>, as outlined in this guidance, are not routinely required. However, the application of <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures must be assessed, and risks mitigated as outlined under the hierarchy of controls.</p>

<p>Screening for early recognition of COVID-19 should be undertaken for all patients. Wherever possible this should be done prior to attendance at the dental setting to ensure rapid implementation of recommended control measures.</p>

<p>Screening  of patients in advance of them attending at the dental setting will minimise the risk to staff and other patients and minimise the inconvenience to the patient (country-specific requirements for screening may vary and should be followed). Patients should be encouraged to inform the dental setting as soon as any symptoms occur and not to wait until the day of the appointment.</p>

<p>Signage should be displayed prior to and on entry to the dental setting instructing patients with respiratory symptoms or suspected or confirmed respiratory infection to inform reception staff immediately on their arrival. Screening should be undertaken by staff who are trained and competent. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control">Appendix 1</a> for an example of COVID-19 screening questions.</p>

<p>Screening for COVID-19 should also be applied to individuals accompanying the patient. Anyone accompanying the patient should be advised not to attend if they have symptoms of respiratory infection. Accompanying persons who are symptomatic should not be permitted to enter the dental setting. Exceptions should only be made for specific circumstances and following a risk assessment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Use of rapid COVID-19 testing</h2>

<p>Pre-appointment testing is not a requirement of the respiratory or non-respiratory pathway. Dental settings may choose to use <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing to provide pre-appointment testing as part of their risk mitigation, providing it is agreed by the country that they are working in that this is an appropriate use for these tests. As testing arrangements are a devolved responsibility, settings should ensure that any testing is carried out in line with country specific requirements. Lack of a negative test must not be used to refuse patient care.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Physical distancing</h2>

<p>In health and care settings physical distancing is the recommended distance that should be maintained between staff, patients and visitors unless mitigations are in place such as the use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> continues to advise that a physical distance of at least 1 metre should be maintained between and among patients, staff, and all other persons in healthcare settings. This distance should be increased wherever feasible, especially in indoor settings. Physical distancing should remain at 2 metres where infectious respiratory patients are cared for.</p>

<p>Patients who have been screened to the non-respiratory pathway are able to sit in waiting rooms together provided a physical distance of at least 1 metre can be maintained.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>Standard infection control precautions (<abbr title="Standard Infection Prevention Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr>)</h2>

<p>All health and social care providers should be familiar with <abbr title="Standard Infection Prevention Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr> and <abbr title="Transmission-based precautions">TBPs</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Standard Infection Prevention Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr> are the basic <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures necessary to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious agents from both recognised and unrecognised sources of infection. Sources of potential infection include blood and other body fluids secretions or excretions (excluding sweat), non-intact skin or mucous membranes, and any equipment or items in the care environment that could have become contaminated. <abbr title="Standard Infection Prevention Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr> are to be used by all staff, in all care settings, at all times, for all patients.</p>

<p><abbr title="Standard Infection Prevention Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr> should be used in treatment of patients in all healthcare settings. For patients on the respiratory pathway <abbr title="Transmission-based precautions">TBPs</abbr> should applied in addition to <abbr title="Standard Infection Prevention Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr>.</p>

<p>National (country specific) policy for <abbr title="Standard Infection Prevention Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr> is available for <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://phw.nhs.wales/services-and-teams/harp/infection-prevention-and-control/nipcm/">Wales</a>, <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.niinfectioncontrolmanual.net/">Northern Ireland</a>, and <a href="https://www.nipcm.hps.scot.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Scotland</a>. NHS England is developing  a national <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> Manual for England as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nipcm.hps.scot.nhs.uk/" rel="external">UK 5-year Tackling Antimicrobial Resistance National Action Plan (2019 to 2024)</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.1 </span>Personal protective equipment (as part of <abbr title="Standard Infection Prevention Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Before undertaking any procedure, staff should assess any likely exposure and ensure <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is worn in line with guidance and the risks associated with the procedure or task being undertaken. Disposable gloves and aprons should be worn when contact with blood or body fluids is anticipated.</p>

<p>A summary of the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> required for staff as part of <abbr title="Standard Infection Prevention Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr> is shown in Table 1.</p>

<p>All <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>compliant with the relevant BS/EN standards (technical standards as adopted in the UK post-EU exit)</li>
  <li>located close to the point of use</li>
  <li>stored to prevent contamination in a clean/dry area until required for use (expiry dates must be adhered to)</li>
  <li>single use only, unless specified by the manufacturer</li>
  <li>disposed of after use into the correct waste stream for example healthcare waste</li>
</ul>

<p>Hand hygiene should be performed after removal of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.

<p>Any reusable <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> must have a decontamination process in place that follows manufacturer’s instructions, and responsibility assigned.</p>

<p>Disposable gloves should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be worn when exposure to blood and other body fluids, non-intact skin or mucous membranes is anticipated or likely</li>
  <li>be changed immediately after each patient and after completing a procedure or task even on the same patient</li>
  <li>be put on immediately before performing an invasive procedure and removed on completion</li>
  <li>not be decontaminated with alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) or soap between use</li>
  <li>be changed when they become moist or damaged</li>
</ul>

<p>Inappropriate use of gloves, that is not changing them as recommended above, risks the gloves contributing to the transfer of organisms and cross-infection.</p>

<p>Gloves are not required when undertaking administrative tasks for example using the telephone, using a computer or tablet, writing in the patient notes.</p>

<p>Gloves are not an alternative to hand hygiene.</p>

<p>Disposable plastic aprons (or gowns if an apron does not provide sufficient protection) should be worn to protect staff uniform or clothes from contamination when providing direct patient care (if there is a risk of extensive splashing or spraying) and during environmental and equipment decontamination.</p>

<p>Aprons should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>worn to protect uniform or clothes when contamination is anticipated or likely</li>
  <li>changed between patients or after completing a procedure or task</li>
  <li>fluid-resistant gowns should be worn when a disposable plastic apron provides inadequate cover of staff uniform or clothes for the procedure or task being performed and when there is a risk of extensive splashing of blood or other body fluids</li>
  <li>disposable aprons and gowns should be changed between patients and immediately after completion of a task</li>
  <li>disposed of and replaced if damaged</li>
</ul>

<p>Aprons are not required when undertaking administrative tasks, (for example using the telephone, using a computer or tablet).</p>

<p>Eye or face protection (including full-face visors) should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be worn if blood and/or body fluid contamination to the eyes or face is anticipated or likely and always during aerosol generating procedures</li>
  <li>not be impeded by accessories such as piercings or false eyelashes</li>
  <li>not be touched when being worn</li>
  <li>if reusable, must have a decontamination schedule in place in line with the manufacturers’ instructions</li>

<span class="number">14. </span>Respiratory pathway</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.1 </span>Deferral of treatment</h3>

<p>Following screening, if a patient is identified as having a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection (answers yes to one or more of the screening questions), a clinical assessment should take place to determine whether it is appropriate to defer treatment. Treatment should not be deferred unless there has been a clinical assessment. This assessment can be undertaken remotely, if necessary.</p>

<p>If treatment is deferred antibiotic stewardship is advocated to ensure antibiotics are only prescribed when appropriate. UK guidelines on antimicrobial stewardship can be found at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/dental-antimicrobial-stewardship-toolkit" class="govuk-link">dental AMR toolkit</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.2 </span>Patient placement</h3>

<p>In all healthcare settings, including dental settings, patients with symptoms of respiratory infection or a suspected or confirmed respiratory infection should be segregated from other patients as promptly as possible. If a separate room is not available, the patient should be asked to return home or return to their car and asked to phone the dental setting so arrangements for their care can be discussed.</p>

<p>Dental services should identify in advance areas, routes and consultation rooms for these individuals who have been assessed as requiring treatment. Ideally, these individuals should be seen at the end of the day or session to reduce any post <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> downtime (where an <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> is performed) impacting on the remaining patient consultation list. Where space allows, a dedicated consultation or treatment room should be identified for placement of individuals with respiratory symptoms.</p>

<p>Physical distancing of at least 2 metres is required for patients on the respiratory pathway.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span>Transmission-based precautions (<abbr title="Transmission-based precautions">TBPs</abbr>) (for use in the Respiratory Pathway)</h2>

<p>This section describes specific actions that should be taken when applying <abbr title="Transmission-based precautions">TBPs</abbr> in the care of a person known or suspected to have a respiratory infection (the respiratory pathway).<abbr title="Transmission-based precautions">TBPs</abbr> are applied when <abbr title="Standard Infection Prevention Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr> alone are insufficient to prevent cross transmission of an infectious agent.</p>

<p>The risk of spread of infection may be minimised by ensuring that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there are separate waiting and reception areas or use of physical barriers</li>
  <li>patients wear surgical facemasks whilst in the dental setting</li>
  <li>in settings where multiple chairs are in use in the same room, there is physical spacing of at least 2 metres</li>
  <li>when <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> are undertaken, a method of physical segregation that provides at least a 2 metre barrier in the horizontal and vertical planes is provided</li>
  <li>each clinical area has adequate ventilation</li>
  <li>patients on the respiratory pathway are seen at a different time from other patients, with disinfection of shared areas taking place between patients</li>
  <li>the procedure is deferred or re-scheduled, providing this is not detrimental to their condition and has been assessed as clinically appropriate</li>
  <li>patients are advised to arrive on time (not early) and wait in their car or outdoors if possible, until contacted to advise to enter the building for their appointment</li>
  <li>patient care is transferred to a designated site for example an urgent care centre. This option will be dependent on local arrangements</li>
  <li>any accompanying persons are not present during <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> unless they are considered essential following a risk assessment, for example a carer, parent or guardian</li>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.2 </span>Respiratory protective equipment (<abbr title="respiratory protective equipment">RPE</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Respirators can be single use or single session use (disposable or reusable). Reusable respirators can be used if they comply with HSE recommendations and should be decontaminated and maintained according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<p>In some countries of the UK reusable respirators are not recommended. Dental settings should check the relevant country-specific advice on the use of reusable respirators.</p>

<p>All tight fitting <abbr title="respiratory protective equipment">RPE</abbr>, for example FFP3 (filtering face piece or hood) respirators must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be fluid-resistant</li>
  <li>be fit tested on all healthcare staff who may be required to wear a respirator to ensure an adequate seal and fit according to the manufacturer’s guidance. Where fit testing fails, suitable alternative equipment must be provided</li>
  <li>be fit checked (according to the manufacturer’s guidance) every time a respirator is donned to ensure an adequate seal has been achieved</li>
  <li>be compatible with other facial protection used, for example protective eyewear, so that this does not interfere with the seal of the respiratory protection. Regular corrective spectacles are not considered adequate eye protection</li>
  <li>be disposed of and replaced if breathing becomes difficult, the respirator is damaged or distorted, the respirator becomes obviously contaminated by respiratory secretions or other body fluids, or if a proper face fit cannot be maintained</li>
  <li>not be allowed to dangle around the neck of the wearer or hang from one ear after or between each use</li>
  <li>not be touched once put on</li>
</ul>

<p>Remove <abbr title="respiratory protective equipment">RPE</abbr> and eye protection in a safe area (for example outside the clinical area). If <abbr title="respiratory protective equipment">RPE</abbr> is removed in a clinical area following an <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>, appropriate post <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> downtime must have elapsed before the <abbr title="respiratory protective equipment">RPE</abbr> is removed. All other <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be removed in the patient care area. Perform hand hygiene after removing and disposing of <abbr title="respiratory protective equipment">RPE</abbr>.</p>

<p>All staff who are required to wear an FFP3 respirator must be fit tested for the relevant model to ensure an adequate seal or fit according to the manufacturer’s guidance.</p>

<p>Further information regarding fitting and fit checking of respirators can be found on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/ppe-face-masks/face-mask-ppe-rpe.htm" class="govuk-link">Health and Safety Executive website</a>.</p>

<p>Respirators with exhalation valves are not fluid-resistant unless they are also ‘shrouded’. Valved non-shrouded respirators should be worn with a full-face shield (a Type IIR mask is not acceptable) if blood or body fluid splashing is anticipated.</p>

<p>Respirators and powered hoods with exhalation valves should not be worn by a healthcare worker when sterility directly over the surgical field is required, for example in theatres or surgical settings or when undertaking a sterile procedure as the exhaled breath is unfiltered. Dental care such as surgical extractions and implant placement are not considered sterile procedures in this context. It is unlikely that this will apply to situations where an FFP3  is worn while carrying out surgical procedures in primary care settings as they are not usually considered sterile procedures.

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span>Aerosol generating procedures</h2>

<p>An <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> is a medical procedure that can result in the release of airborne particles (aerosols) from the respiratory tract. When treating someone who is suspected or known to be suffering from an infectious agent transmitted wholly or partly by the airborne or droplet route an <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> can transmit the infectious agent. <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> should only be carried out on when essential and only staff who are needed to undertake the procedure should be present.</p>

<p><abbr title="Transmission-based precautions">TBPs</abbr> are required when undertaking <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> for patients on the respiratory pathway. Only essential staff who are needed to undertake the procedure should be present. Dental procedures that use high velocity air and water streams are considered a high risk of creating aerosols and include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ultrasonic scaler (including piezo)</li>
  <li>high speed air rotor (or electric rotor that is greater than 60,000 rpm)</li>
  <li>piezo surgical handpiece</li>
  <li>air polishers</li>
</ul>

<p>Research has demonstrated that use of the 3-in-1 syringe with either air-only or water-only resulted in lower levels of contamination, with water-only causing the least contamination. There is currently no consensus to include the use of a 3-in-1 as an <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>. Non-surgical dental extractions are not considered <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>.</p>

<p>The defined list of <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> is currently under review, this is expected to be finalised by end November 2021 at which point this appendix will be updated.</p>

<span class="number">16.1 </span>Post <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> downtime (respiratory pathway)</h3>

<p>A multidisciplinary working group (the Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme, <abbr title="Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme">SDCEP</abbr>) has proposed a pragmatic algorithm with mitigation factors for post <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> downtime that has been accepted by the 4 UK Chief Dental Officers. The <a href="https://www.sdcep.org.uk/published-guidance/covid-19-practice-recovery/rapid-review-of-agps/" class="govuk-link" rel="external"><abbr title="Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme">SDCEP</abbr> rapid review of <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> is available</a>.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="#figure2">Figure 2</a> for post <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> downtime algorithm.</p>

<p>The working group advises that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where there is ventilation but the number of <abbr title="air changes per hour">ACH</abbr> are unknown, or there are 1 to 5 <abbr title="air changes per hour">ACH</abbr>, a baseline post <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> downtime of 30 minutes is recommended with mitigation such as high-volume suction/rubber dam</li>
  <li>where there are 6 to 9 <abbr title="air changes per hour">ACH</abbr>, a baseline post <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> downtime of 20 minutes is recommended</li>
  <li>where there are 10 or more <abbr title="air changes per hour">ACH</abbr>, a baseline post <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> downtime of 15 minutes is recommended</li>
  <li>where dentists use other mitigating measures such as screening, high volume suction/rubber dam and cleaning/disinfection of the environment between patients, post-<abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> down time is not considered necessary for successive appointments between members of the same household</li>
  <li>patients on the respiratory pathway should be separated by space or time from other patients for example with end of session appointments</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> should not be conducted in a room that has no natural ventilation (that is a window) or mechanical ventilation (see section 7 for further detail on ventilation requirements)</li>
  <li>all equipment, including ventilation, suction and air cleaners, is maintained according to manufacturer’s instructions and is operating effectively</li>
  <li>a minimum post <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> downtime of 10 minutes should apply to allow larger droplets to settle before environmental cleaning</li>
  <li>post <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> downtime can commence at the end of aerosol production (as soon as the use of the piece of equipment generating the aerosol has ceased)</li>
</ul>

<p>Post-<abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> downtime is not required for <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> on patients or individuals with no known or suspected respiratory infection (those on the non- respiratory pathway).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span>Safe management of the care environment and equipment</h2>

<p>Frequently touched sites and points in waiting rooms and surgeries, for example dental chairs, should be cleaned between patients and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>equipment used for cleaning, for example cloths, should preferably be disposable; however, reusable items such as mops/buckets should be stored clean and dry between use</li>
  <li>medical devices and equipment should be managed as per manufacturer’s instructions. Decontamination of equipment and the environment following dental treatment should follow country specific guidance for <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/decontamination-in-primary-care-dental-practices-htm-01-05/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">England</a>, <a rel="external" href="https://www.nipcm.scot.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link">Scotland</a>, <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sites3/documents/254/WHTM%2001-05%20Revision%201.pdf">Wales</a> or <a rel="external" href="https://cis.ihs.com/CIS/browse/publishers/department-of-health-social-services-and-public-safety" class="govuk-link">Northern Ireland</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Reusable (communal) equipment (for example dental chairs, cabinetry, dental lights, x-ray equipment) should be decontaminated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>between each patient</li>
  <li>after blood and body fluid contamination</li>
  <li>at regular intervals as part of equipment cleaning</li>
</ul>

<p>Decontamination of equipment must be performed following manufacturer’s advice. Cleaning of care equipment as per manufacturer’s guidance and instruction and recommended product ‘contact time’ must be followed for all cleaning or disinfectant solutions and products.</p>

<p>Other reusable dental equipment (for example handpieces, scalers, probe) should be decontaminated in accordance with manufacturer’s advice and in line with decontamination guidance.</p>

<p>An increased frequency of decontamination and cleaning should be incorporated into the environmental decontamination schedules for areas where there may be higher environmental contamination rates for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>toilets</li>
  <li>frequently touched surfaces such as door and toilet handles</li>
  <li>staff room equipment, for example kettles</li>
</ul>

<p>Decontamination of the care environment must be performed using a detergent and a disinfectant that has proven efficacy against bacteria and viruses, including <abbr title="respiratory syncytial virus">RSV</abbr>, influenza and SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">18. </span>Additional advice for environmental mitigation measures</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.1 </span>Air cleaning devices</h3>

<p>Recirculating air cleaning devices based on <abbr title="High-Efficiency Particulate Air">HEPA</abbr> filter systems or UV-C are likely to be effective, but each device needs to be validated by the manufacturer and maintained.</p>

<p>It is difficult to make general recommendations for devices that remove viable microbes from air, either by filtration or microbicidal action. This is because there is variability in the rate they pass air through the device, the removal or inactivation will vary according to filtration or microbicidal efficacy, and over time filters will become progressively blocked. Microbicidal treatment such as UV can become obscured by a build-up of dust and the spectrum of UV emission, critical for microbicidal efficacy, can change over time.</p>

<p>Addition of recirculating air cleaning devices could enhance the effective air change rate. Devices should be correctly sized and the impacts on the room air flow considered. The effectiveness of air cleaning devices will depend on the flow rate of the device, the efficiency of air cleaning and the size of the room.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.2 </span>Fans</h3>

<p>Fans should be cleaned regularly to remove visible soiling and should not be used on the respiratory pathway. Fans should be directed to move air towards windows and mechanical extract points. Fans should not be directed towards doors, driving air into other rooms. Planned preventative maintenance, and cleaning of fans and their blades should continue.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.3 </span>Air conditioning units</h3>

<p>Fixed air conditioning units (for example, wall or ceiling mounted recirculating air coolers -split units) and portable air conditioning, which do not recirculate to other rooms, can be used. Where there is poor air circulation within a room, it may be beneficial to mix air to dilute aerosols. These types of air conditioning will cool staff wearing water repellent <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Portable air conditioning should not be directed towards doors as this will drive air into other rooms, nor should any pipework or cables impede fire doors. Care should be taken when emptying the reservoir of portable air conditioning due to the risk of legionella or other microorganisms being present in the condensate water. See separate HTM 04-01 guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hot-and-cold-water-supply-storage-and-distribution-systems-for-healthcare-premises" class="govuk-link">England, Wales, Northern Ireland</a> and <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nss.nhs.scot/publications/water-safety-for-healthcare-premises/">Scotland</a> on this. Daily emptying of the reservoir should be recorded. Planned maintenance should be carried out on the device following manufacturer’s guidance and should be recorded. Do not use portable air conditioning that incorporates humidifiers.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.4 </span>Fumigation and fogging</h3>

<p>The use of fumigation and fogging devices with disinfection chemicals are not advised for routine cleaning and or disinfection against COVID-19 and should only be considered in healthcare settings when multi-drug resistant organisms cannot be eradicated. Any use must always be under specialist <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> advice.</p>
