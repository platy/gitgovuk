<h2>Messages for dental services</h2>

<p>Patients will fall into either low, medium or high risk COVID-19 pathways.</p>

<p>Patients must be screened, triaged (and when available tested) prior to treatment.</p>

<p>Treatment for patients who are on the high risk pathway should be restricted to urgent care only and these patients will need to be separated by space or time from other patients.</p>

<p>Airborne precautions are required for patients on the medium and high risk pathways if an Aerosol generating procedure (<abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>) is undertaken.</p>

<p>Standard infection control precautions are required for patients in the low risk pathway even if an <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> is undertaken.</p>

<p>Dental practices are recommended to ascertain the air changes per hour (<abbr title="air changes per hour">ACH</abbr>) within all dental surgeries.</p>

<p>Post <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> downtime (fallow time) is dependent on air changes per hour and procedural mitigating factors (see <a href="#Additionaladvice" class="govuk-link">Additional advice for environmental mitigation measures</a>) but does not fall below 10 mins for patients in medium or high risk pathways.</p>

<p>Mitigation against aerosols, such as high-volume suction and dental dam, should be used routinely and mitigation is considered essential where air changes are low.</p>

<p><abbr title="Aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> should not be carried out in rooms where there is no natural or mechanical ventilation.</p>

<p>Practices should ensure physical distancing and good hand and respiratory hygiene measures are followed at all times throughout the practice.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>This document is an appendix to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control" class="govuk-link">COVID-19: Infection prevention and control guidance</a> and covers the additional dental specific requirements to facilitate remobilisation. This should be read in conjunction with this guidance. Services should use the <a href="https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-guidance-for-maintaining-services-within-health-and-care-settings-infection-prevention-and-control-recommendations#carepathways" class="govuk-link" rel="external">COVID-19 care pathways</a> when planning care and treatment.</p>

<p>Reducing transmission of COVID-19 requires the risk from all activities to be assessed for all areas, and the hierarchy of control should be used to identify appropriate controls with elimination, substitution, engineering controls and administrative controls considered before personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) or respiratory protective equipment (<abbr title="respiratory protective equipment">RPE</abbr>) is considered. Further information on this can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control" class="govuk-link">COVID-19: Infection prevention and control guidance</a>.</p>

<p>This guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>seeks to ensure a consistent and resilient UK wide approach, though some differences in operational details and organisational responsibilities may apply in Northern Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland</li>
  <li>applies to all clinical dental services in all settings, including those provided on a private or independent basis</li>
</ul>

<p>Academic evidence has been considered in the development of this guidance, and in particular, relevant sections of published reports from 2 UK dental expert working groups, which include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.scottishdental.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ventillation-Final-Copy-1.pdf">SBAR Ventilation, water and environmental cleaning in dental surgeries relating to COVID-19</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sdcep.org.uk/published-guidance/covid-19-practice-recovery/rapid-review-of-agps/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Mitigation of Aerosol Generating Procedures in Dentistry: A Rapid Review</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Administration measures for the care pathways in dentistry</h2>

<p>Screening and triaging must be undertaken prior to the patient attending the dental setting or hospital, or immediately upon arrival.</p>

<p>Patients with symptoms fulfilling the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-initial-investigation-of-possible-cases/investigation-and-initial-clinical-management-of-possible-cases-of-wuhan-novel-coronavirus-wn-cov-infection">clinical case definition</a> should not attend for routine dental care in any setting.</p>

<p>Signage at the entrance to the surgery, clinic or hospital should alert patients not to attend if suffering from the symptoms of COVID-19 and should signpost alternative courses of action if they have an urgent care need.</p>

<p>Treatment for patients on the high risk pathway should be restricted to urgent care only and they must be separated in time or place from other patients.</p>

<p>Hand hygiene facilities and face masks should be available at the entrance and exit of the surgery, clinic or hospital.</p>

<p>If possible, all patients should be separate in space (2 metres) and time such as longer appointment times to ensure segregation.</p>

<p>In settings where multiple chairs are in use in the same room, there needs to be physical spacing of at least 2 metres. A method of physical segregation that provides at least a 2 metre barrier in the horizontal and vertical plains is recommended where <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> are undertaken. Each âpodâ should have adequate ventilation.</p>

<p>Only the person receiving dental treatment should attend unless a carer or escort is required, for example with a child.</p>

<p>The use of face masks is mandatory for healthcare staff and all members of the dental team should wear masks in dental settings at all times.</p>

<p>Face coverings or masks are required by members of the public in public places such as hospitals, outpatient waiting areas and dental surgeries or clinics.</p>

<p>Waiting and treatment areas should be kept clean and clutter free with all non-essential items removed.</p>

<p>The example care pathways are outlined below.</p>

<h2>COVID-19 care pathways</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> High risk COVID-19 pathway</h3>

<p>a) Untriaged individuals present for assessment or treatment (symptoms unknown).</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>b) Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive individuals are cared for.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>c) Symptomatic or suspected COVID-19 individuals including those with a history of contact with a COVID-19 case, who have been triaged/clinically assessed and are awaiting test results.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>d) Symptomatic individuals who decline testing.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Medium risk COVID-19 pathway</h3>

<p>a) Triaged/clinically assessed individuals are asymptomatic and are awaiting a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>b) Triaged/clinically assessed individuals are asymptomatic with COVID-19 contact or exposure identified.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>c) Testing is not required or feasible on asymptomatic individuals and infectious status is unknown.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>d) Asymptomatic individuals who decline testing.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Low risk COVID-19 pathway</h3>

<p>a) Triaged/clinically assessed individuals with no symptoms or known recent COVID-19 contact/exposure.</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>Have a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test within 72 hours of treatment and, for planned admissions, have self-isolated for the required period or from the test date.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>b) Individuals who have recovered (14 days) from COVID-19 and have had at least 48 hours without fever or respiratory symptoms.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>c) Patients or individuals are part of a regular formal NHS testing plan and remain negative and asymptomatic.</p>

<p>Currently, and until âpoint of careâ testing is available, patients requiring routine dental care will predominantly fall into the medium risk pathway. If a patient has evidence of a recent (72 hours) negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and no screening or triaging risks are identified, then the low risk pathway can be followed.</p>

<h2>Standard Infection Prevention Control Precautions (<abbr title="Standard Infection Prevention Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr>)</h2>

<p><abbr title="Standard Infection Prevention Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr> are the basic infection prevention and control measures necessary to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious agents from both recognised and unrecognised sources and are required across all COVID-19 pathways. Patients on the low risk pathway require <abbr title="Standard Infection Prevention Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr> alone unless another infectious agent is present.</p>

<p>The elements related to COVID-19 for dentistry are as follows.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Patient assessment for infection risk</h3>

<p>There must be screening, triaging and testing as outlined above in the administrative measures for the care pathways.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Hand hygiene</h3>

<p>Hands should be washed with soap and water: use of at least 60 to 80% alcohol based hand rub before and after caring for or treating a patient, entering and leaving the surgery and after removal of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Respiratory and cough hygiene</h3>

<p>Display posters on the need to cover the nose and mouth, have disposable tissues, hand hygiene facilities and waste receptacles available for staff and patients. Encourage patients to wear a face mask or covering.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Personal protective equipment</h3>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="#PPEtable">Table 1</a> below for each pathway.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5. </span> Safe management of the care environment and equipment</h3>

<p>The frequency of cleaning across all risk pathways should be increased during the pandemic to at least twice daily. Frequently touched sites and points, in particular waiting rooms and dental chair, should be cleaned between patients and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a disinfectant agent such as a solution of chlorine at 0.1% or 1000ppm or an equivalent disinfectant effective against viruses, bacteria and fungi to EN standard 14476 for viricidal activity should be used</li>
  <li>equipment used for cleaning, for example cloths, should preferably be disposable; however, reusable items such as mops and buckets should be stored clean and dry between use</li>
  <li>medical devices and equipment should be managed as per manufacturerâs instructions â decontamination processes for equipment and the environment following dental treatment should follow country specific guidance (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/decontamination-in-primary-care-dental-practices">England</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sdcep.org.uk/decontamination-into-practice-guidance-series/" rel="external">Scotland</a> and <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sites3/Documents/254/WHTM%2001-05%20Revision%201.pdf">Wales</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6. </span> Safe management of linen</h3>

<p>Uniforms and scrubs should be washed separately at the highest temperature setting for the fabric.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7. </span> Safe disposal of waste (including sharps)</h3>

<p>Clinical waste should be treated as infectious waste and treated accordingly.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8. </span> Occupational safety, prevention and exposure management</h3>

<p>Prompt recognition of cases of COVID-19 among staff is crucial to limit spread. If a staff member has symptoms of COVID-19, they should self-isolate, arrange to have a PCR test, and follow self-isolation guidance. Symptomatic staff members should only return to work if their PCR test result is negative. If the PCR test result is positive, they must complete 10 full days self-isolation from the date of onset of symptoms as per guidance.</p>

<p>Asymptomatic staff members who test positive on a lateral flow device antigen test should follow self-isolation guidance and arrange to have a PCR test. If the PCR test result is positive, they must self-isolate for 10 full days from the date of the PCR test. If they develop symptoms after their PCR test, the 10-day isolation period restarts from the day the symptoms start. Employers should risk assess staff at high risk of complications from COVID-19 and manage their work commitments accordingly.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9. </span> Maintain physical distancing of 2 metres</h3>

<p>This is at all time in healthcare settings unless wearing <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> during direct care. If it is not possible to achieve this distance such as multi-chair clinics or reception areas, physical barriers should be used for example clear screens for reception. If space in staff rest areas is limited, consider allocating separate break times.</p>

<h2>Transmission-based precautions (<abbr title="Transmission-based precautions">TBPs</abbr>)</h2>

<p><abbr title="Transmission-based precautions">TBPs</abbr> are additional measures to <abbr title="Standard Infection Prevention Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr> required when caring for patients and individuals with a known or suspected infection such as COVID-19. <abbr title="Transmission-based precautions">TBPs</abbr> are based upon the route of transmission and include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact precautions â used to prevent and control infections spread by direct (hands) or indirect (environment or equipment) contact; COVID-19 can be spread via this route</li>
  <li>droplet precautions â used to prevent and control infections that spread from the respiratory tract via droplet (&gt;5 Î¼m via coughs and sneezing) over short distances (1 to 2 metres) from one individual to another; COVID-19 is predominately spread via this route</li>
  <li>airborne precautions â used to prevent and control infections that spread by aerosols (&lt;5 Î¼m) from the respiratory tract of one individual to another; COVID-19 can be spread via this route; <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> increase the risk of spread by this route</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Standard Infection Prevention Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr> are the basic IPC measures necessary to reduce the risk of transmitting infectious agents from both recognised and unrecognised sources of infection and are required across all COVID-19 pathways.</p>

<h2>Aerosol generating procedures (<abbr title="Aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>)</h2>

<p><abbr title="Aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> are procedures that create a higher risk of respiratory infection transmission and are defined as any medical, dental or patient care procedure that can result in the release of airborne particles &lt;5 Î¼m in size from the respiratory tract of an individual. These can remain suspended in the air, may travel over a distance and may cause infection if they are inhaled when treating someone who is suffering from an infectious disease, transmitted wholly or partly by the airborne or droplet route.</p>

<p>Airborne precautions are required when undertaking <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> on the medium and high risk pathway and only essential staff who are needed to undertake the procedure should be present. Dental procedures that use high velocity air and water streams are considered a high risk of creating aerosols and include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ultrasonic scaler (including piezo)</li>
  <li>high speed air or electric rotor (that is &gt;60,000 rpm)</li>
  <li>Piezo surgical handpiece</li>
  <li>air polishers</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that research demonstrated that use of the 3-in-1 syringe with either air-only or water-only resulted in lower levels of contamination, with water-only causing the least contamination. There is currently no consensus to include the use of a 3-in-1 as an <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Personal protective equipment including respiratory protective equipment (<abbr title="respiratory protective equipment">RPE</abbr>)</h2>

<p>(1) Airborne precautions are NOT required for <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> on patients or individuals in the low risk COVID-19 pathway, providing the patient has no other infectious agent transmitted via the droplet or airborne route.</p>

<p>(2) FRSM is a fluid-resistant (type IIR) surgical mask.</p>

<p>(3) Eye/face protection (visors) ideally should be disposable. Re-usable eye and face (visors) protection (such as polycarbonate safety glasses, goggles and visors) is acceptable if decontaminated according to the manufacturerâs instructions or local infection control policy. Regular prescription glasses are not considered adequate eye protection. Eye and face protection should be removed outside the surgery if worn with a respirator as part of airborne precautions.</p>

<p>(4) Reusable gowns can be used for sessional wear if disposable gowns are unavailable as a contingency measure only. Further advice on the use of reusable gowns may be found in country specific Standard Operating Procedures.</p>

<p>(5) Reusable respirators can be utilised by practices where the practice, as the employer, holds the evidence that the respirator complies with HSE (Health and Safety Executive) recommendations and that the relevant staff members have been fitted to that mask according to the manufacturerâs guidance. Reusable respirators are decontaminated, and filters replaced according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Sessional use of respirators is recommended if the dental team is undertaking multiple <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>. FFP3s with valves should be shielded with full face visors.</p>

<p>Dental technician and laboratory workers should continue with their routine infection prevention and control measures in the laboratory and should follow the same guidance as dental practices in terms of hand and respiratory hygiene and physical distancing.</p>

<p>Engineering support workers for dental practices should adhere to <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> requirements and only work on equipment and rooms that have been decontaminated.</p>

<h2>Ventilation requirements</h2>

<p>All enclosed workplaces must be ventilated by natural or artificial means as set out in the <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/priced/l24.pdf" class="govuk-link">Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulation</a>. UK building regulations recommend whole building ventilation to be 10 l/s/person and current healthcare guidance for new buildings and major refurbishments specifies that a treatment room should have at least 10 air changes per hour (<abbr title="air changes per hour">ACH</abbr>).</p>

<p>Ventilation is important to reduce the risk of aerosol contamination from potential airborne and droplet pathogens in dental settings. Specialist advice should be sought on how best to achieve the recommended air changes.</p>

<p>It is recognised that transitional arrangements may need to be in place to support dental practices where air changes are unknown or below this recommended level.</p>

<h2>Additional advice for environmental mitigation measures</h2>

<h3>Air cleaning devices</h3>

<p>Recirculating air cleaning devices based on High-Efficiency Particulate Air (<abbr title="High-Efficiency Particulate Air">HEPA</abbr>) filter systems or UV-C are likely to be effective, but each device needs to be validated by the manufacturer and maintained.</p>

<p>It is difficult to make general recommendations for devices that remove viable microbes from air, either by filtration or microbicidal action.</p>

<p>This is because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is variability in the rate they pass air through the device</li>
  <li>the removal or inactivation will vary according to filtration or microbicidal efficacy</li>
  <li>over time filters will become progressively blocked</li>
</ul>

<p>Microbicidal treatment such as UV can get obscured by a build-up of dust and the spectrum of UV emission, critical for microbicidal efficacy, can change over time.</p>

<p>Addition of recirculating air cleaning devices could enhance the effective air change rate. Devices should be correctly sized and the impacts on the room air flows considered. The effectiveness of air cleaning devices will depend on the flow rate of the device, the efficiency of air cleaning and the size of the room.</p>

<h3>Fans</h3>

<p>These will create turbulence that dilutes the most concentrated aerosols. In these environments, it may be beneficial to move air towards windows and mechanical extract points.</p>

<p>Fans should not be directed towards doors, driving air into other rooms. Fans should be cleaned regularly to remove visible soiling and should not be used in the high risk pathway.</p>

<p>Planned preventative maintenance, and cleaning of fans and their blades should continue.</p>

<h3>Air conditioning units</h3>

<p>Fixed air conditioning units (for example, wall or ceiling mounted recirculating air coolers -split units) and portable air conditioning, which do not recirculate to other rooms, can be used. Where there is poor air circulation within a room, it may be beneficial to mix air so as to dilute aerosols. These types of air conditioning will cool staff wearing water repellent <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Portable air conditioning should not be directed towards doors, driving air into other rooms, nor should any pipework or cables impede fire doors. Care should be taken when emptying the reservoir of portable air conditioning due to the risk of legionella or other microorganisms being present in the condensate water. See separate HTM 04 01 guidance for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hot-and-cold-water-supply-storage-and-distribution-systems-for-healthcare-premises">England, Wales, Northern Ireland</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nss.nhs.scot/publications/water-safety-shtm-04-01/" rel="external">Scotland</a> on this. Daily emptying of the reservoir should be recorded. Planned maintenance should be carried out on the device following manufacturerâs guidance and should be recorded. Do not use portable air conditioning that incorporates humidifiers.</p>

<h3>Fumigation and fogging</h3>

<p>The use of fumigation and fogging devices with disinfection chemicals are not advised for routine cleaning and or disinfection against COVID-19 and should only be considered in healthcare settings when multi-drug resistant organisms cannot be eradicated. This must always be under specialist infection prevention and control advice.</p>

<h2>Post <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> downtime</h2>

<p>A multidisciplinary working group (<a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.sdcep.org.uk/published-guidance/covid-19-practice-recovery/rapid-review-of-agps/">Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme (<abbr title="Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme">SDCEP</abbr>)</a>) have proposed a pragmatic algorithm with mitigation factors for post <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> downtime that has been accepted by the 4 UK Chief dental officers.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="#figure1">figure 1</a> for post <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> downtimes.</p>

<p>They advise that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where there is ventilation but the number of <abbr title="air changes per hour">ACH</abbr> are unknown, or there are air changes of 1 to 5 <abbr title="air changes per hour">ACH</abbr>, a baseline post <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> downtime of 30 minutes is recommended with mitigation such as high-volume suction and rubber dam</li>
  <li>where there are 6 to 9 <abbr title="air changes per hour">ACH</abbr>, a baseline post <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> downtime of 20 minutes is recommended</li>
  <li>where there are 10 or more <abbr title="air changes per hour">ACH</abbr>, a baseline post <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> downtime of 15 minutes is recommended</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>low risk patients do not require post <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> downtime</li>
  <li>post <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> down time (fallow time) is not considered necessary for successive appointments between members of the same household; to minimise aerosol spread dentists should use mitigating measures such as high volume suction/rubber dam; cleaning and disinfection of the environment should be carried out between patients of the same household; high risk patients should be separated by space or time from other patients</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> should not be conducted in a room that has no natural (that is a window) or mechanical ventilation</li>
  <li>all equipment including ventilation, suction, air cleaners and so on, is maintained according to manufacturerâs instructions and is operating effectively</li>
  <li>a minimum post <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> downtime of 10 minutes should apply to allow larger droplets to settle before environmental cleaning</li>
  <li>post <abbr title="Aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> downtime can commence at the end of aerosol production</li>
</ul>
