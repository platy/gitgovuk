<h2>Key messages</h2>

<p>Amendments have been made to strengthen existing messaging and provide further clarity where needed, including updates on the hierarchy of controls, clarity over the use of valved respirators, and highlighting the need to protect those previously shielding and who are considered clinically extremely vulnerable from COVID-19.</p>

<p>Changes to the previous version are listed on page 7 of the guidance. Following a clinical and scientific review, no changes to the recommendations, including <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr>, have been made in response to the new variant strains at this stage, however this position will remain under constant review. Organisations who adopt practices that differ from those recommended/stated in the national guidance are responsible for ensuring safe systems of work, including the completion of a risk assessments approved through local governance procedures.</p>

<p>All NHS organisations should ensure reliable application of all <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> recommendations and assurance on adherence, that <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> is available and in supply, and that all staff training is up to date.</p>

<p>Version 1.2 COVID-19 Guidance for maintaining services within health and care settings: infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) recommendations is an amendment to the previous version 1.1.</p>

<p>Local and national prevalence and incidence data will continue to guide services as advised by country-specific/public health organisations. Identification of new variants of concern is inevitable and on each new identification evidence for any change in transmissibility, mode of transmission, disease severity and any evidence of vaccine evasion will need to be considered as well as local incidence and prevalence of any new variant of concern. It may be necessary to change the <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures required on the basis of any new evidence.</p>

<p>For further information on the variants of concern:</p>

</ul>

<p>For further guidance on investigating and managing variants of concern:</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sars-cov-2-voc-investigating-and-managing-individuals-with-a-possible-or-confirmed-case/guidance-for-investigating-and-managing-individuals-with-a-possible-or-confirmed-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern" class="govuk-link">Guidance for investigating and managing individuals with a possible or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern or Variant Under Investigation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This data will continue to be used to ensure patients/individuals’ treatment, care and support can be managed in the 3 COVID-19 pathways, which remain as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>high risk: This includes patients/individuals who are confirmed COVID-19 positive by a SARS-CoV-2 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test or are symptomatic and suspected to have COVID-19 (awaiting result)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>medium risk: This includes patients/individuals who are waiting for their SARS-CoV-2 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result and who have no symptoms of COVID-19 and individuals who are asymptomatic with COVID-19 contact/exposure identified</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>low risk: This includes patients/individuals who have been triaged/tested (negative)/clinically assessed with no symptoms or known recent COVID-19 contact/exposure</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To ensure maximum workplace risk mitigation, organisations should undertake local risk assessments based on the measures as prioritised in the hierarchy of controls. If an unacceptable risk of transmission remains following this <a class="govuk-link" href="www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/publication/every-action-counts/">risk assessment</a>, it may be necessary to consider the extended use of respiratory protective equipment (<abbr title="respiratory protective equipment">RPE</abbr>) for patient care in specific situations. The risk assessment should include evaluation of the ventilation in the area, and prevalence of infection/new variants of concern in the local area. such as the care of patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (red / high risk pathway) in poorly ventilated settings.</p>

<p>Individuals who are clinically extremely vulnerable from COVID-19 will require protective <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures depending on their medical condition and treatment whilst receiving healthcare, for example priority for single room isolation.</p>

<p>Sessional use of single-use <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr>/<abbr title="respiratory protective equipment">RPE</abbr> items continues to be minimised and only applies to extended use of facemasks (all pathways) or FFP3 respirators (together with eye/ face protection) in the medium and high-risk pathway for healthcare workers where airborne precautions are indicated.</p>

<p>The use of face masks or face coverings<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> across the UK remains as an <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measure. In addition to social distancing, hand hygiene for staff, patients/individuals and visitors is advised in both clinical and non-clinical areas to further reduce the risk of transmission.</p>

<p>Patients in all care areas should still be encouraged and supported to wear a face mask, providing it is tolerated and is not detrimental to their medical or care needs.</p>

<p>Physical distancing of 2 metres remains in place as standard practice in all health and care settings, unless providing clinical or personal care and wearing appropriate <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Patients/individuals on a low-risk pathway require Standard Infection Control Precautions for all care including surgery or procedures.</p>

<p>Triaging and SARS-CoV-2 testing must be undertaken for all patients either at point of admission or as soon as possible/practical following admission across all the pathways.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> principles in this document apply to all health and care settings including acute, diagnostics, independent sector, mental health and learning disabilities, primary care, care homes, care at home, maternity and paediatrics (this list is not exhaustive).</p>

<p>NB. This guidance does not apply to Adult Social Care settings in England. Adult social care providers in England should refer to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/coronavirus-covid-19-social-care-guidance" class="govuk-link">existing guidance</a> already in place. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>/<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> will continuously review this guidance and update as needed.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures recommended are underpinned by the National Infection Prevention and Control Manual (NIPCM) practice <a href="http://www.nipcm.hps.scot.nhs.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">guide and associated literature reviews</a>. NHS England is using this an opportunity to introduce and adopt the NICPM as set out in the ‘UK Five-year Tackling Antimicrobial Resistance National Action Plan (2019-2024).’</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Explanation of the updates to infection prevention and control guidance</h2>

<p>The guidance is issued jointly by the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>), Public Health Wales (<abbr title="Public Health Wales">PHW</abbr>), Public Health Agency (<abbr title="Public Health Agency">PHA</abbr>) Northern Ireland, Health Protection Scotland (<abbr title="Health Protection Scotland">HPS</abbr>)/National Services Scotland, Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) and NHS England for health and care organisations as the UK moves to maintain healthcare services. The content is consistent with the administrative measures outlined in WHO <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> during healthcare when coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is suspected or confirmed: Interim Guidance, June 2020. In addition, the updates to this guidance are informed by the paper produced for the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies; <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/979441/S1169_Facemasks_for_health_care_workers.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Masks for healthcare workers to mitigate airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. (23.04.2021)</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures recommended are underpinned by the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nipcm.hps.scot.nhs.uk/" rel="external">National Infection Prevention and Control Manual</a> practice guide and associated literature reviews.</p>

<p>Maintaining services continues to require ‘new ways’ of working during the ongoing pandemic. Continual assessment of the available evidence/science and feedback from guidance users, professional bodies and associations, has identified the amendments required to version 1.0 to assist in supporting services in this ‘new and changing’ environment whilst COVID-19 remains a threat. This is based upon emerging evidence, experience and expert opinion.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Main changes to the guidance</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Inclusion of the hierarchy of controls as these apply to COVID-19, with definitions and supporting materials for implementation. Also, where an unacceptable risk of transmission remains following the hierarchy of controls risk assessment, it may be necessary to consider the extended use of <abbr title="respiratory protective equipment">RPE</abbr> for patient care in specific situations. The risk assessment should include evaluation of the ventilation in the area, operational capacity, and prevalence of infection/new variants of concern in the local area.</li>
  <li>Further advice on the use of valved respirators with examples of sterile procedures in the clinical setting.</li>
  <li>Further advice on minimising sessional or extended use of gowns where cohorts of confirmed COVID-19 patients are managed and there is a lack of single rooms/isolation rooms.</li>
  <li>Amendment to the <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> list to state ‘upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy where open suction of the upper respiratory tract occurs beyond the oro-pharynx’.</li>
  <li>Individuals who are clinically extremely vulnerable from COVID-19 will require protective <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures depending on their medical condition and treatment whilst receiving healthcare, for example, priority for single room isolation.</li>
