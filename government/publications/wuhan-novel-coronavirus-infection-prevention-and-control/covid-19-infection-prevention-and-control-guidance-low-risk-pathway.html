<p>This pathway applies to any care facility where:</p>

<p>a)  Triaged/clinically assessed individuals with no symptoms or known recent COVID-19 contact/exposure.</p>

<p>AND</p>

<p>Have a negative SARS-CoV-2 <abbr title="Polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result within 72 hours of treatment  and, for planned admissions, have self-isolated for the required period of from the test date.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>b) Individuals who have recovered (14 days) from COVID-19 AND have had at least 48 hours without fever or respiratory symptoms.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>c) Patients or individuals are part of a regular formal NHS testing plan and remain negative and asymptomatic  .</p>

<p>Clinicians should advise people who are at greater risk of getting COVID 19, or having a poorer outcome from it, that they may want to self-isolate for 14 days before a planned procedure. The decision to self-isolate will depend on their individual risk factors and requires individualised care and shared decision making.</p>

<p>NB. Some individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 may continue to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 by <abbr title="Polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> for up to 90 days from their initial illness onset. If they do not have any new COVID-19 symptoms and have not had a known COVID-19 exposure they are unlikely to be infectious. However, advice should be sought from an infection specialist (infectious disease/virologist/microbiologist) for severely immunosuppressed individuals who continue to test positive.</p>

<p>Patients/individuals on a low risk pathway require Standard Infection Control Precautions for all care including surgery or procedures.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7.1 </span> Maintaining physical distancing</h2>

<p>All staff and other care workers must maintain social/physical distancing of 2 metres where possible (unless providing clinical or personal care and wearing personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) as per care pathway).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7.2 </span> Personal protective equipment</h2>

<p><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> required for standard infection control precautions (<abbr title="standard infection control procedures">SICPs</abbr>) is as follows (see table below):</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">SICPS/PPE     (all   settings/all patients/individuals)</th>
      <th scope="col">Disposable   gloves</th>
      <th scope="col">Disposable   apron/gown</th>
      <th scope="col">Face masks</th>
      <th scope="col">Eye/face   protection(visor)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>If contact with blood and/or body fluids   is anticipated</td>
      <td>Single use</td>
      <td>Single use apron (gown if risk of spraying   / splashing)</td>
      <td>FRSM Type IIR for direct patient care and surgical mask* Type II for extended use</td>
      <td>Risk assess and use if required for care   procedure/task where anticipated blood/body fluids spraying/splashes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>*Sessional/extended use of facemasks apply across the UK for healthcare workers in any health or care settings.</p>

<p>NB. Airborne precautions are not required for <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> on patients/individuals in the low risk COVID-19 pathway, providing the patient has no other known or suspected infectious agent transmitted via the droplet or airborne route.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7.3 </span> Safe management of environment/equipment and blood/body fluids</h2>

<p>During the pandemic, the frequency of cleaning of both the environment and equipment in care (patient) areas should be increased to at least twice daily, this includes frequently touched sites/points and communal facilities such as shared toilets.</p>

<p>In the low risk COVID-19 pathway organisations may choose to revert to general purpose detergents for cleaning, as opposed to widespread use of disinfectants (with the exception of blood and body fluids, where a chlorine releasing agent (or a suitable alternative) solution should be used).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3.1 </span> Safe management of waste of waste</h3>

<p>Waste must be segregated in line with the respective countries’ national regulation and there is no requirement to dispose of all waste as infectious waste in the low risk pathway.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3.2 </span> Operating theatres and procedure rooms</h3>

<p>Within the low risk COVID-19 pathway, standard theatre cleaning and time for air changes provides appropriate levels of IPC and there is no requirement for additional cleaning or theatre down time unless the patient has another infectious agent that requires additional IPC measures.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7.4 </span> Aerosol generating procedures (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>): procedures that create a higher risk of respiratory infection transmission</h2>

<p>Airborne precautions are not required for <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> on patients/individuals in the low risk COVID-19 pathway, providing the patient has no other known or suspected infectious agent transmitted via the droplet or airborne route.</p>

<p>There is no additional requirement for ventilation or downtime in this pathway, providing safe systems of work, including engineering controls are in place.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4.1 </span> Critical care areas</h3>

<p>Providing suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases can be cared for in single rooms or isolation rooms, the department should no longer be classified as an <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> ‘hot spot’ or ‘high risk area.’ This should be defined locally depending on prevalence/incidence data and the subsequent pathway assigned. This negates the requirement for the routine wearing of airborne <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> including a respirator in the low risk COVID-19 pathway.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4.2 </span> Operating theatres</h3>

<p>Patients/individuals in the low risk COVID-19 pathway do not need to be anaesthetised or recovered in the operating theatre if intubation/extubation (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>) is required.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7.5 </span> Visitor guidance</h2>

<p>As outlined in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/care-pathways#IPCmeasures" class="govuk-link">administration measures for the pathways (section 4.4)</a>, hand hygiene and respiratory hygiene, and the wearing of a face covering (if tolerated) along with social distancing should be encouraged and maintained. Therefore visitors require no additional <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. Visitors should be triaged.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7.6 </span> Discharge or transfer</h2>

<p>There is no restriction on discharge unless the patient/individual is entering a long-term care facility where testing may be required. If someone in the patient’s household has COVID-19 or is a contact of a COVID-19 case and is self-isolating, the discharge guidance will be provided by the clinician.</p>

<p>In England, to ensure testing does not delay a timely discharge to a care home,  all patients who have previously tested negative should be re-tested for SARS-CoV-2 again 48 hours prior to discharge. Immunocompetent patients who have tested positive within the previous 90 days, and remain asymptomatic, do not need to be re-tested. The information from the test results, with any supporting care information, must be communicated and transferred to the relevant care home. No one should be discharged from hospital directly to a care home without the involvement of the local authority.</p>

<p>Discharge arrangements may differ between countries, refer to country <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/introduction-and-organisational-preparedness" class="govuk-link">specific resources in Section 2.1</a>.</p>
