<h2>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Scope and purpose</h2>

<p>This document sets out the infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) advice for health and care organisations as the UK continues to maintain healthcare services during the ongoing pandemic.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> principles in this document apply to all health and care settings, including the independent/private sector, mental health and learning disabilities, primary care areas, care homes, maternity and paediatrics (this list is not exhaustive, please refer to specific country resources for setting specific guidance). It includes key <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> control recommendations and includes risk assessed patient pathway scenarios to help guide the implementation of measures to provide safe and effective care locally and is based on the best available evidence.</p>

<p>Version 1.2 COVID-19 Guidance for maintaining services within health and care settings: <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> recommendations is an amendment to the previous version 1.1 and has been updated to continue to support services. The challenge facing the NHS is to maintain healthcare services and manage NHS capacity whilst providing a safe and equitable service for staff, visitors and patients/individuals including those who may present with COVID-19, those who have recovered from COVID-19 and those with no history of COVID-19 until public health strategies such as mass vaccination are complete.</p>

<p>Maintaining services requires a continuous review of ways of working to respond to the pandemic and; guidance for working in a changing environment requires continual and ongoing development based upon emerging evidence, experience and expert opinion.</p>

<p>While this document seeks to ensure a consistent and resilient UK-wide approach, some differences in operational details and organisational responsibilities may apply, where current legislation, guidance, for example, clinical definitions, already exists. Links can be accessed in the resources below.</p>

<p>Please note that this guidance does not apply to adult social care settings in England given <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/coronavirus-covid-19-social-care-guidance" class="govuk-link">existing guidance for adult social care settings</a> has already been provided and continues to be relevant. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>/<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> will continuously review this guidance and update as needed.</p>

<p>This document does not provide links throughout the sections, please follow the country-specific resources, for example visiting guidance, testing, discharge policies.</p>
