<p>Concerns regarding increased transmissibility and potential impact on health and social care are acknowledged. It was agreed that there is provision within the guidance for extended use of respiratory protective equipment (RPE) following local risk assessment. It was agreed, however, that this could be made more explicit within the guidance with elevation of this statement into the ‘main messages’ section of the guidance.</p>

<p>As at 8 December 2021, the UK COVID-19 infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) Cell, having reviewed further information regarding the new Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, remains of the view that the current <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-guidance-for-maintaining-services-within-health-and-care-settings-infection-prevention-and-control-recommendations">COVID-19 <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> guidance</a> remains otherwise fit for purpose.</p>

<p>There should be reinforcement to providers of health and care services of the need for rigorous implementation of all <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures, based on a dynamic risk assessment based on person, place and environment, using a hierarchy of controls approach. There should be an emphasis on the optimised use of personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) (right time, right place) and which includes the safe donning and doffing of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<p>There should also be a strengthening of messaging on safe and correct mask use by patients, visitors, and staff, to maximise the understanding of source control. Especially noting evidence supporting the relative importance of patient-to-patient transmission of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<p>The pattern of nosocomial transmission seen in previous waves of COVID-19 infection has followed on from increases in community transmission. There is also, therefore, a need to put community/population control measures in place to limit the spread of Omicron variant to protect health and social care services.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> Cell is committed to continuing to monitor/review emerging evidence/science and data, and to recommend updates to the <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> guidance if required.</p>

<p>COVID-19 nosocomial transmission data is monitored through surveillance in each of the 4 nations and feeds into the <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> Cell assessments via the nation leads.</p>

<p>Any new epidemiological information/trends will be considered by the <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> Cell.</p>

<p>With regard to FFP2 versus FFP3 masks, it is a requirement of the Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) that FFP2 masks are also fit-tested in the same way as FFP3 masks. <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> also advises against the use of FFP2 unless we are in contingency measures as these provide a lesser filtration rate than FFP3. Currently the supply of FFP3 masks is considered adequate.</p>
