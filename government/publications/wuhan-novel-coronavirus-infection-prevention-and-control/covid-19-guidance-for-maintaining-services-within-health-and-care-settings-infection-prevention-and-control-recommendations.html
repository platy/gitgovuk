<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Main messages and explanation of updates</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>About this guidance</h3>

<p>This guidance is issued jointly by the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>), Public Health Wales (<abbr title="Public Health Wales">PHW</abbr>), Public Health Agency (<abbr title="Public Health Agency">PHA</abbr>) Northern Ireland, Health Protection Scotland (<abbr title="Health Protection Scotland">HPS</abbr>)/National Services Scotland, Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) and NHS England as official guidance.</p>

<p>Amendments have been made to strengthen existing messaging and provide further clarity where needed, including updates on the hierarchy of controls, clarity over the use of valved respirators, and highlighting the need to protect those previously shielding and who are considered clinically extremely vulnerable from coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>Following a clinical and scientific review, no changes to the recommendations, including personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>), have been made in response to the new variant strains at this stage, however this position will remain under constant review. Organisations who adopt practices that differ from those recommended/stated in the national guidance are responsible for ensuring safe systems of work, including the completion of a risk assessment approved through local governance procedures.</p>

<p>All NHS organisations should ensure reliable application of all infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) recommendations and assurance on adherence, that <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is available and in supply, and that all staff training is up to date.</p>

<p>This guidance seeks to ensure a consistent and resilient UK wide approach, however some differences in operational details and organisational responsibilities may apply in Northern Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland.</p>

<p>Please note that this guidance is of a general nature and that an employer should consider the specific conditions of each individual place of work and comply with all applicable legislation, including the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/37/contents" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> principles in this document apply to all health and care settings including acute, diagnostics, independent sector, mental health and learning disabilities, primary care, care homes, care at home, maternity and paediatrics (this list is not exhaustive).</p>

<p>This guidance does not apply to adult social care settings in England. Adult social care providers in England should refer to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/coronavirus-covid-19-social-care-guidance" class="govuk-link">existing guidance</a> already in place. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>/<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> will continuously review this guidance and update as needed.</p>

<p>This <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> guidance will be updated in line with service need and as the evidence evolves. The administrative measures outlined in the guidance are consistent with <a rel="external" href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-IPC-2021.1" class="govuk-link">World Health Organization (WHO) guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Main messages</h3>

<p>Local and national prevalence and incidence data will continue to guide services as advised by country-specific/public health organisations. Identification of new variants of concern is inevitable and on each new identification evidence for any change in transmissibility, mode of transmission, disease severity and any evidence of vaccine evasion will need to be considered as well as local incidence and prevalence of any new variant of concern. It may be necessary to change the <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures required on the basis of any new evidence.</p>

<p>For further information on the variants of concern:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/threat-assessment-emergence-sars-cov-2-b1617-variants" rel="external">Threat Assessment Brief: Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 variants in India and situation in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>/<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investigation-of-novel-sars-cov-2-variant-variant-of-concern-20201201" class="govuk-link">Investigation of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern: technical briefings</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For further guidance on investigating and managing variants of concern:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sars-cov-2-voc-investigating-and-managing-individuals-with-a-possible-or-confirmed-case/guidance-for-investigating-and-managing-individuals-with-a-possible-or-confirmed-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern">Guidance for investigating and managing individuals with a possible or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern or Variant Under Investigation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This data will continue to be used to ensure patients/individuals’ treatment, care and support can be managed in the 3 COVID-19 pathways, which remain as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>high risk - this includes patients/individuals who are confirmed COVID-19 positive by a SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) test or are symptomatic and suspected to have COVID-19 (awaiting result)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>medium risk - this includes patients/individuals who are waiting for their SARS-CoV-2 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result and who have no symptoms of COVID-19 and individuals who are asymptomatic with COVID-19 contact/exposure identified</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>low risk - this includes patients/individuals who have been triaged/tested (negative)/clinically assessed with no symptoms or known recent COVID-19 contact/exposure</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To ensure maximum workplace risk mitigation, organisations should undertake local risk assessments based on the measures as prioritised in the hierarchy of controls. If an unacceptable risk of transmission remains following this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/publication/every-action-counts/" rel="external">risk assessment</a>, it may be necessary to consider the extended use of respiratory protective equipment (<abbr title="respiratory protective equipment">RPE</abbr>) for patient care in specific situations. The risk assessment should include evaluation of the ventilation in the area, and prevalence of infection/new variants of concern in the local area.</p>

<p>Individuals who are clinically extremely vulnerable from COVID-19 will require protective <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures depending on their medical condition and treatment whilst receiving healthcare, for example priority for single room isolation.</p>

<p>Sessional use of single use <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>/<abbr title="respiratory protective equipment">RPE</abbr> items continues to be minimised and only applies to extended use of face masks (all pathways) or filtering face piece (FFP3) respirators (together with eye/face protection) in the medium and high risk pathways for healthcare workers (<abbr title="healthcare workers">HCWs</abbr>) where airborne precautions are indicated.</p>

<p>The use of face masks or face coverings across the UK remains as an <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measure. In addition to social distancing, hand hygiene for staff, patients/individuals and visitors is advised in both clinical and non-clinical areas to further reduce the risk of transmission.</p>

<p>Patients in all care areas should still be encouraged and supported to wear a face mask, providing it is tolerated and is not detrimental to their medical or care needs.</p>

<p>Physical distancing of 2 metres remains in place as standard practice in all health and care settings, unless providing clinical or personal care and wearing appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Patients/individuals on a low-risk pathway require standard infection control precautions (<abbr title="standard infection control precautions">SICPs</abbr>) for all care including surgery or procedures.</p>

<p>Triaging and SARS-CoV-2 testing must be undertaken for all patients either at point of admission or as soon as possible/practical following admission across all the pathways.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures recommended are underpinned by the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://www.nipcm.hps.scot.nhs.uk/">National Infection Prevention and Control Manual (NIPCM) practice guide and associated literature reviews</a>. NHS England is using this an opportunity to introduce and adopt the NICPM as set out in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-5-year-action-plan-for-antimicrobial-resistance-2019-to-2024" class="govuk-link">UK Five-year Tackling Antimicrobial Resistance National Action Plan (2019 to 2024)</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Explanation of the updates to <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> guidance</h3>

<p>The guidance is issued jointly by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>, <abbr title="Public Health Wales">PHW</abbr>, <abbr title="Public Health Agency">PHA</abbr> Northern Ireland, <abbr title="Health Protection Scotland">HPS</abbr>/National Services Scotland, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> and NHS England for health and care organisations as the UK moves to maintain healthcare services. The content is consistent with the administrative measures outlined in <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/332879">WHO <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> during healthcare when COVID-19 is suspected or confirmed: Interim Guidance, June 2020</a>. In addition, the updates to this guidance are informed by the paper produced for the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emg-masks-for-healthcare-workers-to-mitigate-airborne-transmission-of-sars-cov-2-25-march-2021" class="govuk-link">Masks for healthcare workers to mitigate airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (23 April 2021)</a>.</p>

<p>Maintaining services continues to require ‘new ways’ of working during the ongoing pandemic. Continual assessment of the available evidence/science and feedback from guidance users, professional bodies and associations, has identified the amendments required to the guidance to assist in supporting services in this ‘new and changing’ environment whilst COVID-19 remains a threat. This is based upon emerging evidence, experience and expert opinion.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>Main changes to the guidance</h3>

<p>The main amendments to this version of the guidance are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Inclusion of the hierarchy of controls as these apply to COVID-19, with definitions and supporting materials for implementation. Also, where an unacceptable risk of transmission remains following the hierarchy of controls risk assessment, it may be necessary to consider the extended use of <abbr title="respiratory protective equipment">RPE</abbr> for patient care in specific situations. The risk assessment should include evaluation of the ventilation in the area, operational capacity, and prevalence of infection/new variants of concern in the local area.</li>
  <li>Further advice on the use of valved respirators with examples of sterile procedures in the clinical setting.</li>
  <li>Further advice on minimising sessional or extended use of gowns where cohorts of confirmed COVID-19 patients are managed and there is a lack of single rooms/isolation rooms.</li>
  <li>Amendment to the aerosol generating procedure (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>) list to state ‘upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy where open suction of the upper respiratory tract occurs beyond the oro-pharynx’.</li>
  <li>Individuals who are clinically extremely vulnerable from COVID-19 will require protective <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures depending on their medical condition and treatment whilst receiving healthcare, for example, priority for single room isolation.</li>
</ol>

<span class="number">2. </span>Introduction</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Scope and purpose</h3>

<p>This document sets out the <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> advice for health and care organisations as the UK continues to maintain healthcare services during the ongoing pandemic.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> principles in this document apply to all health and care settings, including the independent/private sector, mental health and learning disabilities, primary care areas, care homes, care at home, maternity and paediatrics (this list is not exhaustive, please refer to specific country resources for setting specific guidance). It includes key <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> control recommendations and includes risk assessed patient pathway scenarios to help guide the implementation of measures to provide safe and effective care locally and is based on the best available evidence.</p>

<p>The challenge facing the NHS is to maintain healthcare services and manage NHS capacity whilst providing a safe and equitable service for staff, visitors and patients/individuals including those who may present with COVID-19, those who have recovered from COVID-19 and those with no history of COVID-19, until public health strategies such as mass vaccination are complete.</p>

<p>Maintaining services requires a continuous review of ways of working to respond to the pandemic and guidance for working in a changing environment requires continual and ongoing development based upon emerging evidence, experience and expert opinion.</p>

<p>While this document seeks to ensure a consistent and resilient UK-wide approach, some differences in operational details and organisational responsibilities may apply, where current legislation, guidance, for example, clinical definitions, already exists. Links can be accessed in the resources below.</p>

<p>This guidance does not apply to adult social care settings in England given <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/coronavirus-covid-19-social-care-guidance" class="govuk-link">existing guidance for adult social care settings</a> has already been provided and continues to be relevant. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>/<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> will continuously review this guidance and update as needed.</p>

<p>This document does not provide links throughout the sections. Follow the country-specific resources, for example visiting guidance, testing, discharge policies.</p>

<p>Further updates will be made to this document as new data/evidence emerges and as the <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/884352/slides_-_11_05_2020.pdf" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 alert levels change</a>. This is a scale of 1 to 5 which the UK government uses to reflect the degree of threat to the country from the current COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Governance and responsibilities</h2>

<p>Organisations and employers including NHS Trusts, NHS Boards, Health and Social Care Trusts (Northern Ireland), local authorities, and independent sector providers, through their Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or equivalent, must ensure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>monitoring of <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> practices, as recommended in this guidance, and ensure that resources are in place to implement and measure adherence to good <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> practice. This must include all care areas and all staff (permanent, agency and external contractors)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>testing and self-isolation strategies are in place with a local policy for the response if transmission rates of COVID-19 increase</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>COVID-19 care pathways</h2>

<p>These pathways are specific to the COVID-19 pandemic and are examples of how organisations may separate COVID-19 risks. It is important to note that these pathways do not necessarily define a service to a particular pathway and should not impact the delivery and duration of care for the patient or individual. Moving patients between pathways should be based on their infectious status (testing required), clinical need, availability of services and this should be agreed locally. Implementation strategies must be underpinned by patient/procedure risk assessment, appropriate testing regimens (as per organisations or country specific) and epidemiological data. Additional information on specific settings can be found in: NICE (2020) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng179/resources/covid19-rapid-guideline-arranging-planned-care-in-hospitals-and-diagnostic-services-pdf-66141969613765" rel="external">COVID-19 rapid guideline: arranging planned care in hospitals and diagnostic services</a>.</p>

<p>Triaging and testing within all health and other care facilities must be undertaken to enable early recognition of COVID-19 cases. See <a href="https://draft-assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1021294/20210118_COVID-19_Infection_prevention_control_Appendix_1_Sample_triage_tool.pdf" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Appendix 1</a> for an example of triage questions. Triage should be undertaken by clinical staff who are trained and competent in the application of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-initial-investigation-of-possible-cases/investigation-and-initial-clinical-management-of-possible-cases-of-wuhan-novel-coronavirus-wn-cov-infection" class="govuk-link">clinical case definition</a> prior to arrival at a care area, or as soon as possible on arrival, and allocated to the appropriate pathway. This should include screening for other infections/multi-drug resistant organisms, including as per national screening requirements.</p>

<p>Infection risk and <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> precautions, for example <abbr title="standard infection control precautions">SICPs</abbr> or transmission based precautions (<abbr title="transmission based precautions">TBPs</abbr>) must be communicated between care areas/pathways, including when discharge planning.</p>

<p>Patients with respiratory symptoms should be assessed in a segregated area, ideally a single room, pending test result to define the causative organism.</p>

<p>Individuals who are clinically extremely vulnerable from COVID-19 will require protective <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures depending on their medical condition and treatment whilst receiving healthcare, for example priority for single room isolation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>Administration measures for the pathways</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Establish separation of patient pathways and staff flow to minimise contact between pathways. For example, this could include provision of separate entrances and exits (if available) or use of one-way entrance and exit systems, clear signage and restricted access to communal areas:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>care areas (for example, ward, clinic, GP practice, care home) may designate self-contained area(s) or ward(s) for the treatment and care of patients/individuals at high, medium and low risk of COVID-19. Temporal separation may be used in clinics/primary care settings</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>as a minimum in smaller facilities or primary care outpatient settings physical or temporal separation of patients/departments at high risk of COVID-19 from the rest of the facility/patients</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure that hygiene facilities, <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures and messaging are available for all patients/individuals, staff and visitors to minimise COVID-19 transmission such as:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>hand hygiene facilities including instructional posters</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>good respiratory hygiene measures</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>maintaining physical distancing of 2 metres at all times (unless wearing <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> due to clinical care or personal care as per pathways)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>increasing frequent decontamination of equipment and environment</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>considering improving ventilation by opening windows (natural ventilation) if mechanical ventilation is not available</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>clear advice on use of face coverings and face masks by patients/individuals, visitors and by staff in non-patient facing areas - this will include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>use of face masks/coverings by all outpatients (if tolerated) and visitors when entering a hospital, GP/dental surgery or other care settings</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>use of a surgical face mask (Type II or Type IIR) by all patients across all pathways, if this can be tolerated and does not compromise their clinical care, such as when receiving oxygen therapy. This will minimise the dispersal of respiratory secretions and reduce environmental contamination</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>extended use of face masks by all staff in both clinical and non-clinical areas within the healthcare or care setting</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>where visitors are unable to wear face coverings due to physical or mental health conditions or a disability, clinicians/person in charge should consider what other <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures are in place, such as physical distancing and environmental cleaning, to ensure sufficient access depending on the patient’s condition and the care pathway</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where possible and clinically appropriate remote consultations rather than face-to-face should be offered to patients/individuals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure restricted access between pathways if possible (depending on size of the facility, prevalence/incidence rates), by other patients/individuals, visitors or staff, including patient transfer and in communal staff areas (changing rooms/restaurant). If the prevalence/incidence rates decline this may not be necessary between pathways providing the <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures are reliably maintained.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure areas/wards are clearly signposted, using physical barriers as appropriate to ensure patients/individuals and staff understand the different risk areas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure local standard operating procedures detail the measures to segregate equipment and staff, including planning for emergency scenarios, as the prevalence/incidence of COVID-19 may increase or decrease until cessation of the pandemic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure a rapid and continued response through ongoing surveillance of rates of infection within the local population and for hospital/organisation onset cases (staff and patients/individuals). Positive cases identified after admission who fit the criteria for a healthcare associated infection should trigger a case investigation. If 2 or more cases are linked in time and place, an outbreak investigation should be conducted. Refer to country-specific definitions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the prevalence/incidence rate for COVID-19 is high, where possible, assign separate teams of health and other care workers, including domestic staff, to care for individuals in isolation/cohort rooms or areas/pathways. If a member of staff is required to move between sites/hospitals/cohort areas due to the unique function of their role, all <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures including physical distancing must be maintained.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Providers of planned services should be responsive to local and national prevalence/incidence data on COVID-19 and adapt processes so that services can be stepped-up or down. This can be assessed using the respective countries weekly COVID-19 surveillance report/SARS-CoV-2 positivity data on admission, and local capacity and resources.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Safe systems of work outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/default.html">hierarchy of controls</a> including elimination, substitution, engineering, administrative controls and <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>/<abbr title="respiratory protective equipment">RPE</abbr> are an integral part of <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures. Organisations should undertake risk assessments based on these measures, prioritised in the hierarchy of controls in the context of managing infectious agents. If an unacceptable risk of transmission remains following a risk assessment taking these controls into account, it may be necessary to consider the extended use of <abbr title="respiratory protective equipment">RPE</abbr> for patient care in specific situations. The risk assessment should include evaluation of the ventilation in the area, operational capacity, and prevalence of infection/new variants of concern in the local area.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span>Community settings</h3>

<p>Areas where triaging for COVID-19 is not possible, for example community pharmacies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>signage at entry points advising of the necessary precautions</li>
  <li>staff should maintain 2 metres physical distance with customers/service users, using floor markings, clear screens or wear surgical face masks (Type IIR) where this is not possible</li>
  <li>patients/individuals with symptoms should be advised not to enter the premises</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span>Outpatient/primary/day care</h3>

<p>In outpatient, primary care and day care settings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>where possible and appropriate, services should utilise virtual consultation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if attending outpatients or diagnostics, service providers should consider timed appointments and strategies such as asking patients/individuals to wait to be called to the waiting area with minimum wait times</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>patients/individuals should not attend if they have symptoms of COVID-19 or are isolating as a contact/exposure and communications should advise actions to take in such circumstances for example for patients/individuals receiving chemotherapy and renal dialysis</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>communications prior to appointments should provide advice on what to do if patients/individuals suspect they have come into contact with someone who has COVID-19 prior to their appointment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>outpatient letters should be altered to advise patients/individuals on parking, entrances, <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> precautions and COVID-19 symptoms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>patients/individuals must be instructed to remain in waiting areas and not visit other parts of the facility</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>prior to admission to the waiting area, all patients/individuals and accompanying persons should be triaged for COVID-19 symptoms and assessed for exposure to contacts</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>patients/individuals and accompanying persons will also be asked to wear a mask/face covering at all times</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>SARS-CoV-2 confirmed positive patients/individuals or those self-isolating should still be assessed and reviewed following the high/medium care pathway in these settings, to ensure urgent treatment/appointments are accommodated. This is important to avoid unwarranted poor patient outcomes.</p>

<p>In some clinical outpatient settings, such as vaccination/injection clinics, where contact with individuals is minimal, the need for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items for each encounter, for example gloves and aprons are only recommended when there is (anticipated) exposure to blood/body fluids or non-intact skin. Staff administering vaccinations/injections must apply hand hygiene between patients and wear a sessional face mask.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Standard infection prevention control precautions (<abbr title="standard infection control precautions">SICPs</abbr>) - all pathways or settings</h2>

<p><abbr title="standard infection control precautions">SICPs</abbr> are the basic <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures necessary to reduce the risk of transmitting infectious agents from both recognised and unrecognised sources of infection and are required across all COVID-19 pathways. Sources of (potential) infection include blood and other body fluids secretions or excretions (excluding sweat), non-intact skin or mucous membranes and any equipment or items in the care environment that could have become contaminated.</p>

<p>The application of <abbr title="standard infection control precautions">SICPs</abbr> during care delivery is determined by an assessment of risk to and from individuals and includes the task, level of interaction and/or the anticipated level of exposure to blood and/or other body fluids.</p>

<p><abbr title="standard infection control precautions">SICPs</abbr> must therefore be used by all staff, in all care settings, at all times and for all patients/individuals, whether infection is known or not, to ensure the safety of patients/individuals, staff and visitors. This section highlights the key measures for the COVID-19 pathways. Please refer to the practice guide* for additional information on the other elements which remain unchanged.</p>

<p>The elements of <abbr title="standard infection control precautions">SICPs</abbr> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>patient placement and assessment for infection risk (screening/triaging/testing)</p>
  </li>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Aerosol generating procedures – procedures that create a higher risk of respiratory infection transmission</h2>

<p>An <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> is a medical procedure that can result in the release of airborne particles (aerosols) from the respiratory tract when treating someone who is suspected or known to be suffering from an infectious agent transmitted wholly or partly by the airborne or droplet route.</p>

<p>This is the list of medical procedures for COVID-19 that have been reported to be aerosol generating and are associated with an increased risk of respiratory transmission:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tracheal intubation and extubation</li>
  <li>manual ventilation</li>
  <li>tracheotomy or tracheostomy procedures (insertion or removal)</li>
  <li>bronchoscopy</li>
  <li>dental procedures (using high speed devices, for example ultrasonic scalers/high speed drills)</li>
  <li>non-invasive ventilation (<abbr title="non-invasive ventilation">NIV</abbr>); bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation (<abbr title="Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure Ventilation">BiPAP</abbr>) and continuous positive airway pressure ventilation (<abbr title="Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Ventilation">CPAP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>high flow nasal oxygen (<abbr title="high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO)">HFNO</abbr>)</li>
  <li>high frequency oscillatory ventilation (<abbr title="high frequency oscillatory ventilation">HFOV</abbr>)</li>
  <li>induction of sputum using nebulised saline</li>
  <li>respiratory tract suctioning*</li>
  <li>upper ear, nose and throat (<abbr title="ear, nose and throat">ENT</abbr>) airway procedures that involve respiratory suctioning*</li>
  <li>upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy where open suction of the upper respiratory tract* occurs beyond the oro-pharynx</li>
  <li>high speed cutting in surgery/post-mortem procedures if respiratory tract/paranasal sinuses involved</li>
</ul>

<p>*The available evidence relating to respiratory tract suctioning is associated with ventilation.  In line with a precautionary approach, open suctioning of the respiratory tract regardless of association with ventilation has been incorporated into the current (COVID-19) <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> list. It is the consensus view of the UK <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> cell that only open suctioning beyond the oro-pharynx is currently considered an <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>, that is oral/pharyngeal suctioning is not an <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>.  The evidence on respiratory tract suctioning is currently being reviewed by the <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> Panel which is an independent panel set up by the 4 Chief Medical Officers (CMOs) to review new or further evidence for consideration.</p>

<p>Certain other procedures or equipment may generate an aerosol from material other than patient secretions but are not considered to represent a significant infectious risk for COVID-19. Procedures in this category include administration of humidified oxygen, administration of Entonox or medication via nebulisation.</p>

<p>The New and Emerging Respiratory Viral Threat Assessment Group (<abbr title="New and Emerging Respiratory Viral Threat Assessment Group*[PPE]: personal protective equipment">NERVTAG</abbr>) advised that during nebulisation, the aerosol derives from a non-patient source (the fluid in the nebuliser chamber) and does not carry patient-derived viral particles. If a particle in the aerosol coalesces with a contaminated mucous membrane, it will cease to be airborne and therefore will not be part of an aerosol. Staff should use appropriate hand hygiene when helping patients to remove nebulisers and oxygen masks. In addition, <a href="https://www.swast.nhs.uk/assets/1/cpr_as_an_agp_-_evidence_review_and_nervtag_consensus.pdf#:~:text=NERVTAG%20consensus%20statement%20on%20Cardiopulmonary%20Resuscitation%20%28CPR%29%20as,increased%20risk%20of%20transmission%20of%20acute%20respiratory%20infections" rel="external" class="govuk-link">the current expert consensus from <abbr title="New and Emerging Respiratory Viral Threat Assessment Group*[PPE]: personal protective equipment">NERVTAG</abbr></a> is that chest compressions are not considered to be procedures that pose a higher risk for respiratory infections including COVID-19.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Low risk pathway – key principles</h2>

<p>This pathway applies to any care facility where:</p>

<p>a)  Triaged/clinically assessed individuals with no symptoms or known recent COVID-19 contact/exposure.</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>Have a negative SARS-CoV-2 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result within 72 hours of treatment  and, for planned admissions, have self-isolated for the required period or from the test date.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>b) Individuals who have recovered (14 days) from COVID-19 and have had at least 48 hours without fever or respiratory symptoms.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>c) Patients or individuals are part of a regular formal NHS testing plan and remain negative and asymptomatic.</p>

<p>Clinicians should advise people who are at greater risk of getting COVID-19, or having a poorer outcome from it, that they may want to self-isolate for 14 days before a planned procedure. The decision to self-isolate will depend on their individual risk factors and requires individualised care and shared decision making.</p>

<p>Some individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 may continue to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 by <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> for up to 90 days from their initial illness onset. If they do not have any new COVID-19 symptoms and have not had a known COVID-19 exposure they are unlikely to be infectious. However, advice should be sought from an infection specialist (infectious disease/virologist/microbiologist) for severely immunosuppressed individuals who continue to test positive.</p>

<p>Patients/individuals on a low risk pathway require <abbr title="standard infection control precautions">SICPs</abbr> for all care including surgery or procedures.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Maintaining physical distancing</h3>

<p>All staff and other care workers must maintain social/physical distancing of 2 metres where possible (unless providing clinical or personal care and wearing <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> as per care pathway).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>Personal protective equipment</h3>

<p><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> required for <abbr title="standard infection control precautions">SICPs</abbr> when following the low risk pathway is as follows:</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>*Sessional/extended use of face masks applies across the UK for <abbr title="healthcare workers">HCWs</abbr> in any health or other care settings.</p>

<p>Airborne precautions are not required for <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> on patients/individuals in the low risk COVID-19 pathway, providing the patient has no other known or suspected infectious agent transmitted via the droplet or airborne route.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span>Safe management of environment/equipment and blood/body fluids</h3>

<p>During the pandemic, the frequency of cleaning of both the environment and equipment in care (patient) areas should be increased to at least twice daily, this includes frequently touched sites/points and communal facilities such as shared toilets.</p>

<p>In the low risk COVID-19 pathway, organisations may choose to revert to general purpose detergents for cleaning, as opposed to widespread use of disinfectants (with the exception of blood and body fluids, where a chlorine releasing agent (or a suitable alternative) solution should be used).</p>

<h4>7.3.1 Safe management of waste</h4>

<p>Waste must be segregated in line with the respective countries’ national regulation and there is no requirement to dispose of all waste as infectious waste in the low risk pathway.</p>

<h4>7.3.2 Operating theatres and procedure rooms</h4>

<p>Within the low risk COVID-19 pathway, standard theatre cleaning and time for air changes provides appropriate levels of <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> and there is no requirement for additional cleaning or theatre down time unless the patient has another infectious agent that requires additional <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span>Aerosol generating procedures (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>): procedures that create a higher risk of respiratory infection transmission</h3>

<p>Airborne precautions are not required for <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> on patients/individuals in the low risk COVID-19 pathway, providing the patient has no other known or suspected infectious agent transmitted via the droplet or airborne route.</p>

<p>There is no additional requirement for ventilation or downtime in this pathway, providing safe systems of work, including engineering controls are in place.</p>

<h4>7.4.1 Critical care areas</h4>

<p>Providing suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases can be cared for in single rooms or isolation rooms, the department should no longer be classified as an <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> ‘hot spot’ or ‘high risk area’. This should be defined locally depending on prevalence/incidence data and the subsequent pathway assigned. This negates the requirement for the routine wearing of airborne <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> including a respirator in the low risk COVID-19 pathway.</p>

<h4>7.4.2 Operating theatres</h4>

<p>Patients/individuals in the low risk COVID-19 pathway do not need to be anaesthetised or recovered in the operating theatre if intubation/extubation (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>) is required.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.5 </span>Visitor guidance</h3>

<p>As outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#IPCmeasures">administration measures for the pathways (section 4.4)</a>, hand hygiene and respiratory hygiene, and the wearing of a face covering (if tolerated) along with social distancing should be encouraged and maintained. Therefore visitors require no additional <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. Visitors should be triaged.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.6 </span>Discharge or transfer</h3>

<p>There is no restriction on discharge unless the patient/individual is entering a long-term care facility where testing may be required. If someone in the patient’s household has COVID-19 or is a contact of a COVID-19 case and is self-isolating, the discharge guidance will be provided by the clinician.</p>

<p>In England, to ensure testing does not delay a timely discharge to a care home,  all patients who have previously tested negative should be re-tested for SARS-CoV-2 again 48 hours prior to discharge. Immunocompetent patients who have tested positive within the previous 90 days, and remain asymptomatic, do not need to be re-tested. The information from the test results, with any supporting care information, must be communicated and transferred to the relevant care home. No one should be discharged from hospital directly to a care home without the involvement of the local authority.</p>

<p>Discharge arrangements may differ between countries, refer to <a href="#resources" class="govuk-link">country specific resources in section 2.1</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Transmission based precautions (<abbr title="transmission based precautions">TBPs</abbr>)</h2>

<p><abbr title="transmission based precautions">TBPs</abbr> are additional measures (to <abbr title="standard infection control precautions">SICPs</abbr>) required when caring for patients/individuals with a known or suspected infection such as COVID-19.</p>

<p><abbr title="transmission based precautions">TBPs</abbr> are based upon the route of transmission and include the following precautions:</p>

<h4>a) Contact precautions</h4>

<p>Used to prevent and control infections that spread via direct contact with the patient or indirectly from the patient’s immediate care environment (including care equipment). This is the most common route of cross-infection transmission. COVID-19 can be spread via this route.</p>

<h4>b) Droplet precautions</h4>

<p>Used to prevent and control infections spread over short distances (at least 3 feet/1 metre) via droplets (&gt;5µm) from the respiratory tract of individuals directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another individual. Droplets penetrate the respiratory system to above the alveolar level. COVID-19 is predominantly spread via this route and the precautionary distance has been maintained at 2 metres in care settings.</p>

<h4>c) Airborne precautions</h4>

<p>Used to prevent and control infection spread without necessarily having close patient contact via aerosols (≤5µm) from the respiratory tract of one individual directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another individual. Aerosols penetrate the respiratory system to the alveolar level. COVID-19 can spread via this route. This can be mitigated by safe systems of work outlined in the hierarchy of controls. <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> increase the risk of spread by the airborne route.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Medium risk pathway – key principles</h2>

<p>This pathway applies to any care facility where:</p>

<p>a) Triaged/clinically assessed individuals are asymptomatic and are waiting a SARS-CoV-2 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>b) Triaged/clinically assessed individuals are asymptomatic with COVID-19 contact/exposure identified.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>c) Testing is not required or feasible on asymptomatic individuals and therefore infectious status is unknown.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>d) Asymptomatic individuals decline testing.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span>Maintaining physical distancing and patient placement</h3>

<p>It is important to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maintain physical distancing of 2 metres at all times (unless the member of staff is wearing appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to provide clinical care) and to advise other patients/visitors to comply</li>
  <li>ensure cohorted patients/individuals are physically separated from each other, for example with screens and privacy curtains between the beds to minimise opportunities for close contact - this should be locally risk assessed to ensure patient safety is not compromised</li>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.3 </span>Safe management of care environment/equipment/blood and body fluids</h3>

<h4>9.3.1 Equipment</h4>

<p>Important considerations in the use of equipment are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>patient care equipment should be single use items where practicable</li>
  <li>reusable (communal) non-invasive equipment should be allocated to an individual patient or cohort of patients/individuals</li>
  <li>all reusable (communal) non-invasive equipment must be decontaminated:
    <ul>
      <li>between each and after patient/individual</li>
      <li>after blood and body fluid contamination</li>
      <li>at regular intervals as part of routine equipment cleaning</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>decontamination of equipment must be performed using either:
    <ul>
      <li>a combined detergent/disinfectant solution at a dilution of 1,000 parts per million available chlorine (ppm av.cl.); or</li>
      <li>a general-purpose neutral detergent in a solution of warm water followed by a disinfectant solution of 1,000ppm av.cl.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>alternative cleaning agents/disinfectant products may be used with agreement of the <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> team/health protection team (<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>)</li>
  <li>cleaning of care equipment as per manufacturer’s guidance/instruction and recommended product ‘contact time’ must be followed for all cleaning/disinfectant solutions/products</li>
  <li>an increased frequency of decontamination should be considered for all reusable non-invasive care equipment when used in isolation/cohort areas</li>
  <li>the use of fans in high and medium risk pathways should be risk assessed - refer to Estates guidance</li>
</ul>

<h4>9.3.2 Environment</h4>

<p>Important considerations for environmental cleaning and disinfection are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cleaning frequencies of the care environment in COVID-19 care areas must be enhanced and single rooms, cohort areas and clinical rooms (including rooms where <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is removed) cleaned at least twice daily</li>
  <li>routine cleaning must be performed using either:
    <ul>
      <li>a combined detergent/disinfectant solution at a dilution of 1,000ppm av.cl.; or</li>
      <li>a general-purpose neutral detergent in a solution of warm water followed by a disinfectant solution of 1,000ppm av.cl</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>alternative cleaning agents/disinfectants may be used with agreement of the local <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> team/<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the increased frequency of decontamination/cleaning should be incorporated into the environmental decontamination schedules for all COVID-19 areas, including where there may be higher environmental contamination rates, including for example:
    <ul>
      <li>toilets/commodes particularly if patients/individuals have diarrhoea</li>
      <li>‘frequently touched’ surfaces such as medical equipment, door/toilet handles, locker tops, patient call bells, over bed tables, bed rails, phones, lift buttons/communal touch points and communication devices (for example, mobile phones, tablets, desktops, keyboards) particularly where these are used by many people, should be cleaned at least twice daily with solution of detergent and 1,000ppm chlorine or an agreed alternative when known to be contaminated with secretions, excretions or body fluids</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>dedicated or disposable equipment (such as mop heads, cloths) must be used for environmental decontamination</li>
  <li>reusable equipment (such as mop handles, buckets) must be decontaminated after use with a chlorine-based disinfectant or locally agreed disinfectant</li>
  <li>single (isolation) rooms must be terminally cleaned as above following resolution of symptoms, discharge or transfer (this includes removal and laundering of all curtains and bed screens)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.4 </span>Aerosol generating procedures (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>): procedures that create a higher risk of respiratory infection transmission</h3>

<p><abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> should only be carried out when essential and only staff who are needed to undertake the procedure should be present, wearing airborne <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>/<abbr title="respiratory protective equipment">RPE</abbr> precautions (see information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#highrisk">high risk pathway guidance</a>).</p>

<h4>9.4.1 Critical care areas</h4>

<p>Droplet precautions apply when within 2 metres and providing direct patient care. Airborne precautions are required when undertaking <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>. However, consideration may need to be given to the application of sessional use of FFP3 masks where the number of cases of suspected/possible COVID-19 requiring <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> increases and patients/individuals cannot be managed in single or isolation rooms that is patient cohort. Sessional use of FFP3 masks (includes eye/face protection) may be considered.  All other items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> (gloves/gown) must be changed between patients and/or after completing a procedure or task.</p>

<h4>9.4.2 Operating theatres</h4>

<p>Patients/individuals should be anaesthetised and recovered in the operating theatre if intubation/extubation (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>) is required. For local, neuraxial or regional anaesthesia the patient is not required to be anaesthetised/recovered in theatre.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.5 </span>Duration of <abbr title="transmission based precautions">TBPs</abbr>
</h3>

<p><abbr title="transmission based precautions">TBPs</abbr> should only be discontinued in consultation with clinicians and should take into consideration the individual’s <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test results and clinical symptoms. If test results are not available (for example the patient/individual declines) <abbr title="transmission based precautions">TBPs</abbr> can be discontinued after 14 days (inpatients) depending on contact exposure and providing the patient/individual remains symptom free.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.6 </span>Visitor guidance</h3>

<p>Visiting may be limited during increases in incidence and prevalence of COVID-19,  however as cases decline and restrictions ease, visitors should be permitted to enter the facility and be educated in the <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures required as outlined in the <a href="#IPCmeasures" class="govuk-link">information on administration measures for the pathways</a>. All visitors should be triaged.</p>

<p>This includes accompanying individuals when attending outpatient appointments, such as antenatal appointments and therapy groups.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.7 </span>Discharge or transfer</h3>

<p>There is no restriction on discharge if the patient/individual is well, unless the patient/individual is entering a long-term facility and testing may be required. If someone in the patient’s household has COVID-19 or is a contact of a COVID-19 case and is self-isolating, the discharge guidance will be provided by the clinician.</p>

<p>Discharge information for patients/individuals should include an understanding of their need for any self-isolation, as well as their family members (where applicable).</p>

<p>Ambulance services and the receiving facilities must be informed of the infectious status of the individual.</p>

<p>Discharge arrangements may differ between countries, refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="#resources">country specific resources in section 2.1</a>.</p>

<p>In England, to ensure testing does not delay a timely discharge to a care home, all patients who have previously tested negative should be re-tested for SARS-CoV-2 again 48 hours prior to discharge. Immunocompetent patients who have tested positive within the previous 90 days, and remain asymptomatic, do not need to be re-tested. The information from the test results, with any supporting care information, must be communicated and transferred to the relevant care home. No one should be discharged from hospital directly to a care home without the involvement of the local authority.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>High risk pathway – key principles</h2>

<p>This pathway applies to any emergency/urgent care facility where:</p>

<p>a) Untriaged individuals present for assessment or treatment (symptoms unknown*).</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>b) Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> positive patients are cared for.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>c) Symptomatic or suspected COVID-19 individuals including those with a history of contact with a COVID-19 case who have been triaged/clinically assessed and are waiting test results.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>d) Symptomatic individuals decline testing.</p>

<p>*Once assessed, if asymptomatic with no contact history, patients/individuals may move to the medium risk pathway awaiting test result.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.1 </span>Patient placement</h3>

<p>If the patient/individual has symptoms or a history of contact/exposure with a case, they should be prioritised for single room isolation or cohorted (if an isolation room is unavailable) until their test results are known, for example use privacy curtains between bed spaces to minimise opportunities for close contact between patients/individuals. This should be locally risk assessed to ensure this does not compromise patient safety.</p>

<p>If single rooms are in short supply, priority should be given to patients with excessive cough and sputum production, diarrhoea or vomiting and to those at high risk/extremely high risk of severe illness.</p>

<p>Local risk assessments and clinical decisions must be made regarding placement of patients/individuals with availability of single rooms taken into consideration.</p>

<p>†<abbr title="fluid resistant surgical face mask">FRSM</abbr> can be worn sessionally (includes eye/face protection) if providing care for COVID -19 cohorted patients/individuals.</p>

<p>††FFP3 can be worn sessionally (includes eye/face protection) in high risk areas where <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> are undertaken for COVID-19 cohorted patients/individuals.</p>

<p>*Consideration may need to be given to the application of airborne precautions where the number of cases of COVID-19 requiring <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> increases and patients/individuals cannot be managed in single or isolation rooms.</p>

<p>**Or if an unacceptable risk of transmission remains following rigorous application of the hierarchy of control, taking these controls into account, it may be necessary to consider the extended use of <abbr title="respiratory protective equipment">RPE</abbr> for patient care in this situation.</p>

<h4>10.2.1 Respiratory protective equipment (<abbr title="respiratory protective equipment">RPE</abbr>)/FFP3 (filtering face piece or hood)</h4>

<p>Respirators are used to prevent inhalation of small airborne particles arising from <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Respirators should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be well fitting, covering both nose and mouth</li>
  <li>always be worn when undertaking an <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> on a COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patient/individual</li>
  <li>not be allowed to dangle around the neck of the wearer or hang from one ear after or between each use</li>
  <li>not be touched once put on</li>
  <li>be removed outside the patient’s/individual’s room or cohort area or COVID-19 ward</li>
  <li>respirators can be single use or single session use (disposable or reusable) and fluid-resistant</li>
  <li>all staff who are required to wear an FFP3 respirator must be fit tested for the relevant model to ensure an adequate seal or fit (according to the manufacturer’s guidance)</li>
  <li>where fit testing fails, suitable alternative equipment must be provided, or the <abbr title="healthcare worker">HCW</abbr> should be moved to an area where FFP3 respirators are not required</li>
  <li>fit checking (according to the manufacturer’s guidance) is necessary when a respirator is put on (donned) to ensure an adequate seal has been achieved</li>
  <li>respirators should be compatible with other facial protection used (protective eyewear) so that this does not interfere with the seal of the respiratory protection</li>
  <li>the respirator should be discarded and replaced and not be subject to continued use if the facial seal is compromised, it is uncomfortable, or it is difficult to breathe through</li>
  <li>reusable respirators can be utilised by individuals if they comply with <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> recommendations - reusable respirators should be decontaminated according to the manufacturer’s instructions</li>
</ul>

<p>Valved respirators are not fluid-resistant unless they are also ‘shrouded’. Valved non-shrouded FFP3 respirators should be worn with a full-face shield if blood or body fluid splashing is anticipated. Valved respirators should not be worn by an <abbr title="healthcare worker">HCW</abbr>/operator when sterility directly over the surgical field is required, for example in theatres/surgical settings or when undertaking a sterile procedure, as the exhaled breath is unfiltered.</p>

<p>Examples of sterile procedures include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any surgical or invasive procedure that routinely requires maximal sterile barrier precautions to prevent infection, for example sterile gowns, sterile gloves, face mask as required for surgical antisepsis/<abbr title="aseptic non-touch technique">ANTT</abbr> - these are commonly but not exclusively undertaken in operating theatres, critical care or emergency departments</li>
  <li>those sterile percutaneous or invasive procedures such as interventional radiology/cardiac catheterisation, <abbr title="peripherally inserted central catheter">PICC</abbr> or other central venous catheter insertions</li>
</ul>

<p>The ongoing use of valved respirators in theatres and surgical settings should be based on a local risk assessment. The risk of an asymptomatic <abbr title="healthcare worker">HCW</abbr> transmitting COVID-19 infection if wearing a valved respirator is considered ‘very small’, as the <abbr title="healthcare worker">HCW</abbr> would need to be excreting virus and the patient would need to be negative for COVID-19 (FFP3 use is when an <abbr title="healthcare worker">HCW</abbr> is managing a suspected/confirmed COVID-19 positive patient undergoing <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> in the medium or high risk pathway).</p>

<h4>10.2.2 Full body gowns or fluid repellent coveralls</h4>

<p>Full body gowns or fluid repellent coveralls must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>worn when there is a risk of extensive splashing of blood and/or body fluids</li>
  <li>worn when undertaking <a href="#AGPs" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr></a>
</li>
  <li>worn when a disposable apron provides inadequate cover for the procedure or task being performed for example, surgery changed between patients/individuals and immediately after completing a procedure or task</li>
</ul>

<p>Sessional or extended use of gowns must be minimised and only used in areas where cohorts of confirmed COVID-19 patients are managed and there is a lack of single rooms/isolation rooms.  If sessional use is required, an individual patient risk assessment must be undertaken and reviewed daily. Gowns are not required when moving around a unit or department.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.3 </span>Safe management of care environment/equipment/blood and body fluids</h3>

<p>Please refer to information given in the <a href="#safemed" class="govuk-link">medium risk pathway</a>.</p>

<p>In addition if there are clusters or outbreaks of COVID-19 (2 or more cases linked by time and place) with significant respiratory symptoms in communal settings cleaning frequencies should be increased.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.4 </span>Aerosol generating procedures (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>): procedures that create a higher risk of respiratory infection transmission and operating theatres</h3>

<h4>10.4.1 Critical care</h4>

<p>Droplet precautions would apply, however consideration may need to be given to the application of airborne precautions where the number of cases of COVID-19 requiring <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> increases and patients/individuals cannot be managed in single or isolation rooms.</p>

<h4>10.4.2 Operating theatres (including day surgery)</h4>

<p>Patients/individuals should be anaesthetised and recovered in the theatre if intubation/extubation (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>) is required using airborne precautions. This is not required for regional, neuraxial or local anaesthesia.</p>

<p>Ventilation in both laminar flow and conventionally ventilated theatres should remain in full operation during surgical procedures where patients/individuals have suspected/confirmed COVID-19. Air passing from operating theatres to adjacent areas will be highly diluted and is not considered to be a risk.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.5 </span>Duration of precautions</h3>

<p>In general, patients with COVID-19 who are admitted to hospital will have more severe disease than those who can remain in the community, especially if they have been severely unwell or have pre-existing conditions such as severe immunosuppression. Therefore, it is recommended that these individuals should be isolated within hospital or remain in self-isolation on discharge for 14 days from their first positive SARS-CoV-2 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test.</p>

<p>Whilst in hospital patients/individuals should remain in isolation/cohort with <abbr title="transmission based precautions">TBPs</abbr> applied for at least 14 days after onset of symptoms and  should be 48 hours without a fever (without use of antipyretic medication) or respiratory symptoms. The decision to modify the duration of, or ‘stand down’ <abbr title="transmission based precautions">TBPs</abbr> (contact/droplet/airborne) should be made by the clinical team managing the individual’s care.</p>

<p>For clinically suspected COVID-19 patients who have tested negative or have not been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and whose condition is severe enough to require hospitalisation, then the 14 day isolation period should be measured from the day of admission.</p>

<p>Testing for virological clearance is encouraged in severely immunosuppressed patients. For these patients, <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures should be continued unless there is evidence of virological clearance prior to discharge or there has been a complete resolution of all symptoms. This is different to other advice sections but reflects the complex health needs of such patients and likelihood for prolonged shedding, with risk of spread in healthcare settings. Upon discharge such patients may be retested at first follow-up appointment to help inform actions at any next medical appointment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.6 </span>Visitor guidance</h3>

<p>In this pathway, visiting should continue to be limited to only essential visitors, for example birthing partner, carer/parent/guardian. Hospitals/organisations will provide advice and guidance to support patients during these restrictions. Visitor guidance may differ between countries, refer to <a href="#resources" class="govuk-link">country specific resources in section 2.1</a>.</p>

<p>Whilst face masks/coverings are recommended the need for visitors to wear additional <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be individually assessed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.7 </span>Discharge or transfer</h3>

<p>Discharge from an inpatient facility can occur when the individual is well enough and the clinician has provided them with discharge such as advice to self-isolate for at least 14 days from the date of the positive SARS-CoV-2 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test (providing their symptoms resolve during this period). Refer to <a href="#resources" class="govuk-link">country specific resources in section 2.1</a>.</p>

<p>Advice should include written information, such as patients with a cough or a loss of, or change in, normal sense of smell or taste (anosmia), may persist in some individuals for several weeks following COVID-19 recovery, and is not currently considered an indication of ongoing infection when other symptoms have resolved.</p>

<p>Prior to discharge (if the patient is within the 14 days) clinicians  should ascertain  if there are any clinically extremely vulnerable  individuals who live in the household and are currently not infected. If so, it is highly advisable for patients to be discharged to a different home until they have finished their self-isolation period. If these individuals cannot be moved to a different household, then ensure that the discharged patient is advised on <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures as outlined in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">Stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Advice on ongoing medical needs should be provided for patients who are discharged within their self-isolation period. If patients deteriorate at home or in a care setting, they or their carer should seek advice from <a href="https://111.nhs.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">NHS 111 online</a> or by telephone, or through pre-existing services such as GP practice links with care homes. In an emergency, 999 should be called. In either case, they should inform the call attendant that they have been recently discharged from hospital with confirmed COVID-19.</p>

<p>Discharge information for patients/individuals to their own home should include an understanding of their need for any self-isolation, as well as their family/household members.</p>

<p>Ambulance services and the receiving facilities must be informed of the infectious status of the individual and the ongoing need to continue with infection control precautions.</p>

<p>Discharge arrangements may differ between countries as discharge to other areas is dependent on testing and/or isolation facilities available. Refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="#resources">country specific resources in section 2.1</a>.</p>

<p>In England, to ensure testing does not delay a timely discharge to a care home, patients who have tested negative should be re-tested for SARS-CoV-2 again 48 hours prior to discharge. All SARS-CoV-2 positive patients who are discharged within their 14 day self-isolation period will need to be discharged to a designated setting. The information from the test results, with any supporting care information, must be communicated and transferred to the relevant care home. No one should be discharged from hospital directly to a care home without the involvement of the local authority.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Occupational health and staff deployment</h2>

<p>Prompt recognition of cases of COVID-19 among healthcare staff is essential to limit the spread.</p>

<p>Health and social care staff with symptoms of COVID-19 or a positive COVID-19 test result should not come to work. Refer to country specific testing requirements.</p>

<p>As a general principle, healthcare staff who provide care in settings for suspected or confirmed patients/individuals should not care for other patients. However, this has to be a local decision based on local epidemiology and the configuration of the organisation.</p>

<p>A risk assessment is required for health and social care staff at high risk of complications from COVID-19, or clinically extremely vulnerable groups, including pregnant and <abbr title="Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic">BAME</abbr> staff. Guidance on carrying out risk assessments can be found by following the links to the <a class="govuk-link" href="#resources">country specific resources in section 2.1</a>.</p>

<p>Employers should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>discuss with employees who are clinically extremely vulnerable, including those who are pregnant and of <abbr title="Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic">BAME</abbr> origin, the need to be deployed away from areas used for the care of those who have, or are clinically suspected of having, COVID-19; or, in primary care settings, clinics set up to manage people with COVID-19 symptoms</li>
  <li>ensure that advice is available to all health and social care staff, including specific advice to those at risk from complications</li>
</ul>

<p>Bank, agency and locum staff who fall into these categories should follow the same deployment advice as permanent staff.</p>

<p>As part of their employer’s duty of care, providers have a role to play in ensuring that staff understand and are adequately trained in safe systems of working, including donning and doffing of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. A fit testing programme should be in place for those who may need to wear respiratory protection.</p>

<p>In the event of a breach in infection control procedures, staff should be reviewed by occupational health.</p>

<p>Occupational health departments should lead on the implementation of systems to monitor staff illness, absence and vaccination against COVID-19.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Glossary of terms</h2>

<h4>Aerosol generating procedures (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>)</h4>
<p>Certain medical and patient care activities that can result in the release of airborne particles (aerosols). <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> can increase the risk transmission of infections.</p>

<h4>Airborne transmission</h4>
<p>The spread of infection from one person to another by airborne particles (aerosols) containing infectious agents.</p>

<h4>Airborne particles</h4>
<p>Very small particles that may contain infectious agents. They can remain in the air for long periods of time and can be carried over long distances by air currents. Airborne particles can be released when a person coughs or sneezes, and during <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>. ‘Droplet nuclei’ are aerosols formed from the evaporation of larger droplet particles (see droplet transmission). Aerosols formed from droplet particles in this way behave as other aerosols.</p>

<h4>Airborne precautions</h4>
<p>Measures used to prevent and control infection spread without necessarily having close patient contact via aerosols (less than or equal to 5μm) from the respiratory tract of one individual directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another individual. Aerosols can penetrate the respiratory system to the alveolar level.</p>

<h4>BS/EN standards</h4>
<p>Mandatory technical specifications created by either the British Standards Institute (BS) or European Standardisation Organisations (EN) in collaboration with government bodies, industry experts and trade associations. They aim to ensure the quality and safety of products, services and systems.</p>

<h4>Clinically vulnerable or extremely clinically vulnerable</h4>

<p>People who are defined as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19#cev">clinically extremely vulnerable</a> are at very high risk of severe illness from COVID-19.  Those included in this category will been identified by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>having one or more of conditions list, or</li>
  <li>a clinician or GP has added the individual to the Shielded Patient List</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cohort area</h4>
<p>An area (room, bay, ward) in which 2 or more patients (a cohort) with the same confirmed infection are placed. A cohort area should be physically separate from other patients.</p>

<h4>Contact precautions</h4>
<p>Measures used to prevent and control infections that spread via direct contact with the patient or indirectly from the patient’s immediate care environment (including care equipment). This is the most common route of infection transmission.</p>

<h4>Contact transmission</h4>
<p>Contact transmission is the most common route of transmission, and consists of 2 distinct types: direct contact and indirect contact. Direct transmission occurs when microorganisms are transmitted directly from an infectious individual to another individual without the involvement of another contaminated person or object (fomite). Indirect transmission occurs when microorganisms are transmitted from an infectious individual to another individual through a contaminated object (fomite) or person.</p>

<h4>COVID-19</h4>
<p>COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The disease was discovered in China in December 2019 and has since spread around the world.</p>

<h4>Droplet precautions</h4>
<p>Measures used to prevent and control infections spread over short distances (at least 1 metre or 3 feet) via droplets (greater than 5μm) from the respiratory tract of one individual directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another individual. Droplets penetrate the respiratory system to above the alveolar level. COVID-19  is predominantly spread via this route and the precautionary distance has been maintained at 2 metres in care settings.</p>

<h4>Droplet transmission</h4>
<p>The spread of infection from one person to another by droplets containing infectious agents.</p>

<h4>Eye or face protection</h4>
<p>Worn when there is a risk from splashing of secretion (including respiratory secretions). Eye or face protection can be achieved using any one of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a surgical mask with integrated visor</li>
  <li>a full face visor or shield</li>
  <li>goggles</li>
</ul>

<h4>Fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical face mask (<abbr title="fluid resistant surgical face mask">FRSM</abbr>)</h4>
<p>A disposable fluid-resistant mask worn over the nose and mouth to protect the mucous membranes of the wearer’s nose and mouth from splashes and infectious droplets. FRSMs can also be used to protect patients.  When recommended for infection control purposes a ‘surgical face mask’ typically denotes a fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask.</p>

<h4>Fluid-resistant</h4>
<p>A term applied to fabrics that resist liquid penetration, often used interchangeably with ‘fluid-repellent’ when describing the properties of protective clothing or equipment.</p>
