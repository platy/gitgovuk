<p><abbr title="standard infection control precautions">SICPs</abbr> are the basic <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures necessary to reduce the risk of transmitting infectious agents from both recognised and unrecognised sources of infection and are required across all COVID-19 pathways. Sources of (potential) infection include blood and other body fluids secretions or excretions (excluding sweat), non-intact skin or mucous membranes and any equipment or items in the care environment that could have become contaminated.</p>

<p>The application of <abbr title="standard infection control precautions">SICPs</abbr> during care delivery is determined by an assessment of risk to and from individuals and includes the task, level of interaction and/or the anticipated level of exposure to blood and/or other body fluids.</p>

<p><abbr title="standard infection control precautions">SICPs</abbr> must therefore be used by all staff, in all care settings, at all times and for all patients/individuals, whether infection is known or not, to ensure the safety of patients/individuals, staff and visitors. This section highlights the key measures for the COVID-19 pathways. Please refer to the practice guide* for additional information on the other elements which remain unchanged.</p>

<p>The elements of <abbr title="standard infection control precautions">SICPs</abbr> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>patient placement and assessment for infection risk (screening/triaging/testing)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hand hygiene</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>respiratory and cough hygiene</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>personal protective equipment (see below)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>safe management of the care environment (see below)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>safe management of care equipment (see below)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>safe management of healthcare linen</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>safe management of blood and body fluids</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>safe disposal of waste (including sharps)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>occupational safety: prevention and exposure management</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>maintaining social/physical distancing (new <abbr title="standard infection control precaution">SICP</abbr> due to COVID-19)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>*Practice guides and literature reviews to support <abbr title="standard infection control precautions">SICPs</abbr> can be found for England and Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr>)</h2>

<p>For the purpose of this document, the term ‘personal protective equipment’ is used to describe products that are either <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> or medical devices that are approved by the Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) as protective solutions in managing the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Local or <a rel="external" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/about/equality/equality-hub/uniforms-and-workwear/" class="govuk-link">national uniform policies</a> should be considered when wearing <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<h3>All <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> should be:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>located close to the point of use (where this does not compromise patient safety, for example, mental health/learning disabilities). In domiciliary care <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> must be transported in a clean receptacle</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>stored safely and in a clean, dry area to prevent contamination</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>within expiry date (or had the quality assurance checks prior to releasing stock outside this date)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>single use unless specified by the manufacturer or as agreed for extended/sessional use including surgical facemasks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>changed immediately after each patient and/or after completing a procedure or task (unless sessional use has been agreed and local risk assessment undertaken)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>disposed into the correct waste stream depending on setting, for example domestic waste/offensive (non-infectious) or infectious clinical waste</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>discarded if damaged or contaminated</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>safely doffed (removed) to avoid self-contamination. Refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-use-for-aerosol-generating-procedures">guidance on donning (putting on) and doffing (removing)</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>decontaminated after each use following manufactures guidance if reusable <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> is used, specifically non-disposable goggles/face shields/visors</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Gloves must:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>be worn when exposure to blood and/or other body fluids, non-intact skin or mucous membranes is anticipated or likely<sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be changed immediately after each patient and/or after completing a procedure/task even on the same patient</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be put on immediately before performing an invasive procedure and removed on completion</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>not be decontaminated with alcohol based hand rub (<abbr title="alcohol based hand rub">ABHR</abbr>) or soap between use</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>NB. Double gloving is not recommended for routine clinical care of COVID-19 cases.</p>

<h3>Aprons must be:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>worn to protect uniform or clothes when contamination is anticipated or likely</p>
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>changed between patients and/or after completing a procedure or task</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Full body gowns or fluid repellent coveralls must be:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>worn when there is a risk of extensive splashing of blood and/or body fluids</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>worn when undertaking aerosol generating procedures</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>worn when a disposable apron provides inadequate cover for the procedure or task being performed (surgical procedures)</p>

    <p>not be impeded by accessories such as piercings or false eyelashes</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<h3>Fluid resistant surgical face mask (<abbr title="fluid resistant surgical face mask">FRSM</abbr> Type IIR) masks must:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>be worn with eye protection if splashing or spraying of blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions onto the respiratory mucosa (nose and mouth) is anticipated or likely</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be worn when providing direct care within 2 metres of a suspected/confirmed COVID-19 case</p>
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be replaced if damaged, visibly soiled, damp, uncomfortable or difficult to breathe through</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Surgical face masks Type II must be:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>worn for extended use by healthcare workers when entering the hospital or care setting (Type IIR is also suitable). Type I are suitable in some settings, refer to the resource section for country specific guidance</li>
</ul>

<h3>Head/footwear</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>headwear is not routinely required in clinical areas (even if undertaking an AGP) unless part of theatre attire or to prevent contamination of the environment such as in clean rooms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>headwear worn for religious reasons (for example, turban, kippot veil, headscarves) are permitted provided patient safety is not compromised. These must be washed and/or changed between each shift or immediately if contaminated and comply with additional attire in, for example, theatres</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>foot/shoe coverings are not required or recommended for the care of COVID-19 cases</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>NB. <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> may restrict communication with some individuals and other ways of communicating to meet their needs should be considered.</p>
