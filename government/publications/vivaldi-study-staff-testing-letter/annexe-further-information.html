<h2>Testing for staff in Vivaldi study care homes</h2>

<p>All staff in care homes that are participating in the Vivaldi study should take a lateral flow test (<abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr>) before the start of every shift.</p>

<p>They should also take a weekly polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) test, ideally on the same day each week.</p>

<h2>Why Vivaldi study care homes are retaining <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing for staff</h2>

<p>Homes participating in the Vivaldi study are retaining regular <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests as these provide additional data which is necessary for scientific research and is not available from <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr>.</p>

<p>For example, additional data can be obtained from <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing to measure how infectious an individual is likely to have been at the time of their test.</p>

<p>The majority of positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests are also sent for whole genomic sequencing, which provides data on the genomic code of the virus which infected that individual, helping to identify which variant of coronavirus (COVID-19) caused the infection.</p>

<p>This data allows the study team to undertake research to explore scientific questions such as how well the vaccines work at preventing infections for people who live and work in care homes, how effective vaccination is at reducing the spread of infection, and whether future boosters may be required to protect against COVID-19.</p>

<p>This research is vital in helping inform government policy in order to protect staff and residents in care homes from COVID-19.</p>

<p>All data from individuals who are participating in Vivaldi is held anonymously, and it is not possible for the scientific team to identify any individuals from their test results.</p>

<p>Please note that staff are not obliged to take a weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test if they do not wish to do so.</p>

<h2>Actions for staff who receive a positive <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> result</h2>

<p>You should self-isolate immediately.</p>

<p>You should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings#guidance-for-health-and-social-care-staff-on-covid-19-symptoms-test-results-and-being-identified-as-a-contact-of-a-case">management of staff and exposed patients or residents in health and social care settings guidance</a> on ending your isolation period.</p>

<h2>Actions for staff who receive a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> result</h2>

<p>You should self-isolate immediately and follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings#guidance-for-health-and-social-care-staff-on-covid-19-symptoms-test-results-and-being-identified-as-a-contact-of-a-case">management of staff and exposed patients or residents in health and social care settings guidance</a> on ending your isolation period.</p>

<p>You should not take another <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test until 90 days after you tested positive unless an exemption applies (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings#repeat-testing-for-covid-19">see guidance</a>), however, you should restart your daily pre-shift <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> after your isolation period.</p>

<h2>Actions for staff who receive different <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> results</h2>

<h3>Positive <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> and negative <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If your <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> test is positive and your <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> is negative it is likely that your <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> may be a false negative.</p>

<p>You should self-isolate immediately and follow the management of staff and exposed patients or residents in health and social care settings guidance on ending your isolation period.</p>

<h3>Negative <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> and positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If your <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> is negative and your <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> is positive, it is likely that you have COVID-19 but that the virus was not picked up on your <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr>.</p>

<p>You should self-isolate immediately, and follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings#guidance-for-health-and-social-care-staff-on-covid-19-symptoms-test-results-and-being-identified-as-a-contact-of-a-case">management of staff and exposed patients or residents in health and social care settings guidance</a> on ending your isolation period.</p>

<p>If you had previously tested positive with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test in the 90 days before this <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> result, you should disregard this new, positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> result. This is because it is possible that you would continue to test positive with <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests after your infection.</p>

<p>Do not resume taking <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests until 90 days after your first positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, and continue to take only regular pre-shift <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> until this point, unless you develop new COVID-19 symptoms.</p>

<h2>Ordering tests for your care home</h2>

<p>Continue to order your <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr>, <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests and outer return boxes in bulk from the online portal. The number of <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> provided in your orders will be increased to reflect the change in policy to daily orders.</p>

<h2>Outbreak testing</h2>

<p>Outbreak testing will remain unchanged.</p>

<p>If your care home has one or more positive cases (or multiple symptomatic individuals), please follow the outbreak testing guidance and contact your Health Protection Team (<abbr title="Health Protection Team">HPT</abbr>) for advice.</p>

<p>One positive test result may be the first sign of an outbreak, so you should also contact your <abbr title="Health Protection Team">HPT</abbr> for advice in this instance.</p>

<p>Staff should continue their regular <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing during an outbreak, as well as their new asymptomatic regular testing regime of daily lateral flow testing.</p>
