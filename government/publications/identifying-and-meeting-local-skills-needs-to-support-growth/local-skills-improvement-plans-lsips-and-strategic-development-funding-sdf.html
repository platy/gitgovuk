<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/skills-for-jobs-lifelong-learning-for-opportunity-and-growth">skills for jobs white paper</a> set out the government’s blueprint for reshaping the technical skills system to better meet the needs of employers and the wider economy.</p>

<p>As part of this new approach, the Department for Education has introduced local skills improvement plans (<abbr title="local skills improvement plans">LSIPs</abbr>) and a strategic development fund (<abbr title="strategic development fund">SDF</abbr>).</p>

<h2>Local skills improvement plans</h2>

<p><abbr title="local skills improvement plans">LSIPs</abbr> will provide an agreed set of actionable priorities that employers, providers and stakeholders in a local area can get behind to drive change.</p>

<p><abbr title="local skills improvement plans">LSIPs</abbr> will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>place employers at the heart of local skills systems</li>
  <li>facilitate direct and dynamic working arrangements between employers and providers</li>
</ul>

<p>We are in the process of rolling out <abbr title="local skills improvement plans">LSIPs</abbr> and employer representative bodies have been designated to lead the development of <abbr title="local skills improvement plans">LSIPs</abbr> from 5 September 2022.</p>

<p>Once the programme is fully rolled out, there will be 38 <abbr title="local skills improvement plans">LSIPs</abbr> covering the whole of England.</p>

<h3>The role of designated ERBs</h3>

<p>Designated ERBs will work closely with employers, providers and key stakeholders to develop evidence-based, credible, and actionable <abbr title="local skills improvement plans">LSIPs</abbr>. Each plan will set out the key changes needed in a local area to make technical skills training more responsive to employers’ needs.</p>

<p>The plans will help people to develop the skills they need to get good jobs and increase prospects.</p>

<p>It is our expectation that by being employer-led, <abbr title="local skills improvement plans">LSIPs</abbr> will be uniquely placed to highlight the skills employers need most in the workplace but may be struggling to find locally. Following their publication, <abbr title="local skills improvement plans">LSIPs</abbr> will be reviewed regularly to ensure they remain up to date and relevant.</p>

<p>Further information on the process for developing and reviewing a plan is set out in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-skills-improvement-plans">statutory guidance on local skills improvement plans</a>.</p>

<p>DfE will run a redesignation process and review the geographies for <abbr title="local skills improvement plans">LSIPs</abbr> periodically.</p>

<h3>LSIP trailblazers</h3>

<p>In the 2021 to 2022 financial year we ran <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/skills-accelerator-trailblazers-and-pilots">8 LSIP trailblazer pilots</a> that enabled us to test how employers, providers and local stakeholders can work together effectively to develop a LSIP.</p>

<p>The ongoing independent evaluation of the trailblazers, alongside wider stakeholder engagement and evidence, has informed the development of the LSIP statutory guidance and our approach to national rollout.</p>

<h3>Getting involved with your LSIP</h3>

<p>Having a single designated <abbr title="employer representative body">ERB</abbr> leading the development of a LSIP for each specified area in the country will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make it easier for employers to navigate the system,</li>
  <li>help drive up engagement</li>
  <li>enable employers to build stronger relationships with their local providers</li>
</ul>

<p>We encourage businesses to contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/designated-employer-representative-bodies">designated <abbr title="employer representative body">ERB</abbr></a> for their area if they would like to be involved.</p>

<h3>Milestones for LSIP rollout</h3>

<p><strong>Autumn 2022</strong>: the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-skills-improvement-plans">statutory guidance on local skills improvement plans</a> will be updated.</p>

<p><strong>Summer 2023</strong>: we expect most of the country will have a LSIP developed and approved by the Secretary of State.</p>

<p><strong>March 2025</strong>: plans will be drawn up for an initial period up to March 2025. ERBs will work with partners to regularly review and update their LSIP to ensure it remains relevant.</p>

<h2>Strategic development fund</h2>

<p>The&nbsp;strategic development fund&nbsp;provides capital and programme funding to enable <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> providers in an area to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>support changes in local teaching and training facilities and provision so as to better meet the needs of employers, as set out in <abbr title="local skills improvement plans">LSIPs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>support local innovation and economic growth</li>
  <li>develop a more efficient overall delivery infrastructure</li>
</ul>

<h3>What the funding is for</h3>

<p>The purpose of the fund is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>support providers across an area to upgrade their facilities, equipment and curriculum to better meet the needs of their local economy</li>
  <li>enable colleges and other&nbsp;<abbr title="further education">FE</abbr>&nbsp;providers to build their overall capacity to meet local skills priorities, and to drive more effective and efficient use of funds through a more coordinated&nbsp;<abbr title="further education">FE</abbr>&nbsp;offer</li>
  <li>support ongoing&nbsp;<abbr title="further education">FE</abbr>&nbsp;provider quality improvement through&nbsp;<abbr title="further education">FE</abbr>&nbsp;workforce training, developing sector-led approaches to peer-to-peer support, sharing good practice, including two-way industry exchanges with&nbsp;<abbr title="further education">FE</abbr>&nbsp;providers</li>
  <li>stimulate employer demand for and investment in skills leading to more sustainable provision, including by raising awareness about new technologies and driving the adoption of innovation in local businesses, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises</li>
</ul>

<h3>Funding awarded</h3>

<p>In 2021 the strategic development fund was trialled in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/skills-accelerator-trailblazers-and-pilots/skills-accelerator-local-skills-improvement-plan-trailblazers-and-strategic-development-fund-pilots">18 areas across England</a>.</p>

<p>In spring 2022 the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/skills-accelerator-apply-now">strategic development fund (<abbr title="strategic development fund">SDF</abbr>)</a> was opened to collaborations of further education (<abbr title="further education">FE</abbr>) providers across England.</p>

<p>All areas of England applied for and received funding in the second strategic development fund round, with a total of £92 million <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/strategic-development-fund-awards-2022-to-2023">funding awarded in the 2022 to 2023 financial year</a>.</p>

<p>Strategic development funding arrangements for the 2023 to 2024 financial year will be confirmed in due course.</p>
