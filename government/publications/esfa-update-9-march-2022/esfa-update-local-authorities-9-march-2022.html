<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Information: carry over of unspent school improvement monitoring and brokering (SIMB) grant to 2022 to 2023 financial year</h2>

<p>To support the transition away from school improvement monitoring and brokering (SIMB) grant funding for core school improvement responsibilities, local authorities will be able to carry-over any unspent 2021 to 2022 SIMB grant to spend on their core school improvement responsibilities in financial year 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p>The conditions of the grant, which are set out in the grant determination letter, remain unchanged. The Secretary of State retains the option to seek repayment of any SIMB grant funds that remain unspent at the end of financial year 2022 to 2023.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Information: teachers’ pay grant (TPG) and teachers’ pensions employer contribution grant (TPECG) - arrangements for 16 to 19 and early years from April 2022</h2>

<p>Since 2021 to 2022 the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-pay-grant-methodology/teachers-pay-grant-methodology">TPG</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-pension-employer-contribution-grant-tpecg/pension-grant-methodology">TPECG</a> funding for reception to year 11 provision has been paid through the national funding formula, and therefore been part of core monthly funding since April 2021 (schools) and September 2021 (academies).</p>

<p>Separate grants, however, continued to be paid in respect of early years and 16 to 19 provision.</p>

<p>From 2022 to 2023 academic year the TPG funding for 16 to 19 provision will be paid through the 16 to 19 core funding formula. A separate grant will continue for 16 to 19 TPECG.</p>

<p>Separate grants will also continue for early years TPG and TPECG.</p>

<p>To summarise:</p>

<p>Beyond 2022 to 2023 we intend to continue to simplify the allocation of this funding, by continuing the process of rolling this funding into core allocations. We will provide information on how we intend to do that in due course.</p>
