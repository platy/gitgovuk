<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Action: submit your school resource management self-assessment checklist</h2>

<p>This is a final reminder that the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-resource-management-self-assessment-tool">school resource management self-assessment checklist</a> is now open for academy trusts to complete and return by Tuesday 15 March 2022.</p>

<p>All academy trusts with an open academy on 31 December 2020 must submit a checklist return.</p>

<p>Please note that the Excel version of the dashboard has been replaced with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://schools-financial-benchmarking.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">schools financial benchmarking dashboard</a>. The SRM self-assessment checklist is not specific on the data to be used for benchmarking and it is also an annual return. This means that trusts can do their benchmarking at any time in the 12 months prior to completing the checklist, with the most relevant data they have available at that time.</p>

<p>The list of checklist questions that were included in the tool can now be found in the checklist support notes on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/school-resource-management-self-assessment-checklist">school resource management self-assessment checklist</a> webpage.</p>
