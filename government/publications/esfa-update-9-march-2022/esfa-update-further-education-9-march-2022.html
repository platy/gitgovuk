<span class="number">1. </span>Reminder: application deadline for the incentive payment for hiring a new apprentice</h2>

<p>Do you work with employers who hired a new apprentice between 1 October 2021 and 31 January 2022?</p>

<p>If these apprentices have an apprenticeship start date between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2022, employers could be eligible for the £3,000 incentive payment for hiring a new apprentice.</p>

<p>Employers must log into their Apprenticeship Service accounts to apply for the incentive payment. Applications close 15 May 2022.</p>

<p>Share these resources with employers to support their application:</p>

<span class="number">2. </span>Information: third cycle for higher technical qualifications announced</h2>

<p>The application window for the third cycle of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/higher-technical-qualifications/approvals-process-and-timelines/" rel="external">Higher Technical Qualifications</a> (HTQs) approvals process has now opened.</p>

<p>The government announced <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/major-overhaul-of-higher-technical-education-announced">plans in 2020 to drive up the quality of level 4 and 5 qualifications</a> and make it far easier for employers and learners to identify which training programmes meet their skills needs.</p>

<p>A keyway of doing this will be through HTQs. Approved qualifications will be set apart from other qualifications by a government backed quality mark.</p>

<span class="number">3. </span>Information: teachers’ pay grant (TPG) and teachers’ pensions employer contribution grant (TPECG) - arrangements for 16 to 19 and early years from April 2022</h2>

<p>Since 2021 to 2022 the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-pay-grant-methodology/teachers-pay-grant-methodology">TPG</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-pension-employer-contribution-grant-tpecg/pension-grant-methodology">TPECG</a> funding for reception to year 11 provision has been paid through the national funding formula, and therefore been part of core monthly funding since April 2021 (schools) and September 2021 (academies).</p>

<p>Separate grants, however, continued to be paid in respect of early years and 16 to 19 provision.</p>

<p>From 2022 to 2023 academic year the TPG funding for 16 to 19 provision will be paid through the 16 to 19 core funding formula. A separate grant will continue for 16 to 19 TPECG.</p>

<p>Separate grants will also continue for early years TPG and TPECG.</p>

<p>To summarise:</p>

<p>Beyond 2022 to 2023 we intend to continue to simplify the allocation of this funding, by continuing the process of rolling this funding into core allocations. We will provide information on how we intend to do that in due course.</p>

<span class="number">5. </span>Information: reform of basic digital skills qualifications – Level 2 ICT functional skills and ICT users’ qualifications at level 2</h2>

<p>From 1 August 2022, we will remove funding approval from some information and communication technology (ICT) qualifications at level 2. We are doing this as part of the Department for Education’s work to reform essential digital skills.</p>

<p>We have published an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/level-2-information-and-communication-technology-ict-user-and-level-2-functional-skills-qualifications-in-ict-with-removed-funding-approval-from-1-a">initial list of ICT qualifications that are in scope for removed funding approval</a>. These are Functional Skills Qualifications (FSQs) in ICT at level 2 and ICT for Users level 2 qualifications.</p>

<p>Awarding organisations with ICT for Users qualifications on the initial list may appeal the decision to remove funding approval, but not for FSQs. You can find details and timelines for the appeals process on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/level-2-information-and-communication-technology-ict-user-and-level-2-functional-skills-qualifications-in-ict-with-removed-funding-approval-from-1-a">ESFA Qualifications and public funding page</a>.</p>

<p>We will publish the final list of qualifications with removed funding approval before the end of March 2022.</p>

These allocations will include funding to cover the carry in costs of learners who started on or before 31 March 2020.  From 1 April 2021, all new apprenticeship starts will be funded via the Apprenticeship Service.</p>

<span class="number">7. </span>Your feedback: IfATE apprentice survey</h2>

<p>The Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (IfATE) apprentice panel wants to hear from apprentices all across the country in their apprenticeship survey. This is a chance to have apprentices’ voices heard and to help make apprenticeships even better.</p>

<p>This is a short survey and should take about 10 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>This <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/reviews-and-consultations/apprentice-panel-survey/?utm_source=ESFA&amp;utm_medium=update&amp;utm_campaign=app_survey" rel="external">survey is open to any apprentice</a> who is on or has completed an apprenticeship standard. The survey will close on 8 April 2022.</p>
