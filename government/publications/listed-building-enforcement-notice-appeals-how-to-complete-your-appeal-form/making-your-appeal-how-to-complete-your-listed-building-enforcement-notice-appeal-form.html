<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>Before you make your appeal, you should enter into discussions with the local planning authority (<abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr>).   We encourage you to continue these discussions, during the appeal. This will help to narrow the areas in dispute.</p>

<p>You should make your appeal only when all else has failed.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Before you make an appeal</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Deadlines</h3>

<p>Written notice of an appeal against a listed building enforcement notice <em>must</em> be received by us <em>before</em> the effective date of the notice. The effective date will be on the notice. We cannot accept any appeals received after this date. You should not wait until the last few days to submit your appeal.</p>

<p>Before you decide to appeal, please carefully consider the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr>’s reasons for serving the enforcement notice on you. These are set out on the enforcement notice.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> will serve an enforcement notice on you when it considers you have not complied with planning rules and regulations. Normally a listed building enforcement notice may be issued by the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> where it appears to it that demolition or works to alter or extend a listed building without the required listed building consent have been carried out. Or, if there has been a failure to comply with any condition attached to a listed building consent.</p>

<p>Examples of the types of alteration or extension which would normally require listed building consent are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an extension to a building whether or not it is within the permitted development limits of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/596/contents/made" rel="external">Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>alterations such as the removal and replacement of doors and windows</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>alterations to the interior fabric of a listed building</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Who can appeal?</h3>

<p>To make an appeal against an enforcement notice, you must either have an <strong>interest</strong> in or be a <strong>relevant occupier</strong> of the building the enforcement notice relates to.</p>

<p>‘Interest’ means either a legal or equitable interest in the building when the appeal is made (irrespective of your status when the enforcement notice was served). This includes but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Owners</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lessees</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some tenants</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Official receivers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mortgagees or other lenders</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A ‘relevant occupier’ is someone who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>on the date on the date on which the enforcement notice is issued occupies the land through the consent of the owner whether oral, written or implied</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and continues to occupy the building when the appeal is made.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A person who does not have an interest in the building or is not a relevant occupier does not have a right of appeal – even if the local planning authority serves a copy of the enforcement notice on them. Similarly, a person that has not been served with a copy of the notice may be eligible to make an appeal.</p>

<p>A limited company or unincorporated body can have a legal interest in the building or be a relevant occupier. If this is the case the appeal must be made in the name of the company. A director or shareholder, or in the case of an unincorporated body their authorised representative, does not have the right of appeal on the company’s behalf. Although they can act as agent to the appellant company.</p>

<p>For further information on eligibility please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enforcement-appeals-procedural-guide/procedural-guide-enforcement-notice-appeals-england#before-making-an-appeal">2.3 of our Enforcement Appeals Procedural Guide.</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Application for appeal costs</h3>

<p>You and the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> normally must meet your own appeal expenses.</p>

<p>If a party does not behave reasonably during the appeal process, they leave themselves open to costs being awarded against them.  This would be on the basis that the behaviour had directly caused another party to incur expenses that would not otherwise have been necessary.</p>

<p>Costs may be awarded in response to an application for costs by one of the parties.  Also, the Inspector may make an award of costs even if none of the parties have made an application.</p>

<p>There is guidance about costs awards in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities’ (<abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities'">DLUHC</abbr>) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/appeals">planning practice guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Before you appeal, it is important that you read this guidance because it explains how, and on what basis you can make an application or have an application made against you.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Completing the appeal form</h2>

<p>Once you have logged into your account, start the appeal process by clicking on ‘Make a new appeal’.</p>

<p>In this section, we use the same headers as within the appeal form.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Enter the name of your local planning authority</h3>

<p>Here you should type in the name of your local planning authority.  As you type, possible matches will be returned.  You can then select the correct one from the list. Note you cannot change your local authority once you are in the appeal form.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Selecting your appeal form</h3>

<p>You will be asked a series of questions about your appeal; with each answer you give determining the next question.  You may need to consult the enforcement notice.</p>

<p>If you want to make an appeal in relation to more than one enforcement notice or in relation to an application for listed building consent, you must make a separate appeal for each.</p>

<p>If you believe that you may have selected the wrong from, please select the ‘Restart’ button to begin the appeals process again.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Meaningful name</h3>

<p>This name will be used to identify this appeal on your personal homepage.  Please use a name that clearly identifies the appeal to you, for example, the first line of the site address.  This is particularly important if you are an agent who may be dealing with multiple cases.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Appellant details</h3>

<p>The details registered to your account will be displayed. If for any reason your details have changed since you created your account, you should change them through the ‘My Details’ link at the top of the page.</p>

<p>If you are an unrepresented appellant and you prefer to be contacted by email, where possible, we will send you our letters and appeals correspondence by email and we will not send paper copies.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span>Agent details</h3>

<p>You do not have to employ an agent to handle your appeal.  If you decide to employ an agent, they will probably complete the appeal form for you.</p>

<p>If you have an agent, we will send all our communications to them.  We will not send a copy to you.  The only exception to this is that we will send you and your agent a copy of the appeal decision.  You should ensure that you keep in touch with your agent about the appeal arrangements, particularly times and dates for site visits, hearings or inquiries.</p>

<p>If you prefer to be contacted by email, where possible, we will send you our letters and appeals correspondence by email and we will not send paper copies.</p>

<p>If you are the agent completing the form, by selecting ‘No’ to the question ‘Are you the appellant?’ the details registered to your account will be displayed on the Agent Details section of the form.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span>Local planning authority details</h3>

<p>This information should be on the listed building enforcement notice.</p>

<p>The name of the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> and relevant details of the enforcement notice will have transferred through to the form from when you entered it at the start of the process. If you need to change the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr>, you will need to restart from your homepage.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.7 </span>Appeal site details</h3>

<p>The appeal site must be the same as the site given in the listed building enforcement notice.</p>

<p>If you confirm that the address of the affected building is the same as the appellant’s address, then this information will transfer over from the Appellant Details section (provided you have completed the Appellant Details section before the Appeal Site Details section).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.8 </span>Does the appeal relate to an existing property?</h3>

<p>If the address of the affected building is not the same as the appellant’s address you will be asked an extra question about whether the appeal relates to an existing property.  If it does, you can use the address finder to complete your details quickly.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.9 </span>Postcode</h3>

<p>If the appeal site does not have a postcode, please provide the postcode of the nearest building.  Also please provide information to help us identify the site for example, a map or plan showing the site and at least 2 named or numbered local roads or a grid reference or you can enter the street name into <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.royalmail.com/find-a-postcode" rel="external">Royal Mail post code finder</a> to generate a postcode.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.10 </span>Health and safety at the site</h3>

<p>The site is likely to be inspected during the course of the appeal and the Inspector needs to be made aware of any potential problems.</p>

<p>We take seriously our duties regarding the health and safety of our employees and those affected by our work.  Inspectors may abort the site visit if the conditions on site are unsatisfactory.  Failure to provide the necessary information may therefore result in a delay to your appeal.</p>

<p>The following questions indicate the type of information we need about the appeal site, such as the condition of the land or any building to be entered.  Please note that the questions do not actually feature on the appeal form.  The information should be supplied within the free text field underneath the Health and Safety question.</p>

<p>Will the Inspector be expected to wear Personal Protection Equipment? Please give details.</p>

<p>Are any building works or other operations taking place on the site?  If it is a workplace, is there a risk assessment in place for visitors?</p>

<p>Are there any animals (For example, pets or livestock) within the site?  If so, you <strong>must</strong> ensure that <strong>all</strong> animals (both livestock and pets) will be kept away from the area to be visited.</p>

<p>Is the site remote or in an area likely to have a poor mobile phone signal?</p>

<p>Are there any areas that require specialist equipment or training for access for example, confined spaces or use of ladders/scaffolding?  If a ladder will be used, you must explain why and give details of the heights involved and arrangements for securing the ladder.</p>

<p>Does the Inspector need to be aware of specific dangers within the site?  This would include uneven surfaces, equipment or substances kept at the site, risk of exposure to chemicals, asbestos or radiation.</p>

<p>Will it be necessary to view the site from a height, for example, from a roof or balcony?  Are any railings or guards in place?</p>

<p>Are there any site-specific safety arrangements in place?</p>

<p>Is the site accessible for persons with limited mobility?</p>

<p>Is there any overgrown vegetation that could restrict access to the site?  If so, you will need to ensure that the site is made accessible to our Inspector and any other people accompanying them.</p>

<p>You must also inform us of any relevant changes to the site which occur in the period leading up to the planned site visit date.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.11 </span>What is your/the appellant’s interest in the land/building?</h3>

<p>‘Interest in the building’ is explained in the earlier section ‘Who can appeal?’</p>

<p>Please state your interest in the land.  If it is none of the above, you will need to indicate whether you/the appellant occupied the land/building under a written or oral licence both on the date the enforcement notice was issued and on the making of this appeal. Use the text box to explain your interest.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.12 </span>Choice of procedure</h3>

<p>There are 3 possible procedures for the determination of an appeal: written representations, hearings and inquiries. We will decide which procedure your appeal should follow. Our decision will be based on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/criteria-for-determining-the-procedure-for-planning-enforcement-advertisement-and-discontinuance-notice-appeals">criteria for procedure determination</a>. We will also take into account any views you have expressed about which procedure would be most suitable for your case and the views of the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr>.</p>

<p>You should note if we decide at the initial stage that the appeal should proceed as a hearing or as an inquiry, we will, based on the criteria, also subsequently consider whether a ‘combined procedure’ would be appropriate. For example, a hearing with some elements dealt with by written representations or an inquiry with hearing and/or written representation elements.</p>

<p>We will keep the determined procedure, including any combined procedure, under review during the appeal and may change it at any point before a decision on the appeal is made.</p>

<p>Please use our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/criteria-for-determining-the-procedure-for-planning-enforcement-advertisement-and-discontinuance-notice-appeals">criteria</a> before choosing your preferred procedure.</p>

<h4>The written representations procedure</h4>

<p>This is normally the most straightforward way of making an appeal. It is simpler to undertake than a hearing or inquiry. Over 60% of enforcement appeals proceed by the written procedure. The Inspector will consider the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr>’s reasons for issuing the enforcement notice, your grounds of appeal (see the below section ‘The Different grounds of appeal’), any further representations received from you and the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> and any representation received from interested people. The Inspector will usually visit the site.</p>

<p>Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enforcement-appeals-procedural-guide/procedural-guide-enforcement-notice-appeals-england#the-procedures">8.2 our Enforcement Appeals Procedural Guide</a> for a more detailed explanation of the written representations procedure.</p>

<p>We will use your responses to questions 1a) and 1b) to help us decide how the site visit should be conducted.</p>

<h4>The hearing procedure</h4>

<p>This procedure is likely to be suited to more complicated cases which require detailed discussion. The hearing is an inquisitorial process led by the Inspector who identifies the issues for discussion based on the evidence received and any representations made. The hearing may include a discussion at the site. Or the site may be visited, on an accompanied (without any discussion), or unaccompanied basis.</p>

<p>If you ask for a hearing you should explain on the appeal form why you think your appeal fits the criteria for a hearing. Although you may indicate a preference for a hearing, we must also consider that your appeal is suitable for this procedure. It is unlikely to be suitable if the evidence needs to be tested that is, where the factual evidence about the condition of the building before the works took place are in dispute. In this case an Inquiry would be more suitable.</p>

<p>Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enforcement-appeals-procedural-guide/procedural-guide-enforcement-notice-appeals-england#the-procedures">8.3 our Enforcement Appeals Procedural Guide</a> for a more detailed explanation of the hearing procedure.</p>

<h4>The inquiry procedure</h4>

<p>This is the most formal of the appeal procedures. Although it is not a court of law the proceedings will often seem to be quite similar. An inquiry provides for the investigation into, and formal testing of, evidence, usually through expert witnesses. Parties may be formally represented by advocates and evidence will sometimes be given on oath. The site may be visited before, during or after the inquiry.</p>

<p>If you ask for an inquiry you should explain on the appeal form why you think your appeal fits the criteria for an inquiry. Although you may indicate a preference for an inquiry, we must be satisfied that your appeal is suitable for this procedure.</p>

<p>Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enforcement-appeals-procedural-guide/procedural-guide-enforcement-notice-appeals-england#the-procedures">8.4 our Enforcement Appeals Procedural Guide</a> for a more detailed explanation of the inquiry procedure.</p>

<h5>How long do you estimate the inquiry will last?</h5>

<p>In answering this question, you should say how long you estimate the inquiry will last, including the time you think will be required to present all your case. Please be realistic - the estimate should include time for opening and closing the inquiry, any sessions on conditions and any section 106 obligation and the time you consider may be necessary for questions to be put to both your and the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr>’s witnesses. If you have instructed someone to represent you at the inquiry (your ‘advocate’) it may be useful for you to get their views on the likely length of the inquiry.</p>

<p>We will take account of your estimate, the estimate we receive from the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> and our own experience when we set the likely length of the inquiry. Once set we will expect the length of the inquiry to stay within the agreed timetable.</p>

<p>To help us to do this please indicate at Q3(b) how many witnesses you intend to call to give evidence at the inquiry and the topic areas they will cover and any other information which will help us decide on the appropriate timetable for the inquiry. If you have an advocate it may be useful for you to get their views on this.</p>

<p>If you have any further information relevant to the inquiry use the text box below.</p>

<h5>Statement of common ground</h5>

<p>For inquiry cases you are required to send to us a statement of common ground not later than 4 weeks before the inquiry. You should begin discussing this with the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> before you make your appeal. The statement of common ground should include basic facts such as site description, area, planning history, relevant planning policies, evidence on technical issues and conditions and all other matters of agreement. You should also list the specific areas where agreement is not possible.</p>

<p>For further information on statements of common ground please see 8.4.13 in the Enforcement Appeals Procedural Guide.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.13 </span>Grounds and facts</h3>

<p>A planning obligation - often referred to as a ‘section 106 agreement’ – is either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a legal agreement made between the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> and a person ‘interested in the land’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>or a legally binding undertaking signed unilaterally by a person ‘interested in the land’</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you intend to rely on a planning obligation you should send a draft version with your appeal form. The “start letter” we will send you will tell you when you must send the final draft to us. For further information please see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/planning-obligations-good-practice-advice">good practice advice on planning obligations</a>.</p>

<h4>The Different grounds of appeal</h4>

<p>There are 11 different grounds of appeal set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/9/section/39" rel="external">section 39(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended)</a> (‘<abbr title="the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended)">the Act</abbr>’) on which an appeal can be made. However, not all of them will be relevant in all cases because listed building enforcement notices can require different types of remedy to the breaches of listed building control.</p>

<p>Those which may be relevant to all appeals are grounds (a), (b), (c), (d), (f), and (h) (although not all will necessarily be relevant to your appeal).</p>

<p>The remaining grounds of appeal which will be relevant will depend upon what the listed building enforcement notice requires. It can require either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>restoration of the building to its former state</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and/or alleviation of the effects of the unauthorised works</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in the case of breach of a condition imposed on a listed building consent that the building be put into the condition it would have been had that condition been complied with.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If restoration is required, then grounds (g) or (i) may be relevant but they are different and generally only one will suit the circumstances of your appeal.</p>

<p>If alleviation is required, then ground (j) may be relevant.</p>

<p>If compliance with a condition attached to a listed building consent is required, then ground (k) may be relevant.</p>

<p>Your appeal must give facts in support of each chosen ground of appeal. You should think carefully about the facts on which you will rely.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to provide evidence to support what you are saying for each ground of appeal.</p>

<p>The following is information about the different grounds and advice on what to include in your grounds of appeal.</p>

<p><strong>Ground (a)</strong> - That the building is not of special or architectural or historic interest</p>

<p>Please note that any object or structure fixed to the building, and any object or structure within the curtilage of the building which, although not fixed to the building, forms part of the land and has done so since before 1 July 1948, shall be treated as part of the building. It is, therefore, their contribution to the listed building which must be considered rather than only their own architectural or historic interest.</p>

<p>You will need to explain fully why you are challenging the listing of the building. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/principles-of-selection-for-listing-buildings">Principles of Selection for Listing Buildings</a>. Paragraphs 9 to 11, sets out the statutory criteria which may be relevant if you are considering making an appeal under ground (a).</p>

<p><strong>Ground (b)</strong> - That the matters alleged to constitute a contravention of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/9/section/9" rel="external">section 9(1) or (2) of <abbr title="the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended)">the Act</abbr></a> have not occurred.</p>

<p>If you plead ground (b) you are saying that whatever is alleged in the notice has not taken place. You should provide facts to support this. If the works have taken place then, irrespective of other circumstances, this ground cannot succeed.</p>

<p>If you wish to argue that listed building consent is not needed, do not do that under ground (b). You should do that under ground (c).</p>

<p><strong>Ground (c)</strong> - That those matters (if they occurred) do not constitute such a contravention.</p>

<p>You will need to show that the alleged works have not affected the character of the building as one of special architectural or historic interest or because the works concern a building which is not part of a listed building. This ground is not concerned with merits, which arise under ground (e).</p>

<p>Appellants and agents often confuse ground (b) with ground (c) and vice versa. Put simply, ground (b) is that they did not do it, and ground (c) is that they did, but listed building consent is not needed.</p>

<p><strong>Ground (d)</strong> - That the works to the building were urgently necessary in the interest of safety or health or for the preservation of the building, that it was not practicable to secure safety or health or, as the case may be, the preservation of the building by works of repair or works for affording temporary support or shelter, and that the works carried out were limited to the minimum measures immediately necessary.</p>

<p>You will need to show all of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the works carried out were urgently necessary in the interest of safety or health or preservation of the building</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and it would have been impractical to carry out inoffensive repairs or provide temporary support or shelter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and the works were limited to the minimum measures immediately necessary - for example, urgent works to keep a building wind and weatherproof, or safe from collapse, or action to prevent vandalism or theft.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You will also need to show why prior consultation with the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> was not possible.</p>

<p><strong>Ground (e)</strong> - That listed building consent ought to be granted for the works, or that any relevant condition of such consent which has been granted ought to be discharged, or different conditions substituted.</p>

<p>This ground covers any arguments on the merits of the case. You should focus on the points raised in the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr>’s statement of reasons for issuing the listed building enforcement notice, which is normally part of the notice.</p>

<p>You should include an explanation of why you disagree with each reason for issuing the enforcement notice. It is not enough to say that you do not accept them – this will not help the Inspector to decide your appeal.</p>

<p>There is no deemed application for listed building consent, therefore you do not need to pay a fee.</p>

<p>You should indicate if you wish to accept or can suggest planning conditions that you think would mitigate the impact of the works.</p>

<p>You should look at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities'">DLUHC</abbr>’S <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/use-of-planning-conditions">planning practice guidance on the use of planning conditions</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Appendix A - “Suggested Models of Acceptable Conditions for Use in Appropriate Circumstances” (which is still in existence) to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-use-of-conditions-in-planning-permissions-circular-11-1995">Circular 11/95: Use of conditions in planning permission</a> (which has been cancelled).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The fact that conditions are suggested does not mean that the appeal will be allowed, and listed building consent granted or that, if granted, conditions will be imposed. A hearing or inquiry will usually include a discussion about the conditions which may be imposed if the works are granted listed building consent.</p>

<p><strong>Ground (f)</strong> That copies of the notice were not served as required by section 38(4).</p>

<p>You will need show the copies of the notice were not served as required by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/9/section/38" rel="external">section 38(4) of <abbr title="the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended)">the Act</abbr></a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>on the owner and on the occupier of the building to which it relates</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and on any other person having an interest in the building, being an interest which, in the opinion of the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr>, is materially affected by the notice.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The service of the notice shall take place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>not more than 28 days after its date of issue</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and not less than 28 days before the date specified in it as the date which it is to take effect.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the notice was not served as specified in section 38(4) this can be disregarded if no substantial prejudice has been caused to anyone’s interests. For example, if the appellant or other person is present at the inquiry or hearing or sent written representations it is likely that they have been given adequate notice.</p>

<p>You should be aware that even if you succeed in this ground of appeal, the Inspector might disregard the matter and will give reasons for doing so. It depends whether they think the failure to serve a copy of a notice on a person has caused that person some injustice.</p>

<p>You should provide the details of anyone who has an interest in the land. You should indicate who received the notice and who did not.</p>

<p><strong>Ground (g)</strong> - Except in relation to such a requirement as is mentioned in section 38(2) (b) or (c) of <abbr title="the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended)">the Act</abbr>, that the requirements of the notice exceed what is necessary for restoring the building to its condition before the works were carried out.</p>

<p>The building’s condition before the works were carried out refers to its former authorised condition, which is its condition when listed, subject to any listed building consents subsequently granted. It does not refer to its physical condition, for example in terms of repair.</p>

<p><strong>If you choose this ground you cannot generally also choose (i), (j) or (k).</strong></p>

<p>You should say why you think the steps set out in the listed building notice for restoration are excessive.</p>

<p>Note - Sometimes there is confusion about grounds (g) and (i). Put simply ground (g) is when you consider that the steps set out in the listed building enforcement notice for restoring the building to its former authorised condition are more than necessary. Ground (i) is when you consider that the steps set out in the listed building enforcement notice will not achieve the purpose of restoring the building to its former authorised state.</p>

<p><strong>Ground (h)</strong> - That the period specified in the notice as the period within which any step required by the notice is to be taken falls short of what should reasonably be allowed.</p>

<p>You should say what you consider to be a more reasonable period and why. If you appeal solely on this ground you should consider negotiating the timescale with the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr>, as it may be willing to extend the period for compliance, removing the need for an appeal.</p>

<p><strong>Ground (i)</strong> - That the steps required by the notice for the purpose of restoring the character of the building to its former state would not serve the purpose.  Please see the nore to ground (g).</p>

<p><strong>If you choose this ground you cannot generally also choose (g), (j) or (k).</strong></p>

<p>You should say why you consider the restoration of the character of the building would not be achieved by the steps as set out in the listed building enforcement notice.</p>

<p><strong>Ground (j)</strong> - That the steps required to be taken by virtue of section 38(2)(b) exceed what is necessary to alleviate the effect of the works executed to the building.</p>

<p>This ground is concerned with alleviation, not with restoration.</p>

<p>__ If you choose this ground you cannot generally also choose (g), (i) or (k).__</p>

<p>You could appeal on this ground if you think that the works required in the notice go beyond what is necessary to alleviate the effect of the works done.</p>

<p>You should say why you think the steps in the listed building enforcement notice to alleviate the effect of the unauthorised works are excessive.</p>

<p><strong>Ground (k)</strong> - That steps required to be taken by virtue of section 38(2)(c) exceed what is necessary to bring the building to the state in which it would have been if the terms and conditions of the listed building consent had been complied with.</p>

<p><strong>If you choose this ground you cannot generally also choose (g), (i) or (j).</strong></p>

<p>You should say why you consider the works required by the listed building enforcement notice are excessive as a means of achieving the appearance of the building that would have existed if the terms and conditions of the original listed building consent had been complied with.</p>

<p>You should attach a copy of the (conditional) listed building consent and its supporting plans as well as any relevant associated documents including photographs.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.14 </span>Other Appeals</h3>

<p>If you have made any other related appeals which have not yet been decided on this site or for nearby sites please supply the reference numbers. Where practical, and depending on the relevant timescales, we may consider related cases together.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.15 </span>Building Information</h3>

<p>If the building is listed, you need to indicate the grade of the building.</p>

<p>You must also give the date the building was first listed.</p>

<p>Under sections 3A and 4 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/1-2/49/contents" rel="external">the Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act 1953</a> the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission may make a grant for the preservation of historic buildings, their contents and adjoining land. You need to indicate if a grant has been made.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.16 </span>Supporting Documents</h3>

<p>All documents should be submitted at the time of your appeal. You should submit all documents using the portal. Sending documents by email may delay your appeal.</p>

<p>Any supporting documentation other than a copy of the listed building enforcement notice and plan as required in this section of the appeal form should be kept to a minimum and should be essential and directly relevant to the appeal. Such documentation should be clearly cross-referenced to your representations on your grounds of appeal.</p>

<p>You may wish to send appendices to your representations. These can include reports and information that relate directly to the reasons for issuing the enforcement notice. Appendices should be used sparingly.</p>

<p>You may use photographs (preferably in colour) to illustrate your grounds of appeal – for example to show the site and its relationship to its neighbours. If you send photographs you must give details of where they were taken, on a map showing the viewpoints, and when and what they show. If you take photographs in public places, please take reasonable care to respect the privacy of individuals whose images you may inadvertently capture. We are unable to return photographs.</p>

<p>We will return any audio/video evidence sent to us. We cannot accept audio or video evidence, as we cannot be sure that everyone involved has exactly the same version or that they have the equipment needed to access the evidence. However, you may send a written summary.</p>

<p>If the appeal will proceed by a hearing or inquiry, you may ask the Inspector at the event if they are willing to accept the audio/video evidence and allow it to be played at the hearing/inquiry.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to contact the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> to find out whether it has suitable equipment at the venue to access the evidence, or if it will allow you to use your own. The equipment must be suitable to play the evidence so that everyone can see/hear it.</p>

<p>If the evidence is accepted by the Inspector it will become part of the hearing/inquiry evidence and will be retained by the Inspector. You will need to have additional of the audio/video evidence available as if the Inspector allows it to be played these copies will be given to the main parties Our Case Officer will be able to tell you how many copies you will need to provide.</p>
