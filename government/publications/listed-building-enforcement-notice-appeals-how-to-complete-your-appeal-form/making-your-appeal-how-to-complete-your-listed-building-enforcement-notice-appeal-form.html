<p>This guide shows you how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create an account</li>
  <li>Complete your form</li>
  <li>Submit your form</li>
  <li>Contact us</li>
  <li>Troubleshoot problems</li>
</ul>

<h2>Before you start</h2>

<p>Before you make your appeal, you should enter into discussions with the local planning authority (LPA). We encourage you to continue these discussions, during the appeal. This will help to narrow the areas in dispute.</p>

<p>You should make your appeal only when all else has failed.</p>

<h3>System Availability</h3>

<p>Our online facilities will usually be available 24 hours a day. We will sometimes need to take the system out of service for a while to implement upgrades. Wherever possible, we will do this outside of usual office hours.
All planned downtime for the appeals service will be advertised on the <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/organisations/planning-inspectorate">Planning Inspectorate page of GOV.UK</a>. Sometimes GOV.UK itself may also be unavailable because of updates.</p>

<h3>System Requirements</h3>

<p>Before you start, you should ensure that you have the following system requirements -</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adobe Acrobat (Version 9 or higher recommended);</li>
  <li>an internet browser (Internet Explorer/Chrome/Firefox recommended);</li>
  <li>an email account.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Registration</h3>

<p>You need to create an account with us in order to make an appeal or make representations on an appeal. Registering will enable you to access our full range of electronic services, including a personal homepage.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">

<h3>Your account</h3>

<h4>Personal homepage</h4>

<p>From this page you are able to â</p>

<ul>
  <li>make a new appeal;</li>
  <li>view your submitted appeal forms through âMy casesâ. These will not be editable as they have already been submitted to us. You will have been emailed a PDF version of any appeal form you have submitted;</li>
  <li>search for a case using either the quick search facility (using the 7 digit case reference number) or, alternatively, you can search using other criteria (such as site address) with our advanced search;</li>
  <li>access any of your appeals or representations which you are still working on via the âAwaiting submissionsâ facility. Please note that any appeals or representations which are still awaiting submission after 180 days will be automatically deleted;</li>
  <li>view submitted representations through âMy representationsâ. This will include any representations you have submitted for your own case(s) and any representations which you may have submitted for other cases which you are interested in (for example, as an interested party). These will not be editable as they have already been submitted to us. You will have been emailed a PDF version of the form upon submission;</li>
  <li>watch any cases which are of interest to you. Once you have found a case which you want to follow, you can click the âWatch caseâ button on the Case Summary screen and the case will then be added to your âWatched casesâ list. If at any time you want to remove the case from your list, simply click the âStop watchingâ button on the Case Summary screen or click the red âxâ button on your homepage and the case will be removed from your list.</li>
</ul>

<h4>My Details</h4>

If at any time your details change, you should make amendments to them through this page, but please note you cannot change your name once your account has been created. It is your responsibility to ensure that your details are kept up to date.</p>

<p>If you make a change to your address details, telephone number or fax number then these details will be updated instantly on your account. If you change your email address, you will be sent an email confirming this change and asking you to verify the new email address. Once verified, your account will be updated.</p>

<h2>Making your appeal</h2>

<h4>Deadlines</h4>

<p>We must receive your listed building enforcement appeal <strong>before</strong> the date on which the notice takes effect. This date should be shown on the enforcement notice and should be at least 28 days from when the enforcement notice was served on you. You should not wait until the last few days.</p>

<h4>Why has the LPA served an enforcement notice on me?</h4>

<p>Your LPA will serve an enforcement notice on you when it considers you have not complied with planning rules and regulations. Normally a listed building enforcement notice may be issued by the LPA where it appears to it that demolition or works to alter or extend a listed building without the required listed building consent have been carried out. Or, if there has been a failure to comply with any condition attached to a listed building consent.</p>

<p>Examples of the types of alteration or extension which would normally require listed building consent are:</p>

<p>a) an extension to a building whether or not it is within the permitted development limits of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015;</p>

<p>b) alterations such as the removal and replacement of doors and windows; and</p>

<p>c) alterations to the interior fabric of a listed building.</p>

<h4>Who can appeal?</h4>

<p>An appeal may be made by:</p>

<p>(i) a person who has a legal interest in the building when the appeal is made (irrespective of his/her standing when the notice was served); or</p>

<p>(ii) a relevant occupier in occupation of the building both when the notice was served and when the appeal is made.</p>

<p>Interest in this context has a special significance. It means either a legal or an equitable interest in the building. It includes owners, lessees, some tenants and Official Receivers. Mortgagees or other lenders also have an interest in the building (as security for the loan they have advanced to the borrower).</p>

<p>Section 39 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 provides a right of appeal for a person who has an interest in the building to which a listed building enforcement notice relates or is a relevant occupier of the building.</p>

<p>A ârelevant occupierâ means a person who:</p>

<p>(a) on the date on which the enforcement notice is issued occupies the building to which the notice relates by virtue of a licence (the consent of the owner whether oral, written or implied); and</p>

<p>(b) continues so to occupy the building when the appeal is brought.</p>

<p>If you âhave an interestâ or are a ârelevant occupierâ you may appeal even if the notice has not been served on you.</p>

<p>Sometimes, more than one person may have a legal interest in the building to which a listed building enforcement notice relates and their different interests may conflict with each other. For example, the owner of the building may wish the enforcement notice to be upheld, while the occupier of the land may wish to retain the works. In these circumstances, it is up to each person with a legal interest to decide how his or her interests will best be served once an enforcement notice has been issued.</p>

<p>If you own the building and you do not appeal against a listed building enforcement notice but someone else does appeal against it, in law you will have the status of an âinterested personâ. This does not entitle you to receive a copy of all the representations made by the appellant and other interested people (though you would be able to see such representations at the LPAâs offices).</p>

<p>However, in those circumstances, you may wish to request to be considered as an âinterested ownerâ. This status is given at our discretion. It means that we will give you similar treatment as to an appellant. You will be able to attend any hearing or local inquiry, or be present when the Inspector visits the site. You will also be able to see and comment on any written representations made by the appellant, the LPA, and any other interested people, during the progress of the appeal. It is important you notify us to request this at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>A person</p>

<ul>
  <li>who does not have an interest in the building or is not a relevant occupier; or</li>
  <li>who is a trespasser;</li>
</ul>

<p>does not have a right of appeal â even if the LPA serves a copy of the enforcement notice on them.</p>

<h4>Openness and transparency</h4>

<p>Hearings and inquiries are open to journalists and the wider public, as well as interested people. Provided that it does not disrupt proceedings, anyone will be allowed to report, record and film proceedings including the use of digital and social media. Inspectors will advise people present at the start of the event that the proceedings may be recorded and/or filmed, and that anyone using social media during or after the end of the proceedings should do so responsibly.</p>

<p>If anyone wants to record or film the event on equipment larger than a smart phone, tablet, compact camera, or similar, especially if that is likely to involve moving around the venue to record or film from different angles, they should contact us and the local planning authority in advance to discuss arrangements.</p>

<h2>Guidelines for submitting documents</h2>

<h3>Acceptable file formats</h3>

<p>PDF .pdf</p>

<p>Microsoft Word .doc or.docx</p>

<p>TIF .tif or .tiff</p>

<p>JPEG .jpg or .jpeg</p>

<p>PNG .png</p>

<p>ZIP .zip</p>

<h3>File sizes</h3>

<p>Documents submitted may be no bigger than 15mb each. It is your responsibility to keep your documents to a manageable size.</p>

<p>If you have documents that are larger than this, you can try the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Break long documents into several files, but note the document naming conventions below.</li>
  <li>Try and use black and white wherever possible (unless submitting photographs).</li>
  <li>If submitting images, your software may have file/image compression facilities to make them smaller.</li>
  <li>Note scanned documents are usually bigger than non-scanned versions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Provided you are using the acceptable file types above, you can use ZIP files to compress documents.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>Remove any document security and enable macros if necessary. Documents should not be password protected, they should not be formatted as âread onlyâ and printing should be enabled.</p>

<h3>Copyright</h3>

<p>Ensure you have the ownerâs permission and have paid any copyright licence fee before sending in documents.</p>

<h3>File names</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure all documents have descriptive names, including the type of document you are sending, eg âProposed plan 1 March 2014â.</li>
  <li>Number appendices and submit them as separate documents. Ensure the first page includes the appendix number. Name them to indicate what they form part of, and their sequence eg âAppeal statement Appendix 2 Traffic census.â</li>
  <li>Use âPart 1â, âPart 2â etc in the file name if you have split up a large document eg âAppeal statement in Appendix 1 Environmental Assessment Part 1 of 3â.</li>
  <li>Include the required paper size in the document name for plans and drawings eg âProposed plan A3 size 1 March 2014â.</li>
  <li>Include scale bar(s) on all plans and drawings.</li>
  <li>Do not use a colon â:â in any file names.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scanning</h3>

<p>Ensure documents are complete and legible and avoid scanning more than one document into a single file. Use black and white unless colour is essential.</p>

<h3>Ordnance Survey</h3>

<p>People may only scan an Ordnance Survey map if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have an annual licence to make copies; or</li>
  <li>Have purchased a bulk copy arrangement; or</li>
  <li>Are using a local planning authority supplied map under the âmap return schemeâ (for which a fee is normally payable at the local planning authorityâs discretion), or</li>
  <li>Have purchased the site-specific map for the purposes of attaching to a planning application, appeal or representation.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/support/licensing.html" rel="external">More information on map licensing is available on the Ordnance Survey website</a></p>

<h3>Images</h3>

<p>Send pictures, photographs, plans, maps or drawings as individual files. Avoid the use of bitmap images as they are very large.</p>

<h3>Hyperlinks</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You should not use hyperlinks within documents you send to us. Instead, you should download such documents yourself and attach them separately.</li>
  <li>You should not use hyperlinks to a website page containing multiple documents or links.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sending emails</h3>

<p>If you send anything by email you should get an automatic acknowledgement, provided it is sent to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:appeals@planninginspectorate.gov.uk">appeals@planninginspectorate.gov.uk</a> or to a team email address (which can be found at the top of letters from us about the appeal). If you do not get an automatic acknowledgement, then you should contact us.
For any correspondence which you send to us via email, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Quote the appeal reference and/or appellantâs name, site address and local planning authority name in the subject line or in the body of your email.</li>
  <li>If you are attaching more than one document, please list them in the covering email.</li>
  <li>If you are sending a series of emails, include â1 of 5â, â2 of 5â etc in the subject line of the email, so we know how many to expect and can check with you if any appear to be missing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Formatting</h3>

<p>You should ensure that you number all pages accordingly.</p>

<h2>Application for appeal costs</h2>

<p>You and the LPA normally have to meet your own appeal expenses, whether we decide it by the written procedure, a hearing or an inquiry.</p>

<p>If a party does not behave reasonably they leave themselves open to costs being awarded against them. This would be on the basis that the behaviour had directly caused another party to incur expenses that would not otherwise have been necessary.</p>

<p>Costs may be awarded in response to an application for costs by one of the parties. Also the Inspector may make an award of costs even if neither of the parties has made an application.</p>

<p>There is <a class="govuk-link" href="/guidance/appeals">guidance about costs awards in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities planning practice guidance</a>.</p>

<p>It is important that you read this guidance because it explains how, and on what basis you can make an application or have an application made against you.</p>

<p>If you are making an application for costs you <strong>must</strong> send your costs application <strong>with</strong> your appeal.
There is a <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/apply-for-an-award-of-appeal-costs-application-form">model costs application form on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>Selecting the correct appeal form</h2>

<p>Once you have logged into your account, start the appeal process by clicking on the âMake a new appealâ button.</p>

<h3>Enter the name of your local planning authority</h3>

<p>Here you should type in the name of your local planning authority. As you type, possible matches will be returned. You can then select the correct one from the list. Note you cannot change your local authority once you are in the appeal form.</p>

<h3>Selecting your appeal form</h3>

<p>You will be asked a series of questions about your appeal, with each answer you give determining the next question. You may need to consult the enforcement notice issued from your LPA.</p>

<p>If you want to make an appeal in relation to more than one enforcement notice or eg in relation to an application for listed building consent, you must make a separate appeal for each.</p>

<p>If you believe that you may have selected the wrong from, please select the âRestartâ button to begin the appeals process again.</p>

<h3>Meaningful name</h3>

<p>This name will be used to identify this appeal on your personal homepage. Please use a name that clearly identifies the appeal to you, for example, the first line of the site address. This is of particular importance if you are an agent who may be dealing with multiple cases.</p>

<h2>Completing the appeal form</h2>

<p>In this guidance, we use the same section headers as within the listed building notice enforcement appeal form.</p>

<h3>Appellant Details</h3>

<p><strong>Name</strong>
<strong>Preferred contact method</strong>
If you are an unrepresented appellant and you prefer to be contacted by email, where possible, we will send you our letters and appeals correspondence by email and we will not send paper copies.</p>

<p>If for any reason your details have changed since you created your account, you should change them through the My Details link at the top of the page.</p>

<h3>Agent Details</h3>

<p>You do not have to employ an agent to handle your listed building enforcement notice appeal. If you decide to employ an agent he or she will probably complete the appeal form for you.</p>

<p>If you have an agent we will send all of our communications to them. We will not send a copy to you. You should ensure that you keep in touch with your agent about the appeal arrangements particularly if an âaccess requiredâ site visit is arranged.</p>

<h4>Preferred contact method</h4>

<p>If you prefer to be contacted by email, where possible, we will send you our letters and appeals correspondence by email and we will not send paper copies.</p>

<p>If you are the agent completing the form, by selecting âNoâ to the question âAre you the appellant?â the details registered to your account will be displayed on the Agent Details section of the form.</p>

<h3>Local Planning Authority Details</h3>

<p>This information should be on the listed building enforcement notice.</p>

<p>The name of the LPA will have transferred through to the form from when you entered it at the start of the process. If you need to change the LPA you will need to restart from your homepage.</p>

<h3>Appeal Site Details</h3>

<p>The appeal site must be the same as the site given in the listed building enforcement notice.</p>

<p>If you confirm that the address of the affected building is the same as the appellantâs address then this information will transfer over from the Appellant Details section (provided you have completed the Appellant Details section before the Appeal Site Details section).</p>

<h4>Does the appeal relate to an existing property?</h4>

<p>If the address of the affected building is not the same as the appellantâs address you will be asked an additional question as to whether the appeal relates to an existing property. If it does, you can use the address finder to complete your details quickly.</p>

<h4>Postcode</h4>

<p>If the appeal site does not have a postcode, please provide the postcode of the nearest building.</p>

<h4>Health and safety at the site</h4>

<p>The site is likely to be inspected during the course of the appeal and the Inspector needs to be made aware of any potential problems. The following questions indicate the type of information we need about the appeal site such as the condition of the land or any building to be entered.</p>

<p>We take seriously our duties with regard to the health and safety of our employees and those affected by our work. Inspectors may abort the site visit if the conditions on site are unsatisfactory. Failure to provide the necessary information may therefore result in a delay to your appeal.</p>

<p>The following questions indicate the type of information we need about the appeal site, such as the condition of the land or any building to be entered. Please note that the questions do not actually feature on the appeal form. The information should be supplied within the free text field underneath the Health and Safety question.</p>

<p>1) Will the Inspector be expected to wear Personal Protection Equipment? Please give details.</p>

<p>2) Are any building works or other operations taking place on the site? If it is a workplace, is there a risk assessment in place for visitors?</p>

<p>3) Are there any animals (eg pets or livestock) within the site? If so, you <strong>must</strong> ensure that <strong>ALL</strong> animals (both livestock or pets) will be kept away from the area to be visited.</p>

<p>4) Is the site remote or in an area likely to have a poor mobile phone signal?</p>

<p>5) Are there any areas that require specialist equipment or training for access e.g. confined spaces or use of ladders / scaffolding? If a ladder will be used, you must explain why and give details of the heights involved and arrangements for securing the ladder.</p>

<p>6) Does the Inspector need to be aware of specific dangers within the site? This would include uneven surfaces, equipment or substances kept at the site, risk of exposure to chemicals, asbestos or radiation.</p>

<p>7) Will it be necessary to view the site from a height, e.g. roof, balcony? Are any railings or guards in place?</p>

<p>8) Are there any site specific safety arrangements in place?</p>

<p>9) Is the site accessible for persons with limited mobility?</p>

<p>10) Is there any overgrown vegetation that could restrict access to the site? If so, you will need to ensure that the site is made accessible to our Inspector and any other people accompanying him or her.</p>

<p>You <strong>must</strong> also inform us of any relevant changes to the site which occur in the period leading up to the planned site visit date, hearing or inquiry.</p>

<h4>What is your/the appellantâs interest in the land/building?</h4>

<p>âInterest in the buildingâ is explained in the earlier section âWho can appeal?â.</p>

<p>Please state your interest in the building. If it is none of the above you will need to indicate whether you/the appellant occupied the land/building under a written or oral licence BOTH on the date the enforcement notice was issued AND on the of making this appeal? . Use the text box to explain your interest.</p>

<p>Please see previous âWho can appeal?â section for an explanation.</p>

<h3>Choice of Procedure</h3>

<p>There are 3 possible procedures for the determination of an appeal: written representations, hearings and inquiries. We will decide which procedure your appeal should follow. Our decision will be based on the criteria which are set out in Annexe 1. We will also take into account any views you have expressed about which procedure would be most suitable for your case and the views of the LPA.</p>

<p>You should note if we decide at the initial stage that the appeal should proceed as a hearing or as an inquiry, the appointed Inspector will also subsequently consider, whether a âcombined procedureâ would be appropriate, such as a hearing with some elements dealt with written representations or an inquiry with hearing and/or written representation elements, on the basis of the criteria.</p>

<p>We will keep the determined procedure, including any combined procedure, under review during the appeal and may change it at any point before a decision on the appeal is made.</p>

<p><strong>Please refer to Annexe 1 before indicating which is your preferred procedure.</strong></p>

<h4>The written representations procedure</h4>

<p>This is normally the simplest, quickest and most straightforward way of making an appeal, it is simpler to undertake than a hearing or inquiry. The Inspector will consider the LPAâs reasons for issuing the enforcement notice, your grounds of appeal, any further representations received from you and the LPA and any representation received from interested people. The Inspector will usually visit the site.</p>

<p>You may wish to look at âThe Town and Country Planning (Enforcement) (Written Representations Procedure) (England) Regulations 2002, Statutory Instrument 2002 No. 2683â.</p>

<p>We will use your responses to questions 1a) and 1b) to help us decide how the site visit should be conducted.</p>

<h4>The hearing procedure</h4>

<p>This procedure is likely to be suited to cases which require detailed discussion. The hearing is an inquisitorial process led by the Inspector who identifies the issues for discussion based on the evidence received and any representations made. The hearing may include a discussion at the site or the site may be visited, on an accompanied (without any discussion), or unaccompanied basis. If you ask for a hearing you should explain on the appeal form why you think your appeal fits the criteria for a hearing. Although you may indicate a preference for a hearing, we must also consider that your appeal is suitable for this procedure. It is unlikely to be suitable if the evidence needs to be tested ie where the factual evidence about the condition of the building before the works took place are in dispute.</p>

<p>You may wish to look at âThe Town and Country Planning (Enforcement) (Hearings Procedure) (England) Rules 2002, Statutory Instrument 2002 No. 2684.â</p>

<h4>The inquiry procedure</h4>

<p>This is the most formal of the procedures. Although it is not a court of law the proceedings will often seem to be quite similar. An inquiry provides for the investigation into, and formal testing of, evidence, usually through expert witnesses. Parties may be formally represented by advocates and evidence will sometimes be given on oath. The site may be visited before, during or after the inquiry.</p>

<p>If you ask for an inquiry you should explain on the appeal form why you think your appeal fits the criteria for an inquiry.</p>

<p>You may wish to look at âThe Town and Country Planning (Enforcement) (Determination by Inspectors) (Inquiries Procedure) (England) Rules 2002, Statutory Instrument 2002 No. 2685â.</p>

<p>For inquiry cases you are required to send to us a formal <strong>statement of common ground</strong> not later than 4 weeks before the inquiry. You should begin discussing this with the LPA before you make your appeal. The statement of common ground should include basic facts such as site description, area, planning history, relevant planning policies, evidence on technical issues and conditions and all other matters of agreement. You should also list the specific areas where agreement is not possible.</p>

<p>For further information please see Annexe D, paragraph D.9 âStatement of common groundâ of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/enforcement-appeals-procedural-guide">âProcedural Guide: Enforcement notice appeals â Englandâ</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Q3a) How long do you estimate the inquiry will last?</strong>
In answering this question you should say how long you estimate the inquiry will last, including the time you think will be required to present all of your case. Please be realistic - the estimate should include time for opening and closing the inquiry, any sessions on conditions and any section 106 obligation and the time you consider may be necessary for questions to be put to both your and the LPAâs witnesses. If you have instructed an advocate it may be useful for you to get their views on the likely length of the inquiry.</p>

<p>We will take account of your estimate, the estimate we receive from the LPA and our own experience when we set the likely length of the inquiry. Once set we will expect the length of the inquiry to stay within the agreed timetable.</p>

<p>To help us to do this please indicate at Q3b) how many witnesses you intend to call to give evidence at the inquiry and the topic areas they will cover and any other information which will help us to decide on the appropriate timetable for the inquiry.</p>

<p>If you have any further information relevant to the inquiry which you need to tell us about please use the text box below.</p>

<h3>Grounds and Facts</h3>

<h4>Planning Obligations</h4>

<p>If you intend to rely on a planning obligation1 you should send a draft version with your appeal form. The âstart letterâ we will send you will tell you when you must send the final draft to us. For further information please see Annexe I of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/enforcement-appeals-procedural-guide">âProcedural Guide: Enforcement notice appeals â Englandâ</a>.</p>

<h4>The Different grounds of appeal</h4>

<p>There are 11 different grounds of appeal set out in section 39(1) of the Act on which an appeal can be made. However, not all of them will be relevant in all cases because listed building enforcement notices can require different types of remedy to the breaches of listed building control.</p>

<p>Those which may be relevant to all appeals are grounds (a), (b), (c), (d), (f), and (h) though not all may be relevant to your appeal.</p>

<p>The remaining grounds of appeal which will be relevant will depend upon what the listed building enforcement notice requires. It can require either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>restoration of the building to its former state; and/or</li>
  <li>alleviation of the effects of the unauthorised works; or</li>
  <li>in the case of breach of a condition imposed on a listed building consent that the building be put into the condition it would have been had that condition been complied with.</li>
</ul>

<p>If restoration is required, then grounds (g) or (i) may be relevant, but note that they are different and generally only one will suit the circumstances of your appeal.</p>

<p>If alleviation is required, then ground (j) may be relevant.</p>

<p>If compliance with a condition attached to a listed building consent is required, then ground (k) may be relevant.</p>

<p>The following is information about the different grounds and advice on what to include in your grounds of appeal.</p>

<p>Your appeal must give facts in support of each chosen ground of appeal. You should think carefully about the facts on which you will rely.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to provide evidence to support what you are saying for each ground of appeal.</p>

<p><strong>Ground (a)</strong>
That the building is not of special or architectural or historic interest. Please note that any object or structure fixed to the building, and any object or structure within the curtilage of the building which, although not fixed to the building, forms part of the land and has done so since before 1 July 1948, shall be treated as part of the building. It is, therefore, their contribution to the listed building which must be considered rather than only their own architectural or historic interest.</p>

<p>You will need to explain fully why you are challenging the listing of the building. <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/principles-of-selection-for-listing-buildings">âPrinciples of Selection for Listed Buildingsâ</a>, at paragraphs 9 to 11, sets out the statutory criteria which may be relevant if you are considering making an appeal under ground (a).</p>

<p><strong>Ground (b)</strong> â That the matters alleged to constitute a contravention of section 9(1) or (2) have not occurred.</p>

<p>If you plead ground (b) you are saying that whatever is alleged in the notice has not taken place. You should provide facts to support this. If the works have taken place then, irrespective of other circumstances, this ground cannot succeed.</p>

<p>If you wish to argue that listed building consent is not needed, do not do that under ground (b). You should do that under ground (c).</p>

<p><strong>Ground (c)</strong> â That those matters (if they occurred) do not constitute such a contravention.
You will need to show that the alleged works have not affected the character of the building as one of special architectural or historic interest or because the works concern a building which is not part of a listed building. This ground is not concerned with merits, which arise under ground (e).</p>

<p>Note - Appellants and agents often confuse ground (b) with ground (c) and vice versa. Put simply, ground (b) is that they did not do it, and ground (c) is that they did, but listed building consent is not needed.</p>

<p><strong>Ground (d)</strong> - That the works to the building were urgently necessary in the interest of safety or health or for the preservation of the building, that it was not practicable to secure safety or health or, as the case may be, the preservation of the building by works of repair or works for affording temporary support or shelter, and that the works carried out were limited to the minimum measures immediately necessary.
You will need to show all of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the works carried out were urgently necessary in the interest of safety or health or preservation of the building; and</li>
  <li>it would have been impractical to carry out inoffensive repairs or provide temporary support or shelter; and</li>
  <li>the works were limited to the minimum measures immediately necessary. For example, urgent works to keep a building wind and weather proof, or safe from collapse, or action to prevent vandalism or theft.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will also need to say why prior consultation with the LPA was not possible.</p>

<p><strong>Ground (e)</strong> â That listed building consent ought to be granted for the works, or that any relevant condition of such consent which has been granted ought to be discharged, or different conditions substituted. 
You should indicate if you wish to accept or can suggest a planning condition(s) that you think would mitigate the impact of the works.</p>

<p>You should look at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="/guidance/appeals">Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities planning practice guidance</a> on the use of planning conditions and</li>
  <li>Appendix A â âSuggested Models of Acceptable Conditions for Use in Appropriate Circumstancesâ (which is still in existence) to Circular 11/95: Use of conditions in planning permission (which has been cancelled).</li>
</ul>

<p>The fact that conditions are suggested does not mean that the appeal will be allowed and listed building consent granted or that, if granted, conditions will be imposed. A hearing or inquiry will usually include a discussion about the conditions which may be imposed if the works are granted listed building consent. 
This ground covers any arguments on the merits of the case. You should focus on the points raised in the LPAâs statement of reasons for issuing the listed building enforcement notice, which is normally part of the notice.</p>

<p>You should include an explanation of why you disagree with each reason for issuing the enforcement notice. It is not enough to say that you do not accept them â this will not help the Inspector to decide your appeal. 
There is no deemed application for listed building consent, therefore you do not need to pay a fee.</p>

<p><strong>Ground (f)</strong> â That copies of the notice were not served as required by section 38(4). 
You will need show the copies of the notice were not served as required by section 38(4) of the Act:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on the owner and on the occupier of the building to which it relates; and</li>
  <li>on any other person having an interest in the building, being an interest which, in the opinion of the LPA, is materially affected by the notice.</li>
</ul>

<p>The service of the notice shall take place:-</p>

<ul>
  <li>not more than 28 days after its date of issue; and</li>
  <li>not less than 28 days before the date specified in it as the date which it is to take effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note - If the notice was not served as specified in section 38(4) this can be disregarded if no substantial prejudice has been caused to anyoneâs interests. For example if the appellant or other person is present at the inquiry or hearing or sent written representations it is likely that he or she has been given adequate notice.</p>

<p>You should be aware that even if you succeed in this ground of appeal, the Inspector might disregard the matter and will give reasons for doing so. It depends whether he or she thinks the failure to serve a copy of a notice on a person has caused that person some injustice.</p>

<p>You should provide the details of anyone who has an interest in the land. You should indicate who received the notice and who did not.</p>

<p><strong>Ground (g)</strong> â Except in relation to such a requirement as is mentioned in section 38(2) (b) or (c), that the requirements of the notice exceed what is necessary for restoring the building to its condition before the works were carried out. You should note that its condition before the works were carried out refers to its former authorised condition, which is its condition when listed, subject to any listed building consents subsequently granted. It does not refer to its physical condition, for example in terms of repair.</p>

<p><strong>If you choose this ground you cannot generally also choose (i), (j) or (k).</strong></p>

<p>You should say why you think the steps set out in the listed building notice for restoration are excessive.</p>

<p>Note:- Sometimes there is confusion about grounds (g) and (i). Put simply ground (g) is when you consider that the steps set out in the listed building enforcement notice for restoring the building to its former authorised condition are more than necessary. Ground (i) is when you consider that the steps set out in the listed building enforcement notice will not achieve the purpose of restoring the building to its former authorised state.</p>

<p><strong>Ground (h)</strong> â That the period specified in the notice as the period within which any step required by the notice is to be taken falls short of what should reasonably be allowed.</p>

<p>You should say what you consider to be a more reasonable period and why. If you appeal solely on this ground you should consider negotiating the timescale with the LPA, as it may be willing to extend the period for compliance, removing the need for an appeal.</p>

<p><strong>Ground (i)</strong> â That the steps required by the notice for the purpose of restoring the character of the building to its former state would not serve the purpose. Please see the note to ground (g).</p>

<p><strong>If you choose this ground you cannot generally also choose (g), (j) or (k).</strong>
You should say why you consider the restoration of the character of the building would not be achieved by the steps as set out in the listed building enforcement notice.</p>

<p><strong>Ground (j)</strong> - That the steps required to be taken by virtue of section 38(2)(b) exceed what is necessary to alleviate the effect of the works executed to the building. This ground is concerned with alleviation, not with restoration.</p>

<p><strong>If you choose this ground you cannot generally also choose (g), (i) or (k).</strong>
You could appeal on this ground if you think that the works required in the notice go beyond what is necessary to alleviate the effect of the works done.</p>

<p>You should say why you think the steps in the listed building enforcement notice to alleviate the effect of the unauthorised works are excessive.</p>

<p><strong>Ground (k)</strong> â That steps required to be taken by virtue of section 38(2)(c) exceed what is necessary to bring the building to the state in which it would have been if the terms and conditions of the listed building consent had been complied with.</p>

<p><strong>If you choose this ground you cannot generally also choose (g), (i) or (j).</strong></p>

<p>You should say why you consider the works required by the listed building enforcement notice are excessive as a means of achieving the appearance of the building that would have existed if the terms and conditions of the original listed building consent had been complied with.</p>

<p>You should attach a copy of the (conditional) listed building consent and its supporting plans as well as any relevant associated documents including photographs.</p>

<h3>Other Appeals</h3>

<p>If you have made any other related appeals which have not yet been decided on 
this site or for nearby sites please supply the reference numbers. Where 
practical, and depending on the relevant timescales, we may consider related 
cases together.</p>

<h3>Building Information</h3>

<p>If the building is listed you need to indicate the grade of the building.</p>

<p>You must also give the date the building was first listed.</p>

<p>Under sections 3A and 4 of the Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act 1953 the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission may make a grant for the preservation of historic buildings, their contents and adjoining land. You need to indicate if a grant has been made.</p>

<h3>Supporting Documents</h3>

<p>Any supporting documentation other than a copy of the listed building enforcement notice and plan as required in this section of the appeal form should be kept to a minimum and should be essential and directly relevant to the appeal. Such documentation should be clearly cross-referenced to your representations on ground (a).</p>

<p>You may wish to send appendices to your representations. These can include reports and information that relate directly to the reasons for issuing the enforcement notice. Appendices should be used sparingly.</p>

<p>You may use photographs (preferably in colour) to illustrate your grounds of appeal â for example to show the site and its relationship to its neighbours. If you send photographs you must give details of where they were taken, on a map showing the viewpoints, and when and what they show. If you take photographs in public places please take reasonable care to respect the privacy of individuals whose images you may inadvertently capture. We are unable to return photographs.</p>

<h3>Audio/Video</h3>

<p>We will return any audio/video evidence sent to us. We cannot accept audio or video evidence, as we cannot be sure that everyone involved has exactly the same version or that they have the equipment needed to access the evidence.</p>

<p>However, you may send a written summary within 6 weeks of the starting date for the appeal.</p>

<p>If the appeal will proceed by a hearing or inquiry, you may ask the Inspector at the event if they are willing to accept the audio/video evidence and allow it to be played at the hearing/inquiry.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to contact the LPA to find out whether it has suitable equipment at the venue to access the evidence, or if it will allow you to use your own. The equipment must be suitable to play the evidence so that everyone can see/hear it.</p>

<p>If the evidence is accepted by the Inspector it will become part of the hearing/inquiry evidence and will be retained by the Inspector. You will need to have additional copies of the audio/video evidence available as if the Inspector allows it to be played these copies will be given to the main parties Our Case Officer will be able to tell you how many copies you will need to provide.</p>

<p>The Planning Inspectorate takes its data protection responsibilities for the information you provide us with very seriously. To find out more about how we use and manage your personal data, please go to our privacy notice.</p>

<h2>Annexe 1: Criteria for determining the procedure for planning, listed buildings, enforcement, hazardous substances, advertisement and discontinuance notice appeals</h2>

<p><strong>The criteria for each procedure cannot be fully prescriptive or entirely determinative: they require judgement to be applied using common sense. More than one criterion may apply. 
Written representations</strong> - written representations would be appropriate if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the planning issues raised or, in an enforcement appeal, the grounds of appeal, can be clearly understood from the appeal documents and a site inspection (if required - A small number of appeals do not require a site visit and can be dealt with solely on the basis of the appeal documents); or</li>
  <li>the issues are not complex and the Inspector is not likely to need to test the evidence by questioning or to clarify any other matters; or</li>
  <li>in an enforcement appeal the alleged breach, and the requirements of the notice, are clear.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hearing</strong> - a hearing would be appropriate if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Inspector is likely to need to test the evidence by questioning or to clarify matters (For example, where detailed evidence on housing land supply needs to be tested by questioning); or</li>
  <li>the status or personal circumstances of the appellant are at issue (For example whether in traveller appeals the definition in Annex 1 of DLUHCâs planning policy for traveller sites is met); or</li>
  <li>there is no need for evidence to be tested through formal questioning by an advocate or given on oath; or</li>
  <li>the case has generated a level of local interest such as to warrant a hearing; or</li>
  <li>it can reasonably be expected that the parties will be able to present their own cases (supported by professional witnesses if required) without the need for an advocate to represent them; or</li>
  <li>in an enforcement appeal, the grounds of appeal, the alleged breach, and the requirements of the notice, are relatively straightforward.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Inquiry</strong> - an inquiry would be appropriate if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is a clearly explained need for the evidence to be tested through formal questioning by an advocate (This does not preclude an appellant representing themselves as an advocate); or</li>
  <li>the issues are complex (For example, where large amounts of highly technical data are likely to be provided in evidence); or</li>
  <li>the appeal has generated substantial local interest to warrant an inquiry as opposed to dealing with the case by a hearing; or</li>
  <li>in an enforcement appeal, evidence needs to be given on oath (For example where witnesses are giving factual evidence about how long the alleged unauthorised use has been taking place); or</li>
  <li>in an enforcement appeal, the alleged breach, or the requirements of the notice, are unusual and particularly contentious.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong> - It is considered that the prospect of legal submissions being made is not, on its own, a reason why a case would need to be conducted by inquiry. Where a party considers that legal submissions will be required (and are considered to be complex such as to warrant being made orally), the Inspectorate requires that the matters on which submissions will be made are fully explained â including why they may require an inquiry - at the outset of the appeal or otherwise at the earliest opportunity.</p>
