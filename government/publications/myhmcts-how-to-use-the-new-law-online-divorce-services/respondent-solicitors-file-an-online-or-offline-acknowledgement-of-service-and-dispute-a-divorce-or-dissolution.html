<p>This guide is for respondent solicitors dealing with a divorce/dissolution under the new law. If your case was issued before April 2022 you should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/990690/Represented_Respondent_Solicitor_Guidance_-June_2021.pdf" rel="external">previous guidance for respondent solicitors</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Before you start</h2>

<p>Before you can use MyHMCTS, you and/or your organisation must have completed other steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Registered your organisation with MyHMCTS</li>
  <li>Set up your MyHMCTS user account</li>
</ol>

<p>Please read the MyHMCTS registration guidance for further information and instructions. If your organisation has an account already, contact the existing administrator to arrange for your account creation.</p>

<p>Once you have a MyHMCTS account, you can sign in to manage a case using your email address and password.</p>

<p>If you need additional help with MyHMCTS email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:MyHMCTSsupport@justice.gov.uk">MyHMCTSsupport@justice.gov.uk</a>. We aim to respond within 5 working days.</p>

<p>Make sure you are using the solicitor portal, not the citizen portal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>manage your organisation from: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://manage-org.platform.hmcts.net" rel="external">https://manage-org.platform.hmcts.net</a>
</li>
  <li>access your divorce application through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://manage-case.platform.hmcts.net" rel="external">https://manage-case.platform.hmcts.net</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you cannot find your organisation when entering your details or have issues registering with the service, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:MyHMCTSSupport@justice.gov.uk">MyHMCTSSupport@justice.gov.uk</a> for the team to look into your account and ensure your organisation has been setup correctly.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> How the case is assigned to your firm</h2>

<p>When the applicant or applicant’s solicitors submits a divorce/dissolution they will be asked whether the respondent is represented by a solicitor.</p>

<p>The applicant’s solicitor can select that the respondent is represented and enter the respondent solicitor’s details into the address field.</p>

<p>If the details entered for the respondent solicitor returns no results, this may be because they are not registered with MyHMCTS. Their details can be entered manually.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/145421/16._Service_details_represented_1.png"></div></figure>
<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/145422/17._Service_details_represented_2.png"></div></figure>

<p>After the application has been submitted the case is checked and issued by court staff.</p>

<p>As the respondent solicitor, you will receive notice of proceeding and the application by both email and post, providing the email address has been provided by the applicant/solicitors.</p>

<p>The notice of acting email advises you to contact your organisation’s CAA (case access administrator) so the case can be assigned to you.</p>

<p>The applicant’s solicitor will also receive an email to notify them the application has been issued with a notice of proceedings.</p>

<p>After the application has been submitted, the case is checked and issued by court staff.</p>

<p>Unregistered respondent solicitors will receive their formal ‘notice of proceedings’, D8 application and acknowledgement of service (AoS) through the post.</p>

<p>The notice of proceedings will also include the paper acknowledgement of service for completion.</p>

<p>Further communications are sent out by post, for example the entitlement order, conditional order and final order.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/myhmcts-how-to-complete-case-administration-tasks/complete-case-administration-tasks-in-myhmcts">share a case and CAA guidance</a> for how to assign the case to the solicitor.</p>

<h2>

<p>2. View the state the case is in and select ‘Draft AoS’ and ‘Go’ from the ‘Next step’ menu.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147750/110._Draft_AOS.png"></div></figure>

<p>3. Confirm your contact details. The email address is important, as this is used for future case updates including the certificate of entitlement, conditional order approval and final order notifications.</p>

<p>4. Confirm that you are willing to accept service of all correspondence and orders by email at the email address provided by selecting the checkbox.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147751/111._Confirm_sol_contact_details.png"></div></figure>

<p>5. You can review the applicant’s application for divorce and confirm whether the respondent has read the application for divorce/dissolution before proceeding.</p>

<p>6. Select the hyperlink to view the online application. This will open in a new window. You can then confirm whether the respondent has read the application.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147752/112._View_application.png"></div></figure>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The timescale to respond has changed in the new divorce law from 7 to 14 days</p>
</div>

<p>7. You are asked how you want to respond to the divorce/dissolution on behalf of your client. You should provide details on how to proceed.</p>

<p>If you are challenging the application, it is now known as ‘dispute’ instead of ‘defending’. You can only dispute the divorce/dissolution for 2 reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>jurisdiction</li>
  <li>validity of the marriage</li>
</ul>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147753/113._How_to_respond.png"></div></figure>

<p>8. If you choose to dispute the divorce/dissolution you will need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-d8b-answer-to-a-divorcedissolutionjudicial-separation-or-nullity-petitionapplication">file the D8B</a> to the court separately</p>

<p>9. You will be asked to agree that the courts of England and Wales have jurisdiction. You will see what the applicant indicated on their application.</p>

<p>10. If you select ‘No’ you should state the reason the respondent disagrees with the claimed jurisdiction and to provide the country where the respondent is mainly based.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147754/114._Jurisdiction.png"></div></figure>

<p>11. You are asked if there any other legal proceedings. If you answer ‘Yes’ to this question you are given a text box to include additional information on the other legal proceedings.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147755/115._AOS_other_legl_proceedings.png"></div></figure>

<p>12. Once you have completed all the questions you can view the check your answers screen.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147756/116._Check_answers_1.png"></div></figure>

<p>12. You can choose to change any of the questions if amendments are needed. If all the answers are correct, then select ‘Save AoS Response’.</p>

<p>It is important to note that you have only drafted your AoS at this stage and you have not yet fully submitted the AoS.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Submit the acknowledegment of service</h2>

<p>1. Select the appropriate option from the next steps drop down. You are given 3 options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Submit AoS’ – if you are ready to submit</li>
  <li>‘Update AoS’ – to make changes to your draft</li>
  <li>‘Update Contact Details’ – if you want to edit any of your details</li>
</ul>

<p>2. Select ‘Submit AoS’ if everything in the draft is correct.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147757/117._Submit_AOS.png"></div></figure>

<p>3. You can view the drafted AoS answers. If you want to make any changes you need to select ‘Cancel’ to return to the previous page and choose ‘Update AoS’.</p>

<p>4. If you are happy with everything, select continue</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147758/118._Check_answers_2.png"></div></figure>

<p>5. You are taken to the statement of truth where you must confirm if you are authorised by the respondent to sign this statement.</p>

<p>6. You need to provide the solicitor’s name and firm.</p>

<p>7. You have the option to add any additional comments in the bottom box.</p>

<p>8. Once complete select ‘Continue’</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147759/119._AOS_SoT.png"></div></figure>

<p>9. You are shown a check your answers page. If you need to change anything, select the change link on the right. Choosing ‘Previous’ will take you back to the previous page.</p>

<p>10. If you are ready select ‘Save and continue’.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147760/120._Check_answers_3.png"></div></figure>

<p>11. At the top of the case, a header will appear stating that the case number has been updated with the event ‘Submit AoS’.</p>

<p>12. Your AoS has been successfully submitted.</p>

<p>13. The only option you have available in next step drop down is update contact details</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147761/121._Updated_with_submit_AOS.png"></div></figure>

<p>The case will sit in the 20-week holding state which starts from the date the application was issued.</p>

<p>After 20 weeks have passed, the applicant or their solicitors are notified that they can apply for the conditional order.</p>

<p>If you have chosen to dispute you have 14 days to fill in your AoS. You then have 21 days to fill in your D8B and submit it to the court.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Offline acknowledgement of service</h2>

<p>If the applicant or their solicitors are unable to find the solicitor’s firm in the organisation search function, they can enter the solicitor’s information and address details manually.</p>

<p>This means that when the case is issued by court staff, you will receive the notice of proceedings, D8 application and the AoS through the post for completion.</p>

<p>1. Complete the paper acknowledgement of service and return this to the court by email or post.</p>

<p>2. Include a notice of acting with the completed acknowledgement of service.</p>

<p>3. If you want to dispute the divorce/dissolution, you need to provide the D8B to the court.</p>

<p>4. The D8B can either be sent at the same time as your acknowledgement of service or you can send it later.</p>

<p>5. You have 14 days to complete the AoS and then 21 days to provide your answer.</p>

<p>6. Once the AoS is received and processed by court staff, the system will move into the 20-week holding state.</p>

<p>7. Once the 20 weeks have passed, the applicant/applicants solicitor will be invited to apply for conditional order.</p>

<p>As an offline respondent solicitor, you will receive all future documents by post – entitlement order, conditional order and final order.</p>
