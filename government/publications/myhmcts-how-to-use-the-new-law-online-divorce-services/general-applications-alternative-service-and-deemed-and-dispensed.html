<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> General applications</h2>

<p>1. As an applicant’s solicitor, you can make an application asking for a court order or directions in the divorce proceedings.</p>

<p>2. You can upload an application at any point after the case has been submitted.</p>

<p>3. You need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-d11-application-notice">download the D11 application</a>.</p>

<p>4. The application notice (D11) form will be referred to a judge for an order or direction to be made.</p>

<p>5. You will need your fee account number so that the system can take payment for your application.</p>

<p>General applications can used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>expediting a divorce or dissolution</li>
  <li>submitting a divorce application without a marriage certificate</li>
  <li>filing of the ‘Answer out of time’</li>
  <li>costs</li>
  <li>serving by an alternative method</li>
  <li>amending a judicial decision</li>
</ul>

<p>Other forms you can upload to a case are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-d13b-statement-in-support-to-dispense-with-service-of-the-divorce-dissolution-nullity-judicial-separation-petition-on-the-respondent">D13B: Dispense with service application</a></p>

  </li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You cannot apply for bailiff service using general applications</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Application types</h2>

<h3>Alternative service applications</h3>

<p>This could be an application asking to serve the divorce application in a different way, such as by text, email or social media.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the court cannot serve by text or social media. This would be the responsibility of the applicant or applicant’s solicitor, or a third party.</p>

<p>A statement of truth and proof of service must be provided to the court.</p>

<p>It is important to note that if the request is for service by email, the judge will order the court to serve by email as this is fastest way with instant proof of service by the court. If you want to serve by email yourself you should clearly state this in your D11 application and outline the reasons why for the judge’s consideration.</p>

<h3>Application for costs</h3>

<p>This application asks the respondent to pay the cost of the divorce and/or legal fees incurred.</p>

<h3>Department of Work and Pension (DWP)</h3>

<p>This allows the court, on behalf of the applicant, to ask for a DWP disclosure of the respondent’s address, by serving an order on the DWP.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> How to apply</h2>

<p>1. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-d11-application-notice">Download the D11 application</a>.</p>

<p>2. Complete the D11 application making sure that parts 10 and 11 are both signed and dated.</p>

<p>3. On the next step drop down choose ‘general application’.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147690/102._Next_step_-_general_application.png"></div></figure>

<p>3. From the drop-down list you need to choose what the application is for (application type). The options are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>dispensed with service</li>
  <li>deemed service</li>
  <li>issue divorce without marriage certificate</li>
  <li>expedite</li>
  <li>other alternative service methods</li>
  <li>other</li>
</ul>

<p>4. If you choose ‘other’ you are given a free text box to provide more information about the application type.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147691/103._Select_application_type.png"></div></figure>

<p>5. Select the fee amount.</p>

<ul>
  <li>application on notice has a £167 fee if a hearing is required</li>
  <li>application without notice has a £53 fee</li>
</ul>

<p>If you choose the wrong option, the fee can be refunded and the court will request the different amount from you.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147692/104._Select_fee_type.png"></div></figure>

<p>6. Upload your application and any supporting documentation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>give a brief description of what the application is for</li>
  <li>date you are uploading the D11</li>
  <li>your comments</li>
  <li>file name</li>
  <li>file type</li>
  <li>any additional comments or instructions</li>
</ul>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147693/105._General_app_-_upload_doc.png"></div></figure>

<p>7. You are taken to the payment screen where your options are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fee account (enter your account and reference number)</li>
  <li>help with fees (this brings up another field for you to enter your help with fees reference)</li>
  <li>telephone (the CTSC will email you asking you to call to make payment of the D11, or you can call to pay over the phone once you have submitted your application)</li>
</ul>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147694/106._Genral_app_-_payment_1.png"></div></figure>

<p>8. An order summary screen shows the amount to pay for the application. This is based on your choice of fee type at the beginning of the application and the payment method.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147695/107._General_app___payment_2.png"></div></figure>

<h3>Check your answers</h3>

<p>1. You should review the answers given.</p>

<p>2. If you want to change any answers, select the change link at the right hand side of the section you want to edit.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147696/108._General_app___check_answers.png"></div></figure>

<p>3. If you have reviewed and are happy with the answers, select ‘save and continue’ to submit the application</p>

<p>4. The end state is ‘General Application received’.</p>

<p>5. A banner tick box appears at the top of the page to say the case has been updated with the event: General application.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147697/109._Event_update_-_general_application.png"></div></figure>

<p>The general application received state will be monitored by CTSC staff. Your application will be processed through to the judge.</p>

<p>You do not need to contact the CTSC to make them aware of your application.</p>

<p>Once the application has been referred to the judge and the judge has decided, the order is typed up by CTSC staff.</p>

<p>You can view the order in the documents tab under ‘General Order’.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Applications and orders</h2>

<p>Once your application has been considered by a legal advisor or a judge, they will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>approve the request</li>
  <li>reject the request</li>
  <li>ask for more information</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the nature of the application filed by the applicant, an order will be produced, and next steps provided. The case will remain digital.</p>

<p>If the judge requests any additional information the case will be put in a state called ‘Awaiting Judge Clarification’.</p>

<p>Once the response has been provided, an event called ‘response to Judge’ will be triggered and the application and response will go back to the judge for review.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Alternative service applications</h2>

<p>For alternative service applications, an order will be generated.</p>

<p>Once confirmation has been received by the applicant or solicitor, the caseworker will confirm service in CCD and the case moves to ‘Awaiting AOS’ for 14 working days, unless the respondent is overseas in which case the judge could ask for longer.</p>

<p>After ‘Awaiting AOS’ the case will move into the 20-week holding state.</p>

<p>Once the 20 weeks has passed you are notified that you can apply for a conditional order.</p>

<p>When applying for the conditional order you are either shown the AOS, if filed by the respondent, or you can apply for a conditional order.</p>

<p>If you apply for a conditional order, the legal advisor will look in the documents tab for the general order/service order or certificate of service.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Deemed and dispensed service applications</h2>

<h3>‘Deemed’ service application</h3>

<p>A deemed service application is where the respondent has not responded to the divorce application by filing an acknowledgement of service.</p>

<p>The applicant can apply for a deemed application for a court order to prove the application is ‘deemed to have been served’ anytime after the 14 days have passed.</p>

<p>The application is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-d11-application-notice">filed using a D11</a>. If accepted, the judge will deem that the application has been served to the respondent.</p>

<h3>‘Dispensed’ service application</h3>

<p>A dispensed service application is where all attempts to serve notice to the respondent have failed.</p>

<p>The applicant can apply to the court to have the service of the application ‘dispensed with’. The applicant will need to demonstrate that they have made all reasonable attempts and enquiries to find the respondent and serve the papers.</p>

<p>The application is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-d13b-statement-in-support-to-dispense-with-service-of-the-divorce-dissolution-nullity-judicial-separation-petition-on-the-respondent">filed using a D13B</a>.</p>

<p>You need to have submitted your application for divorce or dissolution first. Follow the guidance for <a class="govuk-link" href="#general-applications">general applications and alternative services</a>.</p>

<h3>Once you have submitted your application</h3>

<p>You will receive an email to notify you that your deemed or dispensed with service application has been either accepted or rejected.</p>

<p>1. Follow the link provided in the email to sign into your account and view the outcome of your service application.</p>

<p>2. You can view and download a copy of the order in the documents tab.</p>

<p>3. If the service application has been refused you can view the reason for this in the service order available in the documents tab.</p>

<p>4. If you provide additional evidence or a response to the refusal this will be sent back to the legal advisor using the response to service application functionality by CTSC staff.</p>

<p>5. The case will move to the AOS overdue state where you can then either respond to the refusal or put in a new application on a D11 using the general application functionality.</p>

<p>6. You are notified once the legal advisor has made a service decision.</p>

<p>7. The case will move to the 20-week holding state. This is counted from the date the application was issued.</p>

<p>8. Once the 20 weeks has passed you can draft your conditional order application.</p>

<p>9. If the service application is approved, select the ‘draft conditional order’ event from the drop down menu to ‘apply for your conditional order’.</p>

<p>10. You can continue the case without the respondent’s acknowledgement of service, using your deemed or dispensed order instead. See the applying for conditional order guidance on how to do this.</p>
