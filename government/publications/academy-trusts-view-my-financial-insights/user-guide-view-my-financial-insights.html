<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction to view my financial insights (VMFI)</h2>

<p>This section includes:</p>

<p>1.1. <a class="govuk-link" href="#1.1">VMFI’s core features</a><br>
1.2. <a class="govuk-link" href="#1.2">What’s new in VMFI?</a></p>

<p>View my financial insights (VMFI) is an online tool which helps schools view and improve their financial performance. It enables academy trusts and local authorities to see all their schools in one place and provides users with an automated assessment of their data based on similar schools. This assessment identifies areas with the greatest variance, providing users with a helpful starting to point to investigate, potentially leading to improved resource management.</p>

<p>VMFI is designed for a range of educational professionals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>finance directors or chief financial officers (CFOs)</li>
  <li>business managers</li>
  <li>governors or trustees</li>
  <li>school leadership teams</li>
  <li>local authorities</li>
  <li>school resource management advisers (SRMAs)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>VMFI’s core features</h3>

<p>VMFI enables you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>compare the financial performance of each school against a predetermined set of 30 statistically similar comparator schools (see section 3.3). There are 2 types of comparator school – one based on pupil characteristics and the other on the building attributes. For cost categories such as premises staff and services, the size and age of the building gave a more accurate comparison than using the number of pupils.</li>
  <li>analyse financial performance across 9 cost categories and over 30 sub-cost categories</li>
  <li>identify areas across your trust or LA which may require further attention through the ‘areas for investigation’ page</li>
  <li>assess risks based on the budget forecast return (academies only) on the ‘forecasts and risks’ page</li>
  <li>create your own set of comparator schools through the ‘select comparators’ tab</li>
  <li>the ability to edit your data locally to model different scenarios through the ‘data modelling’ tab</li>
  <li>create a high-level view of your integrated curriculum and financial planning (ICFP) metrics</li>
  <li>view the latest commercial resources, frameworks, financial guidance and training available through DfE to support financial decisions through the ‘commercial resources’ tab</li>
  <li>see tailored recommendations for each school based on the areas of greatest variance in spend when compared to similar schools</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Providing access for school resource management advisers</h3>

<p>For a school to grant a school resource management advisor (SRMA) access to their VMFI data, a user with a full access role should:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>go to the view your education data service and sign in using your IDAMs account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>select ‘Academies and schools financial reporting’ and then ‘View my financial insights (VMFI) tool’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>navigate to ‘Access for SRMA’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>click ‘Give access’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>select the SRMA supplier</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>select the advisor from pre-populated list</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to revoke access, select the ‘Remove’ option</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>SRMA names and their associated supplier will only show up once your SRMA has set up their IDAMS account. SRMAs should have received instructions from the internal DfE SRMA team on getting their IDAMS accounts set up.</p>

<p>SRMA users will be given a list of assigned schools, trusts or local authorities at this point. If you are an SRMA working with two or more educational providers, you can select the one you need to view.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Summary of finances (academies only)</h3>

<p>This summary report is available as a download within VMFI. It is based on the most recent budget forecast returns (BFR) and academies accounts return (AAR). The report is available to download in PDF or Excel format.</p>

<p>It provides quick insights into potential areas for improvement for your trust and can be easily shared amongst colleagues (for example, governors). It shows how your trust revenue reserves are forecasted to change and indicates the variances between your actual revenue reserves at the end of the year and your most recent forecast for that period.</p>

<p>For each school which has been part of the trust for the full financial year it highlights the top area for investigation based on widest variation in cost when compared to similar schools.</p>

<p>You can access the summary of finances report when you first log into the system. If you are already in the VMFI tool, you can click ‘view your education data’ in the top left-hand corner of the screen to return to this area.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>School resource management self-assessment tool (academies only)</h3>

<p>In the last two years VMFI has contained a pre-populated school resource management self-assessment tool (SRMSAT). This has now been placed within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://schools-financial-benchmarking.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">schools financial benchmarking site</a> and can be accessed within the ‘start a comparison’ section of the website once you have selected a school. We will no longer maintain a pre-populated SRMSAT within VMFI.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>How default comparator schools are selected</h3>

<p>VMFI compares schools against the 30 schools most statistically similar in your sector (academy or maintained). Each school is placed within two comparators groups, one based on pupil characteristics and the other on building characteristics. The reason for this is that the nature of the buildings drives some of the costs in schools more than the pupils within them.</p>

<p>The following logic is used for both comparator groups.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>The school is matched to the 60 schools that are most statistically similar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of those 60 schools, any in your region are automatically selected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most statistically similar schools from the rest of the group are then used to give a maximum of 30 schools.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach has been chosen to reflect user feedback that locality is an important factor in creating effective comparisons.</p>

<p><strong>Building characteristics</strong></p>

<p>This group is used to compare Utilities and Premises staff and services cost categories. The 30 default schools have been selected based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>school phase or type (nursery, primary, secondary, special, alternative provision/PRU and UTCs)</li>
  <li>boarding or non-boarding type</li>
  <li>region</li>
  <li>gross internal floor area</li>
  <li>average age of buildings</li>
  <li>whether it is a PFI school (for primary, secondary and special non-boarding)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pupil characteristics</strong></p>

<p>This group is used to compare the remaining seven cost categories (see section 3.2 for a full list). The 30 default schools have been selected based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>school phase or type (nursery, primary, secondary, special, alternative provision/PRU and UTCs)</li>
  <li>boarding or non-boarding type</li>
  <li>region</li>
  <li>number of pupils</li>
  <li>percentage of pupils eligible for free school meals</li>
  <li>percentage of SEN pupils, or proportion of various SEN provisions for special schools</li>
</ul>

<p>Under school phase, middle schools are included in the phase appropriate to their deemed status. All-through schools and post-16 colleges are defined as secondary schools.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>RAG (red, amber, green) ratings</h3>

<p><strong>What do the RAG ratings show</strong></p>

<p>The RAG ratings are an indicator of how your spending in the cost categories compares to schools within the below ‘close range’ definition.</p>

<p>For 3 cost categories (teaching and teaching support staff; educational supplies; educational ICT), red ratings are allocated for either relative overspending or underspending. Schools with an outstanding or good Ofsted rating are given an amber rating, not a red rating, for relative underspending in these cost categories.</p>

<p>For the other 6 cost categories, relatively low spending gives a green rating and high spending gives a red rating.</p>

<p>The table below provides a more detailed view on how the RAG ratings are allocated.</p>

<figcaption><p>Table providing a detailed view on how the red, amber, green (RAG) ratings are allocated in VMFI.</p></figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Where can you see the RAG ratings</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>on the ‘home’ tab and ‘areas for investigation’ page, you can see RAG ratings across your trust or local authority</li>
  <li>on the ‘trust/LA cost overview’ page, select the toggle titled ‘RAG status compared to similar schools’. This is only available for the ‘per pupil or m2’ view</li>
  <li>on the ‘school cost overview’ page, select the toggle titled ‘RAG status’. This is only available for the ‘per pupil or m2’ view</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How the RAG ratings are generated</strong></p>

<p>RAG ratings compare your school/s against comparator schools that fall within the below definitions of ‘close range’:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for the two building cost categories (premises staff and services, and utilities), comparator schools are considered as ‘close range’ for building characteristics when they are within +/- 10% of the gross internal floor area and +/- 20 years of the average age of buildings</li>
  <li>for all other cost categories, comparator schools are considered ‘close range’ for pupil characteristics when they are within +/- 25% of number of pupils, +/- 5% of % FSM and +/- 10% of % SEN</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don’t have 10 or more comparator schools within the ‘close range’ definition, VMFI will use all 30 of the most statistically similar schools (the default comparator schools).</p>

<p><strong>How the RAG ratings are generated in custom view</strong></p>

<p>In a custom view (where you have selected your own comparator schools), RAG ratings will only be generated if a minimum of 10 comparator schools have been selected. This ensures the RAG ratings provided are sufficiently robust.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>How VMFI apportions central services costs for MATs</h3>

<p>For academies within a MAT, the values for cost categories and sub-cost categories also include a share of trust central services costs where these costs have been reported in the accounts return.</p>

<p>Depending on the cost category, these central services costs are apportioned based on the number of pupils or gross internal floor area in the trust’s academies. This is to ensure all costs are held at school level, so that schools that pay for certain things directly themselves can compare with schools who have services provided by their trust and pay for it through a top-slice.</p>

<p>For comparator academies, the CFO’s email details will appear at the bottom right of the screen.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Select comparators</h2>

<p>The ‘select comparators’ tab allows you to select your own custom set of comparator schools. This will change the insights shown in the home tab.</p>

<p>To generate areas for investigation and a RAG rating, a minimum of 10 comparator schools must be selected for a given school. If less than 10 schools are chosen, insights will still be shown in the single cost category and school profile pages.</p>

<p><strong>Choosing comparator schools and generating custom views</strong></p>

<p>You can choose to select groups of up to 30 comparator schools for each school:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Select the tab ‘select comparators’, and you will go to the select comparator schools section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To begin, use the drop-down box to select a school you would like to build a comparison set for, and select the ‘continue’ button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This takes you to the select comparator school page which is divided into two columns:</p>
</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>the first column provides several ways to locate comparator schools. You can search by typing in specific names of trusts or individual schools. Alternatively, you can use the filters to select specific metrics</li>
  <li>the second column shows a list of schools that meet the inputs from the search or filters. Information on each school can be found by selecting ‘view more details’</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to add a school to your comparator list, select the ‘add to comparator list’ button next to that school. The number of schools you have chosen will show above the list. You can add up to a maximum of 30 schools.</p>

<p>If you want to remove a school from your comparator list, select the ‘remove from comparator list’ button next to that school.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>When you have selected the comparators required, select the ‘review my comparator list’ button. This page shows the list of the schools you have chosen as comparators. Comparators can be removed from this list or select the ‘add more comparators’ link at the bottom of the page to choose more comparators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the list is correct, select the ‘save custom comparator schools’ button to generate the custom view. A notification will appear to inform you that the custom comparators have been saved and a custom version of the dashboard is being generated. This will take some time as it involves recalculating all of VMFI’s data. While you are waiting for this version to be generated, you can continue using VMFI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the notification appears, select the green button labelled ‘Go to custom dashboard’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your custom view will default to the ‘School view’ home tab. The custom view will only contain comparators for the schools that you have created a custom comparator set for. As a result, the top 3 areas for investigation will only relate to the schools in the trust or local authority for which you have generated custom comparator sets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to the school view tab, to see the comparison charts and school profile information for your selected school.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>You can repeat the selection process to generate comparator sets for other schools within your trust or local authority.</p>

<p><strong>Custom view</strong></p>

<p>A notification appears telling you that you are looking at a custom view of comparators.</p>

<p><strong>Returning to default view</strong></p>

<p>Selecting the home tab or using the ‘Change school’ link will take you back to the default view.</p>

<p><strong>Saving and retrieving a custom view</strong></p>

<p>When you ‘save custom comparator schools’ for a school, these will be saved in VMFI and can be retrieved by going to the notification in the select comparator schools page for the school and selecting ‘Go to custom view’, you will not need to wait for it to be re-created.</p>

<p><strong>Accessing custom peer group view the next time you sign in</strong></p>

<p>When you sign out of VMFI and sign back in you will return to your default list of schools. However, your customised comparator groups are saved, and you can view them by selecting the ‘select comparators’ tab:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Select a school in your trust or local authority containing a comparator set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a custom comparator group has been generated, a notification will appear to show when the data was updated, and you can select ‘go to custom view’. This will take you to the ‘School view’ home tab.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Data modelling</h2>

<p>Data modelling lets you adjust non-financial and cost category data for each school in your trust or local authority to generate custom views incorporating these changes. Data changes made do not change the data submitted to DfE via data collections or returns.</p>

<p>To continue or review the data, choose a school, and select the ‘continue’ button.</p>

<p>Select a category to view default and custom values.</p>

<p>To adjust data within a category:</p>

<ul>
  <li>select adjust data in each category</li>
  <li>enter the new value in the custom value column. When adjusting cost category data, ensure all values are stated in actual values (£30,000 would be 30000)</li>
  <li>you can choose between showing the custom value or default value</li>
  <li>select ‘save custom values’</li>
  <li>the default value will appear in your custom view if no custom value has been entered</li>
  <li>if you want to adjust the data on another school, choose the school from the drop-down list and repeat the data modelling process</li>
  <li>to generate the custom view, select ‘save custom values’ below the list of categories. A notification will appear informing you that the custom data has been saved and a custom version of the dashboard is being generated. This will take some time as all of VMFI’s data on your account has to be recalculated. While you are waiting for this version to be generated, you can continue using VMFI. A further notification will appear when this has been completed</li>
  <li>when the notification appears, select the green button labelled ‘go to custom dashboard’</li>
  <li>your custom view will default to the ‘School view’ home tab</li>
</ul>

<p>When the non-financial metrics are adjusted, VMFI will recalculate the comparator set of academies.</p>

<p><strong>Custom view</strong></p>

<p>A notification appears telling you that you are looking at custom data.</p>

<p><strong>Returning to default view</strong></p>

<p>Values can be set to reset to default values by selecting ‘reset all values to default values’ and below the list of categories, select ‘save custom values’ (this can take some time), going to this custom view will be the default view for that school.</p>

<p><strong>Saving custom data</strong></p>

<p>When you have saved custom data, the values will be saved within VMFI. When there is an overnight reset, the view will automatically change to the default view.</p>

<p><strong>Accessing custom data view the next time you log in</strong></p>

<p>To view the customised data on a subsequent visit to VMFI:</p>

<ul>
  <li>go to data modelling</li>
  <li>choose a school which has custom data</li>
  <li>a notification will show to say who in the school has adjusted data. and the time with the option to ‘Go to custom view’</li>
  <li>select ‘Go to custom view’ to generate the custom view</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Curriculum and financial planning (ICFP)</h2>

<p>Integrated curriculum and financial planning (ICFP) is a management process that can help schools plan their curriculum based on the finances they have available. The ICFP tool available in VMFI is an introduction to this process.</p>

<p>Use the integrated curriculum and financial planning (ICFP) tool to help make your curriculum financially sustainable by measuring current curriculum spending and staffing structure finances.</p>

<p>The tool is pre-populated with data from the most recent financial returns and corresponding school and workforce census data held by the ESFA.</p>

<p>You will need to fill in some information relating to curriculum and finances. The tool will then provide a set of basic ICFP calculations.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/integrated-curriculum-and-financial-planning-icfp">There is detailed guidance on how ICFP can help you, as well as other ICFP tools</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Example calculation</strong></p>

<p>The tool generates an example based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the most recent accounts return data</li>
  <li>school and workforce census data</li>
  <li>example calculation model data  </li>
</ul>

<p>The example calculation uses the following model data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>percentage of time teachers spend teaching (contact ratio) of 78%</li>
  <li>timetabled periods of 25 for secondary and 10 for primary schools. Timetabled periods for primaries is based on 10 half-day teaching sessions</li>
</ul>

<p>You can amend both assumed figures later in the process.</p>

<p>To view the calculation users will be asked to select the school they wish to carry out the analysis for.</p>

<p><strong>Entering your own data</strong></p>

<p>After selecting continue, you can enter curriculum and finance data for the last school year (mandatory field) and the current year (optional). You can change the pre-populated census data and model data used in the example calculation.</p>

<p>You will be asked to enter the following curriculum data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>number of pupils on roll</li>
  <li>number of FTE teaching staff</li>
  <li>contact ratio</li>
  <li>number of timetabled periods</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be asked to enter the following year-on-year finance figures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>percentage change in teacher costs</li>
  <li>percentage change in other costs</li>
  <li>percentage changes in revenue</li>
</ul>

<p>The tool will present your calculation in a table, with comparative columns for the years you have entered data for. From this view, you can select ‘change’ next to the relevant field to amend the calculation.</p>

<p>Data changes made are local only and do not change the data submitted to DfE via data collections or returns.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Commercial resources</h2>
