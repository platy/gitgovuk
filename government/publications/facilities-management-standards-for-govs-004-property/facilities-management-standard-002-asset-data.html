<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> About this government functional standard</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Purpose of this standard</h3>

<p>The aim of this standard is to improve the quality, consistency, interoperability and usage of facilities management (FM) asset data throughout the government estate.</p>

<p>The key principle that informs this standard is that public sector organisations must be able to produce an asset register of all their FM assets and be aware of the condition and maintenance requirements of each asset.</p>

<p>This standard sets the following minimum requirements:</p>

<h4>1.1.1 Structure</h4>

<p>The requirements for FM asset registers and the parameters of assurance frameworks required to ensure ongoing validation of the data.</p>

<p>The aim is to ensure that across public sector organisations there is consistent FM asset data which is kept up to date.</p>

<h4>1.1.2 Systems</h4>

<p>The requirements for ownership and accessibility of FM asset data, along with the minimum requirements to ensure flexibility, interoperability and security of the data.</p>

<p>The aim is to ensure that public sector FM asset data is portable between organisations and suppliers.</p>

<h4>1.1.3 Usage</h4>

<p>the requirement that policies and procedures are in place to ensure the application of FM asset data to support decision-making and that facilities managers have the capacity, capability and responsibility to effectively utilise the FM asset data.</p>

<p>The aim is to ensure that public sector organisations leverage FM asset data to drive improvements in maintenance and service delivery.</p>

<p>The adoption of a standard across the public estate will help drive consistency and quality improvements via a common approach to FM asset data within the public sector.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Scope of this standard</h3>

<p>The Government FM asset data standard applies to property across government. This FM asset data standard is mandatory for central government organisations with property responsibilities, including Departments and their arm’s length bodies. Other public sector organisations might ﬁnd it useful to assess themselves against the same framework. It provides the foundation for consistent and efﬁcient use of asset data across all public sector bodies.</p>

<p>In this document, the term “asset” refers to an FM asset (that is, system/component) rather than a property asset (that is, building or land). Where property asset is meant, it will be clearly identiﬁed as such (see 3.1.1 for definition).</p>

<p>This standard covers the following elements related to asset data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data Structure – the data ﬁeld taxonomy and related asset hierarchies.</li>
  <li>Data Quality and Assurance – the process and governance around data coverage and completeness.</li>
  <li>Data Ownership and Access – the contractual data ownership and accessibility of data.</li>
  <li>Data Systems – the flexibility, interoperability and security of data systems.</li>
  <li>Data Usage – the application and decisions based on asset data.</li>
  <li>Team Capacity and Capability – the supporting teams’ capacity, capability and responsibility.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> Government standards references and related standards</h3>

<p>This FM asset data standard has been developed alongside a maturity tool and supporting guidance. The maturity tool is not mandated and has been designed to support assessments against this standard and to provide evidence to support any required case for change.</p>

<p>This standard is designed to set the minimum requirements for asset data across the government estate and not to replace existing speciﬁcations or legal requirements.</p>

<p>The following hierarchy of legislation and standards should be applied:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All applicable laws as relevant in the country where the asset is located.</li>
  <li>Organisational asset data standards that exceed this standard.</li>
  <li>Facilities Management Asset Data Standard (this document).</li>
</ul>

<p>This FM asset data standard is associated with the Government Functional Standard Gov S004: Property and forms part of the Governance and Management Framework for the Government Property Function. It is also aligned with the Government Property Data Standard Gov S004– PDS010, which details requirements related to property and building level data. In line with the functional standard, ‘organisation’ will be the generic term used to describe a government department, arm’s length body or any other entity that is agreed to be within the scope of this standard.</p>

<p>Property organisations and the Government Commercial Function are expected to maintain detailed, up-to-date operational standards and speciﬁcations as technology and legislation evolves, including Annexes A and B of the Crown Commercial Service FM Framework, NHS and Ministry of Defence standards. This FM asset data standard is not intended to duplicate these operational standards and it is expected that they will develop as business requirements evolve.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Rationale</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Context</h3>

<p>The public sector estate contains over 300,000 properties. It covers a wide range of organisations ranging from departments and their arm’s length bodies (ALBs), through non- departmental public bodies (NDPBs) to emergency services, local authorities and health authorities. Across the public sector estate there is a signiﬁcant spend related to FM with many suppliers.</p>

<p>The government’s FM Taskforce identiﬁed problems around departments’ and their arm’s length bodies’ asset registers and signalled that they represented signiﬁcant obstacles to improving FM.</p>

<p>Differing approaches on formats, ownership, management and governance of asset data lead to problems around incomplete asset transfers and the accuracy of data at contract expiry. In addition, they undermine the ability to compare and contrast between different departments, service providers, models of provision and to identify investment priorities.</p>

<p>The main risks that result are that decisions around asset maintenance and contract compliance, including poor delivery and performance relating to statutory, mandatory and health and safety tasks, will not be based on comprehensive, accurate and up-to-date information.</p>

<p>There is currently no estimate of the total number of FM assets, although it is likely to be several millions.</p>

<p>A common standard will address problems around asset data and will deliver improvements in how FM services are delivered.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Objectives of standard</h3>

<p>To achieve a consistent cross-government FM asset data standard and to facilitate a range of beneﬁts, objectives include but are not limited to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>2.2.1 Consistent reporting across government</strong> – improving aggregation and collation of asset data across organisations to facilitate cross-government comparison and evidence- based decision-making.</li>
  <li>
<strong>2.2.2 Improving reporting within organisations</strong> – suppliers applying consistent asset data standards to facilitate an improvement in FM reporting within organisations.</li>
  <li>
<strong>2.2.3 Improving data to support procurement</strong> – increasing transparency and accuracy of asset data to support contract pricing discussions with FM suppliers; increasing interoperability and transferability of data between FM suppliers when changing service providers.</li>
  <li>
<strong>2.2.4 Compliance and safety</strong> – enhancing transparency around mandatory and statutory maintenance to support safety and compliance monitoring.</li>
  <li>
<strong>2.2.5 Sustainability</strong> – supporting the government’s sustainability agenda through having more readily available asset data to support sustainability programmes.</li>
  <li>
<strong>2.2.6 Evidence-based investment decision-making</strong>– increased data availability and quality to inform and support evidence-based decision-making for asset maintenance investment, backlog maintenance and replacement costs optimisation.</li>
  <li>
<strong>2.2.7 Collaboration and knowledge sharing</strong> – a common standard and language across asset data will facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing between organisations.</li>
  <li>
<strong>2.2.8 Improved visibility and confidence in suppliers</strong> – increased data transparency between organisations and suppliers to reinforce conﬁdence in the services being provided.</li>
  <li>
<strong>2.2.9 Improved user experience</strong> – better asset data to contribute positively to FM delivery across the government estate, beneﬁtting the service user and enhancing employee experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Deﬁnitions and Application</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Deﬁnitions</h3>

<p>This standard has been developed to support consistency and improvement in the use of asset data across government. The corresponding maturity tool and guidance (FM_Asset_Data_ Maturity _Tool_v1 and FM_Asset_Data_Guidance_Document_v1) are designed to support organisations in assessing their compliance against this standard and to provide evidence to support any required case for change.</p>

<p>When applying this standard, the following deﬁnitions and principles should be used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>3.1.1 Definition of an asset</strong> – within this standard, assets are deﬁned as components of buildings, for example, elements of the building fabric, a boiler or a ﬁre alarm.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are referred to as non-strategic assets in Government Functional Standard GovS 004: Property to differentiate them from strategic property assets (land and buildings).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>3.1.2 Scope of asset data</strong> – the scope of assets covered by this standard is the built environment, including building fabric and mechanical and electrical assets. This standard does not cover the natural and non-built environment on sites.</li>
  <li>
<strong>3.1.3 Asset Register</strong> – an asset register is a list of all assets that contains information for all the data ﬁelds deﬁned in this standard.</li>
  <li>
<strong>3.1.3 Space types</strong> – this standard applies to all space types across government. It is noted that speciﬁc space types/estates will have speciﬁc requirements around asset data standards.</li>
  <li>
<strong>3.1.4 Delivery model neutral</strong> – this standard has been developed to be delivery model neutral and as such is applicable to outsourced, in-house or mixed economy service provision.</li>
  <li>
<strong>3.1.5 System transferable</strong> – this standard is transferable between data systems. The data structure can be assembled from multiple data tables within source systems. To be an asset register produced in accordance with this standard, the register shall include all core asset data ﬁelds from the table at 4.2.1.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Application</h3>

<p>When applying this standard, the following circumstances should be considered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>3.2.1 Tailoring for specific organisation requirement</strong> – this standard has been developed to promote consistency across organisations. If organisations have speciﬁc requirements which will require them to complement or deviate from this standard – for example, international estates, specialist space types and enhanced healthcare or service user focussed situations – they shall ensure that the structure will map back to the core asset data structure to maintain cross-government consistency.</li>
  <li>
<strong>3.2.2 Contract lifecycle</strong> – the processes and speciﬁcations which are agreed during the contracting of FM suppliers shall be adjusted to this standard when renegotiating contracts (for example, data structure, ownership and access, systems). The other elements of this standard (for example, assurance and quality, usage, team capacity and capability) shall be adopted as soon as practicable.</li>
  <li>
<strong>3.2.3 Portfolio Estates</strong> – this standard shall be applied to assets across the whole portfolio of the organisation’s estate. Where this includes various business units or ALBs with different FM arrangements, organisations may ﬁnd it useful to undertake separate maturity assessments for each one.</li>
  <li>
<strong>3.2.4 Data system</strong> – this standard is not related to the creation of a centralised database. As stated in 6.5 of Gov S004 “information on non-strategic assets shall be recorded in their own property management data systems”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Strategic property assets (land and buildings) shall be recorded in a central government database, in line with the information strategy (InSite platform).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Data Structure</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Data Structure Overview</h3>

<p>An asset register, containing complete and accurate data, forms the foundation of all FM services. Each organisation shall develop and maintain an asset register that includes a complete list of assets and is aligned to the data structure in this section. The asset register shall be available for organisations and suppliers to support the delivery and management of FM.</p>

<p>This section relates to the data structure of the asset register data.</p>

<p>The data structure shall be designed to work effectively with data capture systems, and with this standard, and to enable efﬁcient handling within the asset data management system.</p>

<p>The asset data structure covers the core asset data ﬁelds in ‘4.2.1 Core Asset Data Fields’ and additional suggested ﬁelds are listed in ‘4.2.2 ‘Non-Core’ Asset Data Fields’.</p>

<p>The asset data structure is deﬁned in the form of a table at 4.2.1 with the following headings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Field reference – a unique numeric reference for use within this standard.</li>
  <li>Data fields – the name of the data ﬁeld.</li>
  <li>Description – a description of what the ﬁeld is and what it relates to.</li>
  <li>Data Values Examples – an example value of the data which would be captured against each ﬁeld.</li>
  <li>Comments (including related specifications) – additional comments relating to each ﬁeld, including related speciﬁcations where relevant.</li>
  <li>Rationale – the reasons and uses behind the data captured in each ﬁeld.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Data Assurance and Quality</h2>

<p>Assurance is a systematic set of actions necessary to provide conﬁdence to senior leaders and stakeholders that work is controlled, on track to deliver and aligned with policy or the organisation’s strategy.</p>

<p>Each organisation shall have a strategy for assurance of their asset data. This might be overseen by a governance board or group in order to monitor the data assurance activity. This board should be responsible for deﬁning and implementing actions to improve data quality in relation to assets. This board should include representatives from all relevant teams, these might include FM teams, data teams and supplier teams.</p>

<p>Organisations shall have a deﬁned and consistent assurance framework which includes the following elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>5.1 Initial asset verification</strong> – to generate a complete asset register, a full asset veriﬁcation exercise might be required. This should include the transition and veriﬁcation of BIM asset data where possible.</li>
  <li>
<strong>5.2 Regular sampling of asset verifications</strong> – regular sample surveys of assets to monitor the data quality, coverage and completeness (frequency to be determined by the organisation). These surveys should sample different assets each time they are completed. Over time, these surveys should cover the full asset register, reducing the requirement for multiple full asset veriﬁcation surveys.</li>
  <li>
<strong>5.3 Change control/approvals processes for adding, removing or changing assets</strong> - to maintain the asset register coverage, a documented, understood and consistently applied change control process is required when making changes to the asset data. This shall include a change log detailing the reason for the change, the date, the requestor, the approver and ensure all the required data ﬁelds are completed.</li>
  <li>
<strong>5.4 Data quality checks</strong> – regular data quality checks (frequency to be determined by the organisation). These checks shall include data ﬁeld completeness, data consistency, identifying outlier values, identifying missing data. These might be completed by automated data quality algorithms, applying a set of business rules, or reviewing data quality dashboards.</li>
  <li>
<strong>5.5 Data update assurance</strong> – checks to verify and assure data prior to upload to data systems. This may be part of a data management process completed by suppliers or integrators.</li>
  <li>
<strong>5.6 Documentation</strong> – organisations shall create and hold the relevant supporting documentation regarding the asset data. This shall include documented assurance processes, governance terms of reference, data dictionaries and data workflow schematics. This documentation shall support the application of a consistent approach around asset data and the onboarding of new team members/suppliers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Data Ownership and Access</h2>

<p>The following standards shall be in place with respect to the ownership of and access to asset data.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>6.1 Data ownership</strong> – the asset data shall be contractually owned by the organisation, regardless of whether this data is managed in-house or by a supplier or integrator.</li>
  <li>
<strong>6.2 Data accessibility</strong> – the organisation shall have real-time access to the data within the asset management system to facilitate contract management, data assurance and evidence-based decision-making. This might either be via direct access to a supplier’s asset management system or via a common data platform with regular data pulls from a supplier’s systems. There shall be the ability to extract data from the asset management system either via manual data extracts or automated application programming interface (API) scripts.</li>
  <li>
<strong>6.3 Data access management</strong> – an approval process shall be put in place to control user access to the data including controlled read/write/edit permissions. User lists shall be documented along with user permissions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Data Systems</h2>

<p>The following standards should be in place with respect to the supporting data systems used for asset data.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>7.1 Data taxonomy/flexibility</strong> – the asset management system shall be flexible enough to adjust the data ﬁelds and data values to align to cross-government and organisation- speciﬁc standards.</li>
  <li>
<strong>7.2 Data interoperability/transferability</strong> – the asset management system shall facilitate interoperability of data between supplier and organisation data systems, both during the contract and upon completion of the contract, to facilitate readily transferring the data to new suppliers. This can be facilitated by adhering to the asset data structure standards to provide a consistent data structure between systems. The asset register should, as a minimum, be codiﬁed in line with this standard and be transferred using a Construction Operations Building information Exchange (COBie) ﬁle.</li>
  <li>
<strong>7.3 Common data platform</strong>– where required, the asset management system shall allow for aggregation of data from across multiple supplier systems to support organisation decision-making.</li>
  <li>
<strong>7.4 Data security</strong> – the data security requirements at a minimum shall meet ‘Service Continuity and Availability Management’ ISO 20000 standards or speciﬁc organisation data security standards where required. These shall be aligned to Digital, Data and Technology (GovS005) and Security (GovS007) functional standards.</li>
  <li>
<strong>7.5 Data management and backup</strong> – The data backup process shall meet ‘Service Continuity and Availability Management’ ISO 20000 standards and speciﬁc organisation data management standards. These shall be aligned to Digital, Data and Technology (GovS005) and Security (GovS007) functional standards.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Data Usage</h2>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/145302/fms002.jpeg"></div></figure>

<h3>Site</h3>

<p>A collection of one or more estate assets within a specific geographic boundary. A site must be under the management/ control of an individual Public Sector Organisation</p>

<h3>Building</h3>

<p>A property asset is a unique instance of a piece of public sector estate with physical characteristics and has a unique physical location, e.g. Building or Land.</p>

<h3>Floor</h3>

<p>The floor of the building the asset is located in</p>

<h3>Space</h3>

<p>A space is a unique definable area within a property asset. This can be an area of floor space in a building or an area of land.</p>

<h3>FM Asset</h3>

<p>A FM asset is a built, mechanical or electrical component of a building, for example building fabric, a boiler or a fire alarm this refers to assets which are maintained by a FM supplier.</p>
