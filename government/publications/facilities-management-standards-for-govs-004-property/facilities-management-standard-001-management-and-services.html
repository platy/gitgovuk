<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> About this government functional standard</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Purpose of this standard</h3>

<p>The aim of this standard is to improve quality, consistency and interoperability of facilities management (FM) services throughout the government estate.</p>

<p>The key principle that informs this standard is that public sector FM organisations are ﬁrst and foremost providers of FM services and must take full responsibility for the quality of the services they deliver.</p>

<p>This standard sets the following minimum requirements.</p>

<h4>1.1.1 Management</h4>

<p>The minimum requirement to ensure that the management arrangements for FM balance the needs of the organisation, service users and service providers.</p>

<p>The aim is to ensure that public sector FM organisations utilise recognised methods so that they are structured to provide a professional environment from which an increasingly professionalised FM workforce can deliver high quality services.</p>

<h4>1.1.2 Hard Services</h4>

<p>The minimum requirement to ensure operational availability, statutory compliance and prevent deterioration of assets while enhancing their sustainability.</p>

<p>The aim is to ensure that public sector FM organisations utilise recognised methods so that they have a clear understanding of their maintenance responsibilities and what they need to do to discharge those responsibilities.</p>

<h4>1.1.3 Soft Services</h4>

<p>The minimum requirement to ensure a productive, sanitary and secure environment for service users.</p>

<p>The aim is to ensure that public sector FM organisations utilise recognised methods so that they can demonstrate that they fully understand the requirements of the organisations they serve and arrange the delivery of appropriate services.</p>

<p>The adoption of a standard will help improve consistency and quality across the estate, through a common approach to FM across all asset classes of land and built assets within the public sector.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Scope of this standard</h3>

<p>This standard applies to property across government. This standard is mandatory for central government organisations with property responsibilities, including departments and their arm’s length bodies. Other public sector organisations might ﬁnd it useful to assess themselves against the same framework.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> Government standards references and related standards</h3>

<p>This standard has been developed alongside a maturity tool and supporting guidance. These documents are designed to support assessments against this standard and to provide evidence to support any required case for change.</p>

<p>This standard is designed to set the minimum requirements for FM services and their management across the public estate, and not to replace existing speciﬁcations or legal requirements.</p>

<p>In any event, the following hierarchy of legislation and standards should be applied:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All applicable laws are relevant in the country where the service is delivered.</li>
  <li>Organisational FM management or services standards that exceed this standard.</li>
  <li>FM Management and Services Standard (this document).</li>
</ul>

<p>This standard is associated with the Government Functional Standard for property, namely GovS 004: Property and forms part of the Governance and Management Framework for the Government Property Function. It provides a set of core standards to be utilised in the delivery of FM across the public estate. In line with the functional standard, ‘organisation’ will be the generic term used to describe a government department, arm’s length body or any other entity that is agreed to be within the scope of this standard.</p>

<p>Departments and the Government Commercial Function are expected to maintain detailed operational standards and speciﬁcations as technology and legislation evolves, such as Annexes A and B of the Crown Commercial Service (CCS) FM Framework and NHS standards. This FM standard is not intended to duplicate these operational standards and it is expected that they will develop as business requirements evolve.</p>

<p>This standard looks across the whole public estate and as such may not be appropriate for highly specialised property assets that sit only in one organisation. These specialised property assets may have their own standards in place, for example some parts of the clinical, military and scientiﬁc estates. Any such standards shall reference this standard, note deviations from it and demonstrate equivalence.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Rationale</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Context</h3>

<p>The public sector estate contains over 300,000 properties. It covers a wide range of organisations ranging from departments, and their arm’s length bodies (ALBs), through non- departmental public bodies (NDPBs) to emergency services, local authorities and health authorities. Across the public sector estate there is a signiﬁcant spend related to FM with many suppliers.</p>

<p>Properties across government have been subject to a wide range of standards in FM. These vary from industry standards, bespoke in-house standards and in some instances, to an absence of formal standards. This variation makes it difﬁcult to identify opportunities to collaborate, improve and innovate. A common standard will help to drive up the quality of the public estate and ensure a core minimum standard is adhered to. Property ownership and use is affected</p>

<p>by machinery of government and organisational changes at national, local and devolved levels. These will become simpler and faster to embed with common FM standards. The public estate also contains assets with usages that are highly diverse. As such, common core minimum standards and deﬁnitions will make it easier to understand variances and promote interoperability.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Deﬁnitions and Application</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Deﬁnitions</h3>

<p>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) deﬁnes facility management as the “organizational function which integrates people, place, and process within the built</p>

<p>environment with the purpose of improving the quality of life of people and the productivity of the core business.”</p>

<p>FM is usually classiﬁed in two categories – hard services and soft services.</p>

<p>Hard services primarily covers services to ﬁxed elements ‘attached’ to the building and that cannot easily be removed, such as repairing a leaking roof and servicing a boiler.</p>

<p>Soft services focus on the building environment and the user experience. They are generally services provided at the building such as cleaning and security.</p>

<p>Attached at Appendix 1 is a breakdown of FM services.</p>

<p>Increasingly, FM is becoming part of a wider, integrated ‘workplace services’ model, which incorporates aspects of human resources (HR) and information technology (IT).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Application</h3>

<p>This standard is based upon leading and established UK and international industry standards, including those from the British Standards Institution (BSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Where standards do not exist, reference to industry or professional bodies’ standards may act as a substitute. The standard is delivery model agnostic and can be applied across all delivery models, including in-house, outsourced, hybrid models and Private Finance Initiative (PFI).</p>

<p>The central government estate is varied and complex, with a range of different stakeholders involved. This standard is intended to be broad enough that it is equally applicable to the facilities manager for a single building through to the director of FM for a major government organisation with a large property portfolio.</p>

<p>This standard is focused on FM services in properties used for the provision of public services. Properties held purely for commercial return are excluded.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> FM Core Service Standard</h2>

<p>In this standard FM services fall into three key areas:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Management</h3>

<p>The minimum requirements to ensure that the management arrangements for FM balance the needs of the organisation, service users and service providers.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Hard Services</h3>

<p>The minimum requirements to ensure operational availability and statutory compliance and to prevent deterioration of assets whilst enhancing their sustainability.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> Soft Services</h3>

<p>The minimum requirements to ensure a productive, sanitary and secure environment for service users.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Introduction to Standards</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Standards</h3>

<p>There are a range of recognised standards that can apply to FM. Different standards have varying levels of importance, with Approved Codes of Practice (ACOPs) being a minimum standard to evidence compliance with certain health and safety requirements. This section outlines common standards and how they are applied in this document.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> International Organisation for Standardization</h3>

<p>The International Organisation for Standardization (ISO) is an independent, non-governmental organisation. Its membership consists of the standards organisations of 165 member countries. It works with experts from member countries’ standards boards to develop industry recognised and globally applicable standards. Where an ISO standard exists, it will be referenced in this standard. This standard will take priority over other developed standards due to their globally accepted nature. These standards are denoted by the ‘ISO’ preﬁx.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span> The British Standards Institution</h3>

<p>The British Standards Institution (BSI) is the national standards body of the UK. BSI produces technical standards applicable in the UK. These are often UK implementations of ISOs. These standards are denoted by starting with a ‘BS’ preﬁx.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span> Government Functional Standards</h3>

<p>A suite of standards to guide people that are working in and with the UK government. These functional standards exist to create a coherent, effective and mutually understood way of doing business within government organisations and across organisational boundaries, and to provide a stable basis for assurance, risk management and capability improvement. They support value for money for the taxpayer and continuity of implementation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span> Industry Standards/ Professional Bodies</h3>

<p>Where government, national or international standards do not exist, industry standards are used. These are primarily from industry or professional bodies, such as Institute of Workplace and Facilities Management (IWFM), Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), Building Engineering Services Association (BESA), Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) and Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span> Publicly Available Speciﬁcation</h3>

<p>A Publicly Available Speciﬁcation (PAS) is a fast-track standardisation document – the result of an expert consulting service from BSI. It deﬁnes good practice for a product, service or process. These standards have a ‘PAS’ preﬁx.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.7 </span> Approved Codes of Practice</h3>

<p>Approved Codes of Practice (ACOPs) describe preferred or recommended methods that can be used (or standards to be met) to comply with regulations and the duties imposed by the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act (1974). They are not law. As such, this document interprets them as standards.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>  Overarching Standard</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> Standards</h3>

<p>Industry has a globally recognised and accessible ISO standard for FM in ISO:41001. It provides a common understanding around key aspects including FM strategy and service delivery.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Management Standard</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span> Vocabulary and Terminology</h3>

<p>Standardised vocabulary should be used throughout the property lifecycle, including any externalised service delivery. A common vocabulary and use of terminology avoids ambiguity and misinterpretation. This supports interoperability across the organisations.</p>

<p>Each organisation shall adopt the use of the definitions contained in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/68167.html" rel="external">ISO 41011: 2018 – Facility</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/68167.html" rel="external">Management – Vocabulary</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span> Facilities Management Strategy</h3>

<p>Each organisation shall develop and maintain a FM strategy referenced within their Strategic Asset Management Plan (SAMP). These shall be developed to support organisational and operational requirements and follow a recognised standard.</p>

<p>An FM strategy helps to ensure the FM function:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is aligned with objectives, needs and constraints of the organisation’s core business</li>
  <li>is focused on improving the effectiveness of, and beneﬁts provided to the organisation by its facilities</li>
  <li>meets the needs of all stakeholders.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/68170.html" rel="external">ISO family of standards for facilities management</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rics.org/uk/upholding-professional-standards/sector-standards/real-estate/strategic-fm-framework/" rel="external">Royal Institution of Chartered</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rics.org/uk/upholding-professional-standards/sector-standards/real-estate/strategic-fm-framework/" rel="external">Surveyors (RICS)</a> provide comprehensive guidance for developing FM strategies. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-standard-for-property-govs-004">Government</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-standard-for-property-govs-004">Functional Standard Gov S004: Property details SAMP structure and content</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span> Facilities Management System</h3>

<p>Each organisation shall have a Management System in place for FM modelled on a recognised standard, with process maps for core FM Activities, as outlined in Appendix 1. A wider FM systems approach is also required, covering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>planning</li>
  <li>support</li>
  <li>operation</li>
  <li>performance evaluation and</li>
  <li>improvement.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/68021.html" rel="external">International Standards Organisation</a> family of standards for facilities management provides comprehensive guidelines for comparable services.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span> Quality Management System</h3>

<p>Each organisation and any supply chain partners used in delivery of FM require a quality management system in place. This quality system shall be used to demonstrate the organisation’s ability to consistently deliver to quality, legal and regulatory requirements. The quality management system in place shall cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>policies,</li>
  <li>processes and</li>
  <li>procedures</li>
</ul>

<p>which are required to evidence the meeting of regulatory needs and improving customer experience.</p>

<p>For further guidance, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.iso.org/iso-9001-quality-management.html" rel="external">ISO 9001 Quality Management System Standard</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.5 </span> Environmental Management System</h3>

<p>FM plays a key role in protecting and improving the environment. This is not just in relation to the UK’s commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, but the wider impacts that the built environment can have, for example: water conservation, recycling and waste management, and wider pollution. It can also play an important role in improving the environment, for example through increasing biodiversity and natural capital.</p>

<p>Each organisation shall account for how their FM arrangements support stewardship of the natural environment in their FM strategy.</p>

<p>For further guidance, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.iso.org/iso-14001-environmental-management.html" rel="external">ISO 14001 Environmental Management System Standard</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.6 </span> Understanding FM’s role in the wider business</h3>

<p>It is important for organisations to understand how FM influences and enables their core functions and the impact it can have on the quality of public services. All organisations rely on supporting processes, which are often critical to their core functions. FM integrates and optimises a broad spectrum of supporting processes and delivers their outputs (the facility services), which enable the demand organisation to focus on its primary activities.</p>

<p>The aim of FM is to ensure that this support is available in line with the organisation’s mission and strategy: for example in an appropriate form, deﬁned quality and quantity, and provided in a cost-effective manner.</p>

<p>For further guidance, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/71235.html" rel="external">ISO/TR 41013:2017 Facility Management. Scope, Key</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/71235.html" rel="external">Concepts and Beneﬁts</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.7 </span> Organisational and People Objectives</h3>

<p>Organisations should develop a plan for influencing users’ behaviours within a facility, in order to create a positive response to the environment, the organisation and others.</p>

<p>The plan should set out the synergies between the facility and its users, and how these will be aligned. It should articulate the value of the FM organisation in support of the organisation’s strategic objectives. It will help the facilities managers to identify ways in which facility improvements can incentivise desired behaviours, both in terms of outcomes and the contribution which the facility makes within the built environment.</p>

<span class="number">7.8 </span> Collaboration</h3>

<p>Effective FM relies on wide collaboration, within the organisation, across multiple government organisations, with the wider public sector, with building users and with the supply chain. It may vary between individual buildings or portfolios and by department or organisation.</p>

<p>It is particularly important to avoid variations in service delivery standards across an estate where users at some locations are accessing FM services that are not managed by their employer organisation. For example, by another government organisation or by a landlord.</p>

<p>Each organisation should have a plan in place for effective identiﬁcation, development and management of collaborative business relationships within or between organisations.</p>

<p>For further guidance, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/72798.html" rel="external">ISO 44001:2017 – Collaborative business relationships &amp;</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/72798.html" rel="external">Sourcing playbook</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.9 </span> Occupational Health</h3>

<p>Whether FM is delivered in-house or through the supply chain, each organisation is required to have a robust approach to occupational health in place. This approach needs to focus on ensuring employee and contractor safety, managing workplace risks and providing safe working conditions.</p>

<p>For further guidance, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.iso.org/iso-45001-occupational-health-and-safety.html" rel="external">ISO 45001</a> (replacement for BS OHSAS 1800).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.10 </span> Building User Welfare</h3>

<p>Each organisation shall provide welfare facilities and a working environment that is healthy and safe for everyone in the workplace, including those with disabilities.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Welfare facilities – an appropriate number of toilets and washbasins, arrangements for waste removal including sanitary waste, drinking water and having somewhere to rest and eat meals.</li>
  <li>A healthy working environment – a clean workplace with a reasonable working temperature, good ventilation, suitable lighting and the right amount of space and seating</li>
  <li>A safe workplace – well-maintained equipment, with no obstructions in floors and clear trafﬁc routes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.12 </span> Governance</h3>

<p>Governance ensures that organisations have the leadership, structures and decision-making processes in place which, when combined with the required capacity and capabilities, ensure the effective management of FM.</p>

<p>Good governance for FM enables the successful delivery of services in line with government policy and organisational objectives.</p>

<p>The governance of FM within a government organisation or arm’s length body should be an integral part of that organisation’s overall governance. Governance comprises prioritising, authorising, directing, empowering and overseeing management and should be undertaken across government, as well as within each organisation.</p>

<p>Each organisation shall establish a management framework to include authority limits, decision-making roles and rules, degree of autonomy, assurance needs, reporting structure, accountabilities and responsibilities, together with the arrangements for commissioning management services or practices deﬁned in this standard.</p>

<p>Each organisation shall identify the statutory duty holders for property and FM assets under their management and establish a management framework to ensure that the individuals with those roles are aware of their responsibilities, are competent and have the required resources to fulﬁl their obligations.</p>

<p>This establishment of the framework might form part of the development of a FM System as per section 7.3.</p>

<p>For further guidance, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-standard-for-property-govs-004">Government Functional Standard GovS 004: Property</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.13 </span> Management Structure</h3>

<p>Each organisation shall have an appropriate management structure with clearly deﬁned responsibilities, covering all core FM functions.</p>

<p>For further guidance, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/68021.html" rel="external">ISO 41001 – Facilities Management</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.14 </span> Intelligent Client Function</h3>

<p>FM is becoming an increasingly complex ﬁeld and organisations should deploy an ‘Intelligent Client Function’ to ensure quality, value for money and effective risk management.</p>

<p>This requires each organisation to have clearly deﬁned roles and responsibilities, and they are encouraged to build a ‘Centre of Expertise’ and have identiﬁable access to subject matter experts in key ﬁelds.</p>

<p>The ICF should be the ‘socket’ into which an FM delivery organisation plugs. It is the critical link between those delivering FM services and the organisation, to allow the FM delivery organisation to effectively understand and discharge the organisation’s priorities and policies.</p>

<p>The ICF should be separate to the delivery organisation and act as an independent professional on the client-side liaising with the FM delivery organisation and wider organisation.</p>

<p>For further guidance, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ice.org.uk/getattachment/disciplines-and-resources/best-practice/intelligent-client-capability-framework/intelligent-client-capability-framework.pdf.aspx" rel="external">Intelligent Client Capability Framework – Institution of Civil</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ice.org.uk/getattachment/disciplines-and-resources/best-practice/intelligent-client-capability-framework/intelligent-client-capability-framework.pdf.aspx" rel="external">Engineers (ICE)</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.15 </span> Contract Management</h3>

<p>Contract management is the process of managing and administrating the contract from contract award to the end of the service period, often referred to as the ‘operational period’. An effective and properly resourced contract management function is critical to ensure quality, value for money and effective risk management.</p>

<p>Contract managers shall be appropriately trained to discharge their duties effectively.</p>

<p>Accreditation for contract management roles should be in line with guidance from the Government Commercial Function. Each organisation shall ensure that all staff involved in the management of FM activities are accredited to the Contract Management Capability Programme, Foundation Level. All roles within the FM organisation should be assessed against the criteria in the Contract Management Capability Programme, and accreditation to Practitioner and Expert Level obtained for staff where warranted. The Senior Responsible Owner for a contract shall understand their responsibilities as deﬁned in the Government Commercial Function Contract Management Professional Standards.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.16 </span> Computer Aided Facilities Management and Integrated Workplace Management Systems</h3>

<p>Integrated Workplace Management Systems (IWMS) typically support business processes in real estate, asset and maintenance planning and control, space and workplace management, services management, project management, and sustainability management.</p>

<p>Computer Aided Facilities Management (CAFM) systems provide the facilities manager with the tools to track, plan, manage, and report on facilities information. CAFM systems combine and analyse complex data to improve FM practices throughout a variety of industries including government, healthcare, educational, commercial, and industrial environments. The CAFM system gives decision makers the ability to automate many of the data-intensive FM functions and typically results in continuous cost savings and improved utilisation of assets throughout their entire lifecycle.</p>

<p>Organisations implementing IWMS or CAFM solutions whether as a product or service shall ensure that they have a structured selection and implementation processes so that the extent and deliverables of the project are clear both to internal stakeholders and to suppliers.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.18 </span> Building Information Modelling</h3>

<p>Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a coordinated set of processes, supported by technology, that adds value through creating, managing and sharing a digital information model of an asset throughout its lifecycle.</p>

<p>Each organisation shall have an understanding of how BIM relates to their estate and develop policies and processes to enable the organisation to maintain and leverage BIM information in the delivery of FM services.</p>

<p>For further guidance, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/iso-19650-BIM/" rel="external">BS EN ISO 19650</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.19 </span> Building Management Systems</h3>

<p>Building management systems should be used and managed by FM teams where installed. When developing speciﬁcations, open protocol systems should be speciﬁed to prevent organisations being tied into maintenance contracts with little ability to compete and improve value for money.</p>

<p>Each organisation shall have an overview of all building management systems across their estate, develop policies and processes to enable the organisation to operate and maintain systems to optimise performance, and keep them secure from cyber threats.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.20 </span> Property Technology (PropTech) and Internet of Things (IoT)</h3>

<p>There are a number of technologies being produced that help the Real Estate and FM industries that can be described as ‘PropTech’. This is a rapidly developing ﬁeld in FM, and changing the way FM is designed and delivered.</p>

<p>PropTech should be deployed as part of wider organisational priorities and objectives, with a speciﬁc use case and return on investment identiﬁed.</p>

<p>New and emerging technology should undergo a pilot proof of concept trial before being rolled out.</p>

<p>They include but are not limited to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Artiﬁcial intelligence, such as chatbots and virtual assistants using voice-enabled commands to search properties.</li>
  <li>Big data analytics, with algorithms produced by collection tools that estimate property value, predict maintenance requirements and failures and help optimise design and value for money.</li>
  <li>Computer vision, used with special mapping robots and safety inspection drones.</li>
  <li>IoT access, replacing magnetic access cards with customised electronic bracelets, wearables, lanyards, and biometrics or mobile applications.</li>
  <li>IoT sensors, building occupancy sensors that can help facilities managers to understand how buildings are used, which in turn can be used to optimise the estate and the FM regime in place.</li>
  <li>Machine learning, used in smart buildings with sensors that collect IoT data to run more efﬁciently by analysing people’s movements and adapting to their needs (air conditioning and lighting, for example).</li>
  <li>Deep learning, used for market forecasts, investor analysis, and possibly even combined with blockchain technology to minimise the risks of buying and transaction times.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where deployed, each organisation shall ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>such technology has an open protocol where possible, to avoid expensive and restricted maintenance and change mechanisms</li>
  <li>possible security implications are risk assessed in accordance with the organisation’s IT and security policies and standards.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.21 </span> Sustainability</h3>

<p>The management of FM shall be directed towards compliance with government policy for the environment.</p>

<p>Each organisation shall have a sustainability plan in place for their FM activities and produce regular management information to feed into wider organisational sustainability reporting.</p>

<p>FM teams should have an established and deﬁned role and understand the key FM contributions to wider organisational sustainability.</p>

<p>Typical focus areas for FM include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>energy</li>
  <li>water</li>
  <li>waste management and recycling</li>
  <li>use of harmful chemicals</li>
  <li>single use plastics</li>
  <li>ethical sourcing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Organisations shall incorporate sustainable supply chain considerations when sourcing. Sustainability considerations should be made through the full supply chain, rather than those just directly applicable to the organisation and managed on a continuous improvement basis.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.5 </span> Forward Maintenance Register</h3>

<p>Forward Maintenance Register (FMR) means a schedule of FM assets showing their life expectancy; repair and replacement costs based on location; environmental conditions; level of maintenance; and operational hours to inform a phased replacement programme. It is sometimes known as a Planned Preventative Maintenance (PPM) survey, and is a register identifying short (1-2 years), medium (3-5 years) and long term (5 years plus) maintenance requirements and renewal works activities over the course of the maintenance contract, including any hand back obligations where necessary.</p>

<p>Organisations shall have a complete FM asset register, with granularity of the asset register depending on building criticality. FM asset condition and maintenance status shall be reviewed regularly in line with the organisation’s FM strategy, policy and priorities.</p>

<p>Forward planning is essential to the efﬁcient and effective operation of premises, and to ensure value for money. The FM asset data should be used to inform and evidence a forward maintenance register that sets out the lifecycle maintenance investment priorities for a minimum term of ﬁve years.</p>

<p>For further information on FM asset registers, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-standard-for-property-govs-004">Facilities Management Standard FMS</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-standard-for-property-govs-004">002: Asset Data</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.6 </span> Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment</h3>

<p>Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment (FF&amp;E) are the movable items that organisations use in business operations. FF&amp;E can include ofﬁce furniture, ﬁxtures that won’t damage a building structure when removed, and equipment such as computers. Accountants refer to FF&amp;E as long- term tangible assets (assets that last more than a year, which you can physically touch) that they value on a company’s balance sheet and use for tax purposes.</p>

<p>Some types of FF&amp;E are more challenging to maintain. Organisations might develop a standard catalogue of FF&amp;E with an associated inspection and maintenance regime to aid this.</p>

<p>A register of key aspects of FFE should be developed and maintained.</p>

<span class="number">9.7 </span> Mail Room</h3>

<p>Incoming and outgoing mail and parcels remain a common form of communication, and the timely delivery and sending of mail is essential in effectively supporting the wider organisation.</p>

<p>Organisations should consider implementing digital or hybrid mailrooms where possible and when it ﬁts with wider organisational priorities. An effective digital mailroom can signiﬁcantly increase efﬁciency and access to information.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.8 </span> Internal Planting</h3>

<p>Internal planting can create a more welcoming and productive environment.</p>

<p>Each organisation shall consider the beneﬁts of introducing biophilic design elements within their buildings.</p>

<p>Where internal planting is used, it shall be maintained in accordance with good horticultural practice.</p>

<p>For further guidance see, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bregroup.com/services/research/the-biophilic-office/" rel="external">Building Research Establishment (BRE) – Biophilic Ofﬁce</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.9 </span> Catering &amp; Vending</h3>

<p>Organisations shall provide access to clean drinking water and, where practical, shall provide an area to prepare and consume food.</p>

<p>Where catering and vending facilities are provided, organisations shall consider how they cater for different dietary requirements in an inclusive way.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.10 </span> Security</h3>

<p>A safe and secure environment is essential in effective FM, ensuring staff and visitors feel safe and security risks are mitigated appropriately.</p>

<p>Organisations shall ensure assets are secure and access is controlled as their business rules require.</p>

<p>Organisations shall undertake a security risk assessment for all operational assets and ensure appropriate security risk mitigations are in place, including access control, closed circuit television (CCTV) and in-person guarding where required.</p>

<p>Organisations shall regularly review these risk assessments and update them as required.</p>

<p>Organisations shall ensure that FM services related to security are in accordance with the requirements of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-functional-standard-govs-007-security">Government Functional Standard GovS 007: Security</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.11 </span> Reception</h3>

<p>A well-designed reception service ensures that visitors and service users are welcomed into a building and directed appropriately, and creates a lasting impression of the organisation.</p>

<p>Reception services within an organisation might be delivered by FM or operational teams as appropriate.</p>

<p>Organisations shall design and implement reception services for each building, taking account of the volume of visitors in the following categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>public service users</li>
  <li>business visitors</li>
  <li>staff</li>
  <li>members of the public</li>
  <li>senior UK and foreign politicians.</li>
</ul>

<p>These services should include appropriate management of the interfaces between the reception and security services to ensure that all visitors and staff receive a courteous and professional service.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.12 </span> Audio Visual Services / Equipment</h3>

<p>The provision of audio visual services and equipment is often a shared responsibility between IT, FM and operational teams.</p>

<p>Each organisation should ensure that roles and responsibilities for managing audio visual services and maintaining related equipment are clearly assigned.</p>
