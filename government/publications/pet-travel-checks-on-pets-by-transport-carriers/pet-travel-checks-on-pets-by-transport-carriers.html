<p>Pet dogs, cats and ferrets from other countries can enter Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) without quarantine as long as they follow the pet travel rules.</p>

<p>Pet carriers and checkers are responsible for checking the rules are met, and dealing with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>passengers with pets that do not meet the requirements</li>
  <li>suspected certification fraud</li>
  <li>suspect cases of disguised commercial activity</li>
  <li>suspect cases of smuggling, identified anytime between check-in and disembarking</li>
  <li>recording data of all pets that have travelled on their routes and any that have been found to be non-compliant</li>
</ul>

<h2>When the pet travel requirements apply</h2>

<p>The pet travel requirements apply to dogs, cats and ferrets coming to Great Britain that are both of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>travelling because their owner is travelling</li>
  <li>travelling at the same time as, or within 5 days of, their owner or an authorised person</li>
</ul>

<p>Pets coming to Great Britain must travel on approved routes with an authorised carrier. The exceptions are pets travelling from Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Republic of Ireland.</p>

<p>Recognised assistance dogs such as guide dogs can travel on additional routes. They have the same document and health checks as pet dogs, cats and ferrets.</p>

<h3>Commercial consignments</h3>

<p>Commercial movements are not covered by the pet travel requirements. Pet checkers do not have the authority to carry out official checks on commercial certificates.</p>

<p>Dogs, cats and ferrets coming to Great Britain will be categorised as commercial consignments if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the aim of the move is for the sale, transfer of ownership, or rehoming of the animal</li>
  <li>the pet is travelling more than five days before or after the owner or someone authorised by the owner</li>
</ul>

<p>Rescue dogs moved to Great Britain to be rehomed by an animal rescue centre or charity must be moved under the commercial importation rules.</p>

<p>The transport of dogs, cats and ferrets for commercial reasons is at the discretion of the carrier. All commercial consignments from non-EU countries must go through a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-border-control-posts-animal-and-animal-product-imports">UK Border Control Post</a>.</p>

<p>Commercial consignments attempting to travel under the pet travel requirements should be considered non-compliant with the requirements.</p>

<h3>Travelling for competition and shows</h3>

<p>Under the pet travel requirements, owners can travel with more than 5 pets if the pets are taking part in a competition, show or sporting event, or training for an event. In these situations, the pets must be aged over 6 months and meet the pet travel requirements.</p>

<p>The owner must provide written evidence and a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pet-travel-declaration-for-more-than-5-pets-moving-for-a-competition-or-show">declaration must accompany these pets</a>.</p>

<p>You should keep the declarations for one year for audit purposes.</p>

<h2>Authorisation for pet carriers</h2>

<p>There are 3 types of authorisation for transporting pets from abroad. Carrier and pet checking staff need to know about each of them.</p>

<h3>Required method of operation (<abbr title="Required method of operation">RMOP</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Required method of operation (<abbr title="Required method of operation">RMOP</abbr>) is an agreement that authorises carriers to transport pets to Great Britain. The <abbr title="Required method of operation">RMOP</abbr> describes how the checks will be carried out. An <abbr title="Required method of operation">RMOP</abbr> is needed by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>carriers transporting pet dogs, cats or ferrets using any route into an airport or port in Great Britain (this does not include Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Isle of Man and the Channel Islands)</li>
  <li>any third country airline transporting assistance animals to Great Britain</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Required method of operation">RMOP</abbr> is agreed between carriers and the Animal and Plant Health Agency (<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>). <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> monitors how the <abbr title="Required method of operation">RMOP</abbr> is put into practice.</p>

<h3>Approval of airport checkers and facilities</h3>

<p>This is an agreement between the airport, Border Force and <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>. Pet checkers at airports may carry out compliance checks for different carriers. Their systems and processes are authorised by <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> monitors compliance with the agreement and provides training.</p>

<h3>Memorandum of understanding (<abbr title="memorandum of understanding">MOU</abbr>) to transport assistance animals</h3>

<p>A memorandum of understanding (<abbr title="memorandum of understanding">MOU</abbr>) is an agreement that allows carriers to transport recognised assistance animals. It applies to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cruise and ferry operators based in the EU</li>
  <li>cruise operators based in third countries, with a port of embarking in the EU</li>
  <li>airlines based in the EU</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where checks take place</h2>

<p>Carriers will carry out checks at the locations specified in their <abbr title="Required method of operation">RMOP</abbr> or <abbr title="memorandum of understanding">MOU</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Sea and rail routes</h3>

<p>Ferry operators and Eurotunnel must check pets at their port of departure outside Great Britain.</p>

<p>Pet checkers will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do visual checks of vehicles carrying animals and compliance checks on pet cats, dogs and ferrets that are travelling to Great Britain</li>
  <li>identify and perform checks on foot passengers with pets where this is included as part of the <abbr title="Required method of operation">RMOP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>identify how unaccompanied pets will be handled</li>
</ul>

<p>Cruise operators are allowed to carry out checks on arrival in Great Britain. Depending on the length and ports of call of the journey, they will also have to check that dogs have had the tapeworm treatment before they disembark.</p>

<h3>Air routes</h3>

<p>Checks are carried out on arrival in Great Britain by authorised pet checkers. Carriers must identify animals that need checking and make sure they are presented on arrival.</p>

<h2>Listed and unlisted countries</h2>

<p>The pet travel requirements are different depending on where the pet is travelling from.</p>

<p>Countries are divided into categories according to their compliance with disease control, including rabies.</p>

<p>Countries are categorised as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>part 1 listed countries (EU and other specific third countries)</li>
  <li>part 2 listed countries (certain third countries)</li>
  <li>all other third countries (unlisted)</li>
</ul>

<p>Find out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/bring-pet-to-great-britain/listed-and-unlisted-countries">which countries are under each category</a>.</p>

<h2>Owner checks and authorisation</h2>

<p>Pets must be accompanied by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the owner</li>
  <li>someone authorised by the owner</li>
</ul>

<p>Authorisation is a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pet-travel-declaration-for-the-non-commercial-movement-of-animals">declaration completed and signed by the owner</a>, confirming that the animal is legally accompanied.</p>

<p>You must keep the declaration, or a copy of it, for one year.</p>

<p>If an owner pays someone to travel with their pet (including a pet transport service or courier), they must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meet the welfare in transport requirements</li>
  <li>hold the appropriate welfare in transport documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/animal-welfare#animal-welfare-during-transport">animal welfare requirements during transportation</a>.</p>

<h2>Pet travel documents</h2>

<p>Pets must be accompanied by one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>EU pet passport issued in Great Britain before 1 January 2021</li>
  <li>EU pet passport issued in the EU or Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>pet passport from another part 1 listed country</li>
  <li>GB pet health certificate</li>
  <li>animal health certificate (<abbr title="animal health certificate">AHC</abbr>) issued in Great Britain for travel to the EU and return to Great Britain up to 4 months after it was issued</li>
</ul>

<p>You are responsible for checking the animal and documents for compliance.</p>

<p>The same rules of preparation apply whether an animal travels on a pet passport or a health certificate. Entries in both must be made by a vet authorised to do so.</p>

<p>You may ask to see a boarding pass or flight ticket alongside the non-commercial declaration, to check if the owner or authorised person has travelled within 5 days of the pet.</p>

<h3>EU pet passport</h3>

<p>Great Britain accepts pet passports from all countries in the EU and some other part 1 listed countries.</p>

<p>There are 2 versions of EU pet passports. Most of them are the version introduced after 29 December 2014. There are still some older passports in circulation, they are valid for the life of the pet or until the passport is full.</p>

<p>The date of issue affects the number of checks you must complete. There are more security features in passports issued after 2014.</p>

<p>The number of pages in the passport depends on the country that issued it.</p>

<h4>Passports issued after 29 December 2014</h4>

<p>Passport numbers are printed on the front of the document and on every page. The date of issue is in section IV.</p>

<h4>Passports issued up to 29 December 2014</h4>

<p>Passport numbers are on the front of the document. The date of issue is in section III and is the same date as the microchip implantation. This date should be on or before 29 December 2014.</p>

<h4>Malta and Norway passports</h4>

<p>Because of legislative delays, Malta and Norway continued issuing the old format passports until:</p>

<ul>
  <li>15 June 2015 in Malta</li>
  <li>31 May 2016 in Norway</li>
</ul>

<h4>UK-issued passports printing error</h4>

<p>A small number of UK-issued EU pet passports have a printing error. The serial number on the outside page of the passport is different to the passport number printed on the inside pages.</p>

<p>The serial numbers of the passports affected are within the range of GB 800000 to GB 830000.</p>

<p>If you are presented with one of these passports, the pets can enter the country if they meet all the pet travel requirements.</p>

<p>For these passports you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>complete a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pet-travel-report-of-non-compliant-certificate">pet travel: non-compliance return for dogs, cats and ferrets (PETS08)</a>
</li>
  <li>tell the pet owner they must ask their official veterinarian (<abbr title="official veterinarian">OV</abbr>) for a new passport before travelling again with their pet</li>
</ul>

<h4>Information from the vet</h4>

<p>The vet must complete all the details required in the passport. Vets from third countries are not eligible to complete any section of EU passports except for the tapeworm treatment section.</p>

<p>If rabies vaccinations have been done in a third country, the pet needs a GB pet health certificate to enter Great Britain. The EU passport can then be used as the supporting document for the certificate.</p>

<p>If the pet does not have a GB pet health certificate it needs to be recorded as a non-compliance.</p>

<h3>Animal health certificate (<abbr title="animal health certificate">AHC</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="animal health certificates">AHCs</abbr> are accepted for pets returning to Great Britain from the EU and other part 1 listed countries for up to 4 months from the date of issue.</p>

<p>This certificate must have been issued in Great Britain and you must check it.</p>

<p>Vets must use the current animal health certificate, which they can access through their vet gateway website.</p>

<h3>GB pet health certificate</h3>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pet-travel-apply-for-a-gb-pet-health-certificate">GB pet health certificate</a> is used for pets entering Great Britain directly from part 2 listed and unlisted countries.</p>

<p>Certificates are valid for entry from the third country for up to 10 days from the date of the signature of the <abbr title="official veterinarian">OV</abbr>.</p>

<p>If a journey by sea into Great Britain takes more than 10 days, the period can be extended by the corresponding amount of time for the journey. Check for these details in your <abbr title="Required method of operation">RMOP</abbr> or <abbr title="memorandum of understanding">MOU</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Animal identification checks</h2>

<p>The first step in the preparation of the animal is identification. Details of both the owner and the animal must be specified in the pet travel document.</p>

<p>The pet must have either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a microchip</li>
  <li>a legible tattoo carried out before 3 July 2011</li>
</ul>

<p>If the microchip cannot be read by an International Standard Organisation (ISO) reader, the owner must supply a reader for the microchip.</p>

<p>If the microchip fails, the animal must have a new one implanted and the preparation process must be restarted.</p>

<p>Tattoos imprinted on or after 3 July 2011 cannot be accepted.</p>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>scan the identification of the animal or witness the owner doing so</li>
  <li>independently read and verify the identification</li>
  <li>check each animal’s identification against what is recorded in the pet passport or health certificate</li>
  <li>check that the date of the microchip or tattoo is before any other procedure, such as rabies vaccine, blood test or tapeworm treatment</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rabies vaccinations and blood tests</h2>

<p>The date of the rabies vaccination must be the same as or after the date of the animal’s microchip or tattoo.</p>

<p>The animal must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at least 12 weeks old at the time of vaccination - check this against the date of birth on the document</li>
  <li>vaccinated with a vaccine authorised for use in the country in which it was administered and according to the manufacturer’s datasheet for that country</li>
</ul>

<p>You can get the datasheet from the vaccine manufacturer or the <abbr title="official veterinarian">OV</abbr> who administered the vaccine.</p>

<p>The pet must have a valid vaccination at the time of travel and complete the necessary waiting time after vaccination.</p>

<h3>Post rabies vaccination waiting time from a listed country</h3>

<p>The waiting time after a rabies vaccination is 21 days for pets coming from part 1 listed countries (EU and other specific countries) and part 2 listed countries.</p>

<p>The waiting time is based on the day of vaccination being day 0, so day 1 is the day after vaccination. The animal can travel on day 21 after vaccination.</p>

<p>There is no waiting time for a booster vaccination if there has been no break in the vaccine cover.</p>

<p>If the pet is travelling less than 21 days after a booster vaccination, you must make sure there was no break in the vaccination cover.</p>

<h3>Vaccination rules for pets from unlisted countries</h3>

<p>Pets from unlisted third countries must wait at least 30 days after the rabies vaccination before they can have the blood test. The blood test checks for antibodies.</p>

<p>You must check that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at least 30 days have passed since the rabies vaccination was given before the blood sample was taken</li>
  <li>the result of the test is equal to or greater than 0.5IU/ml</li>
  <li>at least 3 calendar months have passed between the date of the blood sample draw and the date of entry into Great Britain (if prepared outside the EU or UK)</li>
  <li>the blood test was carried out at an approved laboratory</li>
</ul>

<p>Check the lists of:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/movement-pets/approved-rabies-serology-laboratories/approved-rabies-serology-laboratories_en" rel="external">approved laboratories in the EU</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rabies-blood-testing-laboratories-in-the-uk">approved laboratories in Great Britain</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/movement-pets/approved-rabies-serology-laboratories/non-eu-countries_en" rel="external">approved laboratories in other countries</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need the full vaccination history, but you must check:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the pre-blood sample vaccination is recorded, you must use the information to check that the correct order of preparation was followed</li>
  <li>if the current vaccination is after the blood sample was taken, and the details of the previous vaccination are not recorded, supporting documents must prove that there has been no break in the vaccination cover, and a previous vaccination was given at least 30 days before blood sampling</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pets returning to Great Britain from an unlisted third country</h3>

<p>Pets returning to Great Britain from an unlisted third country do not need to wait 3 months after the blood test to re-enter if they have a GB pet health certificate with supporting documentation issued in the EU or Great Britain. The supporting documents must show evidence of a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>microchip</li>
  <li>valid vaccination against rabies</li>
  <li>valid blood test with a satisfactory result carried out before the pet left Great Britain or the EU</li>
</ul>

<p>Evidence of a pet leaving Great Britain or the EU could include a flight ticket or booking information showing their outbound journey.</p>

<p>This rule also applies to pets that have travelled to an unlisted third country from the EU and then enter Great Britain. Supporting evidence may be part of the EU pet passport.</p>

<p>All information must be entered in the EU pet passport by an authorised vet. This must have been done before the pet left the EU.</p>

<h3>Checking blood test results</h3>

<p>Carriers and checkers should carry out random checks of blood test results to verify authenticity.</p>

<p>If you think blood test results are fraudulent or have been tampered with you must:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Contact the issuing laboratory to check the results.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Report any non-compliance to <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Refuse entry or travel.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Tapeworm treatment (dogs only)</h2>

<p>No treatment is needed for dogs travelling directly from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>Republic of Ireland</li>
  <li>Finland</li>
  <li>Malta</li>
  <li>Norway</li>
</ul>

<p>Dogs from any other country must be treated using an authorised product effective against the Echinococcus multilocularis tapeworm.</p>

<p>The treatment must be given by a vet no less than 24 hours and no more than 120 hours before the expected arrival time in Great Britain. The vet does not have to be an <abbr title="official veterinarian">OV</abbr>.</p>

<p>If the 120 hours are exceeded during the journey or while waiting to board, the dog is allowed to travel, but it must not leave the transport or travel crate after check-in.</p>

<p>Where the time of treatment has not been given, the animal is allowed to travel if you can see that 24 hours will have elapsed and 120 hours not be exceeded before arrival in Great Britain.</p>

<p>If these requirements are not met it must be recorded as a non-compliance. You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>stop the pet from entering</li>
  <li>complete section 3 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pet-travel-report-of-non-compliant-certificate">pet travel: non-compliance return for dogs, cats and ferrets (PETS08)</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Dogs travelling on cruise ships must have received the treatment as agreed in the <abbr title="Required method of operation">RMOP</abbr> or <abbr title="memorandum of understanding">MOU</abbr> prior to disembarking in Great Britain.</p>

<h2>How to check pet passports</h2>

<p>Make sure the passport has been filled in with the correct information for each section.</p>

<h3>Section I: details of ownership</h3>

<p>The owner must be over 16, and their details must be recorded in the passport.</p>

<p>Passports issued after 29 December 2014 require the owner’s signature.</p>

<p>The owner’s phone number is optional.</p>

<h3>Section II: description of animal</h3>

<p>The animal’s date of birth is required.</p>

<h3>Section III: marking of animal</h3>

<p>The date of the microchip implantation or tattoo must be recorded.</p>

<h4>2013 passport: marking of animal</h4>

<p>The date of chip reading can be entered by the certifying vet if the date of microchipping is not known. This date must prove the microchip was implanted before any preparations began. It must be the same as or before the rabies vaccination.</p>

<p>The certifying vet should delete the option that does not apply, to show the date that is being declared. If both options are left open, it would not be a reason to refuse an animal entry into the country if it passes all other checks.</p>

<p>The section III page should be laminated by the certifying vet when it has been filled in. If this has not been done, record it as a non-compliance.</p>

<h4>2003 passport: marking of animal</h4>

<p>Where the date of microchipping was not known, the vet was allowed to enter ‘before (full date of relevant rabies vaccination)’.</p>

<p>Any amendment in the passport must be signed and stamped by the amending vet.</p>

<h3>Section IV or V: rabies vaccination</h3>

<p>The rabies vaccination must be recorded in the passport.</p>

<h4>2013 passport: rabies vaccination</h4>

<p>In 2013 passports you must check that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it has been signed by the vet, and completed with the vet’s full contact details</li>
  <li>if a rabies vaccination sticker is used, the sticker has been laminated</li>
  <li>the ‘valid from’ field has been filled in with the date from which the pet is eligible to travel following the waiting period</li>
</ul>

<p>In passports issued in Great Britain, the <abbr title="official veterinarian">OV</abbr> stamp by itself is not enough because it does not include full contact details. If the <abbr title="official veterinarian">OV</abbr> stamp is used, the other required details must be filled in.</p>

<p>The ‘valid from’ box does not need to be completed for booster vaccinations if the current vaccination was on or before the ‘valid until’ date of the previous vaccine. The primary or previous vaccination must have been given after identification of the animal, to be deemed relevant to the preparation of the animal.</p>

<h4>2003 passport: rabies vaccination</h4>

<p>In 2003 passports you must check that the vaccination has been signed and stamped by the vet.</p>

<p>There is no ‘valid from’ box to check in 2003 passports.</p>

<h4>Replacement passports: rabies vaccination</h4>

<p>Replacement passports only need to include the latest rabies vaccination.</p>

<p>If 21 days have not passed before travel, the owner will need to present their old passport as well. You can then verify that the recorded vaccine is a booster and not a primary vaccination.</p>

<p>If the need for a replacement is because section VII (anti-echinococcus treatment) is full, a passport can be issued in which only the microchip details are duplicated, and the latest tapeworm treatment is recorded. In these cases, both passports must be presented for checks.</p>

<h3>Section V or VI: rabies blood test</h3>

<p>The blood test result must be recorded in the passport.</p>

<p>If the pre-blood sample vaccination is recorded, you must check that the correct order of preparation was followed:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Microchip.</li>
  <li>Rabies vaccination.</li>
  <li>Blood test.</li>
</ol>

<p>You need to check supporting documents if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the passport lists the vaccination being given after the blood sample</li>
  <li>the details of the vaccination (given before the date of the blood sample) are not recorded in the passport</li>
</ul>

<p>Supporting documents must show that a valid previous vaccination was given at least 30 days before blood sampling. There should be no break in the vaccination cover following the blood test. Any primary or previous vaccination must have been given after identification of the animal.</p>

<p>You do not need to check for the full vaccination history.</p>

<h3>Section VII: echinococcus tapeworm treatment (dogs only)</h3>

<p>Each entry must be signed and stamped by the administering vet.</p>

<h2>How to check health certificates</h2>

<p>You must make sure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all relevant health declarations have been completed</li>
  <li>the certificate is original</li>
  <li>the certificate has been signed, dated and stamped by an <abbr title="official veterinarian">OV</abbr> and, where applicable, the competent authority (this section is at the end of the certificate)</li>
  <li>original or certified copies of the identification and vaccination details and result of the rabies blood test (where required) are attached to or presented alongside the certificate</li>
  <li>all supporting documents record the identification number (microchip or tattoo) of the animal</li>
</ul>

<p>If these supporting documents are not presented with the health certificate, the animal cannot enter the country. You must record this as a non-compliance.</p>

<h3>Vet endorsement</h3>

<p>If the vet who completes the certificate is not an <abbr title="official veterinarian">OV</abbr>, the certificate must be endorsed by the competent authority.</p>

<p>This means that if the first box ‘Official veterinarian/Authorised veterinarian’ has been completed and stamped with a veterinary practice stamp only, the certificate will also need an endorsement. This ‘Endorsement by the competent authority’ box must be completed by a government vet using an official stamp for that country.</p>

<h3>Part I: description of the animal, where it is from and where it is going</h3>

<p>You must check that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>boxes 1.1 and 1.5 show the same name of owner</li>
  <li>there is proof of the owner or authorised person’s movement within 5 days</li>
  <li>box 1.28 is completed and includes the identification number and date of birth of the animal</li>
</ul>

<h3>Part II: recording the microchip (‘transponder’) or tattoo</h3>

<p>The microchip must have been verified by a vet before any entry is made on a certificate.</p>

<p>The date of the chip reading is acceptable if it was done before any relevant vaccination or testing is carried out.</p>

<h3>Part II: rabies vaccination</h3>

<p>Details of the rabies vaccination must be entered into part II of the certificate.</p>

<p>You must check these details have been entered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>date of vaccination</li>
  <li>name and manufacturer of vaccine</li>
  <li>batch number of the vaccine</li>
</ul>

<p>Cross reference these details against the proof of rabies vaccination from the vet. If the details do not match, stop the pet from entering and record it as a non-compliance.</p>

<h4>‘Vaccination from’ box</h4>

<p>The ‘from’ box records the date from which the pet is eligible to travel.</p>

<p>If the vaccination is a booster, the ‘validity of vaccine from’ box does not have to be completed.</p>

<p>You may need to check the date of the previous vaccine, to make sure the booster is valid. The required time intervals between rabies vaccinations will vary depending on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the licensed datasheet for each specific vaccine</li>
  <li>what country the vaccine was licensed and administered in</li>
  <li>if the preceding vaccination was a primary vaccination or a booster</li>
</ul>

<p>You can check <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.noahcompendium.co.uk/datasheets" rel="external">datasheets for drugs licensed for use in the UK</a> on the NOAH website. For any other datasheets, check the drug company’s website or contact them.</p>

<p>You must only accept a previous vaccine if the current vaccination was on or before the ‘valid until’ date of the previous vaccine.</p>

<p>If the animal is coming from an unlisted third country and requires a blood sample, the ‘from’ box should state validity as 21 days after vaccination.</p>

<h4>‘Vaccination to’ box</h4>

<p>This must show the date the vaccine expires. Supporting documents showing vaccination history and the animal’s identification number must be presented with the health certificate.</p>

<h4>‘Blood sampling’ box</h4>

<p>The date of any blood samples taken for antibody testing must be recorded in the relevant table in part II of the certificate. You must check the details against the rabies antibody test certificate (issued by the approved laboratory). This certificate is a supporting document.</p>

<p>If the details do not match, stop the pet from entering and record it as a non-compliance.</p>

<p>If checkers think blood test results are fraudulent or have been tampered with, they must check with the issuing laboratory and report any non-compliance to <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Part II: tapeworm treatment</h3>

<p>The treatment must be entered in part II.4 of the health certificate, including the date and time. Each entry must have the name, stamp and signature of the vet.</p>

<p>Tapeworm treatment can be certified by any registered vet, this may be different to the <abbr title="official veterinarian">OV</abbr> or endorsing veterinarian who signs the certificate.</p>

<p>The vet should have recorded tapeworm treatments by completing the table in section II.4. This section should be used to record subsequent treatments for further travel within the EU and the return to Great Britain.</p>

<h3>Additional certificate for cats from Australia</h3>

<p>As well as the health certificate, cats travelling from Australia must have an additional Hendra virus certificate. This is to confirm the cat has not been exposed to the virus in the 60 days before it left.</p>

<p>The Australian Department of Agriculture must issue the certificate before travel.</p>

<h3>Dogs and cats from Peninsular Malaysia</h3>

<p>Dogs and cats from Malaysia (Peninsula) must have a health certificate from the Malaysian veterinary authorities confirming the cat or dog has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>had no contact with pigs during the 60 days before travel</li>
  <li>not been anywhere during the past 60 days where any case of Nipah disease has been confirmed</li>
  <li>had a negative result to an IgC capture ELISA test carried out in a laboratory approved by the competency veterinary authority for testing for antibodies against the Nipah disease viruses - the test must have been done on a sample of blood taken within 10 days of travel</li>
</ul>

<p>The original health certificate must accompany the dog or cat to Great Britain.</p>

<h2>F1 hybrid cats and dogs</h2>

<p>An F1 hybrid cat or dog cannot enter Great Britain using the pet travel rules.</p>

<p>These animals need an import licence and must enter into a zoo-approved quarantine premises.</p>

<p>An import licence will only be issued after the quarantine premises and carrying agent have confirmed they will house and transport the animals when they arrive into Great Britain.</p>

<h2>Assistance dogs</h2>

<p>‘Recognised assistance dogs’ are dogs that have been trained to help people with disabilities.</p>

<p>Emotional support animals are not recognised assistance dogs.</p>

<p>Carriers are legally obliged to transport recognised assistance dogs under UK and EU law. Assistance dogs are usually trained by organisations that are members of:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.assistancedogsinternational.org/members/programs-search/" rel="external">Assistance Dogs International</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.igdf.org.uk/closest-dog-guide-providers/" rel="external">International Guide Dog Federation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Recognised assistance dogs must fully comply with the pet travel requirements.</p>

<h3>Ferry and cruise operators: assistance dogs</h3>

<p>Ferry and cruise operators in the EU must transport recognised assistance dogs into Great Britain according to the <abbr title="memorandum of understanding">MOU</abbr> they have agreed with <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Third country operators that transport assistance dogs coming from outside of the EU and disembarking first in the UK, must operate under an <abbr title="Required method of operation">RMOP</abbr> on approved routes.</p>

<h4>Notifying <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> of arrivals of assistance dogs: sea carriers</h4>

<p>Carriers must notify <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> of the planned arrival date of an assistance dog, including a list of all ports of call in Great Britain for that journey. Notification must be before arrival, and at the latest at the time of embarking.</p>

<p>Notification must be sent by email to: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:imports@apha.gov.uk">imports@apha.gov.uk</a></p>

<h4>Pet checks on assistance dogs: sea carriers</h4>

<p>Checks on the identification and documentation of assistance dogs are the same as for pets travelling under the pet travel requirements.</p>

<h4>Tapeworm treatment of assistance dogs: sea carriers</h4>

<p>Assistance dogs accompanying passengers on cruise ships may need tapeworm treatment during the journey. Treatment during the voyage is not needed if any of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the ship calls only at ports in Great Britain, Northern Ireland, Finland, the Republic of Ireland, Norway or Malta</li>
  <li>the total journey is shorter than 120 hours since the dog’s first treatment in Great Britain</li>
  <li>the dog does not leave the ship during the voyage</li>
</ul>

<h4>Non-compliant assistance dogs: sea carriers</h4>

<p>The carrier must inform the dog’s owner, <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> and the relevant local authority (at the port where the dog disembarks) of the non-compliance as soon as possible.</p>

<p>For cruises that start and end in Great Britain, the owner must make arrangements to transfer the dog to the nearest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rabies-quarantine-authorised-premises-and-carriers">quarantine facilities</a>.</p>

<p>The dog should remain on the ship or in a holding area while awaiting transfer to the quarantine vehicle.</p>

<p>For cruises that start and end in the EU, with a port of call in Great Britain, the carrier must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure the dog remains on board the ship where possible</li>
  <li>tell the owner that the dog may have to go into quarantine if they disembark in Great Britain</li>
  <li>get written confirmation from the owner that the dog will not disembark in Great Britain</li>
</ul>

<p>The carrier must inform <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> and the local authority if the owner disembarks with a non-compliant assistance dog.</p>

<h3>Air carriers: assistance dogs</h3>

<p>Air carriers can transport recognised assistance dogs in the cabin of aircraft.</p>

<p>All airports must provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>support for people with recognised assistance dogs to travel between destinations</li>
  <li>checking facilities to confirm assistance dogs meet the pet travel requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>Details of these will be in the <abbr title="memorandum of understanding">MOU</abbr> between <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> and the carrier.</p>

<h4>Pet checks on assistance dogs by air carriers</h4>

<p>Compliance of assistance dogs is checked on arrival at the airport by the persons with restricted mobility (PRM) provider. At larger airports, checks may be managed by authorised pet checkers instead.</p>

<p>Assistance dogs travelling with airlines that are not community air carriers must enter on approved carriers with an approved route.</p>

<h4>Non-compliant assistance dogs: air carriers</h4>

<p>If the assistance dog is found to be non-compliant with the pet travel requirements you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>inform the dog’s owner, <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> and the local authority at the arrival airport of the failure as soon as possible</li>
  <li>detain the dog in the agreed facility - listed in the <abbr title="memorandum of understanding">MOU</abbr> or <abbr title="Required method of operation">RMOP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>arrange for the dog to be transferred to the nearest suitable <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rabies-quarantine-authorised-premises-and-carriers">quarantine premises</a> in accordance with the <abbr title="memorandum of understanding">MOU</abbr> or <abbr title="Required method of operation">RMOP</abbr> and under the direction of the local authority</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dealing with non-compliances</h2>

<p>Non-compliance means any failure to comply with the pet travel requirements. This includes failures related to preparation of the animal, incorrect documents or conditions of entry.</p>

<p>Depending on the nature of the non-compliance the animal may or may not be allowed to travel or enter Great Britain. You must record each case as a failed check and report it to <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>.</p>

<p>In each case you need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>give the reason for failure to the pet owner or authorised person</li>
  <li>provide help and information to those whose animals are not allowed to travel</li>
</ul>

<h3>Completing non-compliance paperwork</h3>

<p>You must complete a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pet-travel-report-of-non-compliant-certificate">pet travel: non-compliance return for dogs, cats and ferrets (PETS08)</a> for any pet that fails the checks.</p>

<p>You can use one PETS08 form for multiple animals belonging to the same owner if the same non-compliance is discovered for each animal. You must provide a copy of the PETS08 to the owner.</p>

<p>You must keep copies of the PETS08 and any non-compliant paperwork for at least 6 months.</p>

<p>You must email a copy of the completed PETS08 form to <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> at: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PetTravelSchemeDataRecord@apha.gov.uk">PetTravelSchemeDataRecord@apha.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>Non-compliances on the PETS08 are separated into 3 sections depending on the severity of the non-compliance.</p>

<h4>Sections 1 and 2</h4>

<p>Section 1 is for minor administrative non-compliances where pets are still allowed to travel and can be accepted into Great Britain.</p>

<p>You must record these non-compliances on the PETS08 form and keep copies, but no further action is needed.</p>

<p>Section 2 is for omissions where the carrier or checker must request confirmation of treatment from the administering vet, using the PETS09 form.</p>

<p>Once you’ve received treatment confirmation from the vet, you can allow pets to travel and enter Great Britain. You must record the non-compliances on the PETS08 and keep copies.</p>

<p>For both section 1 and 2 non-compliances, the owner must sign the PETS08 form to confirm they understand that they will not be able to travel into Great Britain again until the paperwork is officially amended or replaced. Make sure the form has been signed before you take copies.</p>

<h4>Discretions</h4>

<p>When pets are allowed to travel or enter Great Britain following section 1 and 2 non-compliances it is known as a discretion.</p>

<p>It’s up to carriers and checkers to develop a system for recording and checking discretions, so that animals are not accepted on the same documentation again. If an owner does not fix a non-compliance in their documentation after a discretion, you should not allow the animal to travel.</p>

<h4>Section 3</h4>

<p>Section 3 is for serious non-compliances in the paperwork or presentation of the animal. You must not allow these pets to travel or enter Great Britain. You must also select what action you have taken. For example, you refused to allow the animal to travel.</p>

<p>For serious non-compliances relating to paperwork or suspected fraudulent documentation, email a PETS08 and a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pet-travel-report-of-non-compliant-certificate">report of non-compliant pet passport or health certificate form (IV62)</a> to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PetTravelSchemeDataRecord@apha.gov.uk">PetTravelSchemeDataRecord@apha.gov.uk</a></p>

<h3>Unlawful commercial movements</h3>

<p>Traders sometimes try to abuse the pet travel requirements to bring dogs, especially puppies, into Great Britain to sell.</p>

<p>If you suspect this type of non-compliance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do not allow the animals to travel or enter Great Britain</li>
  <li>contact Trading Standards and <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>complete section 3 on the PETS08 form</li>
</ul>

<p>If travel is allowed but you suspect commercial activity and cannot prove it, inform <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pet-travel-report-of-non-compliant-certificate">report of non-compliant pet passport or health certificate form (IV62)</a>.</p>

<h4>Common indicators of unlawful commercial movements</h4>

<p>Be especially vigilant when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the pet is not accompanied by the owner named in the passport or by a person with written authorisation from the owner</li>
  <li>the pet is not travelling with an owner or authorised person and does not have a supplementary health certificate</li>
  <li>the owner is a frequent importer of dogs or cats, with regular weekly or monthly movements of different dogs and cats</li>
  <li>the issuing vet page is not completed in a pet passport</li>
  <li>owner information is not completed in a pet passport</li>
  <li>animals are vaccinated at less than 12 weeks of age - if you suspect this, despite having the correct documents, you should report it to <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pet-travel-report-of-non-compliant-certificate">report of non-compliant pet passport or health certificate form (IV62)</a>
</li>
  <li>the pet is travelling from a third country, where the pet is not travelling within 5 days of the owner or authorised person</li>
</ul>

<h2>Suspected smuggling and fraud</h2>

<p>Carriers and checkers need to identify suspect cases of smuggling and fraud.</p>

<p>You will have received training in relation to smuggling awareness and detection as part of the training for the pet travel requirements.</p>

<h3>Potential forms of smuggling</h3>

<p>The 4 common types of pet smuggling are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>unintentional</li>
  <li>intentional and individual</li>
  <li>intentional and organised</li>
  <li>following a failed pet check</li>
</ul>

<h4>Unintentional</h4>

<p>Some people believe there is free access to bring your pets into Great Britain. They usually make no attempt to disguise the fact that they are bringing pets into the country.</p>

<h4>Intentional and individual</h4>

<p>There are individual cases of smuggling by pet owners that want to avoid quarantine.</p>

<h4>Intentional and organised</h4>

<p>Organised smuggling is carried out on behalf of a third party to bring pets or other animals into Great Britain illegally. Certain routes may be targeted as they are thought of as easier options. It is important to maintain consistently high level vigilance on all routes.</p>

<h4>Failed pets check</h4>

<p>An owner of a pet that has failed its check may attempt to hide the pet and travel with another carrier.</p>

<h3>How to identify and prevent smuggling</h3>

<p>To identify and prevent unintentional illegal imports, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide good information at the first point of contact with the passenger, and repeat it when they book their travel</li>
  <li>train all contact staff about the pet travel requirements</li>
  <li>provide accessible information, take into account the passenger’s ability to understand the rules and whether or not they speak English</li>
</ul>

<p>Intentional smuggling is more difficult to identify. It requires a well-trained team of staff who can confidently identify and respond to suspicious cases at any point of the journey.</p>

<h4>Identifying smuggling on sea and rail vehicle routes</h4>

<p>At the point of embarking, carry out a visual check of the occupants of the vehicle and the contents. If you have any suspicions about the behaviour of the occupants or the vehicle’s contents, ask the driver if there is an animal in the vehicle.</p>

<p>If you’re still suspicious after this enquiry, arrange an external visual inspection of the vehicle as soon as possible. Contact <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> or Border Force for advice about this.</p>

<p>Your terms and conditions for transport should be clear that you will refuse travel if you believe an animal is being smuggled.</p>

<p>Animals are often crudely concealed under a cloth, like a rug, in the back of a car. Frequently the animal is in a pet carrier hidden under other items or in a closed box.</p>

<p>Other signs of smuggling include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pet foods and accessories</li>
  <li>indications on the interior of the car such as chewing or scratch damage or pet hairs on the fabric</li>
  <li>car boots that have extra ventilation such as being partly open or hatchback parcel shelves not in the normal position</li>
</ul>

<p>If you suspect smuggling, inform the relevant local authority and the local <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> office of the details of the vehicle before it arrives in Great Britain.</p>

<h4>Identifying smuggling on air routes</h4>

<p>You should convey information about identifying smuggling on air routes during <abbr title="Required method of operation">RMOP</abbr> negotiations. This could include carrying out a visual check of passengers and luggage at the point of check in and embarking.</p>

<p>If airline staff have any suspicion about the behaviour of the passenger or the luggage contents, they can ask the passenger if they are in possession of an animal. If the suspicions remain, ask the police or customs and immigration authorities for help.</p>

<p>Make sure airline staff know how to manage suspect cases of smuggling identified at any time between check in and disembarking in Great Britain.</p>

<p>If a passenger has not notified the airline or checking staff that they’re travelling with an animal, this is a non-compliance. The animal must be held by the carrier until inspection can be arranged or the animal is removed by an official.</p>

<h3>Suspected fraud</h3>

<p>Pet carriers and checkers must be familiar with the documents needed to bring pets into Great Britain. They must check the documents thoroughly.</p>

<p>You do not need to be able to identify particular breeds of cat and dog, but there will be cases where a suspect document prompts a closer check of the details and a crosscheck of the pet.</p>

<p>Where pet carriers or checkers suspect a document is fraudulent, they must refuse it, and speak to a supervisor or <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>. For sea or rail routes a vehicle block could then be placed with the other carriers and the matter referred to the local authority.</p>

<p>Examples of fraud could include where documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are not original, for example, a colour photocopy</li>
  <li>have been tampered with, for example an extra number inserted in the microchip box, or a label has been tampered with</li>
  <li>have been unnecessarily amended</li>
  <li>are incorrectly signed and stamped</li>
  <li>have a description that does not match the pet presented with them</li>
  <li>include a passport issued by a non-EU vet</li>
  <li>show rabies vaccination and travel certification was done earlier than 12 weeks</li>
  <li>are blank passports issued by one EU member state, completed in another member state</li>
  <li>are passports issued where the animal has originated in an unlisted third country and not complied with additional requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>If you suspect a pet passport or health certificate is fraudulent, you can email a copy to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:imports@apha.gov.uk">imports@apha.gov.uk</a> for validation.</p>

<p>You must follow up your email with a phone call to your <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> contact for an immediate response. If outside of working hours, call the local authority.</p>

<p>If you have any doubt about an entry on the document, and cannot satisfy yourself of its validity, you should consider it a non-compliance and refuse travel. You should advise the pet owners of their options.</p>

<p>Report all cases of suspected fraud to <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pet-travel-report-of-non-compliant-certificate">report of non-compliant pet passport or health certificate form (IV62)</a> and attach copies of the documents.</p>

<h2>Data recording</h2>

<p>Carriers and checkers must submit returns to <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> to record the total number of pets that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have travelled</li>
  <li>are non-compliant</li>
</ul>

<p>Carriers must submit to <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a completed form in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://petscarriers.defra.gov.uk/logon.asp" rel="external">pets statistic websystem</a> as stated in their <abbr title="Required method of operation">RMOP</abbr> authorisation, using the login and password given in their approval letter</li>
  <li>a pet travel: non-compliance return for dogs, cats and ferrets (PETS08), whenever one is issued</li>
  <li>throughput figures for all pet travel movements at the end of each month - figures include nil returns and a breakdown of whether the animals were dogs, cats, ferrets or assistance dogs</li>
</ul>

<p>All checkers and carriers must submit throughput figures, including those only authorised to accept recognised assistance dogs.</p>

<p>Email non-compliance returns and throughput figures to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PetTravelSchemeDataRecord@apha.gov.uk">PetTravelSchemeDataRecord@apha.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Identifying and checking animals not travelling as pets</h2>

<p>The transport of dogs, cats and ferrets for commercial reasons is at the discretion of the carrier. All commercial consignments from non-EU countries must go through a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-border-control-posts-animal-and-animal-product-imports">UK Border Control Post</a>.</p>

<p>Pet checkers do not have the authority to carry out official checks on commercial certificates. Commercial consignments attempting to travel under the pet travel requirements will be non-compliant with the requirements.</p>

<p>Reporting these non-compliant cases will enable <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> to take action against the issuing vet where appropriate.</p>

<h3>Commercial movements of pets</h3>

<p>The health status of any dog or cat being transported for commerce must be compliant with requirements under the Pets Regulation 576/2013.</p>

<h3>Pets entering Great Britain to go into quarantine</h3>

<p>Animals can be imported into Great Britain to go into an approved quarantine kennel with an import licence. You do not need to check animals that have an import licence.</p>

<p>A boarding document and red label will be provided to all animals coming into Great Britain with a valid import licence. This document allows the airlines, sea or rail carriers to transport the animal.</p>

<p>The back of the document gives a list of conditions attached to the licence. Any animal presented with this document should be identified as a quarantine animal and managed accordingly on arrival in Great Britain.</p>

<h3>Stowaways</h3>

<p>If you find animals stowed away, you must either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>inform the local authority and have the animal quarantined in Great Britain</li>
  <li>return the animal to its country of origin - you must keep the animal securely while you get permission from the competent authority of the country of origin to hand it over at the port where it originally embarked</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dead pets</h2>

<p>If a pet dies outside Great Britain, before check-in, it can be brought back if it has been cremated. The ashes do not need an <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> licence.</p>

<p>If the owner wants to bring the body of their pet back they will need to complete an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-products-and-pathogens-application-for-import-licence">import application form</a>.</p>

<p>The owner must email the form to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:imports@apha.gov.uk">imports@apha.gov.uk</a></p>

<h3>Pets that die during the journey</h3>

<p>If an animal dies while travelling by rail or sea, the owner can continue their journey with the body of their pet.</p>

<p>If an animal is found dead on arrival after a flight, you may do pet travel checks before releasing the body to the owner.</p>

<p>If the owner does not want the body, the animal must be disposed of as clinical waste.</p>

<h2>Animal welfare</h2>

<p>Animals must be fit for the intended journey and transported in conditions that will not cause them unnecessary suffering.</p>

<p>Carrier staff are not expected to make a detailed assessment of an animal’s health or welfare. However, you should not allow an animal that appears unfit to travel.</p>

<p>A carrier can specify requirements under their own terms and conditions before transporting an animal. For example, they may require the declaration ‘clinical examination’ in the pet passport to be completed by a vet before transportation.</p>

<p>On longer ferry crossings, owners’ vehicles should be parked in the best place in the hold for the welfare of their pet.</p>

<p>Carriers can assess whether an animal’s needs are met by checking that the pet crate, carrier or dog guard:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is sturdy enough to prevent escape</li>
  <li>has enough space for the animal to move</li>
  <li>gives access to water</li>
  <li>has enough holes for ventilation</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Required method of operation">RMOP</abbr> does not require a strategy for managing animal welfare. However, carriers must meet the requirements set out in legislation, and can tell customers they will not transport pets that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are too confined</li>
  <li>are not restrained in a crate or pet carrier</li>
  <li>appear to be at high risk of heat or cold stress</li>
  <li>are ill</li>
</ul>
