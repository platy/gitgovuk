<h2>General</h2>

<p><strong>Where can I watch the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund briefing event held on 26 April 2022?</strong></p>

<p>You can find the briefing event recording and corresponding slides at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ktn-uk.org/events/net-zero-hydrogen-fund-briefing-event/" rel="external">ktn-uk.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong>I have a question about this competition or would like to check if we’re within scope or eligible. Who can I speak with?</strong></p>

<p>You can get in touch with the Innovate UK customer support service by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:support@iuk.ukri.org">support@iuk.ukri.org</a>
</li>
  <li>phone: 0300 321 4357</li>
</ul>

<p>Phone lines are open from 9am to 12:30pm and 1:30pm to 5pm, Monday to Friday (excluding bank holidays).</p>

<p>Innovate UK receive a high number of calls and emails closer to the competition close date. Please allow sufficient time to complete your application.</p>

<p><strong>How can we find partners to work with on our project?</strong></p>

<p>As part of the <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr>, we are not running any networking events. We’re expecting applications to be near market, and to have project partners in place as a result.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>Is it a requirement that hydrogen production must be operating by 2025?</strong></p>

<p>No. The requirement is to be delivering hydrogen by 2030 latest. Your proposal for strand 1 must demonstrate how you will develop a credible project that will contribute to the at-scale production of low carbon hydrogen by 2025.</p>

<p>The questions are designed for all project types and it is recognised that for blue <abbr title="molecular hydrogen">H2</abbr> production, if <abbr title="front end engineering design">FEED</abbr> studies are not yet underway, the 2025 production aspiration would not be met. However, a project could contribute by, for example, planning to take Financial Investment Decision (<abbr title="Financial Investment Decision">FID</abbr>) by 2025.</p>

<p><strong>Will there be another funding window for <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> strand 1?</strong></p>

<p>We anticipate that there will be another <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> strand 1 (<abbr title="development expenditure">DEVEX</abbr>) funding window early next year. Please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://custom-eur.cvent.com/1EEE3F7178EC486E8926B23F55A0B125/files/3ca25b7b2c1b46cda61548db42061f03.pdf?_ga=2.57507946.1988738899.1652366589-669891222.1641319844%22" rel="external"><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> hydrogen funding landscape infographic</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Can the same project apply for strand 1 and strand 2 at the same time?</strong></p>

<p>No. Strand 1 aims to grow the future of hydrogen projects in the UK through supporting front end engineering design (<abbr title="front end engineering design">FEED</abbr>) and post-<abbr title="front end engineering design">FEED</abbr> studies.</p>

<p>Strand 2 is for low carbon hydrogen projects that can deploy on the basis of capital expenditure support and are able to start construction rapidly. Strand 2 projects do not require a hydrogen specific business model.</p>

<p>Projects will be able to apply to strand 1 and then apply to a later window of strand 2, if applicable.</p>

<p><strong>Where can I get more information about the different <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> strands?</strong></p>

<p>Please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://custom-eur.cvent.com/1EEE3F7178EC486E8926B23F55A0B125/files/3ca25b7b2c1b46cda61548db42061f03.pdf?_ga=2.57507946.1988738899.1652366589-669891222.1641319844%22" rel="external"><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> hydrogen funding landscape infographic</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p><strong>When are projects expected to start?</strong></p>

<p>Projects that are successful are expected to start 1 January 2023.</p>

<p>There are a number of documents and financial checks that are required between being informed you are successful and project start date.</p>

<p><strong>When are projects expected to finish?</strong></p>

<p>Successful projects are expected to start 1 January 2022 and can last between 6 and 15 months. Projects must end by 31 March 2024.</p>

<p>For further information read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://apply-for-innovation-funding.service.gov.uk/competition/1150/overview#eligibility" rel="external">eligibility section</a> of the competition brief:</p>

<p><strong>We may require an overseas subcontractor. Will we still be eligible?</strong></p>

<p>Project grant holders must carry out work in the UK but can subcontract overseas if needed.</p>

<p>You will need to provide justification within your application and ensure the value is appropriate to the total project costs.</p>

<p>For further information, read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://apply-for-innovation-funding.service.gov.uk/competition/1150/overview#eligibility" rel="external">eligibility section</a> of the competition brief.</p>

<p><strong>We believe we are eligible for the <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> Strand 1, but we’re a start up without any trading history. Can we still apply?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, you can still apply. As a start-up, you will need to provide evidence of funds available to start the project from yourselves or investors by sharing your bank statement and/or a letter of comfort if this will be a third-party investment. Please note that the funds that need to be before the start of the project is: total project costs or project length* 3 months. 3 months is because <abbr title="Innovate UK">IUK</abbr> pays 3 months in arrears.</p>

<p><strong>We are a micro company. How much can we claim?</strong></p>

<p>For developmental expenditure (<abbr title="development expenditure">DEVEX</abbr>) support, you could get funding of up to 50% of your eligible project costs if you are a UK registered business of any size</p>

<p><strong>We are an academic organisation. How much can we claim?</strong></p>

<p>For developmental expenditure (<abbr title="development expenditure">DEVEX</abbr>) support, you could get funding of up to 80% of full economic costs (<abbr title="full economic costs">FEC</abbr>) if you are a Je-S registered institution such as an academic</p>

<p><strong>We are an <abbr title="Research and Technology Organisation">RTO</abbr>, charity, not for profit organisation, public sector organisation or research organisation. How much can we claim?</strong></p>

<p>For developmental expenditure (<abbr title="development expenditure">DEVEX</abbr>) support, you could get funding of up to 100% of your eligible project costs if you are an <abbr title="Research and Technology Organisation">RTO</abbr>, charity, not for profit organisation, public sector organisation or research organisation. Please note, this can only make up to 30% of the project total eligible cost, and you cannot be project lead.</p>

<p><strong>An applicant can lead on 2 applications (which must be materially different) and participate in a further two. Is this limit applied to each strand or across all four strands?</strong></p>

<p>This is per strand, in relation to strands 1 and 2 only. Further guidance for strands 3 and 4 will be provided at a later date. There is an expectation that successful projects from strand 1 may bid into later windows of the other <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> strands.</p>

<p><strong>We are a company registered in Northern Ireland. Are we eligible for funding?</strong></p>

<p>Any UK registered organisation should be eligible to apply for the funding. The <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> aligns with the safe harbour limits of the EU’s General Block Exemption Regulation (<abbr title="General Block Exemption Regulation">GBER</abbr>) so applicants impacted by the <abbr title="Northern Ireland Protocol">NI Protocol</abbr> have the same eligibility criteria and intervention rates as those under the UK’s subsidy control rules. The only difference would be the definition of company size guidance but this is explicitly stated in the competition brief.</p>

<p>We have attached a questionnaire for you to complete to determine if you’re impacted by the <abbr title="Northern Ireland Protocol">NI Protocol</abbr>. You can also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/complying-with-the-uks-international-obligations-on-subsidy-control-guidance-for-public-authorities/technical-guidance-on-the-uks-international-subsidy-control-commitments#section-6">refer to the following guidance</a> for further information as it will help with the questionnaire:</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>
<p><strong>What is the expected Financial Investment Decision (<abbr title="Financial Investment Decision">FID</abbr>) for projects applying to Strand 1?</strong></p>

<p>There is an expectation of Financial Investment Decision by March 2025 latest to support delivery of the hydrogen production targets.</p>

<p><strong>Is the <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> for developing or trialling hydrogen vehicles?</strong></p>

<p>No, the <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> is only available for low carbon hydrogen production.</p>

<h2>Dates</h2>
<p><strong>When does the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund strand 1 (<abbr title="development expenditure">DEVEX</abbr>) competition close?</strong></p>

<p>Net Zero Hydrogen Fund strand 1 (<abbr title="development expenditure">DEVEX</abbr>) will close on the 22 June 2022 at 11am.</p>

<h2>Supporting information</h2>
<p>No questions received so far</p>

<h2>Low carbon hydrogen&nbsp;standard</h2>

<p><strong>What is meant by the term ‘consignment’?</strong></p>

<p>Consignments are defined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-low-carbon-hydrogen-standard-emissions-reporting-and-sustainability-criteria#full-publication-update-history">draft low carbon hydrogen standard here</a>, under Section 7.1. This section includes examples of when <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> expect different feedstocks to be accounted for as separate consignments.</p>

<p><strong>Is my project allowed to use food or feed crops?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, some of your hydrogen consignments can be made using food or feed crops, but note that these crops must still meet the relevant sustainability criteria, and for any biomass pathway, at least 50% (by <abbr title="lower heating value">LHV</abbr> energy content) of the total hydrogen produced must be made using waste or residue biomass. Separate <abbr title="greenhouse gases">GHG</abbr> emission calculations should be conducted for each feedstock consignment, and reported in the dashboard tab of the Hydrogen Emissions Calculator along with their relative shares of the hydrogen output, in order to calculate an overall weighted average <abbr title="greenhouse gases">GHG</abbr> emissions result.</p>

<p><strong>Are the <abbr title="greenhouse gases">GHG</abbr> emission methodology rules for biomass routes exactly the same as the UK’s <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr>?</strong></p>

<p>The draft low carbon hydrogen standard takes the same approach as the UK’s Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation with regards to the biomass sustainability criteria, as well as the <abbr title="greenhouse gases">GHG</abbr> emissions calculation methodology relating to direct  land use change, plus separate reporting of indirect land use change emissions. The only current minor differences are that under the draft low carbon hydrogen standard , the following terms from the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> guidance cannot currently be claimed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bonus for using restored degraded land</li>
  <li>credit for soil carbon accumulation via improved agricultural management</li>
  <li>credit for avoided manure methane emissions</li>
</ul>
