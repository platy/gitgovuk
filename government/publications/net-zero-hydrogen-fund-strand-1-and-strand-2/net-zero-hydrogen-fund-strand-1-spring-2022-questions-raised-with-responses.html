<h2>General</h2>

<h3>Questions 18 May 2022</h3>

<p><strong>Where can I watch the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund briefing event held on 26 April 2022?</strong></p>

<p>You can find the briefing event recording and corresponding slides at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ktn-uk.org/events/net-zero-hydrogen-fund-briefing-event/" rel="external">ktn-uk.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong>I have a question about this competition or would like to check if we’re within scope or eligible. Who can I speak with?</strong></p>

<p>You can get in touch with the Innovate UK customer support service by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:support@iuk.ukri.org">support@iuk.ukri.org</a>
</li>
  <li>phone: 0300 321 4357</li>
</ul>

<p>Phone lines are open from 9am to 12:30pm and 1:30pm to 5pm, Monday to Friday (excluding bank holidays).</p>

<p>Innovate UK receive a high number of calls and emails closer to the competition close date. Please allow sufficient time to complete your application.</p>

<p><strong>How can we find partners to work with on our project?</strong></p>

<p>As part of the <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr>, we are not running any networking events. We’re expecting applications to be near market, and to have project partners in place as a result.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<h3>Questions 9 June 2022</h3>

<p><strong>Can projects applying for Strand 1 <abbr title="development expenditure">DEVEX</abbr> during this current application window (closing on 22 June 2022) also apply for Strand 3 <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> when the application window opens in Summer 2022?</strong></p>

<p>Strand 1 of the <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> aims to grow the pipeline of projects in the UK by providing development support for <abbr title="front end engineering design">FEED</abbr> and post-<abbr title="front end engineering design">FEED</abbr> studies, and we expect that projects supported through strand 1 will go on to apply for <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> and/or <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model">HBM</abbr> support in future allocation rounds. However, it is our intention that projects will only be able to apply to one window per project at any one time. Therefore, projects will not be able to apply for strand 1 (April – June 2022), and then also apply to strand 3 in the first allocation round (open for applications early July– September 2022).</p>

<p>As such applicants will need to consider whether their project is able to progress without strand 1 development funding, prior to bidding into strand 3.</p>

<h3>Questions 27 May 2022</h3>

<p><strong>Where can I get more information about the different <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> strands?</strong> (updated from 18 May)</p>

<p>You can find more information on various <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> funding strands, as well as other hydrogen funding streams from <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> here:</p>

</ul>

<h3>Questions 18 May 2022</h3>

<p><strong>Is it a requirement that hydrogen production must be operating by 2025?</strong></p>

<p>No. The requirement is to be delivering hydrogen by 2030 latest. Your proposal for strand 1 must demonstrate how you will develop a credible project that will contribute to the at-scale production of low carbon hydrogen by 2025.</p>

<p>The questions are designed for all project types and it is recognised that for blue <abbr title="molecular hydrogen">H2</abbr> production, if <abbr title="front end engineering design">FEED</abbr> studies are not yet underway, the 2025 production aspiration would not be met. However, a project could contribute by, for example, planning to take Financial Investment Decision (<abbr title="Financial Investment Decision">FID</abbr>) by 2025.</p>

<p><strong>Will there be another funding window for <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> strand 1?</strong></p>

<p>We anticipate that there will be another <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> strand 1 (<abbr title="development expenditure">DEVEX</abbr>) funding window early next year. Please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://custom-eur.cvent.com/1EEE3F7178EC486E8926B23F55A0B125/files/3ca25b7b2c1b46cda61548db42061f03.pdf?_ga=2.57507946.1988738899.1652366589-669891222.1641319844%22" rel="external"><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> hydrogen funding landscape infographic</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Can the same project apply for strand 1 and strand 2 at the same time?</strong></p>

<p>No. Strand 1 aims to grow the future of hydrogen projects in the UK through supporting front end engineering design (<abbr title="front end engineering design">FEED</abbr>) and post-<abbr title="front end engineering design">FEED</abbr> studies.</p>

<p>Strand 2 is for low carbon hydrogen projects that can deploy on the basis of capital expenditure support and are able to start construction rapidly. Strand 2 projects do not require a hydrogen specific business model.</p>

<p>Projects will be able to apply to strand 1 and then apply to a later window of strand 2, if applicable.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<h3>Questions 22 June 2022</h3>

<p><strong>What happens if the application is successful but one of the partner organisations decides to not proceed with the grant offer?</strong></p>

<p>The funding is awarded based on the Innovation. If one of the partner leaves, you may have the ability to find another partner however, this will require approvals from the Innovation Leads.</p>

<p><strong>We have team members inside IR35 long term contractors via umbrella companies. Show should they be accounted for in our Finance?</strong></p>

<p>IR35 contractors should be included as a subcontractor. You will be unable to claim overheads for these members.</p>

<p><strong>Will work done before 1 January 2023 be eligible for funding?</strong></p>

<p>Only costs that are incurred during the agreed start and end date of your project, as outlined in your grant offer letter, will be eligible.</p>

<p><strong>When it states that the project must start by 1 January 2023 and complete by 31 March 2024, is this only regarding the <abbr title="front end engineering design">FEED</abbr> stage of the project or the full project?</strong></p>

<p>The start and end date refers to all the development stages of your project that you are requesting funding for.</p>

<h3>Questions 9 June 2022</h3>

<p><strong>If we were successful for Strand 1 funding, would be also be able to receive support from the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, projects are eligible to receive <abbr title="development expenditure">DEVEX</abbr> or <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> from the <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> and also revenue support through the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr>, subject to subsidy control requirements being met.</p>

<h3>Questions 27 May 2022</h3>

<p><strong>We have multiple hydrogen production facilities in the same region with a single off-taker. Can they be considered under one project?</strong></p>

<p>If the same developer is developing multiple production facilities they are able to aggregate them in a single application to the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund, as long as they can reasonably demonstrate they successfully meet the eligibility and assessment criteria. This may be sensible for facilities which are commercially interlinked, are using the same technology type and are broadly located in the same area. The caveat to this approach is that if the joint application fails, all the aggregated facilities will miss out on funding.</p>

<h3>Questions 18 May 2022</h3>

<p><strong>When are projects expected to start?</strong></p>

<p>Projects that are successful are expected to start 1 January 2023.</p>

<p>There are a number of documents and financial checks that are required between being informed you are successful and project start date.</p>

<p><strong>When are projects expected to finish?</strong></p>

<p>Successful projects are expected to start 1 January 2022 and can last between 6 and 15 months. Projects must end by 31 March 2024.</p>

<p>For further information read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://apply-for-innovation-funding.service.gov.uk/competition/1150/overview/d524bd50-207b-4c57-9859-d76480094409#eligibility" rel="external">eligibility section</a> of the competition brief:</p>

<p><strong>We may require an overseas subcontractor. Will we still be eligible?</strong></p>

<p>Project grant holders must carry out work in the UK but can subcontract overseas if needed.</p>

<p>You will need to provide justification within your application and ensure the value is appropriate to the total project costs.</p>

<p>For further information, read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://apply-for-innovation-funding.service.gov.uk/competition/1150/overview/d524bd50-207b-4c57-9859-d76480094409#eligibility" rel="external">eligibility section</a> of the competition brief.</p>

<p><strong>We believe we are eligible for the <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> Strand 1, but we’re a start up without any trading history. Can we still apply?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, you can still apply. As a start-up, you will need to provide evidence of funds available to start the project from yourselves or investors by sharing your bank statement and/or a letter of comfort if this will be a third-party investment. Please note that the funds that need to be before the start of the project is: total project costs or project length* 3 months. 3 months is because <abbr title="Innovate UK">IUK</abbr> pays 3 months in arrears.</p>

<p><strong>We are a micro company. How much can we claim?</strong></p>

<p>For developmental expenditure (<abbr title="development expenditure">DEVEX</abbr>) support, you could get funding of up to 50% of your eligible project costs if you are a UK registered business of any size</p>

<p><strong>We are an academic organisation. How much can we claim?</strong></p>

<p>For developmental expenditure (<abbr title="development expenditure">DEVEX</abbr>) support, you could get funding of up to 80% of full economic costs (<abbr title="full economic costs">FEC</abbr>) if you are a Je-S registered institution such as an academic</p>

<p><strong>We are an <abbr title="Research and Technology Organisation">RTO</abbr>, charity, not for profit organisation, public sector organisation or research organisation. How much can we claim?</strong></p>

<p>For developmental expenditure (<abbr title="development expenditure">DEVEX</abbr>) support, you could get funding of up to 100% of your eligible project costs if you are an <abbr title="Research and Technology Organisation">RTO</abbr>, charity, not for profit organisation, public sector organisation or research organisation. Please note, this can only make up to 30% of the project total eligible cost, and you cannot be project lead.</p>

<p><strong>An applicant can lead on 2 applications (which must be materially different) and participate in a further two. Is this limit applied to each strand or across all four strands?</strong></p>

<p>This is per strand, in relation to strands 1 and 2 only. Further guidance for strands 3 and 4 will be provided at a later date. There is an expectation that successful projects from strand 1 may bid into later windows of the other <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> strands.</p>

<p><strong>We are a company registered in Northern Ireland. Are we eligible for funding?</strong></p>

<p>Any UK registered organisation should be eligible to apply for the funding. The <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> aligns with the safe harbour limits of the EU’s General Block Exemption Regulation (<abbr title="General Block Exemption Regulation">GBER</abbr>) so applicants impacted by the <abbr title="Northern Ireland Protocol">NI Protocol</abbr> have the same eligibility criteria and intervention rates as those under the UK’s subsidy control rules. The only difference would be the definition of company size guidance but this is explicitly stated in the competition brief.</p>

<p>We have attached a questionnaire for you to complete to determine if you’re impacted by the <abbr title="Northern Ireland Protocol">NI Protocol</abbr>. You can also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/complying-with-the-uks-international-obligations-on-subsidy-control-guidance-for-public-authorities/technical-guidance-on-the-uks-international-subsidy-control-commitments#section-6">refer to the following guidance</a> for further information as it will help with the questionnaire.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<h3>Questions 18 May 2022</h3>

<p><strong>What is the expected Financial Investment Decision (<abbr title="Financial Investment Decision">FID</abbr>) for projects applying to Strand 1?</strong></p>

<p>There is an expectation of Financial Investment Decision by March 2025 latest to support delivery of the hydrogen production targets.</p>

<p><strong>Is the <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> for developing or trialling hydrogen vehicles?</strong></p>

<p>No, the <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> is only available for low carbon hydrogen production.</p>

<h2>Dates</h2>

<h3>Questions 9 June 2022</h3>

<p><strong>Are we able to have an extension to the stated deadline?</strong></p>

<p>Our competition milestones are absolute therefore, we are unable to change any of the competition dates.</p>

<h3>Questions 18 May 2022</h3>

<p><strong>When does the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund strand 1 (<abbr title="development expenditure">DEVEX</abbr>) competition close?</strong></p>

<p>Net Zero Hydrogen Fund strand 1 (<abbr title="development expenditure">DEVEX</abbr>) will close on the 22 June 2022 at 11am.</p>

<p>An extension is not possible, therefore please allow sufficient time to complete your application. If you experience any technical issues, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="https://apply-for-innovation-funding.service.gov.uk/info/contact" rel="external">customer support services team</a> before the deadline.</p>

<p><strong>What is the expected Commercial Operation Date (<abbr title="Commercial Operation Date">COD</abbr>) for projects applying to strand 1?</strong></p>

<p>The competition guidance for strand 1 includes a requirement is to be delivering hydrogen by 2030 latest. There is no official commercial operation date but projects which can be operational within the timeframe of the <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> (to March 2025) are encouraged as this will contribute to meeting 2025 targets.</p>

<h2>How to apply</h2>

<h3>Questions 22 June 2022</h3>

<p><strong>What is expected in relation to the fugitive emissions associated with green hydrogen production?</strong></p>

<p>Projects will need to provide a plan demonstrating how their hydrogen production plant will be designed and operated to ensure that fugitive hydrogen emissions are kept as low as reasonably practical.</p>

<p><strong>It states that planning applications are eligible for <abbr title="development expenditure">DEVEX</abbr> funding. Are other permits/consents also included? For example: Environmental Agency permit, Controlled Water Abstraction Licence, COMAH Management plans, Hazardous substance licensing?</strong></p>

<p>Licenses and permits can be included in project costs as they are a legal requirement for specific activities but the cost must be attributable to the project. So if the project is 18 months long and you have to purchase a 2 year permit, your project can apportion the cost accordingly. If you only require the permit for a fraction of the project length then they need to include that element of the cost only.</p>

<h3>Questions 27 May 2022</h3>

<p><strong>If our application is successful, how often will we be expected to report?</strong></p>

<p>Successful projects should expect to report quarterly, with claims quarterly in arrears.</p>

<p><strong>We are submitting a joint application, where our partner organisation will be our lead. Can you confirm if the other project partners will be able to see our commercially sensitive financial information?</strong></p>

<p>If your application is eligible and you are invited to interview, each partner organisation will need to provide InnovateUK additional financial information. You will be invited by email. InnovateUK will not share this information with any of your project partners. This information should be sent back to InnovateUK directly, within 5 working days.</p>

<h2>Low carbon hydrogen&nbsp;standard</h2>

<h3>Questions 18 May 2022</h3>

<p><strong>What is meant by the term ‘consignment’?</strong></p>

<p>Consignments are defined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-low-carbon-hydrogen-standard-emissions-reporting-and-sustainability-criteria#full-publication-update-history">draft low carbon hydrogen standard here</a>, under Section 7.1. This section includes examples of when <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> expect different feedstocks to be accounted for as separate consignments.</p>

<p><strong>Is my project allowed to use food or feed crops?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, some of your hydrogen consignments can be made using food or feed crops, but note that these crops must still meet the relevant sustainability criteria, and for any biomass pathway, at least 50% (by <abbr title="lower heating value">LHV</abbr> energy content) of the total hydrogen produced must be made using waste or residue biomass. Separate <abbr title="greenhouse gases">GHG</abbr> emission calculations should be conducted for each feedstock consignment, and reported in the dashboard tab of the Hydrogen Emissions Calculator along with their relative shares of the hydrogen output, in order to calculate an overall weighted average <abbr title="greenhouse gases">GHG</abbr> emissions result.</p>

<p><strong>Are the <abbr title="greenhouse gases">GHG</abbr> emission methodology rules for biomass routes exactly the same as the UK’s <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr>?</strong></p>

<p>The draft low carbon hydrogen standard takes the same approach as the UK’s Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation with regards to the biomass sustainability criteria, as well as the <abbr title="greenhouse gases">GHG</abbr> emissions calculation methodology relating to direct  land use change, plus separate reporting of indirect land use change emissions. The only current minor differences are that under the draft low carbon hydrogen standard , the following terms from the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> guidance cannot currently be claimed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bonus for using restored degraded land</li>
  <li>credit for soil carbon accumulation via improved agricultural management</li>
