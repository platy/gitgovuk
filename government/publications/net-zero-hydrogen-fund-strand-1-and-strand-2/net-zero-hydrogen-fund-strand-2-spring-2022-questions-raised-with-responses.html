<p><strong>How can we find partners to work with on our project?</strong></p>

<p>As part of the <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr>, we are not running any networking events. We’re expecting applications to be near market, and to have project partners in place as a result.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<h3>Questions 27 May 2022</h3>

<p><strong>Where can I get more information about the different <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> strands?</strong> (updated from 13 May)</p>

<p>You can find more information on various <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> funding strands, as well as other hydrogen funding streams from <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> here:</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Where can I find more information on the Hydrogen business model?</strong></p>

<p>We have published the response to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/design-of-a-business-model-for-low-carbon-hydrogen">Consultation on Hydrogen Business Modes, and indicative Heads of Terms</a>,</p>

<p>You can find further detail on the Hydrogen business model and Net Zero Hydrogen Fund in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://beisgovuk.citizenspace.com/industrial-energy/hbm-nzhf-market-engagement-electrolytic-allocation/" rel="external">Market Engagement on Electrolytic Allocation document</a>.</p>

<h3>Questions 18 May 2022</h3>

<p><strong>Can I apply the same project for Strand 2 and Strand 3?</strong></p>

<p>No. Strand 2 projects must not require a Hydrogen Business Model at any stage, whilst Strand 3 projects are expected to require a Hydrogen Business Model.</p>

<p><strong>Will there be another funding window for <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> strand 2?</strong></p>

<p>We anticipate that there will be another <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> strand 2 (<abbr title="development expenditure">DEVEX</abbr>) funding window early next year. Please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://custom-eur.cvent.com/1EEE3F7178EC486E8926B23F55A0B125/files/3ca25b7b2c1b46cda61548db42061f03.pdf?_ga=2.57507946.1988738899.1652366589-669891222.1641319844%22" rel="external"><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> hydrogen funding landscape infographic</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Can the same project apply for strand 2 and strand 3 at the same time?</strong></p>

<p>No. Strand 1 aims to grow the future of hydrogen projects in the UK through supporting front end engineering design (<abbr title="front end engineering design">FEED</abbr>) and post-<abbr title="front end engineering design">FEED</abbr> studies.</p>

<p>Strand 2 is for low carbon hydrogen projects that can deploy on the basis of capital expenditure support and are able to start construction rapidly. Strand 2 projects do not require a hydrogen specific business model.</p>

<p>Projects will be able to apply to strand 1 and then apply to a later window of strand 2, if applicable.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<h3>Questions 27 May 2022</h3>

<p><strong>Can we include multiple sites in one project?</strong></p>

<p>Developers are advised to make separate applications for hydrogen production facilities based at different sites. If the production facilities are not independently deliverable, developers can submit a single application with a justification for why the sites should be considered together.</p>

<p><strong>Can the producer and off-taker be the same organisation?</strong></p>

<p>Yes they can</p>

<p><strong>We have multiple hydrogen production facilities in the same region with a single off-taker. Can they be considered under one project?</strong></p>

<p>If the same developer is developing multiple production facilities they are able to aggregate them in a single application to the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund, as long as they can reasonably demonstrate they successfully meet the eligibility and assessment criteria. This may be sensible for facilities which are commercially interlinked, are using the same technology type and are broadly located in the same area. The caveat to this approach is that if the joint application fails, all the aggregated facilities will miss out on funding.</p>

<h3>Questions 18 May 2022</h3>

<p><strong>When are projects expected to start?</strong></p>

<p>Projects that are successful are expected to start 1 January 2023.</p>

<p>There are a number of documents and financial checks that are required between being informed you are successful and project start date.</p>

<p><strong>When are projects expected to finish?</strong></p>

<p>Successful projects are expected to start 1 January 2022 and can last between 6 and 15 months. Projects must end by 31 March 2024.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://apply-for-innovation-funding.service.gov.uk/competition/1150/overview#eligibility" rel="external">For further information, read the eligibility section</a> of the competition brief.</p>

<p><strong>Can you confirm what capital costs can be covered by the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund strand 2 (<abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr>)?</strong></p>

<p>Your project must address low carbon hydrogen production opportunities and must focus on construction of new low carbon hydrogen production facilities.</p>

<p>You can claim the usage costs of capital assets providing they meet the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they have a useful life of at least one year</li>
  <li>they are stand alone, clearly definable and moveable</li>
  <li>they conform to your organisation’s capitalisation policy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please calculate the usage value for all equipment and tools bought for use on your project with the following calculation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>original purchase price (excluding <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>) divided by depreciation period in months (as per your current capitalisation policy) = monthly depreciation charge</li>
  <li>project capital usage cost = (monthly depreciation charge x number of project months) x percentage of time used on project.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/guidance-for-applicants/costs-we-fund/costs-guidance-for-non-academic-organisations/" rel="external">See the cost guidance for applicants</a>.</p>

<p><strong>We’re currently running a prototype and expecting to be <abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> 7 later this year. Can we apply now even though we’re not <abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> 7 now?</strong></p>

<p>Your technology needs to have been demonstrated at a minimum of TRL7 at the time of applying for the fund.</p>

<p>We anticipate that there will be additional application window for both strands 1 and 2, which may be more suitable for you project. More information on the further application windows can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/guidance-for-applicants/costs-we-fund/costs-guidance-for-non-academic-organisations/%22" rel="external"><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> hydrogen funding landscape infographic.</a></p>

<p><strong>We may require an overseas subcontractor. Will we still be eligible?</strong></p>

<p>Project grant holders must carry out work in the UK but can subcontract overseas if needed. You will need to provide justification within your application and ensure the value is appropriate to the total project costs.</p>

<p>For further information, refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://apply-for-innovation-funding.service.gov.uk/competition/1150/overview#eligibility" rel="external">eligibility section</a> of the competition brief:</p>

<p><strong>An applicant can lead on 2 applications (which must be materially different) and participate in a further two. Is this limit applied to each strand or across all four strands?</strong></p>

<p>This is per strand, in relation to strands 1 and 2 only. Further guidance for strands 3 and 4 will be provided at a later date.</p>

<p><strong>We are a company registered in Northern Ireland. Are we eligible for funding?</strong></p>

<p>Any UK registered organisation should be eligible to apply for the funding. The <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> aligns with the safe harbour limits of the EU’s General Block Exemption Regulation (<abbr title="General Block Exemption Regulation">GBER</abbr>), so applicants impacted by the <abbr title="Northern Ireland Protocol">NI Protocol</abbr> have the same eligibility criteria and intervention rates as those under the UK’s subsidy control rules. The only difference would be the definition of company size guidance but this is explicitly stated in the competition brief.</p>

<p>We have attached a questionnaire for you to complete to determine if you’re impacted by the <abbr title="Northern Ireland Protocol">NI Protocol</abbr>. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/complying-with-the-uks-international-obligations-on-subsidy-control-guidance-for-public-authorities/technical-guidance-on-the-uks-international-subsidy-control-commitments#section-6">You can also refer to the following guidance</a> for further information as it will help with the questionnaire.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<h3>Questions 18 May 2022</h3>

<p><strong>What is the expected Financial Investment Decision (<abbr title="Financial Investment Decision">FID</abbr>) for projects applying to Strand 2?</strong></p>

<p>The competition guidance for strand 2 states that <abbr title="Financial Investment Decision">FID</abbr> must be taken within 3 months of contract award.</p>

<p><strong>What do you mean “at-scale”?</strong></p>

<p>Strand 2 does not have a size limit on the production, but you are expected to be using core technology that has been tested in a commercial environment, Technology Readiness Level (<abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr>) 7 or more. <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> is designed to support hydrogen production projects that will meaningfully contribute to our up to 10GW ambition.</p>

<h2>Dates</h2>

<h3>Questions 18 May 2022</h3>

<p><strong>When does the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund strand 2 (<abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr>) competition close?</strong></p>

<p>Net Zero Hydrogen Fund strand 2 (<abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr>) will close on the 6 of July 2022 at 11am.</p>

<p>An extension is not possible, therefore please allow sufficient time to complete your application. If you experience any technical issues, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="https://apply-for-innovation-funding.service.gov.uk/info/contact" rel="external">customer support services team</a> before the deadline.</p>

<p><strong>What is the expected Commercial Operation Date (<abbr title="Commercial Operation Date">COD</abbr>) for projects applying to strand 2?</strong></p>

<p>The competition guidance for strand 2 includes a requirement is to be delivering hydrogen by 2030 latest. There is no official commercial operation date but projects which can be operational within the timeframe of the <abbr title="The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> (to March 2025) are encouraged as this will contribute to meeting 2025 targets.</p>

<h2>How to apply</h2>

<h3>Questions 27 May 2022</h3>

<p><strong>For Strand 2, should the <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> expenditure be at purchase price or only depreciated value?</strong></p>

<p>This competition will provide funding inline with our project costs guidance. If you’re looking to claim capital costs then the costs will need to be depreciated inline with your capitalisation policy.</p>

<p>Please see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/guidance-for-applicants/costs-we-fund/costs-guidance-for-non-academic-organisations/" rel="external">project costs guidance</a>.</p>

<p><strong>If our application is successful, how often will we be expected to report?</strong></p>

<p>Successful projects should expect to report quarterly, with claims quarterly in arrears.</p>

<p><strong>We are submitting a joint application, where our partner organisation will be our lead. Can you confirm if the other project partners will be able to see our commercially sensitive financial information?</strong></p>

<p>If your application is eligible and you are invited to interview, each partner organisation will need to provide InnovateUK additional financial information. You will be invited by email. InnovateUK will not share this information with any of your project partners. This information should be sent back to InnovateUK directly, within 5 working days.</p>

<h2>Low carbon hydrogen&nbsp;standard and Hydrogen emissions calculator</h2>

<h3>Questions 18 May 2022</h3>

<p><strong>What is meant by the term ‘consignment’?</strong></p>

<p>Consignments are defined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-low-carbon-hydrogen-standard-emissions-reporting-and-sustainability-criteria">draft low carbon hydrogen standard</a>, under Section 7.1. This section includes examples of when <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> expect different feedstocks to be accounted for as separate consignments.</p>

<p><strong>Is my project allowed to use food or feed crops?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, some of your hydrogen consignments can be made using food or feed crops, but note that these crops must still meet the relevant sustainability criteria, and for any biomass pathway, at least 50% (by <abbr title="lower heating value">LHV</abbr> energy content) of the total hydrogen produced must be made using waste or residue biomass. Separate <abbr title="greenhouse gases">GHG</abbr> emission calculations should be conducted for each feedstock consignment, and reported in the Dashboard tab of the Hydrogen Emissions Calculator along with their relative shares of the hydrogen output, in order to calculate an overall weighted average <abbr title="greenhouse gases">GHG</abbr> emissions result.</p>

<p><strong>Are the <abbr title="greenhouse gases">GHG</abbr> emission methodology rules for biomass routes exactly the same as the UK’s <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr>?</strong></p>

<p>The draft low carbon hydrogen standard takes the same approach as the UK’s Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation with regards to the biomass sustainability criteria, as well as the <abbr title="greenhouse gases">GHG</abbr> emissions calculation methodology relating to direct land use change, plus separate reporting of indirect land use change emissions. The only current minor differences are that under the draft low carbon hydrogen standard , the following terms from the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> guidance cannot currently be claimed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bonus for using restored degraded land</li>
  <li>credit for soil carbon accumulation via improved agricultural management</li>
  <li>credit for avoided manure methane emissions</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1067393/low-carbon-hydrogen-standard-guidance-annexes.pdf" rel="external">Full details are given in Annex C, Chapter 5</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Regarding the <abbr title="greenhouse gases">GHG</abbr> emissions calculation, can you please provide further detail on the system boundary that should be considered for this assessment?</strong></p>

<p>The system boundary and <abbr title="greenhouse gases">GHG</abbr> methodology that is to be used is set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-low-carbon-hydrogen-standard-emissions-reporting-and-sustainability-criteria#full-publication-update-history">draft low carbon hydrogen standard</a>, under Section 6.</p>

<p><strong>How many Excel workbooks do I need to complete and submit?</strong></p>

<p>If you are an electrolytic project, we expect you to submit one single Excel workbook, that covers up to 4 separate consignments (renewable electricity, nuclear electricity, grid electricity and one other electricity source). If you are electrolytic project using multiple other electricity sources, please submit an Excel workbook for each of these other electricity sources, and complete or expand the Dashboard consignment table to calculate your overall weighted average <abbr title="greenhouse gases">GHG</abbr> emission result.</p>

<p>If you are a project using fossil natural gas from the UK gas grid as your only feedstock, you will only need to provide one Excel workbook. If you are not sourcing your natural gas from the UK gas grid (e.g. from multiple imported <abbr title="Liquefied natural gas">LNG</abbr> sources), then please submit an Excel workbook for each of these consignments and complete or expand the dashboard consignment table to calculate your overall weighted average <abbr title="greenhouse gases">GHG</abbr> emission result.</p>

<p>If you are a project using multiple biomass feedstocks, then please submit an Excel workbook for each of feedstock consignments and complete or expand the dashboard consignment table to calculate your overall weighted average <abbr title="greenhouse gases">GHG</abbr> emission result.</p>

<p>If you are a project using mixed waste with biogenic and fossil fractions, this can be dealt within one single Excel workbook that covers these 2 separate consignments. However, if you are a project using mixed waste along with other biomass or waste fossil feedstocks, please submit an Excel workbook for each of these consignments and complete/expand the Dashboard consignment table to calculate your overall weighted average <abbr title="greenhouse gases">GHG</abbr> emission result.</p>

<p><strong>When will the supporting video on how to fill in the hydrogen emissions calculator be available?</strong></p>

<p>These videos will be available online on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-low-carbon-hydrogen-standard-emissions-reporting-and-sustainability-criteria"><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> website</a> by 20 May 2022. The videos will include an overview of the calculator and how to find it, and 5 pathway specific videos with specific details on how to fill out the calculator.</p>

<p><strong>Is the hydrogen emissions calculator locked down, so that formulae cannot be viewed?</strong></p>

<p>The hydrogen emissions calculator is not locked using password protection, so users can see and click on the formulae that are used to calculate your <abbr title="greenhouse gases">GHG</abbr> emission results in each emissions category within each worksheet. However, it is not possible to change these Excel calculation formulae – a warning message is displayed if the cursor moves over the cell, and an error message arises if the user tries to change the calculation formulae (requiring the change to be undone). This is because the Hydrogen Emissions Calculator follows the <abbr title="greenhouse gases">GHG</abbr> methodology set out in the draft low carbon hydrogen standard.</p>
