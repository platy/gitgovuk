<h2><span class="number">1 Introduction </span></h2>

<h3>Principles of Access to Work</h3>

<h4>Above and beyond a reasonable adjustment</h4>

<p>Support that complements but does not replace or subsidise an employer’s legal duty to make reasonable adjustments.</p>

<h4>Additional costs</h4>

<p>Support that is over and above what a non-disabled person would need to do their job.</p>

<h4>When determining whether there are additional costs or a business benefit</h4>

<p>Consider the support required by a disabled person doing the job. Do not take into account the cost incurred by a non-disabled person doing the job.</p>

<h4>Meeting minimum needs</h4>

<p>Support that allows individuals to overcome workplace barriers that arise from their disability.</p>

<h4>Value for money</h4>

<p>Support that meets an individual’s needs in the most cost effective way for the taxpayer.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>1. Access to Work (<abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>) provides support for individual needs within the workplace above and beyond <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/reasonable-adjustments-for-disabled-workers">the employers reasonable adjustments</a>.</p>

<p>2. These instructions will help identify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the support customers need</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the support customers are eligible for</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> is available for applicants who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>have a paid job</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>are about to start a paid job (customers can apply 12 weeks before start date)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>are returning to a paid job</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>4. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> recognises that people are disabled by barriers in society, not by their impairment or difference. Barriers can be physical, or they can be caused by people’s attitudes to difference, like assuming disabled people can’t do certain activities within the workplace.</p>

<p>5. This approach helps <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> recognise barriers that make life harder for disabled people. Removing these barriers creates equality and offers disabled people more independence, choice and control. In some cases, this may mean only slight adjustments to the working environment.</p>

<p>6. Eligible customers will be offered support based on their needs. This may include a grant to help cover the costs of practical support in the workplace.</p>

<p>7. Disability awareness training is available for employers and work colleagues to gain an understanding of changes they could make towards enabling customers to participate fully and flourish in the workplace.</p>

<p>8. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> supports customers with a disability, illness or health condition (this includes mental health), who are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>about to <a class="govuk-link" href="#what-is-employment">start employment</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>serving an <a class="govuk-link" href="#apprenticeships">apprenticeship</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>9. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> funding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>encourages employers to recruit and retain someone with a disability, illness or health condition</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>offers financial help towards the extra cost of employing someone with a disability, illness or health condition</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>offers practical support to overcome work related barriers</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>10. In some cases, the employer will share the cost.</p>

<p>11. Extra employment costs over and above those considered as reasonable adjustments can be considered.</p>

<p>12. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> advisers have access to independent holistic workplace assessors who can identify recommendations to suit the customer’s needs.</p>

<p>13. Advisers work with the customer and their employer if appropriate to give the necessary support.</p>

<p>14. Repayment of some, or all the costs, are agreed in advance.</p>

<p>15. Repayments made under <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> are not liable for income tax.</p>

<p>16. All VAT queries must be signposted to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>).</p>

<p>See: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/definition-of-disability-under-equality-act-2010">Definition of disability under the Equality Act 2010</a> on the GOV.<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> website.</p>

<p>10. Customers meeting this definition of a disability are eligible to apply for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support.</p>

<p>11. Customers whose disability, illness or health condition does not substantially affect their normal day to day activities, but has a considerable adverse effect on their ability to do their job can also apply.</p>

<p>12. The customer must be advised that when DWP makes a decision about disability, it is for support purposes only.  This decision should not be regarded as proof that the individual would meet the Equality Act 2010 definition if tested in a court of law.</p>

<p>13. Under the Equality Act 2010, employers have a responsibility to make reasonable adjustments in the workplace.</p>

<h3>Confirming disability</h3>

<p>14. Customers are not usually requested to supply medical evidence or condition corroboration from a qualified health care professional unless the application is for new support under the Travel to Work element.</p>

<p>15. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> cannot be used to fund treatment for a disability or be used for diagnostic assessments for any type of disability, illness or health condition.</p>

<h3>Initial contact stage</h3>

<p>16. Ask for copies of any evidence or condition corroboration the customer has if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>there’s a disagreement with the customer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there’s difficulty in determining whether the effect of the customer’s disability will introduce extra costs above those of a non-disabled person doing the job</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>17. Tell the customer that the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> adviser may ask for a specialist assessment to identify the support needed. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>technical support</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ergonomic support</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>third sector specialist support</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>18. The adviser may ask for extra evidence or condition corroboration they think necessary at any time during an application in order to validate a request for support.</p>

<h3>Drug and alcohol</h3>

<p>19.  People who are drug and alcohol dependent who do not have a primary disability or health condition fall outside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/definition-of-disability-under-equality-act-2010">Equality Act 2010</a>. However, where a health problem and/or a disability has resulted from their addiction and they are on a treatment programme, they are eligible to apply to Access to Work.</p>

<p>20. Establish if the customer is on a current treatment programme.</p>

<p>Note: An addiction treatment programme helps people overcome compulsive alcohol and/or drug use. The programme may take place in numerous environments, varying from residential rehab to outpatient therapy. They also range in their forms of treatment. There’s no predetermined length for addiction treatment.</p>

<p>21. Validation through self-declaration is sufficient evidence of being on a treatment programme. However, if doubt about eligibility or concern about fraud exists, evidence of the programme should be requested.</p>

<p>22.  A referral for a holistic work placed assessment must be made in line with the existing <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> process.</p>

<p>23. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> advisers must make applicants aware that for all areas of support (excluding mental health), their employer will be contacted ahead of the work placed assessment. This is to validate the applicant’s employment and to seek employer agreement to pay for any aids and equipment. Details of the customer’s health condition must not be divulged.</p>

<h3>What is employment?</h3>

<p>1. For <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> purposes, employment is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>full or part-time paid work, whether permanent, casual or temporary</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a <a class="govuk-link" href="#work-trials">work trial</a> arranged by DWP</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>work in an unsupported or supported environment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>working as a <a class="govuk-link" href="#payments-in-kind">councillor, elected official</a> or appointee who has applied for a position on a public organisation’s board</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#work-experience">work experience</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#self-arranged-work-experience">self-arranged work experience</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>2. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> is not available for those in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#voluntary-work">voluntary work</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>training, except for training related to the customer’s paid employment and is undertaken whilst the customer is in receipt of normal wages for the job</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3. To get <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support, customers who are in work or starting work can supply one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a verbal offer of employment (check this as part of the initial employer engagement call)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a written offer of employment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a contract of employment</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>4. As well as one of the above, customers must be paid at least the National Minimum Wage (<abbr title="National Minimum Wage">NMW</abbr>)</p>

<p>See:  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/197222/11-1216-national-minimum-wage-worker-checklist.pdf">National Minimum Wage </a>check list on GOV.<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>5. If during the initial contact with the customer there are doubts about the employment, ask the customer to provide supporting evidence.</p>

<p>6. The evidence will be considered when assessing the customer’s need for support.</p>

<p>7. Customers who are registered with an agency must have a job to start before they can receive support.</p>

<p>8. Approval cannot be given for any type of <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support, if there’s evidence that a company is about to stop trading.</p>

<h4>Civil servants, public servants and agency employees</h4>

<p>9. From 1 April 2022, <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> does not fund adjustment support including assessments or equipment for civil servants with the exception of Mental Health Support Service.</p>

<p>Note: Public servants can continue to be considered for all support options available through <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>.</p>

<p>See: Civil servants and public servants</p>

<h4>Members of the clergy</h4>

<p>12. Applications from members of the clergy must be dealt with in exactly the same way as any other application. This is regardless of their religion.</p>

<p>13. The customer must be in paid employment. For example, a member of the Church of England clergy who receives a salary or stipend.</p>

<p>14. Some other religious denominations work on a voluntary basis. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> is not available for voluntary workers.</p>

<p>15. If a customer’s employment status is in doubt, contact the employer or the religious organisations they belong to. Most contact details can be found on the internet.</p>

<h3>What is self-employment?</h3>

<p>1. For <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> purposes, self-employment is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>operating a business either on the customer’s own account or in partnership, or working for an employer on a self-employed contractual basis operating a franchised business on a self-employed basis</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a business that satisfies the past or prospective viability tests</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>possessing a Unique Tax Reference number (<abbr title="Unique Tax Reference">UTR</abbr>)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>2. A customer is considered employed (even if they own the company) if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>they draw a salary</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they pay Class 1 National Insurance contributions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3. If they pay Class 4 contributions, they are self-employed.</p>

<p>4. Work can be done:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>from home</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>on their own premises</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>on premises owned or leased by someone else</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>on a travelling basis, for example a piano tuner</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>5. You must be satisfied that the applicant is self-employed. Do this by requesting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a Unique Taxpayer Reference (<abbr title="Unique Tax Reference">UTR</abbr>). This is a ten-digit number issued by HM Revenue &amp; Customs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>accounts for an established business</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a business plan of a standard acceptable to a bank or other financial institution</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: A <abbr title="Unique Tax Reference">UTR</abbr> and CV is appropriate in the case of self-employed applicants, who do not necessarily see themselves as being a business. For example, entertainers or actors etc.</p>

<p>6. Self-employed contractors or freelancers, such as entertainers, actors who may not see themselves as being self-employed, must provide a <abbr title="Unique Tax Reference">UTR</abbr> and CV to confirm their status.</p>

<p>Note: For more information about supporting self-employed applicants who are contractors or freelancers, see: Self-employed Contractors and Freelancers</p>

<p>7. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> cannot pay for the costs of setting up a business such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>standard items of equipment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>support for fact-finding</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>going on courses, seminars or similar events</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>while the business is being formed</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Company directors</h4>

<p>8. Customers are considered employed (not self-employed), if they pay Class 1 National Insurance contributions.</p>

<p>9. Company directors are not entitled to the minimum wage. They don’t therefore,have to meet this eligibility condition to get <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support.</p>

<p>10. Businesses must satisfy the business viability test. This is still true even if the customer is a company director.</p>

<p>11. The customer must provide proof that the company is registered with Companies House.</p>

<h4>HM Revenue and Customs checks for self-employment</h4>

<p>12. You can rely on HM Revenue and Customs treatment of the customer’s employment circumstances. This ensures consistency when determining an applicant is self-employed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if the customer is employed, they will be taxed under PAYE rules and the employer will pay Class1 National Insurance contributions under the same PAYE rules</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the customer is self-employed, customers will be taxed under the Self-Assessment rules and have a <abbr title="Unique Tax Reference">UTR</abbr> number for that purpose. Customers will be managing their Class 2/4 contributions through arrangements with the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> National Insurance Contributions Office</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Business viability</h4>

<p>13. It’s a requirement for a self-employed person or business owner/director seeking <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support, to demonstrate that the business is a viable and legitimate concern.</p>

<p>14. To be considered viable, a business should achieve a minimum level of turnover each year in the course of normal operations.</p>

<p>Note: Due to COVID-19 self-employed customers may not have been able to perform normal operations and as result, may not have achieved <abbr title="Lower Earnings Limit">LEL</abbr>. This applies to existing customers with current support in place and who are seeking renewal. New application for Self-employment support would still be required to meet <abbr title="Lower Earnings Limit">LEL</abbr>.</p>

<p>15. This minimum level is set as the Lower Earnings Limit (<abbr title="Lower Earnings Limit">LEL</abbr>):</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="Lower Earnings Limit">LEL</abbr> for 2021 to 2022 - £6,240</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Lower Earnings Limit">LEL</abbr> for 2020 to 2021 - £6,240</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Lower Earnings Limit">LEL</abbr> for 2019 to 2020 – £6,136</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Lower Earnings Limit">LEL</abbr> for 2018 to 2019 – £6,032</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Lower Earnings Limit">LEL</abbr> for 2017 to 2018 – £5,876</li>
</ul>

<p>See:  <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/collections/rates-and-allowances-hm-revenue-and-customs">GOV.<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> for the current <abbr title="Lower Earnings Limit">LEL</abbr></a>.  This site includes previous years rates.</p>

<h4>Start-up period and down-turns</h4>

<p>16. New businesses or periods of sole-trading may have an initial 12-month period “test trading” where they do not have to turnover the <abbr title="Lower Earnings Limit">LEL</abbr> threshold.</p>

<p>17. However, any new application must be accompanied by a business plan. Advisers may decline any self-employment award if, in their judgement, the plan is unlikely to have any prospect of becoming viable.</p>

<p>18. An award must be terminated if self–employed trading or, a business previously not satisfying the viability test, fails to achieve turnover of the <abbr title="Lower Earnings Limit">LEL</abbr> in between annual review periods.</p>

<p>Note: This does not apply to test trading periods.</p>

<p>19. If a previously viable business fails to achieve turnover of <abbr title="Lower Earnings Limit">LEL</abbr> in between annual review periods, then a further award may be made for the following year. If the business then fails to turnover the <abbr title="Lower Earnings Limit">LEL</abbr> in that following year, then the award is terminated.</p>

<p>20. Periods for which an award is suspended, for example through temporary cessation of trading is disregarded. For example, bereavement.</p>

<h4>Requalification</h4>

<p>21. A person who receives an award for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> on a self-employed basis which is subsequently terminated because the business does not satisfy the viability test, may not re-qualify for another self-employment <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> award for a period of 5 years from the last application.</p>

<p>Note: An <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> award can be considered if the customer claims self-employment as a different business and satisfies all other criteria.</p>

<h4>VAT</h4>

<p>22. All VAT queries must be signposted to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Foster Carers</h4>

<p>23. Case Managers must determine whether the applicant receives money as a salary for Foster caring, or whether the money they receive is solely for the child/children.</p>

<p>24. If the Foster carer receives a salary and satisfies standard <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> eligibility criteria, then they can be considered for support.</p>

<p>25. If the money received is for the child/children, is not considered a salary. This is considered voluntary work and <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> cannot provide funding.</p>

<h3>Self-employed contractors and freelancers, including gig economy workers</h3>

<p>1. Contractors and freelancers, including those customers working in the ‘gig economy’, are paid for instances of work, or ‘gigs’ as opposed to receiving a predicted monthly wage. The instances of work are usually temporary job roles rather than permanent.</p>

<p>2. In order to be considered as self-employed within the gig economy, a customer would normally identify as a contractor or a freelancer.</p>

<h4>Contractor</h4>

<p>3. Contractors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>typically work for single client at any one time, usually on the client’s premises</li>
  <li>are hired on fixed-term contracts through recruitment agencies, or directly with the end client</li>
  <li>work on a business-to-business basis with clients, whether through an agency or otherwise. They usually work for one client at a time, often full-time on a particular project for several months</li>
  <li>are self-employed, and responsible for paying tax through the self-assessment process</li>
  <li>may be a sole trader or have a limited company</li>
  <li>have full control of what work they take on</li>
  <li>can advertise their services to get new business</li>
  <li>set their own working hours</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: This list is not exhaustive</p>

<h4>Freelancer</h4>

<p>4. Freelancers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>usually work for a number of clients at a time, have full control of where they work, usually working from home</li>
  <li>may be used on an ad hoc basis, or to complete a single task. They generally work for several clients at once, often on a per-hour or per-day basis</li>
  <li>are self-employed, and responsible for paying tax through the self-assessment process</li>
  <li>may be a sole trader or have a limited company</li>
  <li>don’t usually have employees, but may outsource work for specific projects</li>
  <li>determine their own rates of pay and how they charge for their work</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: This list is not exhaustive</p>

<h4>Eligibility</h4>

<p>5. Applicants who are considered self-employed as a freelancer or contractor must satisfy the standard Access to Work (<abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>) eligibility criteria.</p>

<p>6. If the support a customer needs for a contract would take them above the CAP, then BAU Cap rules apply. The customer will need to renew as other capped customers need to every year.</p>

<p>7. Customers running a business or enterprise rather than having periods of freelance or contracted work will follow BAU self-employed instructions and would not be considered for a flexible application</p>

<h4>Evidence</h4>

<p>8. Customers working multiple periods of employment as either a contractor or freelancer will not follow the standard self-employed customer journey as many are unable to provide evidence of a viable business in order to make a successful application to <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>.</p>

<p>9. If the customer considers themselves to be a contractor or freelancer and they cannot provide a business plan, they must provide the following evidence to an Advisor instead:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a Unique Tax Reference (<abbr title="Unique Tax Reference">UTR</abbr>) number. This is required as confirmation that the self-employed customer is registered with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>evidence of their paid work for each period of work, including start and end dates as and when they are made available by the employer. For example, an email from the contractor’s employer evidencing their period of work, a copy of a contract, invoices for agreed work, receipts from paid work. This list is not exhaustive</li>
  <li>evidence their rate of pay meets the National Minimum Wage level. Customers in the gig economy do not need to satisfy the Lower Earnings Level (<abbr title="Lower Earnings Limit">LEL</abbr>) limit but must meet National Minimum Wage level. Failure to meet the National Minimum Wage level will result in the customer not being eligible for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: a copy of the customer’s CV detailing the customer’s work history can be requested as evidence, if available. The CV can show a history of short periods of work which supports their self-employed contractor or freelancer status.</p>

<h4>Flexible Application</h4>

<p>10. A flexible application for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support allows customers working on a self-employed freelance or contracted basis to be awarded <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support which can be used for multiple periods of paid employment.</p>

<p>11. A flexible application can be offered to self-employed freelancers or contractors who are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>new <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> customers</li>
  <li>customers reporting a change of circumstances</li>
  <li>customers reporting a new period of work</li>
</ul>

<p>12. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support can be awarded for up to three years using the flexible application process. This means customers can claim for support for up to three years without having to make a new application each time they have a new period of work.</p>

<p>13. Customers can only claim payment during periods they are actively working. Their flexible application is only live during paid periods of employment. During periods where the customer is not working, their award will remain dormant and payment cannot be claimed.</p>

<p>14. The customer’s <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> award can be documented by the customer using a workplace adjustment passport and they can share this information with their prospective employer.</p>

<p>Note: this is optional for the customer. Once an award has been made and documented, the customer owns the workplace adjustment passport and it is their choice whether to share the information it contains with a prospective employer.</p>

<h4>Actions for Advisers</h4>

<p>15. During the information gathering stage, the customer must be informed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if a decision is made to award <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>, they will be given an appropriate length of award, not exceeding three years, and they don’t need to make a new application for support during this time unless their circumstances change</li>
  <li>they must provide details of their new period of paid work each time they make a claim for payment during the award period</li>
  <li>where their support needs change or they have a change in circumstances, they must contact <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> before attempting to claim from their existing award as this could breach their cap</li>
  <li>where equipment has been provided as a one off cost, they are expected to take this equipment with them when leaving a job role if it will be needed to support them in their future job roles</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: cost share does not apply to these customers. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> would meet the cost of moving the equipment in future. See: <a class="govuk-link" href="#transferability">Transferability and portability of equipment</a></p>

<p>16. To finalise the award:</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Customer has further periods of paid work, no change of support needs</h4>

<p>18. When the customer has their award in place, they are able to make further payment claims against this without making a new <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> application, providing their circumstances do not change. The customer must notify <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> and provide evidence of each period of paid work during the award period</p>

<h4>Actions for Service Centre Colleagues</h4>

<p>19. If customers contact <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Service Centres to report a further period of paid work:</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Actions for Advisors</h4>

<p>20. Customers must send evidence of any periods of paid work they wish to claim <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support payment for. The period of work can be reported by the customer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>through the Service Centre</li>
  <li>by email (if this is their preferred method of contact, or</li>
  <li>by sending evidence with their payment claim form</li>
</ul>

<p>See: Evidence</p>

<h4>Advisor receives email from customer – preferred method of contact</h4>

<p>21. If you receive evidence of another period of paid work from a contractor or freelancer by email, forward the email to an Allocator to allocate to an available Advisor.</p>

<h4>Advisor notified of further period of paid work</h4>

<p>22. If the customer reports a further period of paid work to the Service Centre, you will receive this as an allocation.</p>

<p>23. You must contact the customer to establish whether evidence is being sent in by post or by email. The customer can email evidence of the new period of work to the Advisor at this stage if this is their preferred method of contact. Do not request the claim form at this stage.</p>

<p>24. Customers can send evidence by post with their claim form. When evidence is received with a claim pack, Payment Officers will notify Allocators. The evidence will then be available for Advisers to view in ATWIS. This will show as a Payment Task.</p>

<p>25. When evidence is received in MOU without a claim form, it is scanned into ATWIS as Whitemail. An Allocator will allocate this to you.</p>

<p>26. When evidence is received in MOU with a claim form, the post is scanned as the contents of one envelope. A Payment Officer will receive this task. If they find the period of work hasn’t been recorded on DiSC, they will send an email to an Allocator, including the envelope ID in the subject line email. You must record the period of work and reply to the Payment Officer’s email confirming they can now make payment for the period. When you reply, you must copy in the Payment Officer’s Team Leader.</p>

<p>27. When the customer provides their evidence:</p>

</ul>

<p>29. This can be reported by the customer through the Service Centre, email, by post (if this is their preferred method of contact) or sending evidence with their claim form.</p>

<p>30. If evidence of the period of work is received with a claim form, you must check if this period has been recorded in DiSC Business Case and element notes.

<h4>Customer has more than one employer at the same time</h4>

<p>31. If a customer has more than one employer, both periods of work must be recorded in the DiSC Business Case and the element.</p>

<p>32. If the same level of support is required, the claim can continue.</p>

<p>33. If there is an increase in the level of support required, for example, an increase in hours of support, this must be treated as a change of circumstances and sent for allocation.</p>

<h4>Notification of a Change in Circumstances</h4>

<h4>Workers posted from the European Community</h4>

<p>3. Workers posted to <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> by a company based in another European Community country are entitled to apply for support.</p>

<p>4. The EC Posted Workers Directive (96/71/EC) requires equality of treatment for EC posted workers and local workers.</p>

<p>5. In the case of European Community posted workers, <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> should not apply the rules covering living and employment in <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> rules, all other eligibility criteria though still applies.</p>

<p>6. Workers from the European Community must register with HM Revenue and Customs when they start work. This is for National Insurance purposes.</p>

<p>7. You must check the customer has the right to work in <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>. Do this by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>making sure the customer has a current passport with immigration stamps indicating type of and period of leave to stay</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asking for details of time and length of employment contract</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asking for evidence of application for a National Insurance number and registration with HM Revenue and Customs for tax purposes</p>
  </li>

<p>10. Confirmation that the visa allows the customer to work in <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> is enough to meet the residency requirement.</p>

<p>11. You must ask the customer to provide their visa documents.</p>

<h4>Immigration Employment Document (<abbr title="Immigration Employment Document">IED</abbr>)</h4>

<p>12. Some customers will have an Immigration Employment Document (<abbr title="Immigration Employment Document">IED</abbr>) that gives them the right to work in this country.</p>

<p>15. Customers who have a work permit or a leave to remain status do not need to hold a British passport. They are allowed to work in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and receive support.</p>

<p>Note: These cases must be closely monitored. Where the leave to remain is time limited, <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support must also be time limited and subject to review.</p>

<p>16. Leave to remain is normally granted for five years after which the person can apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain. As soon as a person has been granted leave as a refugee, they have immediate access to the labour market and to all key mainstream benefits.</p>

<p>17. Customers who have been given leave to work in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> but have ‘No recourse to public funds’ are still allowed to apply for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support.</p>

  <li>have already started trading</li>
</ul>

<p>2. As <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> is now a contracted provision, extra support is the responsibility of the provider. This means the customer is not eligible for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support for the period from when they report their change of circumstances to UC and 23:59 the day before they begin trading. This is because funding is provided by <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr>.</p>

<p>3. To support Case Managers in identifying customers eligible for <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr>, the following questions must be asked:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on what date was the applicant referred to <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr>?</li>

<h3>Sector-based Work Academy Programme (<abbr title="Sector-based Work Academy Programme">SWAP</abbr>) – Access to Work (<abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>)</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>1. Sector-based Work Academy Programme (<abbr title="Sector-based Work Academy Programme">SWAP</abbr>), previously known as a sector-based work academy (<abbr title="sector-based work academy">SBWA</abbr>), is to help prepare claimants receiving out of work benefits to get experience of, and apply for jobs in a particular sector.</p>

<p>2. Eligibility conditions and participation on a <abbr title="Sector-based Work Academy Programme">SWAP</abbr> opportunity will be decided by Jobcentre Plus staff before an application is made for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> funding.</p>

<p>3. The JCP Work Coach/Other Advisers must make the referral for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support by email to the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:atwosu.london@dwp.gov.uk">Operational Support Unit</a></p>

<p>4. The <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Service Centre team will allocate task to <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser</p>

<h4>Actions for Telephony Agents</h4>

<p>5. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Telephony Agents who receive enquiries from claimants interested or participating in a <abbr title="Sector-based Work Academy Programme">SWAP</abbr> must refer them to their local Jobcentre.</p>

<p>6. SWAPs are available in England and Scotland. There is a similar programme for those who need this support in Wales.</p>

<p>7. SWAPs last for up to 6 weeks and consist of three elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pre-employment training (PET)</li>
  <li>work-experience placement (WEP)</li>
  <li>guaranteed job interview (GJI) for a paid job/paid apprenticeship with employers in that sector or other support to help participants through the employer’s application process</li>
</ul>

<p>8. The PET and WEP may be blended together or can take place separately in any order. The GJI cannot be held before the PET.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Sector-based Work Academy Programme">SWAP</abbr> Access to Work Support</h4>

<p>9. Claimants on a <abbr title="Sector-based Work Academy Programme">SWAP</abbr> are eligible to apply for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> funding although it only applies to the WEP element.</p>

<p>10. For the duration of the WEP, all costs will be paid by <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> including Travel to Work costs, if appropriate.</p>

<p>11. Claimants needing communication support at the GJI stage can apply for this separately using the Communication Support at Interview (<abbr title="communication support at interview">CSI</abbr>) application online form.</p>

<h3>Work Trials</h3>

<p>1. Work trials are used to find out an individual’s suitability for a particular job by giving them an opportunity to try out the job for a short period.</p>

<p>2. Work trials can last between one day and six weeks, but must only be used when there is a genuine job vacancy that the employer wants to fill.</p>

<p>3. Work trials are available for any customer meeting the work trial eligibility criteria.</p>

<p>Note: Customers must also meet <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> eligibility.</p>

<p>4. Customers aged 16 and 17 are not eligible for work trials.</p>

<p>5. Customers in receipt of benefit who start a work trial can continue to receive benefits and travel expenses.</p>

<p>Note: Payments of travel expenses are arranged by Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<p>6. Customers in receipt of benefit must continue to engage with their work coach. The work coach must agree the work trial before <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support is agreed.</p>

<p>7. Customers not in receipt of benefit but meet <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> and work trial eligibility can receive Travel to Work (<abbr title="Travel to Work">TtW</abbr>) support from <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>.</p>

<p>8. All work trials must be arranged in line with Jobcentre Plus instructions.</p>

<p>9. For those customers not in receipt of benefit, <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> advisers will need to receive a completed DWP104 form from the work trial employer.</p>

<h4>Adviser assesses customer needs and completes business case</h4>

<p>10. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> advisers must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>assess customer needs to the same standard as non work trial application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>consider cost effective temporary solutions, such as the hiring or loaning of equipment for the duration of the trial</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>refer for independent assessment if the level of support cannot be decided or agreed with the customer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>tell the work trial employer that it’s their responsibility to purchase, hire or loan any equipment required by the customer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>align support with the start date of the work trial</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>11. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> advisers must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>monitor the customer to make sure support matches the duration of the trial</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reassess the support if the customer secures employment resulting in a longer term <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> award.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Supported Internships and Traineeships</h4>

<p>For applications in Scotland and Wales, you must confirm the funding the education provider has received for the placement. The programme in Wales may be referred to as ‘Engage to Change’.</p>

<p>Note: <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> have agreed funding for Supported Internships where young people are having to repeat their supported internship provision in academic year 2021/22 as they were unable to achieve their workplace objectives due to Covid-19 restrictions in 2020/21.</p>

<p>Access to Work offers support to Supported Interns working in a workplace environment and accommodates hybrid working arrangements.</p>

<p>Where an Intern is hybrid working, the type and level of support would be expected to reflect the different working arrangements. Whilst working at home/away from their main workplace, the support needed is expected to be at a level which enables the Intern to work independently, but a different type of support may be appropriate. For example, the use of assistive technology instead of a Support Worker used in the main place of work.</p>

<p>The support provided to Supported Interns for hybrid working must enable the Intern to deliver the objectives of their EHC plan or equivalent to ensure sufficient progress continues to be made towards gaining employment.</p>

<p>1. Young people, aged from 16 to 24 years old, who start a work placement with an employer as part of the Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) Supported Internship (<abbr title="Supported Internships">SI</abbr>) or Traineeship programme, or the equivalent study programme in Scotland and Wales may be eligible to apply for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support for the period of the work placement.</p>

<p>2. The maximum period of <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support depends on the type of eligible study programme:</p>

<ul>
  <li>39-weeks for a <abbr title="Supported Internships">SI</abbr>, or</li>
  <li>12 months for a Traineeship</li>
</ul>

<p>3. The period of support can span different academic years.</p>

<p>4. <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> would not normally expect a young person to repeat a <abbr title="Supported Internships">SI</abbr> or Traineeship, as they should be demonstrating progression. A young person may be able to participate in a further <abbr title="Supported Internships">SI</abbr> or Traineeship but this would only happen in exceptional circumstances and would have to be agreed by the Local Authority as part of the <abbr title="Education, Health and Care Plan">EHCP</abbr> review process. In these circumstances, the Learning Provider will be required to provide supporting evidence. A full review of the young person’s circumstance will be required.</p>

<p>5. Applications can be made up to six months in advance of the <abbr title="Supported Internships">SI</abbr> or Traineeship work placement starting.</p>

<h4>Supported Internships eligibility</h4>

<p>6. To be eligible to apply for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> grant funding the customer must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be aged between 16 and 24, (or 25, if the internship is completed before the end of the academic year during which the customer turned 25)</li>
  <li>have: an Education, Health and Care Plan (<abbr title="Education, Health and Care Plan">EHCP</abbr>) in England,  Personalised Learning Support Plan (<abbr title="Personalised Learning Support Plan">PLSP</abbr>) in Scotland,a Statement of Special Educational Need (<abbr title="Statement of Special Educational Need">SSEN</abbr>) in Wales</li>
  <li>be undertaking, or about to start, a <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> <abbr title="Supported Internships">SI</abbr> (England). Where the customer is in Scotland or Wales, you must get confirmation of the placement which the customer has received from the education provider</li>
  <li>spend the majority of the <abbr title="Supported Internships">SI</abbr> programme in the workplace</li>
</ul>

<p>7. To check eligibility for <abbr title="Supported Internships">SI</abbr> support, the Adviser must phone the named contact on the application form where the customer has given consent to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>obtain confirmation the customer has been accepted onto a <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> <abbr title="Supported Internships">SI</abbr> programme (England) or a <abbr title="Supported Internships">SI</abbr> programme in Scotland and Wales</li>
  <li>obtain details of how the <abbr title="Supported Internships">SI</abbr> programme is funded in Scotland and Wales</li>
  <li>confirm that the customer has an <abbr title="Education, Health and Care Plan">EHCP</abbr>, a <abbr title="Statement of Special Educational Need">SSEN</abbr> or a <abbr title="Personalised Learning Support Plan">PLSP</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Traineeships</h4>

<p>8. Traineeships are a type of study programme that includes a work placement and aims to move young people closer to employment.</p>

<p>9. A traineeship can last anywhere between 6 weeks to 12 months.</p>

<p>Note: <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support is available for a maximum of 12 months.</p>

<p>10. The unpaid work experience element should last for a minimum of 70 hours and not exceed 240 hours. The provider, the customer and the employer agree how the hours are used based on their needs and activities.</p>

<p>11. The time spent on work experience is dependent on the needs of the trainee and employer and the point at which the opportunity for paid employment occurs.</p>

<h4>Eligibility for a Traineeship</h4>

<p>12. To be eligible for a Traineeship, the customer must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be aged 16 to 24, or be aged 25 with an <abbr title="Education, Health and Care Plan">EHCP</abbr> (also known as an <abbr title="Statement of Special Educational Need">SSEN</abbr> in Wales and a <abbr title="Personalised Learning Support Plan">PLSP</abbr> in Scotland)</li>
  <li>be currently unemployed with little work experience and qualified below level 3. See: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/compare-different-qualification-levels">GOV.<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Compare different qualification levels</a>
</li>
  <li>be deemed to have a reasonable chance of being job ready or gaining an apprenticeship within 6 months of completing a traineeship according to a learning provider</li>
  <li>be undertaking or about to start a traineeship programme and must spend the majority of the programme at the employers premises to be eligible for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>13. To check eligibility, the adviser must get confirmation from the named contact on the application form that the customer has been accepted onto a <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> Traineeship (England) or a Traineeship programme in Scotland or Wales</p>

<p>Note: obtain details of how the Traineeship is funded in Scotland or Wales.</p>

<h3>Permitted Work and Access to Work support</h3>

<p>1. Permitted Work (<abbr title="permitted work">PW</abbr>) rules allow customers to do some work while still receiving <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>, <abbr title="Incapacity Benefit">IB</abbr> or <abbr title="Severe Disablement Allowance">SDA</abbr>, including credits only cases.</p>

<p>2. <abbr title="permitted work">PW</abbr> enables customers to gain skills and build confidence while still receiving benefit.</p>

<p>3. Customers are considered for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support if they’re undertaking:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Permitted Work (<abbr title="permitted work">PW</abbr>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Supported Permitted Work (<abbr title="supported permitted work">SPW</abbr>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Permitted Work PCA Exempt (<abbr title="permitted work PCA exempt">PWPCAE</abbr>)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>See: Permitted Work instructions for information about Permitted Work categories.</p>

<h3>Access to Work and Jobcentre Plus programmes</h3>

<p>1. There are limits on the use of Access to Work with some Jobcentre Plus programmes.</p>

<h4>Specialist Employability Support (<abbr title="Specialist Employability Support">SES</abbr>)</h4>

<p>2. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support is not available to customers on the Specialist Employability Support (<abbr title="Specialist Employability Support">SES</abbr>) programme.</p>

<h4>Modules 1 to 3 of Work Choice and Access to Work</h4>

<p>5. There are limits on <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support for customers who are on Work Choice.</p>

<p>6. In Module 1 of Work Choice (job entry support – six months with occasional extension to nine months), <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> is only available for those who are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> eligible</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>taking part in either Permitted Work or a Jobcentre Plus Work Trial</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>7. In Module 2 of Work Choice (in work support – up to two years) and Module 3 (longer term in work support with no time constraint) <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> is only available for those who are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> eligible</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>who have moved into supported work of 16 hours or more</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>are being supported by the Work Choice provider</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the support required is not short term support, for example special aids and equipment, travel to work</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>8. Short-term support is support that embeds the customer in their employment, for example travel buddy.</p>

<p>9. Short-term support is the responsibility of the Work Choice provider.</p>

<p>10. Short-term support will stop once the Work Choice customer is comfortable handling the journey to their supported employment.</p>

<p>11. All current <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> rules apply, including employer / provider purchase and cost sharing where the individual is in Work Choice supported employment for more than six weeks.</p>

<p>12. Either the employer or the Work Choice provider may contribute to <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> costs. It’s for the employer and Work Choice provider to agree.</p>

<h4>Exiting Work Choice</h4>

<p>13. Once the customer is ready to leave the Work Choice programme and enter unsupported employment, the provider will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>explain the standard <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> process</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide them with appropriate contact details</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>14. Providers must inform <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> that the customer is leaving Work Choice.</p>

<p>15. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will amend records to make sure the customer is picked up in the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> standard review process if they have been getting <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support already.</p>

<h4>Supported factories/businesses</h4>

<p>16. Customers working in supported factories/businesses, are not eligible for adaptations to premises and equipment or for help from some types of support worker.</p>

<p>17. Sometimes, people working in supported factories/businesses are placed on a work placement with another employer with a view to them progressing from Work Choice.</p>

<p>18. In these cases, adaptations to premises and equipment can be considered, but the likely duration of the placement must be taken into account.</p>

<p>19. Cost sharing applies where the customer is in their Work Choice supported employment for more than six weeks.</p>

<h4>Blind Homeworkers Scheme</h4>

<p>20. Applicants working under the Blind Homeworkers Scheme (<abbr title="Blind Homeworkers Scheme">BHS</abbr>) are not eligible for adaptations to premises and equipment or some forms of <a class="govuk-link" href="#support-workers">Support Worker</a> help.</p>

<p>21. There’s a separate capital budget to cover adaptations available via <abbr title="Blind Homeworkers Scheme">BHS</abbr>.</p>

<p>22. Help under all other elements of <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> may be available subject to the usual eligibility conditions.</p>

<p>23. Always check the evidence of employment before authorising support.</p>

<p>24. Some local authorities may withdraw assistance when the customer reaches 65.</p>

<h4>Training and further education</h4>

<p>25. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> cannot be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>skills build / training for work / work based learning for adults programmes where the customer remains on benefit or receives a training allowance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>training for skill enhancement where the customer remains on benefit or receives a training allowance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>student access to education</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>26. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>skills build / training for work / work based learning for adults programmes where the individual is in paid employment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>training in connection with the customer’s job including skills development and career progression or training that any other employee could be expected to attend, and the individual continues to be employed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>day release from work to attend college or time off for study provided the training or study is connected to the applicant’s work and they continue to be employed</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>27. You must establish what support the employer would normally provide for training courses. These are not additional costs and cannot be supported through <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Job related training</h4>

<p>28. The Equality Act 2010 places a duty on both employers and service providers to make reasonable adjustments.</p>

<p>29. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can help with anything considered ‘unreasonable’ due to financial constraints. For example, if a visually impaired employee was sent on a training course, it would be their employer’s duty to ensure the provider was aware the person needed handouts in large print.</p>

<p>30. It’s the service provider’s responsibility to provide these, however, they may well come to some agreement with the employer around any extra costs this might result in. This is seen as a reasonable adjustment.</p>

<p>31. If someone working for a small employer went on a course and needed very expensive <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> support, this may be unreasonable for both the employer and the provider due to financial reasons. This is the sort of case where <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can help.</p>

<h4>Induction training</h4>

<p>32. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can be considered for a short period of paid induction training as part of the job application process.</p>

<p>33. Support must be limited to the length of the induction period and reviewed if the individual is successful.</p>

<h4>Redundancy training</h4>

<p>34. In cases where employees are being made redundant some employers will offer courses prior to leaving.</p>

<p>35. Additional support to attend such courses can be approved providing the individual remains in paid employment during the period of redundancy training.</p>

<h4>European Social Fund Programmes</h4>

<p>36. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support cannot normally be agreed for customers on the European Social Fund (<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>) programmes. <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> contracts of employment will usually cover costs.</p>

<h3>Voluntary work</h3>

<p>1. Access to Work support cannot be offered to people in voluntary work.</p>

<h3>Payments in kind</h3>

<p>1. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support cannot be given unless the customer is paid at least the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage">National Minimum Wage</a>.</p>

<p>2. Payments in kind do not count as contributing towards the <abbr title="National Minimum Wage">NMW</abbr>. Accommodation is an exception to this. If accommodation is provided check the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-accommodation/effect-on-the-minimum-wage">GOV.<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> website</a> for the amount allowable to count towards the <abbr title="National Minimum Wage">NMW</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Local councillors and elected officials</h4>

<p>3. Councillors don’t need to meet the National Minimum Wage requirements as they’re not defined as workers in the National Minimum Wage Act 1998.</p>

<p>4. Councillors elected to office in Scotland since 2007 are paid a salary rather than an allowance and are able to claim <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> providing all other eligibility conditions are satisfied excluding the <abbr title="National Minimum Wage">NMW</abbr> requirement.</p>

<p>5. Councillors in England and Wales getting repaid for travel and meal allowances will continue to be treated as voluntary workers and are not eligible for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>.</p>

<p>6. Councillors getting allowances over and above the travel and meal allowances, for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> purposes, are treated as in employment and may be able to get <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support providing they meet other eligibility conditions excluding the <abbr title="National Minimum Wage">NMW</abbr> requirement.</p>

<p>7. Other elected officials, for example tribunal members, political party workers, volunteer groups, clubs, for which allowances and expenses are paid, are not generally regarded as in paid employment.</p>

<p>8. HM Revenue and Customs confirm that although subsistence and other similar payments are made and attract Tax/National Insurance, these are not treated as paid employment when paid for expenses incurred in carrying out duties.</p>

<p>9. Local councillors and other volunteers who have <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> equipment supplied for use in other jobs may use this equipment in their council or voluntary duties, as long as the owner of the equipment (their employer) agrees.</p>

<h4>Insurance</h4>

<p>10. The equipment owner must confirm that there is adequate insurance cover for equipment being used for voluntary work. If extra insurance cover is required it is the customer’s responsibility to get the insurance.</p>

<p>11. The customer must seek financial support from the ‘voluntary’ employer to cover the insurance costs.</p>

<p>12. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> advisers can help the customer to negotiate with the voluntary employer if necessary.</p>

<h3>Civil servants and public servants</h3>

<p>1. From 1 April 2022, civil servants are no longer eligible for Access to Work support. Their support is arranged through their employer. For example, all assessments for DWP staff must be dealt with by the DWP Workplace Adjustments Team (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions Workplace Adjustments Team">DWPWAT</abbr>).</p>

<p>2. Civil servants, who are staff appointed by the Crown or State to deliver Ministerial or government objectives can make applications for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support until 31 March 2022. If support is agreed, they can receive <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support until the end of that award period.</p>

<p>Note: You can consider accepting a retrospective new application as part of Holistic Decision Making. For more information, see:  Retrospective new applications</p>

<p>3. Public servants, who are staff performing a public function but not working directly for the Crown or State can continue to use <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Holistic Assessments and receive funding through <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> for workplace adjustments.</p>

<p>4. Where the customer is employed by a government department, agency or public body, but it is unclear whether they are employed as a civil servant or a public servant, you must try to identify their status using the information available to you, such as their occupation or job role. See: Identifying civil servants and public servants in government departments, agencies and public bodies</p>

<h4>Mental Health Support Service (<abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr>)</h4>

<p>5. All government employees, whether they are a civil servant or public servant, can still apply for <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr>. See: Mental Health Support Service (<abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr>) referrals</p>

<p>Identifying civil servants and public servants in government departments, agencies and public bodies</p>

<p>6. Civil servants work in government departments and are employed by Government Ministers to deliver Ministerial or government objectives.</p>

<p>7. Public servants work for government agencies and public bodies that perform a public function, but they are not directly working for the Crown or State.</p>

<p>8. There are some organisations, occupations and job roles where it is very clear whether a customer is a civil servant or a public servant.</p>

<p>9. A list of government departments can be found here: <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/organisations">Government Departments, agencies and public bodies</a>
Note: This list is not exhaustive and can help you identify that a customer is a government employee, but it cannot be used to identify if a customer is a civil servant or public servant.</p>

<p>10. While there is no definitive list available to confirm whether a customer is a civil servant or a public servant, you can access a collection of documents which can help you to identify the type of government organisation the customer works for:</p>

<p>Step 1.	select this link: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/public-bodies">Public bodies publications</a></p>

<p>Step 2.	select the link to the most recent Public Bodies Report. For example: Public bodies 2020.</p>

<p>Step 3.	select and open the Excel version of the report</p>

<p>identify the customer’s employer from the ‘Legislated Body Name’ in column A and check the Classification entry in Column D</p>

<p>Arms Length Bodies (ALBs) are executive agencies, non-departmental public bodies, and non-ministerial departments.</p>

<p>The classification in column D can tell you which type of organisation an employee works for: Non-Departmental Public Bodies (NDPB), mainly employ public servants. Note: some historical NDPB organisations employ civil servants:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Executive Agencies employ civil servants</li>
  <li>Non-ministerial departments employ civil servants</li>
</ul>

<p>11. Where a customer states they are a civil servant or a public servant, their answer can be accepted as the customer is responsible for informing the Case Manager (CM) about their employment type. CMs can use the information available to help determine this, but where possible the customer must declare whether they are appointed as a civil or public servant.</p>

<p>12. If a customer working for a government department is unsure about their status as a civil servant or a public servant, and you are unable to identify it from the information available, you must contact the customer’s manager by email to confirm their status before their application can continue.</p>

<h5>Assessments for civil servants</h5>

<p>13. From 1 April 2022, civil servants are no longer eligible for Access to Work support. Their support is arranged through their employer. For example, all assessments for DWP staff must be dealt with by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://intranet.dwp.gov.uk/section/working-dwp/human-resources/hr-support/dwp-workplace-adjustments-team-dwpwat" rel="external">DWP Workplace Adjustments Team (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions Workplace Adjustments Team">DWPWAT</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>14. Civil servants can still apply for Mental Health Support Services. See: Mental Health Support Service (<abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr>) referrals</p>

<p>15. If a customer is identified as a civil servant at any stage of the process, including where the Provider returns the referral, the CMs must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the customer by their usual method of contact to explain that the application is unable to proceed</li>
  <li>update DiSC notes with the reasons for the customer’s application being closed</li>
  <li>issue rejection letter AWT05NARL to notify the customer in writing, with free text</li>
</ul>

<p>“From 1 April 2022, Access to Work support is changing for civil servants. All government departments will be responsible for arranging workplace assessments and adjustment support.  Please speak to your employer, manager or where applicable, your Workplace Adjustment Team to arrange support. Access to Work support will be limited to the Mental Health Support Service only.”</p>

<h5>New Application or Renewal received from a government department employee on or before 31 March 2022</h5>

<p>16. When a new application or renewal is received from a government department employee, you must identify and record their type of employment in DiSC as a civil servant or a public servant. If the customer is unsure of their status, they must ask their manager.</p>

<h5>Actions for Case Managers</h5>

<p>17. Step 1. When you create the customer record, you must enter the type of government department employment in the Employment Sector field in DiSC’s Job page (if not already updated).</p>

<p>Identify and record:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Civil Servant as ‘Government Departments’, or</li>
  <li>Public Servant as ‘Other Public Sector’</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 2.	Issue the award letter ATW01</p>

<p>If the customer is a civil servant, select the appropriate dropdown</p>

<p>Step 3.	In all cases a note must be created in the additional details box of the customer screen with the title ‘<abbr title="other government department">OGD</abbr> Customer’ including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the letters and claim forms issued with the appropriate text added to the award letter</li>
  <li>if the customer is a civil servant, the following text with the customer’s award end date:</li>
</ul>

<p>‘Fixed award end date of xx/xx/xx – Civil Servant. Do not extend funding beyond this date’</p>

<h5>Ministerial department (up to and including 31 March 2022)</h5>

<p>Note: Up to and including 31 March 2022, <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> funding depends on the department the person works for rather than their status as a civil servant or a public servant.</p>

<p>18. Ministerial departments of the Westminster government fund all adjustments for staff directly employed by them and based at any location.</p>

<p>19. Access to Work support is not available to employees of Ministerial departments unless covered in exceptions and variations.</p>

<h6>Exceptions and variations (up to and including 31 March 2022)</h6>

<h6>Non ministerial departments (up to and including 31 March 2022)</h6>

<p>20.	Non ministerial departments do not fund adjustments for their staff, therefore, <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> is appropriate.</p>

<p>See:   <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/organisations">Departments, agencies and public bodies</a> for a full list of non ministerial departments.</p>

<h6>Agencies and other public bodies (up to and including 31 March 2022)</h6>

<p>21.	Ministerial departments do not fund adjustments for staff employed by their agencies and other public bodies. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will fund adjustments required by their staff.</p>

<p>See:   <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/organisations">Departments, agencies and public bodies</a> for a full list of non ministerial departments.</p>

<h6>Mental Health Support Service (up to and including 31 March 2022)</h6>

<p>23.	Mental Health Support Service (<abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr>) referrals are available to employees of any ministerial department.</p>

<p>24.	The cost of any recommendations made by <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr> for employees of ministerial departments cannot be met by <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>.</p>

<h6>Ministry of Defence (up to and including 31 March 2022)</h6>

<p>25.	The Ministry of Defence only fund adjustments for staff employed at their main building in Whitehall.</p>

<h6>Child Maintenance Group (up to and including 31 March 2022)</h6>

<p>26.	The Child Maintenance Group fund adjustments for their staff. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> funding is not appropriate.</p>

<h6>Assessments (up to and including 31 March 2022)</h6>

<p>27.	<abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can provide assessments for people employed in any ministerial department other than DWP.</p>

<p>28.	 All assessments for DWP staff must be dealt with by the DWP Workplace Adjustments Team (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions Workplace Adjustments Team">DWPWAT</abbr>).</p>

<h6>New application for support received from a government department employee on or after 1 April 2022</h6>

<p>29. From 1 April 2022, civil servants can no longer make new applications for Access to Work (<abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>) support.</p>

<p>Note: Any application for support made up to and including 31 March 2022 where support was awarded, the customer continues to receive <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support until the end of that award period.</p>

<p>30. If the customer is employed as a civil servant, a new application cannot proceed. You must signpost the customer to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their employer to arrange support. For example, for DWP civil servants, support is arranged through <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions Workplace Adjustments Team">DWPWAT</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Mental Health Support Services if appropriate See: Mental Health Support Service (<abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr>) referrals</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: You can consider accepting a retrospective new application as part of Holistic Decision Making. For more information, see:  Retrospective new applications  and 43 Renewals</p>

<p>31. If the customer is employed as a public servant, their new <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> application can proceed.</p>

<p>32. If the customer is not able to confirm whether they are a civil servant or a public servant, See: Identifying civil servants and public servants in government departments, agencies and public bodies</p>

<p>33. Where the customer’s status is disputed or their status as a civil servant or public servant cannot be confirmed, the CM must ask their Line Manager for support. If they are unable to establish the customer’s status, the case can be escalated to the Service Assurance Team (SAT).</p>

<p>34. If SAT are unable to deal with the query, then by exception they can raise a query with <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> policy team.</p>

<h6>Change of Circumstances received from civil servant customers on or after 1 April 2022</h6>

<p>35. Awards in place before 31 March 2022 are honoured in their entirety, up to a maximum of 3 years.</p>

<p>36. This means that customers with an award running beyond 1 April 2022 can continue to receive support from <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> up to their existing award end date, including any reported changes in circumstances during the period of their award that relate to the existing element(s) they have been awarded. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will maintain and update the award, but the award end date must not be extended.</p>

<h6>Example</h6>
<p>A civil servant customer has a Travel to Work (<abbr title="Travel to Work">TtW</abbr>) existing award which runs beyond 1 April 2022 and the customer’s <abbr title="Travel to Work">TtW</abbr> costs increase after 1 April 2022. This element is part of their original award, and this is a change of circumstances. The customer can receive an increased award, but the length of award cannot be extended.</p>

<p>37. Where a customer has an existing claim but reports a change of circumstances that requires a new element unrelated to their existing element award, the civil servant will need to go to their employer for the new element. Their existing claim will continue until the award ends. The length of the existing award cannot be extended.</p>

<h6>Examples</h6>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A civil servant customer has a <abbr title="Travel to Work">TtW</abbr> existing award which runs beyond 1 April 2022 and the customer requests help with <abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr> after 1 April 2022. The <abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr> element is a new requirement and therefore it’s a new claim. The <abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr> requirement is unrelated to their original award. The customer must speak to their manager about their required adjustment. As there was no change to the existing <abbr title="Travel to Work">TtW</abbr> award, the claim continues until the award ends. The length of the <abbr title="Travel to Work">TtW</abbr> award cannot be extended.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A civil servant customer has an existing award for a support worker which runs beyond 1 April 2022 and contacts us after 1 April 2022 to tell us about an increase in the support from the support worker and they now also need <abbr title="Travel to Work">TtW</abbr> support. The <abbr title="Travel to Work">TtW</abbr> element is a new application for support and unrelated to their original award. The customer must speak to their manager about their required adjustment. The increase in support from a support worker is a change of circumstances. The customer can receive an increased award, but the length of award cannot be extended.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h6>Actions for Case Managers</h6>

<p>38.</p>

<p>Step 1. Once support is approved, check if the employment type has been recorded</p>

<p>Note: If the customer has changed job roles or department, their employment type may have changed.</p>

<p>You must identify and record the employment type if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the type of government department employment has not previously been recorded in the Job field in DiSC or</li>
  <li>their job role or department has changed</li>
</ul>

<p>identify and record the employment type as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Civil Servant as ‘Government Departments’, or</li>
  <li>Public Servant as ‘Other Public Sector’</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 2. Enter award end date in relevant fields Business case, Payment field</p>

<p>Note: If the customer is a civil servant, once the award end date has been set, the award must not extended for any reason</p>

<p>Step 3. Issue the award letter ATW01</p>

<p>If the customer is a civil servant, select the appropriate dropdown</p>

<p>Step 4.In all cases a note must be created with the title ‘<abbr title="other government department">OGD</abbr> Customer’ including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirmation that letters and claim forms have been issued with the appropriate text dropped in to the award letter.</li>
  <li>if the customer is a civil servant, the following text with the customer’s award end date:</li>
</ul>

<p>‘Fixed award end date of xx/xx/xx – Civil Servant. Do not extend funding beyond this date’</p>

<h3>Apprenticeships</h3>

<p>1. People serving apprenticeships are eligible for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support as they receive a wage and have a contract of employment. National minimum wage rates don’t apply to people on apprenticeships.</p>

<p>2. If the apprentice stays with the same employer when qualified, cost sharing status will remain unchanged for the whole of the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> period of three years from the beginning of the apprenticeship.</p>

For example, being in hospital for an extended period or has been misdirected by the department.</p>

<h3>Deferred applications</h3>

<p>4. If a customer wants to check their eligibility for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> before they apply, inform them to contact us again when they have decided to go ahead with their application. We will then review their eligibility.</p>

<h3>Evidence</h3>

<p>5. There’s no need to obtain condition corroboration from a suitably qualified medical practitioner or other relevant independent professional expert to assess a customer’s eligibility unless the customer is applying for new support with <a class="govuk-link" href="#travel-to-work-and-travel-in-work">Travel to Work</a>.</p>

<p>6. Only request suitable relevant evidence and decide if the evidence is sufficient to decide eligibility.</p>

<p>7. When condition corroboration is required. Advisers must record, in full the information provided within the medical letter by the customer and medical practitioner or GP.</p>

<h4>Missing evidence</h4>

<p>8. Contact the customer and ask them to send in any outstanding evidence they’ve been asked to provide. This should be done straight away.</p>

<p>9. If the customer disputes the need for the evidence or doesn’t have it, explain that an adviser will review their eligibility and may ask for an independent assessment to be made.</p>

<p>10. In all cases, record a summary of the action taken on the appropriate IT systems.</p>

<h3>Application not pursued</h3>

<p>12. An application can be closed if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the customer contacts us to say that they do not wish to go ahead with their application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an employer decides that an <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> contribution is not needed because they will fund the support, provided this is before any assessment costs have been incurred. The customer must be told of the employer’s decision before the application is closed</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Overtime</h3>
<p>13. Overtime cannot be funded for any element of <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>.</p>

<h2><span class="number">5 Assessment </span></h2>

<h3>Action</h3>

<p>1. You and the customer, must discuss and consider the effect their disability, illness or health condition has on their ability to do their job. If in doubt, ask for an assessment of the impact.</p>

<p>2. Suggest reasonable adjustments to the employer and/or consider an Independent Holistic Workplace Assessment</p>

<p>3. Identify the need for any:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>communications support at a job interview</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>travel during working hours</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>travel to work support</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>need for a Support Worker</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>adaptations to premises or equipment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>special aids or equipment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>other miscellaneous support</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>4. When potential solution(s) have been identified, consider and agree with the customer and employer, the most cost effective support that fully meets the customer’s needs.</p>

<h3>Assessing the impact of the disability</h3>

<p>5. If it’s not clear how a customer’s condition affects the way they can or will do their job, arrange an independent holistic workplace assessment. This will be with a specialist for an objective analysis of how the customer’s condition will affect their ability to do a job.</p>

<p>6. Don’t ask for the assessment to identify or diagnose the condition or its causes.</p>

<p>7. Some customers will need to use an interpreter or another third party to help them with their application for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>. That person might also help the customer to identify the types of support they need and offer to provide that support.</p>

<p>8. If you’re concerned that the level of support requested is more than the customer needs, you can ask for an independent holistic workplace assessment through the contracted supplier.</p>

<p>9. You mustn’t use <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> funds for a diagnosis of the disability, illness or health condition.</p>

<h4>Historical evidence and assessments</h4>

<p>10. When assessing the level of support needed, you must take into account any previous assessments a customer has had due to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>having a job</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>being a disabled student</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>having other private support for example, education or a health and care plan</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>11. A further assessment may not be necessary unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the customer asks for one</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the type of work has significantly changed</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Workplace assessments</h3>

<p>12. The most appropriate type of assessment, will depend on the particular needs of the customer.</p>

<h4>Independent holistic workplace assessment</h4>

<p>13. Ask for an independent holistic workplace assessment if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the customer disagrees with a previous assessment or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the in work need is unknown or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it’s difficult to decide whether there will be additional costs due to the disability, illness or health condition of the customer</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>14. The costs of <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> independent holistic workplace assessments are met from general <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> programme spend.</p>

<p>15. For approval and audit purposes, all action taken must be recorded as supporting evidence.</p>

<h4>Technical assessments</h4>

<p>16. Other types of specialist assessments may include technical assessments for adaptations to premises and equipment.</p>

<p>17. All advice received should be clearly recorded in the customer’s case, including supporting documentation and technical reports.</p>

<h3>Considering alternatives</h3>

<p>18. Discuss each option with the customer and the employer to identify the solution that will fully overcome the customer’s employment needs.<br>
19. If the customer and the employer wants to use an option which isn’t the most cost effective, you should discuss this and receive the appropriate contributions.</p>

<p>20. Explain to the customer and employer, the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> contribution is based on the option which fully meets the customer’s employment needs.</p>

<h3>Vehicle purchase</h3>

<p>21. Normally, <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will not fund the purchase of vehicles but there are exceptional circumstances when the purchase of a vehicle would be the most cost effective option.</p>

<p>22. Identify which element of <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> the cost of the support should be allocated to. Different considerations apply depending on whether the vehicle is work equipment or for travelling to work.</p>

<p>23. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> doesn’t fund the purchase of standard equipment, but could fund adaptations to a customer’s vehicle. This would come under the Adaptation to Premises and Equipment element of <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> and the guidance for this must be followed.</p>

<p>24. Vehicles considered as standard, would be for occupations such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>taxis for taxi drivers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lorries for hauliers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>milk floats for milkman</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>tractors, quad bikes, all-terrain vehicles and any other equipment needed for agricultural work</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>25. In exceptional circumstances, <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can make a contribution to the purchase of a non- standard vehicle where a standard vehicle cannot be used.</p>

<p>26. The contribution must be limited to the difference between the cost of the standard vehicle and the specialist vehicle with further deductions for business and social benefits.</p>

<p>27. Use the Special Aids and Equipment element of <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> to fund the contribution.</p>

<h3>Transferability/portability of equipment</h3>

<p>28. You must always discuss with the current employer, the possibility of the customer taking the equipment with them if they go to another job with a new employer. Record this discussion within the business case on the ATW system.</p>

<p>29. If the equipment was funded by both <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> and the employer, and the employer is unwilling to release the equipment despite being requested to, <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will consider funding the equipment in the new job.</p>

<p>1.Travel to Work (<abbr title="Travel to Work">TtW</abbr>) can provide short or long term financial assistance for disabled people who incur extra costs in travelling to and from work because of the effects of their disability, illness or health condition. It’s used to reimburse an agreed portion of the costs of taxis or adaptations to vehicles.</p>

<p>2. Travel to Work costs cannot be paid for customers on a work trial as these will be met by the Jobcentre.</p>

<p>3. Customers are expected to contribute towards the cost of any adaptations to vehicles or the purchase of vehicles which they use for purposes outside work.</p>

<p>4. Car parking charges cannot be considered under any element.</p>

<p>5. The following travel costs are covered under other elements of <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> or other schemes/programmes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>payments to a relative or friend for travel costs other than a mileage rate are covered by the Support Worker element</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>purchase of specialised vehicles specifically for work must be dealt with under Special Aids and Equipment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>special arrangements apply to adaptations to vehicles bought or leased through <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.motability.co.uk/" rel="external">Motability</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>6. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> does not contribute to fares to interviews.</p>

<p>7. The amount paid in support of the costs, will depend on the method of transport used.</p>

<p>8. Help paying for a taxi is available, if this is the only solution due to the effects of a customer’s disability, illness or health condition.</p>

<p>9. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> wouldn’t normally consider making payments to a customer if they can use suitable public transport.</p>

<p>Note: You must consider customers with a disability, illness or health condition that may improve or get worse over time. This means there will be times when they can use public transport and times when they can’t.</p>

<p>10. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will only fund the most cost effective solution that meets the customer’s needs. If the customer decides to use a more expensive method of travel, the customer will then need to fund the difference between the cost effective solution and their preferred alternative.</p>

<h3>Condition corroboration</h3>

<p>11. All new <abbr title="Travel to Work">TtW</abbr> and TiW applications must also be supported by condition corroboration from a General Practitioner (GP) or suitably qualified healthcare professional or other relevant independent professional expert. They must confirm how the disability, illness or health condition affects the customer’s ability to travel to work.</p>

<p>12. Advisers must use PIPCS in the first instance to reuse existing <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> medical evidence where available before requesting this from the customer. See 34 PIPCS access for <abbr title="Travel to Work">TtW</abbr> and TiW applications</p>

<p>13. If suitable medical evidence is not available on PIPCS, the customer should be asked to provide evidence of how their disability, illness or health condition affects their ability to travel to work. Evidence requested could be in the form of a hospital report, clinicians letter etc. This list is not exhaustive.</p>

<p>14. If the evidence provided does not detail how the disability, illness or health condition affects the customer’s ability to travel to work to enable the Adviser to make a decision, The medical letter, can be used. Part B must be signed by a GP or suitably qualified healthcare professional</p>

<p>15. The condition corroboration must be used and Part B must be signed by a GP or suitably qualified healthcare professional.</p>

<p>16. Advisers must record, in full the information provided within the condition corroboration by the customer and suitably qualified healthcare professional or GP.</p>

<p>17. For a change of circumstances or a renewal case, there’s no need for condition corroboration unless there’s a reasonable expectation that the disability, illness or health condition may have improved or needs have changed. Customers with a progressive, degenerative, terminal health condition, or a condition which is never going to improve from one which we have already received evidence for then we do not need additional confirmation of this.</p>

<h3>Normal cost of travel to work</h3>

<p>18. Establish what the cost of the customer’s journey would normally be if they didn’t require support from <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>.</p>

<p>19. If the customer previously drove to work, the customer’s contribution is 25 pence per mile.</p>

<p>20. If the customer used public transport, the customer’s contribution is what the public transport cost would have been for the whole of that journey.</p>

<p>Note: If the customer has a pass entitling them to reduced fares or free travel on public transport, the cost to the customer is the reduced fare or nil as appropriate. If the pass is subject to time restrictions, then these should be taken into account.</p>

<h3>Independent travel</h3>

<p>21. You must discuss the travel needs and choices available to support customers getting to and from work. Consider whether the customer may only require support for part of the journey.</p>

<p>22. After initial support from <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>, it’s possible that a customer may eventually travel independently to work. In this case you must agree a travel plan and arrange for a short-term temporary solution to be in place.</p>

<h3>Flexible personalisation</h3>

<p>23. Build in a tolerance to allow for small increases in support without the need for approval of a new business case and based on need only.</p>

<p>24. The percentage tolerance range must be between 1.5 and 5%, and must only be applied after all reasons have been included in the reaching of the yearly profile.</p>

<h3>Cost effectiveness</h3>

<p>25. You can use <abbr title="Travel to Work">TtW</abbr> if the customer’s work needs them to travel to a variety of sites and there’s no default location provided by the employer, for example a piano tuner.</p>

<p>26. Consider if the proposed solution is practical and cost effective before agreeing the support. For example, if the customer is expected to use a company vehicle to do their job, such as a company rep, identify if a Support Worker driver is more cost effective than taxi fares.</p>

<p>27. Consider if it’s more suitable and cost effective to adapt the company’s vehicle (using the <abbr title="adaptation to premises or equipment">APE</abbr> element) or the customer’s own vehicle (using the <abbr title="Travel to Work">TtW</abbr> element).</p>

<p>28. The costs of removing the adaptation must be included in the agreed spend if adapting a company vehicle.</p>

<p>29. Consider if training is appropriate and will be more cost effective than paying for taxis for customers expected to use public transport.</p>

<h3>Customers with more than one workplace</h3>

<p>30. You must establish whether there is a set pattern of travel on which to base costs.</p>

<p>31. If there isn’t a pattern, work out the extra costs for each destination. This is based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the availability of suitable public transport/mileage and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>profile costs based on previous work patterns where known</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Suitable public transport</h3>

<p>32. A public transport journey is only suitable when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>it would take less than two hours each way from the customer’s home to their place of work and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>public transport is available at times that would enable the customer to use it to travel to or from work.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: The journey isn’t suitable if either of these conditions aren’t met.</p>

<p>33. If public transport isn’t available, <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will only meet Travel to Work costs if the effect of the customer’s disability, illness or health condition would have prevented them from using it had it been available.</p>

<p>34. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will consider an application from a customer who has been travelling to work without previous <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> assistance, but has now developed a disability, illness or health condition. For example, a customer who previously drove to work but has had to stop because of a disability, illness or health condition. This can be temporary or permanent. If no suitable public transport is available, <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will consider <abbr title="Travel to Work">TtW</abbr> costs in these cases.</p>

<p>35. If suitable public transport is available, the customer would be expected to use it unless they could provide condition corroboration from a suitably qualified medical practitioner or other relevant independent professional expert. This would confirm how the disability; illness or health condition affects the customer’s ability to use public transport.</p>

<p>36. Consider whether providing a <a class="govuk-link" href="#support-workers">Support Worker</a> would be the most cost effective means of meeting the customer’s travel needs if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>suitable public transport is available and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the customer would use it if appropriate help or training was available</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Motability</h3>

<p>37. Help may also be available through the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.motability.co.uk/" rel="external">Motability</a> scheme if the customer is in receipt of any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Higher Rate Mobility Component of Disability Living Allowance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enhanced Rate Mobility Component of Personal Independence Payment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enhanced Rate Mobility Component of Adult Disability Payment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Armed Forces Independence Payment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>War Pensioners’ Mobility Supplement</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>38. Advisers must ask customers who get one of the above benefits, if they wish to be supported through the Motability scheme.</p>

<p>39. The customer is free to choose whether they apply for Motability support. If a customer wishes to apply for Motability support, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>refer them to Motability</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>consider putting in place a temporary period of support, with a suitable review period, until the customer receives a response from Motability</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>40. You must continue to assess any other elements of <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support and put them in place as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>41. Customers who already have a suitable vehicle supplied through the Motability scheme shouldn’t need extra help from <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>all other options of travel have been explored</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>extra support is required after considering corroboration of the effect of their disability, illness or health condition</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>42. A Motability vehicle that’s not suitable for travelling to work, for example a motorised scooter, must not be taken into account when considering a customer’s <abbr title="Travel to Work">TtW</abbr> costs.</p>

<p>43. Customers may be able to receive <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support to adapt a vehicle if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>this is the most cost effective solution</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they are not applying for Motability</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they don’t have a suitable vehicle from Motability</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>44. You must inform customers that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will make a contribution towards adaptation costs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they’re fully responsible for ownership, repairs, maintenance and all running costs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they make arrangements for the adaptation to be carried out and reclaim the agreed costs on completion</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>45. Applications for adaptations to vehicles must be supported by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an assessment of driving needs, usually through a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.drivingmobility.org.uk/find-a-centre/" rel="external">Motability accredited centre</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>condition corroboration from a healthcare professional</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>46. Consider providing temporary alternative support while the adaptations are made.</p>

<h3>Adaptations to customer vehicles</h3>

<p>47. Disabled customers who drive to work can get the cost of adaptations to their vehicle to allow them to continue to use it.</p>

<p>48. Help may also be available through the Motability scheme.</p>

<p>49. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can only help with adapting a vehicle if this is the most cost effective solution.</p>

<p>50. Arrange for an assessment through an approved centre to determine what adaptations the customer needs and whether the vehicle is suitable for adaptation.</p>

<p>See: <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.drivingmobility.org.uk/" rel="external">drivingmobility.org.uk</a>.</p>

<p>51. Driving assessments are not included in the contracted holistic assessment.</p>

<p>52. Consider alternative support such as taxis if this is needed in the interim.</p>

<p>53. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will fund the adaptations but customers will be required to make a personal contribution based on the number of days per week it’s not used for work but is still used for personal use. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> calls this a social and domestic benefit contribution.</p>

<p>54. You must calculate the maximum <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> contribution using the following formula:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>take the total cost of the adaptation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>divide it by the seven days of the week</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>multiply that by the number of days not at work</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>A customer has their own vehicle but they can’t use it as it needs adapting for their disability, illness or health condition.</p>

<p>This would come under the Travel to Work / Adapted Vehicle (<abbr title="adapted vehicle">AV</abbr>) element of <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>.</p>

<p>The customer travels to work in the vehicle five days a week.</p>

<p>The total cost of an adaptation would be £2,800.</p>

<p>Use the formula to calculate the customer contribution:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Total cost of adaptation</td>
      <td>£2,800</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Divided by days of a full week</td>
      <td>7</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Equals</td>
      <td>£400</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Multiplied by number of days not at work</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Equals</td>
      <td>£800</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The customer’s contribution is £800.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> contribution is £2,000.</p>

<p>These make up the total adaptation cost of £2,800.</p>

<h3>Vehicle unsuitable for adaptation</h3>

<p>55. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can contribute towards the cost of a vehicle that meets the customer’s minimum requirements. This is when the customer’s existing vehicle is unsuitable for adaptation. This could be because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the vehicle is too old</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the vehicle is not large enough for the customer’s needs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it’s more cost effective to replace a vehicle rather than adapt it, for example exchanging a manual transmission for an automatic</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>56. You must advise the customer, that they must contribute towards the cost by trading in their existing vehicle against the cost of the newer one.</p>

<p>57. The principle of cost effectiveness is taken in to account in every case regardless of the customer’s social and domestic benefit contribution. For example, it’s not cost effective to pay taxi fares over a long period of time when considered alongside the approval of a grant towards buying a vehicle.</p>

<p>58. As it will usually be more cost effective in the long run to adapt a newer car, <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can assist towards the purchase of a vehicle up to two / three years of age, regardless the age of the vehicle being traded in.</p>

<p>59. Customers must be advised that purchasing a newer car should be seen as a one-off and no further grants will be given for this.</p>

<p>60. Customers must provide their own quotes. These must be recorded on the business case.</p>

<p>61. The number and type of written quote depends on the expected level of expenditure as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>£499.99 and under – one quote needed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>£500 and above – three quotes needed</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>62. Use the formula to work out the customer’s contribution but take into account the trade in value.</p>

<h3>Customer owns a manual vehicle but now needs an automatic car</h3>

<p>63. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can help meet the additional cost of an automatic vehicle. This should be based on a like for like swap i.e. the same manufacturer, model and age of car.</p>

<p>64. If it‘s not possible to find a similar vehicle with an automatic gearbox, the customer should look for the next available option that would meet their minimum needs.</p>

<p>65. If a customer’s current vehicle is much older than the required vehicle, they should contribute the trade in price of the old vehicle towards the newer car.</p>

<p>66. When <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> have provided a grant towards a newer automatic vehicle, the customer must be told that we have now ‘moved them into the automatic car market’ and can’t help any further with grants towards any subsequent automatic vehicle.</p>

<p>67. A second-hand automatic vehicle may cost up to £500 more than a manual of the same model, age and condition, although newer vehicles may cost more.</p>

<p>68. Advise the customer that we can help meet the additional costs of an automatic car of the same age / model as their existing vehicle.</p>

<p>69. Additional costs up to £499 can be authorised straight away, but three quotes are required for costs of £500 or more.</p>

<p>70. Although <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will contribute towards the additional costs, the customer must be asked to pay a social and domestic benefit contribution. This is worked out using the formula:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>take the extra cost after trade in</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>divide it by the seven days of the week</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>multiply that by number of days customer not at work</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>A customer has a three-year-old manual Ford Focus which they can no longer use.</p>

<p>They’ve seen an automatic car of the same age and specification at a local dealer. This is a ‘like-for-like’ swap.</p>

<p>They can trade in their own car, but will need to pay an additional £450.</p>

<p>They use the car to travel to work four days per week.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Extra cost (after trade in)</td>
      <td>£450</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Divided by days of a full week</td>
      <td>7</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Equals</td>
      <td>£64.28</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Multiplied by number of days not at work</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Equals</td>
      <td>£192.86</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The customer should be asked to make a social and domestic benefit contribution of £192.86.</p>

<p><abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can contribute £257.14</p>

<p>These make up the total extra cost of £450.</p>

<h3>Adaptation of lease/hire vehicles</h3>

<p>71. The customer must check the terms of the contract before approval can be given for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>adaptations requested for a leased vehicle</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>one purchased via a finance arrangement</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>72. Written permission will be needed before adaptations can be made in either case.</p>

<p>73. Take into account the cost of possible removal of the adaptation later when assessing the cost of adapting a leased or hired vehicle. These costs should be included in the customer’s profile.</p>

<p>74. Consider providing other support on a temporary basis while the adaptations are being made.</p>

<h3>Buying a vehicle</h3>

<p>75. In exceptional circumstances, buying a vehicle may be the most cost effective solution.</p>

<p>76. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support is only available as a contribution to the costs of a vehicle supplied through Motability. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> funds aren’t available to buy a vehicle from any other supplier.</p>

<p>77. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> may contribute towards the deposit for a Motability vehicle.</p>

<p>78. All decisions to give <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support for buying a vehicle must be approved in advance by an <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Senior Operations Manager.</p>

<p>79. You must confirm the customer is in receipt of one of the following benefits if the buying of a vehicle is approved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Disability Living Allowance – Higher Rate Mobility Component</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enhanced Rate Mobility Component of Personal Independence Payment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Armed Forces Independence Payment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>War Pensioners’ Mobility Supplement</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>80. You must refer the customer to Motability who will assess their circumstances and may be able to provide a suitable vehicle.</p>

<p>81. Consider putting in place a temporary period of support, with a suitable review period, until the customer receives delivery of the vehicle.</p>

<p>82. Funding will not be approved for <abbr title="Travel to Work">TtW</abbr> beyond the delivery of the vehicle.</p>

<p>83. You must continue to assess and put in place as quickly as possible if the customer needs any other elements of <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support.</p>

<p>84. Consider whether providing a <a class="govuk-link" href="#support-workers">Support Worker</a> is the most cost effective way in meeting the customer’s needs if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a vehicle is available and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the customer would use it given the correct help or training</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Funding for travel training</h3>

<p>85. Travel training is a short period of time where support is given to the customer to see if they can use public transport on their own.</p>

<p>86. Consider whether funding travel training would be a cost effective way to assist the customer to use public transport.</p>

<p>87. The customer may be more willing to consider this choice once settled in their employment. If this is the case, fund taxi travel for the first few months then revisit and review the customer’s needs.</p>

<p>88. Support should be considered on a case by case basis and reviewed regularly.</p>

<h3>Travel by taxi</h3>

<p>89. In most cases, the actual means of travelling to work will be by taxi.</p>

<p>90.The customer must provide three quotes from three different taxi firms who are registered with the local authority. The adviser must confirm that the rate charged is reasonable and includes VAT.</p>

<p>Note: Taxi companies may submit different quotes but it’s important that the customer’s needs are met for example, the cheapest taxi may not be able to pick the customer up at the required time.</p>

<h3>Shared taxis</h3>

<p>91. If taxis are shared, each <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> customer must contribute their public transport costs/mileage costs in full for the journey. Any other passengers sharing the taxi must contribute their share of the cost of the journey.</p>

<p>92. The combined contributions must be taken off the taxi fare and the outstanding balance met by <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>. This cost must be divided between customers sharing the taxi.</p>

<h3>Lift from a friend, colleague or relative</h3>

<p>93. <abbr title="Travel to Work">TtW</abbr> can pay extra mileage costs if they exceed the normal cost of the customer’s journey. This is when a friend, colleague or relative varies their journey to and from their own place of work to give the customer a lift to and from work.</p>

<p>94. To work out the extra mileage costs, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>work out the mileage for the driver’s usual journey directly to work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>work out the actual mileage for the varied route</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>take off the usual mileage from the actual mileage</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>work out the cost of the extra mileage using the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> mileage rate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>take off the normal cost of the customer’s travel</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>95. If the driver is not varying their route, then no <abbr title="Travel to Work">TtW</abbr> cost applies.</p>

<p>96. Where a friend, colleague or relative makes a return journey to take the customer to and from work, the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if public transport is available:</li>
  <li>the actual cost is the mileage cost for a return journey</li>
  <li>the normal cost is the usual public transport cost for a return journey</li>
  <li>if suitable public transport is not available:
    <ul>
      <li>the actual cost is the mileage cost for a return journey</li>
      <li>the normal cost is the mileage cost for a return journey</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Learner drivers</h3>

<p>97. Customers can be considered for <abbr title="Travel to Work">TtW</abbr> whilst they are learning to drive. Support can be approved for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>up to a year or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to the test date if sooner</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>98. You must confirm that the learner is making progress and has a realistic prospect of passing the driving test before extending support further.</p>

<p>99. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will not pay for driving lessons.</p>

<p>100. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> cannot support the buying or adaptation of a vehicle for a learner driver.</p>

<h3>Travel costs within work</h3>

<p>101. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can be used to pay the extra costs of travel within work if the customer is expected to use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a company car</li>
  <li>their own vehicle or</li>
  <li>local public transport and is unable to do so because of their disability, illness or health condition</li>
</ul>

<p>All new claims for Travel in Work cost must be supported by Condition Corroboration evidence</p>

<p>102. If the customer needs to travel by air/train the employer must meet the additional cost.</p>

<p>103. Examples of the support within work are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>costs of using a taxi for in-work travel, where public transport or a company car cannot be used</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the cost of hiring a vehicle on a temporary basis where the customer’s own vehicle is being adapted or repaired</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>104. Take into account all in-work travel costs the employer would normally pay. For example, mileage allowances or a contribution to the cost of a vehicle or the cost of a vehicle they supply.</p>

<p>105. If the customer is expected to pay some costs, deduct these, using either:</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7 Support </span> Workers</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>1. Advisers must first explore all other options before considering a Support Worker (<abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr>) as the most appropriate support. Examples of these options may include assistive technology or other adaptations. These options and details must be recorded on the business case.</p>

<p>Note: This must be done in a timely manner to enable a Support Worker to be employed promptly if that is the appropriate solution.</p>

<p>2. Advisers need to identify and understand the following before deciding on which single <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> type or multiple <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> types are appropriate. They must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>understand the job role the customer is undertaking and its full requirements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>identify any training requirements for that role</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>identify any barriers the customer is likely to face in the workplace. This should be done with the customer and the employer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>identify what support needs there are including any reasonable adjustments that may have been made</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3. A holistic workplace assessment may be appropriate to identify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>any barriers to work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>suitable recommendations on how to overcome these</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>4. Once the barriers and potential solutions have been identified, advisers must create a tailored package to enable the customer to be able to start, return to or retain their employment</p>

<p>Note: The package may need a combination of support, for example, a single <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> type or multiple <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> types.</p>

<p>5. Advisers must decide on the different <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> type or types and confirm with the customer and employer who the employer of the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> will be. This could be either the customer or the employer. One <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> may be able to provide more than one <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> type.</p>

<p>6. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can pay for the following costs of employing a <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>holidays</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sick leave</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pension contributions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>redundancy costs</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>7. These costs must be confirmed with the employer of the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr>. It must detail the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr>’s entitlement to holidays, sick leave and redundancy. You must ensure that all costs are inclusive of VAT.</p>

<p>Note: These should be in line with the statutory requirements available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/working">GOV.<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>8. Advisers must confirm the hourly rate of the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> and ensure that the total award includes holidays, sick leave and pension contributions. These details must be recorded in the business case.</p>

<p>9. Advisers will need to ensure that details of the holiday, sick leave and pension contributions are detailed in the offer letter so the customer and employer are clear on exactly what <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will fund.</p>

<p>10. Advisers must decide on the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> type or types they’re looking to award and confirm this with the customer and employer.</p>

<p>11. The <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> element of <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> offers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>financial support to cover the full cost of providing <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> assistance in the workplace</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>assistance for the customer to get to and from work</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>12. In all cases, support is given in relation to the customer’s job role.</p>

<p>13. There are different types of <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> who can give different types of help. Some will be ad-hoc or short term, whilst others will be needed on a more regular basis.</p>

<p>14. Advisers must award all of the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> elements that are appropriate to the customer’s needs. This will enable them to overcome the workplace barriers they face because of their disability, illness or health condition.</p>

<p>15. The award could be made up of more than one type of <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>There may be a <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> job coach to help a customer learn and retain the role. They may also have a <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> job aide to help with some aspects of the job the customer can’t do on their own because of their disability, illness or health condition.</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>An autistic customer may have a trigger at the weekend and doesn’t feel they can go to work. With coping strategies not helping, the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> could assist by ensuring further coping strategies are developed to enable the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> customer to attend work. This could involve establishing an action plan at the end of the week, where the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> and customer discuss how the week went and plan for the next week. The <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> could then follow this up with the customer, to see if they’re ready for work on Monday morning. If the plan doesn’t work, they can work with the customer to determine what more is needed.</p>

<h4>Example 3</h4>

<p>A deaf customer who uses English and <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> may use speech to text for training, and <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> interpreting for meetings with colleagues.</p>

<p>16. The <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> mustn’t do the work of the customer.</p>

<p>17. The only exception to this, is when a <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> job aide is provided. A <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> job aide may be used when the customer is unable to do their job because of their disability, illness or health condition. This can be up to 20% of customer’s contracted hours.</p>

<p>18. Advisers can ignore the provision of personal care in the workplace, as this is not a replacement of duties. Advisers must consider where the personal care element is required when awarding a carer element.</p>

<p>19. Advisers must identify the tasks the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> will do for the customer and confirm they’re all work-related. These may include mental health support.</p>

<p>20. A <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> cannot give nursing care or help get the customer up and ready in the morning.</p>

<p>21. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support starts ‘at the front door’ i.e. when a person is ready to go to work.</p>

<p>22. Support can be provided outside of the normal working pattern as a one-off event. For example, doing preparation on a Sunday evening. However, this must fall within the normal hours of an <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> customer’s contracted hours’. It must also be reported as a change of circumstances.</p>

<p>23. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> funding is not available for overtime.</p>

<p>24. If advisers are considering support for a <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> job aide, they’ll need to decide whether:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the customer is making decisions and directing the actions of the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> job aide</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> job aide is enabling the customer to do the job</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>25. If both of the above are true, advisers must identify tasks the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> job aide will do and decide how many hours can be supported. This is up to a maximum of 100% of the customer’s contracted hours.</p>

<p>26. If only one of the above applies, then a maximum of 20% of the customer’s contracted hours can be supported by a <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> job aide.</p>

<h3>Assessing a customer’s needs</h3>

<p>27. Advisers must consider whether the support is the most suitable and cost effective solution to overcome the workplace barriers faced by the customer’s disability, illness or health condition. This applies to every application.</p>

<p>28. Assistive technology, for example, a loop induction system or use of a Video Relay Service (<abbr title="video relay service">VRS</abbr>) may be more cost-effective than providing a <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr>. This all depends on the customer’s needs in the job they’re doing and must form part of the considerations and options detailed within the business case.</p>

<p>Note: Advisers must consider whether the best solution for the customer is a blend of assisted technology, a Support Worker or Support Workers.</p>

<p>29. Advisers must discuss the possibility of job restructuring with the employer when the customer has difficulties with certain duties. This might avoid the need for a <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> whilst ensuring the employer is fully aware of all the steps they could take to make reasonable adjustments to fulfil their duty under the Equality Act.</p>

<p>30. The adviser and customer must discuss:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the different types of <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the most suitable <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> that meets their individual needs</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>31. This must be done before making a final decision.</p>

<p>See: <a class="govuk-link" href="#types-of-support-worker">Types of support worker</a>.</p>

<p>32. If advisers are unsure about the support needed, they can trial a level of support for a shorter period of time. This trial period will help determine the right level of support that meets the needs of the customer. Reviews will ensure the correct level of support is put into place.</p>

<h3>Support workers replacing the need for another employee</h3>

<p>33. Support is given to meet the customer’s needs, not the employer’s.</p>

<p>34. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> must not be used to help the employer avoid employing other staff where needed.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>A Chief Executive role would be expected to have some type of personal assistant or secretary. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> would not provide a <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> to carry out tasks such as filing or photocopying. These tasks would not usually fall within the job description of someone working at Chief Executive level.</p>

<h3>Benefits for the employer</h3>

<p>35. You must consider any benefits the employer may get where a <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> needs to be available at all times but may not be working all the time and is able to take on other duties. If there’s a benefit to the employer, you must negotiate a business benefit contribution.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>A <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> provides assistance by moving through the building and retrieving documents from the printer. There’ll be times the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> isn’t providing support to the customer. It’s likely the employer would utilise the skills, where appropriate, of the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> if they are an employee of the business to undertake other work during that down time such as other filing or retrieval of documents that are not related to the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> customer. This would be a benefit to the employer’s business and as a result a business benefit contribution would be required.</p>

<h3>Employer withdraws support</h3>

<p>36. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will not provide support in situations where an employer has been giving support to an employee then withdraws help as a money saving strategy.</p>

<p>37. Employers have a legal obligation under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/equality-act-2010-guidance">Equality Act 2010</a> to make reasonable adjustments. If adjustments have already been made, employers cannot withdraw them just because <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> funding may be available.</p>

<p>38. If advisers have any doubts, they should ask for written evidence from the employer as to why support that was offered earlier has now been withdrawn.</p>

<p>39. This also applies to help offered earlier by a colleague if there has been no other change of circumstance, other than the withdrawal of help supplied earlier.</p>

<p>40. If an employer withdraws support, advisers must not offer <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support.</p>

<p>41. If an employer stops support that was only put in place temporarily until <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> funding was agreed, this is not regarded as withdrawing support and the application can continue as normal.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>A nurse who cannot drive would normally go out with a colleague to be able to visit patients in the community to provide the nursing assistance their employer requires as part of their job. A part of a restructuring exercise (for cost efficiencies), the employer decides they cannot afford to continue to support two nurses to go to a single patient’s address. As a result, the ability to be driven by the colleague is withdrawn and means the customer would need to drive themselves which they are unable to do. This would be the employer removing the support that was previously in place for cost saving measures and <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> would not be able to support this.</p>

<h3>An employer wants to provide support through an existing employee</h3>

<p>42. This can often be the most suitable and cost effective solution for all concerned. If the employee is being used to give full time support, <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can repay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a full salary</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>national insurance contributions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pension, leave and sickness payments</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>costs of a temporary <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> to cover the sick employed <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: The customer must contact <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> to report this for it to be considered.</p>

<p>43. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> cannot make a contribution towards costs that the employer would have to meet anyway. For example, heating, lighting and other building costs.</p>

<p>44. If the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> is off sick for a period of time and the customer is remaining in work, it’s possible to fund this via <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> and should be considered to ensure the retention of the customer’s job.</p>

<p>45. Set a review date of four weeks (or the period agreed during the decision making process). This is to see if the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> is likely to return to work. Advisers can then in the short or longer term, identify the most appropriate support that can be put in place for the customer. This will ensure they are being supported in work and value for money is being achieved.</p>

<p>46. Advisers need to confirm that the total profiled costs over the year don’t exceed the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr>’s full salary. If they do, advisers must limit <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> funding to the full salary costs only.</p>

<p>Note: This is if the adviser agrees to pay the employer at an hourly rate.</p>

<p>47. A booking fee must not be paid when employers use their own employees to support customers.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>A customer needs 25 hours support per week and the employer has a suitably qualified employee who can give the necessary support. The employee’s salary (including all costs) is £27,000 per year.</p>

<p>The ‘going rate’ for support of this type is £28 per hour in the local area.</p>

<p>In this case, you must work out the cost of support over the year i.e. 25 (hours per week) x £28 (rate per hour) x 52 (weeks per year).</p>

<p>As this total cost would be £36,400 which is significantly higher than their salary, you should restrict the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> grant to £27,000</p>

<p>If the same customer however, needed only 15 hours support per week, then using the average rate, it would work out at a cost of £21,840 per year. This is less than their salary, and the most cost effective choice. This is this amount that <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can pay.</p>

<h3>The customer or employer wants to recruit a new employee as a support worker</h3>

<p>48. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can repay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a full salary</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>national insurance contributions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pension, leave and sickness payments</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>recruitment costs including advertising</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>costs of a temporary <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> to cover the sick employed <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>49. Rates of pay should be looked at again at the yearly review or if the level of support changes.</p>

<p>50. It’s usual to agree to pay for the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> if they or the customer are sick for up to four weeks in a rolling 12-month period from the first period of sickness.</p>

<p>51. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can pay recruitment costs up to 5% of the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr>’s gross salary. This covers the cost of adding the new employee to the payroll and any other HR activities. This must only be done if the employer asks for it. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will repay the full cost when an employer provides evidence to show that they have had to pay an amount greater than this percentage. They must provide a breakdown to demonstrate how this amount is made up.</p>

<p>52. Redundancy and notice payments costs can be paid. Don’t profile redundancy or notice payments into the applicant’s profile. These costs must be profiled when they occur.</p>

<p>53. Costs cannot be applied for retrospectively and would be unlikely to be paid if such an application was received.</p>

<p>54. Advisers need to agree a fixed period for which <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will pay to cover unexpected absences such as sick leave. This must be included in the offer letter outlining the agreed support including the number of hours and rate of pay etc.</p>

<p>55. If a customer accepts the responsibilities of being their <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr>’s employer they might need additional support to fulfil this role properly. These costs can be approved through <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> where the need is related to their disability, illness or health condition.</p>

<p>56. Advisers must agree an extra number of hours initially, but keep this under review. Don’t meet this need through an increase in the hourly rate paid to the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr>.</p>

<p>57. Customers and <abbr title="support workers">SWs</abbr> who wish to find out their employment position must be told to contact their local HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) office.</p>

<p>58. <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> has a Helpline for new employers.</p>

<p>Telephone: 0300 200 3211</p>

<p>Text phone: 0300 200 3212</p>

<p>59. If any financial liability is incurred as a result of a customer being considered an employer by the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, advisers may arrange for the customer to be reimbursed from this element. In all such cases, tell the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> policy team of the details at once.</p>

<p>60. Customers who use family or friends to provide <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> help are equally subject to the considerations above.</p>

<h3>Support workers booked through an agency</h3>

<p>61. If the customer or employer wishes to use an alternative supplier, advisers must confirm that the rate quoted is reasonable.</p>

<p>62. All quotes should be a total amount, including all support, travels costs and any necessary booking fees. This allows the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> adviser to see which agency offers the most cost effective solution for the entire service.</p>

<h3>Payment for a support worker</h3>

<p>63. Payment for a <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> will only be made for the days on which a customer would usually work or for other days for example, leave written in the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr>’s contract of employment.</p>

<p>64. Advisers must ask for a copy of the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr>’s contract and keep it in the customer’s case file to help verify future claims.</p>

<p>65. Where the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> is employed by the customer or customer’s Employer they will continue to be paid if the customer is sick for up to 4 weeks, in a 12-month period from the first period of sickness</p>

<p>66. Advisers must profile all costs, inclusive of VAT, over a 52-week period as the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> may be entitled to holiday/sickness payments from the customer/employer under the Working Time Regulations introduced in October 1998.</p>

<p>67. Under the regulations, a worker is entitled to 5.6 weeks’ leave or at least 28 days if a person was to work a 5-day week. This isn’t in addition to contractual rights.</p>

<p>See:  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/holiday-entitlement-rights">holiday entitlement</a> on the GOV.<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> website.</p>

<p>68. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will pay for these weeks leave, as it’s an extra cost that would not have been relevant had the employer or customer not needed to employ the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr>.</p>

<p>See: <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/" rel="external">Health &amp; Safety Executive</a> website for specific information.</p>

<p>See: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/pay-and-work-rights">Pay and work rights</a> on the GOV.<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> website.</p>

<p>See: <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/contact/faqs/workingtimedirective.htm" rel="external">The Working Time Regulations</a> on the Heath and Safety Executive website.</p>

<h3>Flexible personalisation</h3>

<p>69. Build in a tolerance to allow for small increases in support without the need for approval of a new business case and based on need only.</p>

<p>70. The percentage tolerance range must be between 1.5 and 5%, and must only be applied after all reasons have been included in the reaching of the yearly profile.</p>

<p>Note: If the small changes become the norm, then this should be considered as a change of circumstance and the award revised.</p>

<h3>Additional payments</h3>

<h4>Travel expenses</h4>

<p>1. <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> travel expenses must be included in the hourly rate quoted for support. This makes sure <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> agrees the most cost effective solution for the entire support.</p>

<p>2. If there are cases where <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> have agreed to pay travel expenses, you must repay costs at either the standard class public transport or the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> mileage rate of 25p per mile (if they have driven to the assignment).</p>

<p>3. Car parking charges cannot be reimbursed.</p>

<h4>Customer visiting overseas</h4>

<p>4. Advisers must first establish if the customer is classed as a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> resident for <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> tax purposes. This must be done before they consider <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support for a work visit overseas.</p>

<p>5. Advisers will do this by confirming the customer has been resident in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> for more than 364 days in the last four full consecutive tax years recording this on the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> system.</p>

<p>Note: Each tax year commences from 6 April.</p>

<p>6. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support is available for work-related trips outside of Great Britain. However, advisers must consider all aspects of the trip to identify the most appropriate support.</p>

<p>7. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> advisers must determine the reasons why the customer is going to work abroad. These reasons must be recorded on the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> system.</p>

<p>Note: The visit can only be funded if it’s part of the customer’s job. It cannot be funded, if it’s a developmental or career development opportunity.</p>

<p>8. You must be satisfied that the support being provided is for the customer’s job.</p>

<p>9. You must establish the exact details and reason of the trip. These must be recorded on the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> system and must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the work location</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the method and cost of transport to get there from their home</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the method and cost of journeys taken during their stay</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>travel dates</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the number of hours they’ll be working</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the support that will be required</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>accommodation costs</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>10. You must review all travel and accommodation costs before agreeing <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support. You must determine and assure yourself that value for money is being achieved. This doesn’t mean the cheapest option. Various factors must be considered including any discounted rates an employer gets or any contractual agreements leading to greater discounts.</p>

<p>11. You must discuss costs with the customer’s employer and undertake research using the internet. This includes any information from the customer about the trip.</p>

<p>See: <a class="govuk-link" href="#travel-to-work-and-travel-in-work">Travel in Work</a> for overseas travel for the customer and additional costs.</p>

<h4>Support worker attending meetings, conferences or training as a delegate</h4>

<p>12. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> funding doesn’t cover the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> attending meetings, conferences or training sessions as a participant.</p>

<p>13. The <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> is only engaged to give full support to the customer and cannot do these other tasks at the same time.</p>

<h4>Overnight support</h4>

<p>14. Where support is needed overnight, for example to be at a conference, the approved costs must be based on hotel rates on the DWP Business Travel and expenses website.</p>

<p>Note: Exceptional circumstances can be considered however. For example, the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> needs to stay in an adjacent room.</p>

<p>15. Repayment of necessary travel costs must be considered and must be limited to standard class public transport rates or the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> mileage rate of 25p per mile (if the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> is driving to the event).</p>

<p>16. If the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> drives the customer to the event, you must consider whether this is an extra cost, as the customer or their employer would have to meet these costs as usual business travel.</p>

<h4>Meal allowance</h4>

<p>17. Extra <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> meal costs owed for visits/trips outside their normal working pattern can be paid back on the production of a valid receipt.</p>

<p>18. Costs will be limited to the same restrictions and rates given on the DWP Business Travel and expenses website.</p>

<h4>Cancellation fees</h4>

<p>19. There may be a claim from a <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> for a cancellation fee. Claims can be considered if the cancellation is unavoidable and not caused by the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> or employer.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>The customer has a <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> for two hours each week for a team meeting. The customer phones in sick on the day of the meeting and notifies the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> that they will not be needed. As a result, the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> claims a cancellation fee. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can consider funding this request.</p>

<p>If the employer cancelled the team meeting several days before however but forgot to tell the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr>, then the employer should take responsibility for this and meet any resulting costs.</p>

<p>Note: Cancellation fees for British Sign Language Interpreters can be found on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nubsli.com/guidance/interpreter-fees/" rel="external">National Union of British Sign Language Interpreters</a>  website.</p>

<h3>Types of support worker</h3>

<p>1. Advisers must consider the customer’s needs and take an holistic approach to the support. It may be necessary to award more than one type of <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> to meet the need.   It may also be necessary to have a blended approach of a Support Worker and assistive technology.    If in doubt, check with the customer.</p>

<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>A deaf customer may use Speech to Text for their workplace induction so they have notes they can refer back to later. <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> Interpreting may be required for meetings with colleagues and customers and Remote <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> Interpreting (<abbr title="video relay service">VRS</abbr> / <abbr title="video remote interpreting">VRI</abbr>) may be used for phone calls.</p>

<h3>British Sign Language (<abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr>)</h3>

<h4>Registered Sign Language Interpreters (<abbr title="registered sign language interpreter">RSLI</abbr>) and Trainee Sign Language Interpreters (<abbr title="trainee sign language interpreter">TSLI</abbr>)</h4>

<p>2. Deaf people may describe themselves as Deaf, deaf, deafened, hard of hearing, having a hearing loss. In these instructions we use ‘deaf’ to include all of them.</p>

<p>3. Deaf people’s needs are diverse.  Deaf people may have some or no hearing, and may use British Sign Language, English, or both.</p>

<p>4. Deaf people who use English may have varying levels of fluency and ability with written English, speaking English and understanding spoken English.</p>

<p>5.  British Sign Language (<abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr>) is a language in its own right. It is not a signed form of English.</p>

<p>6. Just having the ability to use two languages is not enough to be able to interpret. Interpreting is a skill that requires training and experience to be able to transfer meaning between British Sign Language (<abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr>) and English effectively. This provides the customer with the most accurate translation service.</p>

<p><abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> 1 and 2 Equivalent to GCSE</p>

<p><abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> 3 Equivalent to A-level</p>

<p>BSL4 Equivalent to first year of undergraduate level</p>

<p><abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> 6 Equivalent to graduate level</p>

<p>7. A <abbr title="registered sign language interpreter">RSLI</abbr> and <abbr title="trainee sign language interpreter">TSLI</abbr> must have completed or started the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 6 NVQ diploma in Sign Language Interpreting approved</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>undergraduate course</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>postgraduate course</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>8. Some interpreters, especially if they live and work in Scotland, may be <abbr title="Scottish Association of Sign Language Interpreters">SASLI</abbr> Registered Interpreter Members with the Scottish Association of Sign Language Interpreters <abbr title="Scottish Association of Sign Language Interpreters">SASLI</abbr>.</p>

<p>See: <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.sasli.org.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="Scottish Association of Sign Language Interpreters">SASLI</abbr> website</a>for more information.</p>

<p>9. A Trainee Sign Language Interpreter (<abbr title="trainee sign language interpreter">TSLI</abbr>) is someone who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>has started their Level 6 interpreting qualification and intends to become a Registered Sign Language Interpreter (<abbr title="registered sign language interpreter">RSLI</abbr>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is potentially active on the <abbr title="National Register of Communication Professionals with Deaf and Deafblind People">NRPCD</abbr></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: You can check their name is on the register by visiting the NRCPD website. Enter their name, making sure you select ‘include trainees’ at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>10. <abbr title="trainee sign language interpreters">TSLIs</abbr> with NRCPD must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>be on an NRCPD approved interpreting course which leads to registered status</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have been assessed by a qualified assessor or verifier as meeting the NRCPD standards for trainee Interpreters</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have a minimum standard of level 4 in <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have a named supervisor/mentor who is a <abbr title="registered sign language interpreter">RSLI</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have sufficient interpreter training or experience to be aware of developing professional competence boundaries</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>See: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nrcpd.org.uk/" rel="external">National Registers of Communication Professionals (NRCPD)</a></p>

<p>Note: Communication Support Worker (<abbr title="communication support worker">CSW</abbr>) don’t have training in interpreting.</p>

<p>11. A Trainee Sign Language Interpreter (<abbr title="trainee sign language interpreter">TSLI</abbr>) is on the path to becoming an interpreter. A <abbr title="communication support worker">CSW</abbr> is not.</p>

<p>12. Sign language interpreters transfer meaning from one spoken or signed language into another signed or spoken language.</p>

<p>13. Customers requiring sign language interpretation will usually require a <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr>/English interpreter. British Sign Language (<abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr>) is a language in its own right. It is not a signed form of English.</p>

<p>14. NRCPD Registered Sign Language Interpreters (<abbr title="registered sign language interpreters">RSLIs</abbr>) have level 6 qualifications in both their second language, such as <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr>, and interpreting.</p>

<p>15. An NRCPD regulated <abbr title="trainee sign language interpreter">TSLI</abbr> may be suitable for some assignments. Advisers must check with the customer to make sure their needs can be met by a <abbr title="trainee sign language interpreter">TSLI</abbr>. Advisers should remind customers that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="trainee sign language interpreters">TSLIs</abbr> must not work in the criminal justice system or mental health settings</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="trainee sign language interpreters">TSLIs</abbr> should exercise caution when accepting work in a social care setting</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the customer should ask the <abbr title="trainee sign language interpreter">TSLI</abbr> if NRCPD has placed further restrictions on the assignments they can take on</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>16. Some trainee interpreters, especially if they live and work in Scotland, may be <abbr title="Scottish Association of Sign Language Interpreters">SASLI</abbr> Trainee Interpreter Members with the Scottish Association of Sign Language Interpreters <abbr title="Scottish Association of Sign Language Interpreters">SASLI</abbr>.</p>

<p>See: <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.sasli.org.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="Scottish Association of Sign Language Interpreters">SASLI</abbr> website</a>for more information.</p>

<p>17. If the customer is not able to find or does not want to engage an interpreter registered with <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nrcpd.org.uk/" rel="external">NRCPD</a>, advisers can ask customers to ensure they check and provide us with the following information. Does the Support Worker hold:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the qualification(s) required for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nrcpd.org.uk/" rel="external">NRCPD</a> registration</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>appropriate Professional Indemnity insurance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a standard check from the Disclosure and Barring Service</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note:  Documentation should be stored in the customer’s case file.</p>

<h4>Remote <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> interpreting (<abbr title="video relay service">VRS</abbr>/<abbr title="video remote interpreting">VRI</abbr>)</h4>

<p>18. Video Relay Services (<abbr title="video relay service">VRS</abbr>) and Video Remote Interpreting (<abbr title="video remote interpreting">VRI</abbr>) are both services where the interpreter is in a different location to the customer.</p>

<p>19. Deaf customers will watch the interpreter on a screen, smart phone, tablet, laptop or, computer.</p>

<p>Note: In this guidance <abbr title="video relay service">VRS</abbr> and <abbr title="video remote interpreting">VRI</abbr> are referred to as “Remote <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> interpreting (<abbr title="video relay service">VRS</abbr> / <abbr title="video remote interpreting">VRI</abbr>)”.</p>

<h4>Video Relay Services (<abbr title="video relay service">VRS</abbr>)</h4>

<p>20. <abbr title="video relay service">VRS</abbr> is when the customer, the person they are communicating with and the sign language interpreter  are all at different locations.</p>

<h4>Video Remote Interpreting (<abbr title="video remote interpreting">VRI</abbr>)</h4>

<p>21. <abbr title="video remote interpreting">VRI</abbr>, is when the customer and the person they are communicating with are at the same location but the sign language interpreter  is at a different location.</p>

<h4>Interpreter with deafblind people</h4>

<p>22. The term ‘interpreter with deafblind people’ refers to someone with specific training and skills, and who is registered with the NRCPD in this category.</p>

<p>23. As there are very few registered interpreters with deafblind people, many deafblind people will work with <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> interpreters who have additional skills, for example, in Close Frame interpreting.</p>

<h4>Communication Support Workers</h4>

<p>24. The term Communication Support Worker (<abbr title="communication support worker">CSW</abbr>) refers to people who use a variety of methods to support deaf and deafblind people access communication. CSWs are not interpreters.</p>

<p>25. CSWs are not interpreters and aren’t trained or assessed to interpret . Their role is to support customers to access communication in English, using a wide range of techniques. For example, note taking or rewriting emails.</p>

<p>26. Most CSWs have some ability in <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr>, up to level 3 (Level 3 is similar to an ‘A’ level, so is not fluent enough for interpreting.) However, this is not a requirement in order to receive <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> funding.</p>

<h4>Deciding whether <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> interpreters and/or CSWs are required</h4>

<p>27. A sign language interpreter should be used in a situation which calls solely or mainly for interpretation.</p>

<p>28. Ask the customer whether they need to use an <abbr title="registered sign language interpreter">RSLI</abbr>, a <abbr title="trainee sign language interpreter">TSLI</abbr> or a <abbr title="communication support worker">CSW</abbr> for their work access needs.</p>

<p>29. Check that the customer understands the difference between Registered Interpreters (<abbr title="registered sign language interpreter">RSLI</abbr>), Trainee Interpreters (<abbr title="trainee sign language interpreter">TSLI</abbr>), and/or Communication Support Workers (<abbr title="communication support worker">CSW</abbr>), and is making an informed choice.</p>

<p>30. The customer may want to use <abbr title="registered sign language interpreters">RSLIs</abbr>, <abbr title="trainee sign language interpreters">TSLIs</abbr> and/or CSWs in different settings. If this is agreed, their award should reflect this.</p>

<p>31. A <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> interpreter should be used for situations in which clear and accurate communication is essential, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>team meetings</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>appraisals</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>disciplinary meetings</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>legal meetings, such as a tribunal or court hearing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>most training sessions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>conferences on an unknown or technical subject</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>32. A <abbr title="communication support worker">CSW</abbr> may be appropriate for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>team meetings</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>basic training</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>conferences on a known subject</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>one to one support</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>General considerations for all interpreters</h3>

<p>33. Due to the physical and mental demands of interpreting, there are a number of areas to consider before agreeing what interpreter support is needed.</p>

<p>34. Two or more interpreters may be required depending on the duration, nature and intensity of the work involved. These and the considerations set out below must be explored with the customer.</p>

<p>35. Consider whether:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>it’s a straightforward one-to-one meeting</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it’s a long meeting and whether there are no or insufficient breaks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there’s a large audience</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are several people going who require a <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> interpreter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the topic is straightforward</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there’s a rapid change over of speakers that might make interpreting more difficult</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are implications for the customer or others if there is a misinterpretation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it’s linked to the customer’s actual job</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the setting is informal or formal</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are structured breaks in place</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there will be ‘break out’ or syndicate exercises</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>36. You must discuss with the event organiser / employer what reasonable adjustments they have made to support communication such as interpreters.</p>

<p>37. If you’re satisfied the event organiser / employer has taken all reasonable steps you must consider providing <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> funding for more than one interpreter.</p>

<h3>Lip speaker</h3>

<p>38. Lip speakers are trained so that their speech is easy to lip read.</p>

<p>39. They are used in conferences or meetings where speakers are hard to lipread because of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>distance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>accents</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>speed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>use of jargon</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>facial hair</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lighting</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are lots of people speaking in turn in a group</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>40. They repeat silently what is being said by the speaker using clear lip patterns and will usually sit or stand close to the deaf person so they can be easily seen.  They may also use some gesture or signs to support understanding.</p>

<p>41. Support can be put in place for deaf people who don’t use <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr>.</p>

<p>42. If the event is likely to last more than a couple of hours you may need to consider the provision of two lip speakers.</p>

<p>43. To register as a Lip speaker with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nrcpd.org.uk/" rel="external">NRCPD</a> someone must hold an NRCPD approved qualification in Lip speaking.</p>

<h3>Note taker</h3>

<p>44. It will mainly be used by customers who are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>deaf</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>dyslexic.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>A deaf customer may need a note taker at meetings and conferences. This may be because a <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> user is unable to follow an interpreter and take notes at the same time.</p>

<p>45. Before authorising a note taker, discuss with the employer whether there is someone else who could take the relevant notes. There’s usually someone at the meeting taking notes or minutes. If so, there’s no need for a <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> note taker.</p>

<p>46. To register as a notetaker with NRCPD, someone must hold an NRCPD approved qualification in notetaking.</p>

<h3>Speech to Text</h3>

<p>47. A Speech to Text Support Worker, for example a palantypist, provide deaf users with access to spoken English.</p>

<p>48. Speech to Text is normally done by palantypists or stenographers using special keyboards. The information is converted into full written English that is seen on a screen for example, a tablet, a laptop, a conference videos screen.  After the event a transcript can be made available.</p>

<p>49. It can be provided by the speech to text Support Worker being in the same room as the customer.</p>

<p>50. If there is a strong and stable Wi-Fi connection, availability of a tablet or laptop with a high quality microphone, it may be possible to provide speech to text remotely, with the operator at a different location. This must be discussed with the customer.</p>

<p>51. To register as a Speech to Text Reporter with NRCPD, someone must have passed an NRCPD eligibility assessment in Speech to Text Reporting.</p>

<h3>Re-Speaker</h3>

<p>52. Re-speaking is a speech to text service. This is where, instead of typing, a remote operator repeats what they can hear, a computer using speech recognition turns it into English words, which are sent to be read on a screen.</p>

<h3>Carer</h3>

<p>53. A carer is someone who helps a customer overcome physical barriers. For example, help with mobility or toilet use at work.</p>

<p>54. Check with the customer whether they’re getting help from elsewhere as there could be some overlap with other benefits such as Disability Living Allowance (<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>), Personal Independence Payment (<abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>) or Carers Allowance (<abbr title="Carer's Allowance">CA</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Coping Strategy Support (Outside of working hours)</h3>

<p>55. Customers who have a complex disability or health condition who experience triggers outside of work which affect their ability to work, can be offered support with coping strategies outside of working hours.</p>

<p>For example, A customer with complex autism may require outside of working hours’ support to ensure they are able to attend their workplace.</p>

<p>56. The outside of working hours’ support is provided to ensure the customer is able to return to employment at the earliest opportunity and they remain engaged with their employer to retain their job readiness.</p>

<p>57. Outside of working hours’ support should only be offered to customers with a triggered complex disability or health condition.</p>

<p>58. Outside of working hours’ support is limited to a maximum of 14 days in any rolling 12-month period, and no more than 4 periods in a rolling 12 months from when the first period of support was originally provided. The appropriate support will enable the customer to develop long term strategies to overcome the need for out of working hours’ support.</p>

<p>Note: Service Delivery must record these periods in the business case</p>

<p>59. Where someone needs support beyond the 14-day period or occurrences of out of working hours are needed more frequently than 4 periods within a 12-month period, this would suggest their condition is more complex and it may require more specialist medical support which is not available from Access to Work. In this instance the customer must be signposted to their GP or healthcare professional to seek further information and advice on the next steps to take. This includes any advice to their employer.</p>

<p>60. In situations where a customer has developed a new trigger and needs specific assistance in the workplace to develop a coping strategy which will last longer than 14 days, <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr> support should be offered. This service is specifically designed to provide a tailored 9-month period of support working through an action plan to develop and test coping strategies in order to ensure at the end of the 9-month period they have retained their employment and have the skills/tools to be enabled within the workplace.</p>

<h3>Driver</h3>

<p>61. A <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> driver enables someone who would normally drive but can’t due to their disability, illness or health condition to be mobile as part of their job role.</p>

<p>62. A <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> driver may be authorised to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>drive the customer to and from work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>travel during their working day.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>63. It shouldn’t be used when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>someone varies their journey to drive a disabled person to work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>friends and relatives who are paid a mileage fee for the duty.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: These applicants must be considered under <a class="govuk-link" href="#travel-to-work-and-travel-in-work">Travel to Work (<abbr title="Travel to Work">TtW</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>64. If a <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> driver is needed on an ongoing basis, inform the employer or customer to go through a recruitment agency.</p>

<p>65. If the <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> is needed to make a return journey, but it’s unlikely they could return home and get back to collect the customer within two hours, then we can pay an amount for ‘downtime’. This payment must be limited to the national minimum wage rate.</p>

<p>See: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates">National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage rates</a> on the GOV.<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> website.</p>

<h3>Job aide</h3>

<p>66. A job aide may be used where the customer is unable, due to disability to do part of their job.</p>

<p>67. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can consider paying up to 100% of this type of support if the job aide is providing enabling support for the customer.</p>

<p>68. If the job aide is providing support which the customer cannot do themselves and requires the assistance to complete that whole task then <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can only consider paying up to 20% of the customer’s contracted hours in total for the role.</p>

<h3>Job coach</h3>

<p>69. A job coach is a person who gives specialised on-site support to someone disabled who has a job to start and will assist the employee:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>learn the job</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>keep the job</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>70. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> customers will have found a job by the time their application is taken or have a Work Trial to start. Therefore coaching for job search will not be funded by <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>.</p>

<p>71. A job coach analyses tasks and breaks them down into parts. The coach identifies skills and knowledge required to do the job.</p>

<p>72. They show the employee how to do each task:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>efficiently</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>safely and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in a logical way.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>73. A job coach can provide soft skills coaching for customers with Asperger’s syndrome or other learning difficulties. This helps them learn appropriate communication styles in the workplace.</p>

<p>74. Soft skills can include social graces, communication, language, personal habits, interpersonal skills, managing people and leadership. This list is not exhaustive. Advisers can specify other duties in consultation with the customer, employer and job coach.</p>

<p>75. The job coach stays with the employee until their learning needs are fully met and levels of support can be safely reduced.</p>

<p>76. The job coach checks progress, initially at pre-agreed intervals and then on an ad hoc basis. This can be requested by the employee or employer. This may be when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a change of job or personal circumstances occurs or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>when an employee’s performance or behaviour gives cause for concern</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>77. The job coach aims to support and encourage an employee to become as independent as possible, taking into account individual circumstances, until the level of support needed is reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>78. Job coaches work primarily, though not only, with the learning disabled and those with mental health conditions.</p>

<p>79. They can also be used to help and support other groups of people such as the physically disabled.</p>

<p>80. If an employee, as a result of an illness or accident, needs to change the way they do their job or re-learn their job, this support can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>settling in</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>help with learning or re-learning their job</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>coping strategies</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>travel</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>making prompt cards for learning and routine tasks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>some advocacy work with the employer for example, negotiating reasonable adjustments</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>81. As the role of the job coach is flexible, their duties may include some or all of those outlined above. This list is not exhaustive and you can specify other duties in consultation with the customer, employer and job coach.</p>

<p>82. To reflect the flexibility of job coaching, advisers must make sure the support put in place is tailored to the needs of the individual.</p>

<p>83. It’s essential that an action plan is drawn up between customer and job coach. This is done during the first weeks of support. It identifies how support will taper off to a point where it’s no longer needed on a regular basis.</p>

<p>84. Once the action plan has been drawn up you will need to look at it regularly to make sure that support is tapering off as planned.</p>

<p>85. Job coaching is always more intensive during the first weeks or months of work. Intensive means working actively with the customer for all or part of each working day. This intensive period is varied to individual needs but should not normally last longer than 26 weeks.</p>

<p>86. An individual may require intensive support for longer than 26 weeks. There is discretion to allow up to a further 13 weeks provided an extension will allow support to begin to taper off. For example, a problem or crisis in someone’s personal life may mean that they take longer to settle in work than expected or their work activities or line manager have changed during their first weeks at work.</p>

<p>87. At the end of the intensive period of support, job coaching must begin to taper off as recorded in the action plan. The tapering off period is not fixed and needs to take the individual needs into account. The aim must be that the individual will be working unaided within a suitable period of time.</p>

<p>88. If support is not beginning to taper off by the end of the 26 weeks (plus the 13 week extension if appropriate) review the application and determine if any of the barriers the customer is continuing to face could be available via another <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> element or if there is a piece of Assistive Technology that could assist.</p>

<p>89. Even after an individual is working unaided there may be times when further job coaching is needed. For example, if the work changes or there is a change of line manager or location.</p>

<p>90. Support is flexible. Tell the customer they can ask for further support at any time by making a change of circumstances application.</p>

<p>91. In these situations, the adviser simply confirms with the customer and Job Coach the reason for the request and how many hours of coaching needed and fund accordingly.</p>

<p>92. A new application is needed if the individual moves to new employment or if the last contact from them was more than three years ago.</p>

<p>93. Job coaches are employed by a variety of organisations, including charities and local authorities. Some work on a self-employed basis. It’s essential that advisers make suitable checks to avoid double funding. Employer withdrawing support must be taken into consideration.</p>

<p>94. The employer may provide a job coach with suitable knowledge and experience of the role from within the workforce. Individuals may already have a job coach who has helped them secure the job and it’s usually sensible to allow this coach to continue in the role.</p>

<p>95. Advisers must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>assess and agree initial levels of support with both customer and job coach.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>check for evidence of any pre-existing funding streams by asking the customer, employer and job coach</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>check that the employer withdrawing support doesn’t apply</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>establish the period of intensive support likely to be required up to a maximum of 26 weeks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if an employee requests support upfront, the Case Manager must establish the reason for payment of upfront sessions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where a company has cash flow problems or is a small business and it means the disabled person would not be able to access that support, then we would look to consider the ‘pro-forma invoice’ route where we could pay for support upfront</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Case Manager’s must then consider the most cost effective option for the customer. For example, it may be more cost effective to agree to a block minimum of 12 weeks as this may be more cost effective than another suppliers quotes for a period of 8 weeks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>once funding is agreed and deemed the most cost effective option, case managers must document this fully in the element and business case for PO’s to view when approving/rejecting claims</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>agree an action plan with the job coach as early as possible into the role and no later than 3 weeks into employment which should clearly give an indication as to how and when the amount of support is likely to taper off, for example, full time intensive support for the first two months followed by a week by week reduction, if appropriate, until support has been reduced to a minimum.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>agree a review date two thirds of the way through the intensive activity period of support</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>review the action plan with the customer and job coach to confirm that the need for support is tapering off</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>exceptionally, agree an extension of up to 13 weeks if the need for further intensive support has been clearly identified with the customer and job coach</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>set a review date before the extension period has elapsed to check that support is tapering off. If it becomes apparent that the customer is unable to work unaided after an extension period has been granted, consider what alternative support might be able to be funded from Access to Work to include <abbr title="support worker">SW</abbr> or specialist aids and equipment</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>96. Any cut or withdrawal of support must be agreed with the customer and job coach.</p>

<p>97. A customer can ask for further help at any time if their circumstances change.</p>

<h3>Personal reader</h3>

<p>98. Support is available for those needing help with reading. This may be due to dyslexia, blindness or sight loss.</p>

<p>99. They need access to text that cannot be provided by scanners or other specialist aids or equipment.</p>

<p>100. It’s likely to be used in conjunction with specialist aids or equipment but the two forms of help must not overlap.</p>

<p>101. Support may be used as an interim measure when a customer is waiting delivery of equipment or other support.</p>

<h3>Travel buddy</h3>

<p>102. This is someone who accompanies the customer when travelling to and from work. For example, where a customer has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>epilepsy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a visual impairment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>fear of travelling such as agoraphobia and who cannot manage travelling alone</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>103. You may wish to consider this type of support for a short and decreasing period to allow someone newly disabled to become confident using public transport, rather than offer long term <abbr title="Travel to Work">TtW</abbr> support.</p>

<p>104. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> would consider funding the transport costs involved with the Travel Buddy using the public transport.</p>

<h4>Other</h4>

<p>105. <abbr title="support workers">SWs</abbr> can also deliver:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>strategy training to help individuals with specific learning difficulties or mental health issues cope better in work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>disability awareness training for colleagues and supervisors.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">8 Adaptation </span> to premises or equipment</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>1. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> is available to pay the additional costs to modify an employer’s or self-employed person’s premises or equipment to allow a disabled customer to work and stay in work.</p>

<p>2. This is only where it’s not the duty of the employer to make reasonable adjustments under the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/equality-act/equality-act-2010" rel="external">Equality Act 2010</a>.</p>

<p>See: <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/advice-and-guidance/what-are-reasonable-adjustments" rel="external">What are reasonable adjustments?</a> on the Equality and Human Rights Commission website</p>

<p>3. What is reasonable will depend on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the customer’s disability, illness or health condition and the effects of that disability, illness or health condition</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how practicable the changes are</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the change will overcome the disadvantage for the customer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how much money and resources are available</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the cost of making the changes</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>4. The kind of adjustments which could be made include removing, changing or providing a way of avoiding a physical feature where it is reasonable to do so.</p>

<p>5. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> funding cannot be used where there is a duty on the employer to provide facilities for disabled members of the public on their premises. For example; disabled access to public areas in a building.</p>

<p>6.This applies even if there are disabled employees who also need the facilities.</p>

<p>7. Examples of different types of adaptations for which help may be available are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ramps for wheelchairs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lifts</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the widening of doors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>disabled toilets and washrooms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>upgrades of computers and other equipment</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Employer’s legal responsibilities</h3>

<p>8. Employers must make adequate provision for disabled people present on their premises. This applies to both employees and visitors and takes into account all forms of disability.</p>

<p>9. You must be satisfied that the employer has taken action to carry out their legal responsibilities before ATW funding is allowed.</p>

<p>10. Employers have a number of legal responsibilities under the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>

</ul>

<p>11. These regulations cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>access to premises</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sanitary facilities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>parking and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>other aspects of a disabled person’s needs on working premises and buildings to which the public has access</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>12. For advice on current regulations, employers can contact:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>local authority planning departments</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Health and Safety Executive</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Equality and Human Rights Commission</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>fire and rescue authorities</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>13. The <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> assessment process must not be delayed where an employer has to finish or fully act upon health and safety, workstation assessment or Equality Act 2010 responsibilities.</p>

<p>14. Under fire safety requirements, employers have to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>carry out fire safety risk assessments and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>implement proper fire precautions and protections measures and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>maintain a fire management plan</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>15. Funding cannot be used where there is a duty on the employer to supply facilities for disabled members of the public on their premises. For example, disabled access to public areas in a building.</p>

<p>16. This applies even if there are disabled employees who also need the facilities.</p>

<h3>Employer’s Equality Act 2010 obligations</h3>

<p>17. You must not give legal advice on Equality Act 2010 obligations.</p>

<p>18. If employers are unsure about their own legal responsibilities, refer them to the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/" rel="external">Equality and Human Rights Commission website</a>.</p>

<p>19. The Equality Act 2010 places a duty on an employer to make reasonable adjustments for disabled employees.</p>

<p>20. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> funding cannot be used to support these changes. Before agreeing <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support, confirm the employer is taking their own steps to support these changes. The fact that <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> agrees to provide support, does not mean that an employer has satisfied their duty under the Equality Act 2010.</p>

<p>21. Detailed advice for employers can be found at the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/" rel="external">Equalities and Human Rights Commission website</a>.</p>

<p>22. A fact sheet covering landlord and property managers responsibilities, can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-for-disability-issues">Office for Disability Issues website</a>.</p>

<h3>Government buildings</h3>

<p>23. Support cannot be given for adaptations to crown buildings.</p>

<p>Note: A crown building is one owned by a government department, including those leased to another government department or agency.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<p>24. You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>confirm that Adaptation to Premises or Equipment (<abbr title="adaptation to premises or equipment">APE</abbr>) applies</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>talk about job restructuring with the employer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>arrange the correct technical expert to assess changes needed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>confirm the employer has met all necessary legal obligations</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>confirm the employer/customer have relevant permissions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>confirm the proposed solution is fit for purpose and value for money</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>consider the business benefit and daily living needs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>consider providing temporary support</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Confirm that adaptations to premises or equipment are suitable</h3>

<p>25. An <abbr title="adaptation to premises or equipment">APE</abbr> application is for alterations to premises or equipment that changes them from how they were originally built/supplied.</p>

<p>Note: Don’t confuse this with a <a class="govuk-link" href="#special-aids-and-equipment">Special Aids and Equipment</a> (<abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr>) case which supplies equipment.</p>

<p>26. Adaptations to new premises (post 2010), cannot normally be funded through Access to Work (<abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>). However, they can be allowed in exceptional cases.</p>

<p>Note: If you believe there’s exceptional hardship, then full details of the case should be sent to the policy team for them to consider and provide advice.</p>

<p>27. Adaptations to customers’ own vehicles, must not be put under either <abbr title="adaptation to premises or equipment">APE</abbr> nor <abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr>. They’ll sit within the <a class="govuk-link" href="#travel-to-work-and-travel-in-work">Travel to Work</a> element.</p>

<p>28. Adaptations, for example, steering, indicators, pedals and seating to a specialist vehicle supplied by the employer such as a mechanical digger are put under the <abbr title="adaptation to premises or equipment">APE</abbr> element.</p>

<p>29. It can be difficult, particularly with equipment, to decide whether an item should be under <abbr title="adaptation to premises or equipment">APE</abbr> or <abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr>. To make this easier, think about the equipment being used by the customer and if it can be bought, or each piece of it, in its eventual state. If it can, then it’s more likely that the item will be an <abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>Providing a split keyboard may seem like an <abbr title="adaptation to premises or equipment">APE</abbr>, as the customer’s <abbr title="Pension Credit">PC</abbr> needs adapting. However, a split keyboard can be bought from a retailer and used without further changes. It is therefore a <abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr>.</p>

<p>30. Providing specialist software should come under <abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr>. However, if the software needs re-scripting to work fully with other software used by the customer, it should come under <abbr title="adaptation to premises or equipment">APE</abbr>.</p>

<p>31. A relevant piece of equipment may be adapted to meet the customer’s needs for employment or self- employment for the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> award. Providing it’s expected to stay serviceable for the life of the award, <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will contribute to the cost for adaptations. Other conditions for the <abbr title="adaptation to premises or equipment">APE</abbr> award must also be met.</p>

<p>32. The application must be dealt with under Special Aids and Equipment (<abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr>), if the equipment is not in place at the place of employment / self-employment or is unlikely to stay serviceable throughout the full <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> award period.</p>

<h3>Technical experts</h3>

<p>33. Various external experts are available to help you decide on the right support needed. You should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the customer’s disability</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>your own areas of expertise and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the probable type of adaptation, for example building or employer’s equipment</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Visit the place of employment</h3>

<p>34. Where an adaptation to premises is needed, a visit to the place of employment must be made by the holistic workplace assessor.</p>

<p>35. For self-employed customers, the holistic workplace assessor will visit their home or at the registered premises.</p>

<h3>Planning permission</h3>

<p>36. Some employers will need to apply for planning permission or need landlord’s permission before carrying out an adaptation.</p>

<p>37. Where possible, the customer should have quotations for building work and relevant permissions. Estimates of costs must include installation and training in use where suitable.</p>

<p>38. Extra costs, for example architect’s fees, can be agreed in advance in order for the permissions to be sought.</p>

<p>39. The local authority may own a building for which they are being asked to approve a planning application.</p>

<p>40. You must request a statement of assurance from the local authority that it has complied with its legal obligations before any <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> funded alterations are made.</p>

<p>41. If <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can’t fund <abbr title="adaptation to premises or equipment">APE</abbr> because relevant permissions are being sought, consider providing alternative <a class="govuk-link" href="#temporary-support">temporary support</a>.</p>

<h3>Value for money</h3>

<p>42. You must consider if it’s more cost effective to replace equipment rather than making an adaptation before agreeing <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support.</p>

<p>43. Consider whether:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the adapted equipment is likely to need replacing within the period of agreed support</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it’s more cost effective to get new equipment (although above present needs), if it’s a cheaper long-term solution</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the employer has any plans to upgrade equipment soon</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>three separate quotes have been received before any planned work takes place</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>44. If you decide it’s more cost effective to buy new equipment rather than adapting existing equipment, the award must be made under <a class="govuk-link" href="#special-aids-and-equipment">Special Aids and Equipment</a>.</p>

<p>45. Decisions must be clearly documented in the business case.</p>

<h3>Leasing and renting</h3>

<p>46.Leasing or renting equipment is usually expensive. Problems may occur if further adaptation is needed later on. For example, a penalty clause for early termination or the need to negotiate a new lease or rental agreement.</p>

<p>47.Before entering into lease or rental agreements, all other possibilities must be looked into first.</p>

<p>48. In some circumstances, leasing or rental is the best choice. For example, where an employee is on a short-fixed term contract. Value for money must be the over-riding reason in deciding which course of action to take.</p>

<h3>Preferred contractors</h3>

<p>49. Employers may wish to use contractors of their own choice rather than the contractor who has supplied the cheapest quote. They may choose to have other work done at the same time to minimise disruption to the workplace.</p>

<p>50. Unless the company has an exclusive contract, <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will only pay the agreed costs based on the lowest estimate that satisfies the customer’s needs. The employer is responsible for any excess costs as well as any cost sharing arrangement.</p>

<h3>Business benefit</h3>

<p>51. You must consider whether other customers of the business or non-disabled colleagues during their work will use the adaptation.</p>

<p>52. Consider if this will be of general benefit to the company. If there is a general business benefit a contribution must be sought, as well as a compulsory cost share.</p>

<h3>Adapting home premises</h3>

<p>53. You must make sure the adaptation is primarily for employment needs and not daily living needs when an adaptation request is made for the customer’s own home or premises.</p>

<p>54. An adaptation may be useful for daily living needs or increase the value of the property. Where this occurs take into account when talking about cost sharing.</p>

<p>55. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> only meets the minimum need cost where a requested adaptation exceeds the minimum need.</p>

<h3>Temporary support</h3>

<p>56. Adaptations to premises may be delayed by the need to get quotes or for a contractor to schedule the work into their plans. In these cases, a short-term, interim solution, should be considered so that customers are inconvenienced as little as possible. For example, a support worker.</p>

<p>57. Temporary support must be taken into account when preparing the business case for approval.</p>

<p>58. If planning permission is refused, temporary support may be extended while work is on-going with the employer to consider other choices. For example, resubmission of amended proposals or re-location of employee.</p>

<p>59. Costs of temporary support must be allocated to the appropriate <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> element for the support, not against <abbr title="adaptation to premises or equipment">APE</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9 Special </span> aids and equipment</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>1. Support is available for customers who have a disability, illness or health condition to buy specialised aids and equipment, but only for employment purposes.</p>

<p>Note: A social and domestic contribution must be considered if appropriate This is based on the number of days the customer is not at work regardless as to whether the equipment is used on a non- working day. If a customer chooses to leave the equipment at work, and the employer confirms this then a SD contribution is not needed. See: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://intranet.dwp.gov.uk/manual/access-work/11-cost-share-0" rel="external">11 Cost share</a></p>

<p>2. A special aid is any item needed to do a job which a person without a disability, illness or health condition would not need to do the same job.</p>

<p>3. Equipment is any tool needed to do a job and which most people would not need.</p>

<p>4. If the equipment needs to be attached or linked to an existing piece of equipment, then it should be classed as an adaptation. The customer would need to apply for help under the <a class="govuk-link" href="#adaptation-to-premises-or-equipment">Adaptation to Premises and Equipment</a> element of <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>.</p>

<p>5. The purchase of specialised vehicles used solely for work, should be categorised under special aids and equipment.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<p>6. On receipt of a customer’s request for items, you must consider whether:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the customer has already had their own assessment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it has been referred for an independent holistic workplace assessment, if needed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it’s standard equipment for the job</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it’s an essential in work disability need</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it’s provided by the NHS</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>these are the only choices available</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you’ve got the appropriate quotes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it’s cost effective and value for money</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>this is temporary support</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>employers can make a voluntary/reasonable contribution towards agreed solutions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Agreeing on the Item(s) needed</h3>

<p>7. Take into account the applicant’s knowledge and awareness of possible solutions. This can be helpful and accurate in identifying need.</p>

<p>8. You must manage a customer’s expectations when a customer expresses a preference for, or awareness of, a specific item. This is vital to the Access to Work (<abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>) process. You must consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>compatibility</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>usability</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>technological development</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>value for money</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>9. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> aims to supply a fit for purpose and cost effective solution. This means looking at a range of choices and, if appropriate, rejecting a preferred choice in favour of another.</p>

<p>10. This doesn’t stop the customer getting their preferred choice but <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> would only contribute towards the most cost effective solution which meets the customer’s employment needs.</p>

<h4>In work disability needs</h4>

<p>11. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> meets extra costs arising from a disability, illness or health condition. When considering applications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be sure the equipment is essential and the job cannot be done another way without the special aid</li>
  <li>consider the type of aid requested</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> doesn’t provide aids of a medical nature. The term ‘medical aids’ includes anything used or worn about a person that effectively treats or improves their disability, illness or health condition and are outside of their working environment. This includes items such as:
    <ul>
      <li>glasses/frames</li>
      <li>contact lenses</li>
      <li>insulin pumps</li>
      <li>cochlear implants</li>
      <li>prosthetics of any kind</li>
      <li>functional electronic stimulus devices, etc.</li>
      <li>electric scooters</li>
      <li>specialist walking sticks</li>
      <li>prescriptions and frames for Irlens Syndrome</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can fund the lens, colour test, tinted glasses for Irlens Syndrome</p>

<p>12. Applications for aids can be considered if there’s a clear work related need, not just a social need, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>aids requiring invasive surgery cannot be supported under any circumstances</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be satisfied that the item is not standard equipment used by anyone doing the job</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be satisfied that there is no Health and Safety requirement for the employer to provide the equipment other than for the disabled employee</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make sure, if appropriate, a workstation assessment is planned or finished and that the report recommendations will be addressed wherever possible. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will only help in meeting extra costs that arise from disability</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>check the employer is acting on their responsibilities and making all reasonable adjustments</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>take into account any aids the customer has that may be useful. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> does not replace help voluntarily given in the past unless there has been a change of circumstance.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>13. The <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> assessment process mustn’t be delayed where an employer has to finish or fully act upon health and safety, workstation assessment or Equality Act 2010 responsibilities.</p>

<h3>Assessments</h3>

<p>14. Before deciding on <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support, it may be necessary to get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>medical, specialist or technical advice</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>advice from suppliers or manufacturers</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>15. Advice is needed when it’s difficult to identify whether a disability, illness or health condition results in more problems over and above those of a non-disabled colleague doing the same job.</p>

<p>16. Technical assessment costs are met by the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> programme spend.</p>

<p>17. External assessment or consultancy costs, are met by <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> programme spend and are not subject to cost share.</p>

<h4>Considering choices</h4>

<p>18. Some customers have a clear idea of what they feel is the best solution for their needs. Before recommending the application, make sure all choices have been fully explored with both the customer and employer, including arranging any specialist or technical assessments where appropriate.</p>

<p>19. You must consider if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the job can be restructured to remove the need for a special aid or equipment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the planned choice meets the minimum suitable requirement and offers the best value for money</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the employer can be expected to provide the equipment for other non-disabled employees</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the employer can provide the equipment as a reasonable adjustment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>supplying the special aid will benefit other employees</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the installation of the equipment affects other employees, for example if a training need is created or will raise environment issues</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the employer is prepared to fund the equipment without <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> help</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Demonstrations and trial periods</h4>

<p>20. In addition to an introductory demonstration, a trial period may be necessary for example, to see if the equipment is compatible with an organisation’s systems.</p>

<p>21. Trial periods must be negotiated at no charge with the suppliers. If a fee is charged a maximum of two weeks trial should be agreed.</p>

<p>22. The cost of training and the availability of support services (in case of breakdown), must be included.</p>

<h3>Cost effectiveness</h3>

<p>23. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> policy is to repay an agreed part of the cost towards suitable equipment that meets the customer’s minimum requirement to do the job.</p>

<p>24. You must consider voluntary/reasonable employer contributions.</p>

<p>25. Quotes are required for each item. These can be obtained from the Independent Holistic Workplace Assessment Report, customer or employer.</p>

<p>26. The number and type of written quotes depend on the expected level of expenditure as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>£499.99 and under – one quote needed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>£500 and above – three quotes needed</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>27. All quotes must be recorded in the business case, and be fully inclusive of VAT.</p>

<p>28. You can accept less than three quotes under exceptional circumstances. For example, if the special aids and equipment come from a very specialised provider or sole supplier. This must be recorded in the business case.</p>

<p>29. Where a wide range of models exist, or where a recommendation is made, you must identify the best value for money and the most cost effective solution to fully meet the customer’s minimum agreed needs.</p>

<p>30. If the customer or employer decides to use a more expensive alternative solution, the customer or employer will need to fund the difference between the appropriate cost effective solution and their preferred alternative.</p>

<p>31. Value for money is achieved by giving the right support for the customer’s need. This does not necessarily mean the cheapest solution if it doesn’t fully meet the customer need or if there are hidden costs for training, delivery or installation.</p>

<h3>Temporary support</h3>

<p>32. You must consider how <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can give best value for money, especially if temporary support is needed whilst equipment is being arranged.</p>

<p>33. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> aims to give help as quickly as possible. Where there are unavoidable delays for example, with the set up of equipment, training, or familiarisation, interim solutions such as using a support worker may be considered.</p>

<p>34. Customers and employers should be informed of likely delays and advised of the reasons.</p>

<p>35. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will not fund expensive on-going temporary support where an employer or customer fails to give information or buy equipment previously agreed.</p>

<p>36. The cost of a temporary solution is recorded under the appropriate <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> element. For example support worker.</p>

<h3>Application for a replacement item</h3>

<p>37. If a customer applies for a replacement item due to loss of the original, treat it in the same way as a new application.</p>

<p>38. You must consider the following points before deciding whether or not to replace:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>what were the circumstances surrounding the circumstances of the loss</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>was it due to carelessness on behalf of the customer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>was the loss avoidable</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>39. Only replace the item(s) if it was uninsured.</p>

<h3>Transferability / portability of equipment</h3>

<p>40. Negotiate the transfer of equipment with the old and new employer when a customer changes job.</p>

<p>41. Customers should take their equipment with them if they move on to a new employer if the equipment is appropriate for the new job.</p>

<p>42. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will pay reasonable removal and transportation costs for the transfer of equipment between employers if it’s cost effective to do so.</p>

<p>43. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> advisers must consider purchasing new equipment if necessary to prevent delays in providing support.</p>

<h3>Standard equipment</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
<abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will not fund items that are:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>standard equipment</li>
  <li>standard business costs</li>
  <li>health and safety requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>45. These are needed whether the person doing the job is disabled or not.</p>

<p>46. If a solution is identified that includes both standard and extra items, <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will only cover the cost of the extra items.</p>

<p>47. This applies to both self-employed and employed customers.</p>

<p>See: Please consider ‘business benefit’.</p>

<h3>Types of equipment</h3>

<h4>Hearing aids</h4>

<p>48. All applications for hearing aids must be supported by an audiology report or appropriate letter.</p>

<p>49. The audiology report or appropriate letter must be provided by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the NHS audiology department or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an accredited private dispenser of hearing aids working on behalf of the NHS.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Letters from private dispensers must state they are working on behalf of the NHS. Letters from other private dispensers of hearing aids are not acceptable for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> purposes.</p>

<p>50. Cost share is applied where appropriate.</p>

<h4>Medical equipment</h4>

<p>51. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can help with a grant towards the cost of medical equipment provided:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the item needed is vital to help the customer to carry out their job</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it is identified as a solution after an assessment and does not pose a threat to the customer’s health or condition</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the item is not available through the NHS or there is a significant waiting list which would put the customer’s job in jeopardy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it does not involve surgery/treatment.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Wheelchairs</h4>

<p>52. All applications must have an NHS assessment.</p>

<p>53. A customer with a voucher towards the cost of buying a wheelchair must use it towards the overall cost.</p>

<p>54. A social and domestic contribution must be considered if appropriate. This is based on the number of days the customer is not at work regardless as to whether the wheelchair is used on a non- working day. If a customer chooses to leave the equipment at work, and the employer confirms this then a SD contribution is not needed. Cost share is applied where appropriate.</p>

<p>55. Wheelchairs bought with <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support are the property of the purchaser, who may be the employer or the customer.</p>

<p>56. The purchaser is responsible for all:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>insurance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>maintenance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>running costs</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Customer reports damage to their Wheelchair</h4>

<p>57. If a customer reports their Wheelchair is damaged, ATW can consider repairing or replacing the wheelchair, depending on the most cost effective choice.</p>

<p>Note: Where the wheelchair has been provided by the NHS wheelchair scheme (excluding the NHS voucher scheme), any maintenance and repairs should be directed back to the NHS as they are responsible as part of the contractual agreement they have for the repair and maintenance of the wheelchairs.</p>

<p>58. Where the wheelchair has been funded via the NHS wheelchair voucher scheme, you must consider the following points before making a decision whether or not to replace or repair:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where only part of the wheelchair is damaged, the rest of the chair is in working order and has been maintained by the person who has purchased the chair, <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can consider funding to repair the damaged chair as this would be the more cost effective than replacing the chair with a new one</li>
  <li>if the cost of the repair to the wheelchair is likely to exceed the cost of replacement, then a new wheelchair should be considered for funding (where the funding from the NHS has been explored and all funding outcomes have been noted)</li>
</ul>

<p>59. You must record, in full, the justification for your decision to either replace or repair a wheelchair in DISC.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10 Miscellaneous </span> support classifications</h2>

<p>1. The miscellaneous support classification is only to be used for short-term or one off support which does not come under any other element.</p>

<p>2. Only a few applications will fall in to this category. Examples of this are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>consultancy fees for establishing what are standard costs for a business, or where the element of support is not known at consultancy stage</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>used alongside cost share for the payment of the Transitional Employer Support Grant (<abbr title="Transitional Employer Support Grant">TESG</abbr>) or Extra Employer Support Grant (<abbr title="Extra Employer Support Grant">EESG</abbr>) (proof of concept)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3. These types of applications will be managed by a specialist team and should not be used for any other element or award for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>.</p>

<p>4. You must consider whether the costs come under other elements of <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> such as consultancy costs for adaptations to premises which would come under the <a class="govuk-link" href="#adaptation-to-premises-or-equipment">Adaptations to Premises and Equipment</a> element.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11 Cost </span> share</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>1. Mandatory cost share applies to all applications for Adaptations to Premises and Equipment (<abbr title="adaptation to premises or equipment">APE</abbr>), Special Aids and Equipment (<abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr>) and Miscellaneous support where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the customer has been in paid employment for more than six weeks at the time of their application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the customer has been in paid employment for less than six weeks when they make their first application but then makes a subsequent application beyond the first six weeks of employment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the customer makes a renewal application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the customer makes an application for a non cost share element of Access to Work (<abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>) and then makes a subsequent application for either <abbr title="adaptation to premises or equipment">APE</abbr>, <abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr> or Miscellaneous support.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>2. Mandatory cost share doesn’t apply to applications for <abbr title="adaptation to premises or equipment">APE</abbr>, <abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr> or Miscellaneous support where the customer has been in paid employment for less than six weeks. In these cases, any costs would be met by <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> in full.</p>

<p>3. Where mandatory cost share would otherwise apply, it will be waived when the adviser has identified that funding for <abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr> falls under the <a class="govuk-link" href="#tech-fund">Tech Fund</a> provision.</p>

<p>Note: The Tech Fund provision only applies to <abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Cost share applies</h3>

<p>4. There are 4 categories of employers:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Category of employer</th>
      <th scope="col">Number of employees</th>
      <th scope="col">Employer contribution threshold</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Micro</td>
      <td>1 to 9</td>
      <td>Nil cost share</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Small</td>
      <td>10 to 49</td>
      <td>Nil cost share</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Medium</td>
      <td>50 to 249</td>
      <td>£500</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Large</td>
      <td>250+</td>
      <td>£1,000</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>5. Where cost share applies, there is a threshold below which <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> pays none of the cost.</p>

<p>6. There’s a £10,000 ceiling below which <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> pays up to 80% of the approved costs and above which <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> pays all the costs over the three year <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> period.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Total figure that attracts cost share (Item    cost)</td>
      <td>£14,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Minus the threshold a large employer   pays</td>
      <td>-£1,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Total</td>
      <td>= £13,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>20% of cost share applicable amount for   employers contribution (<abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will pay the 80%)</td>
      <td>£10,000     x 20%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>This equals</td>
      <td>= £2,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Add the threshold   back in</td>
      <td>+ £1,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Final total for   large employer contribution over a three year award</td>
      <td>= £3,000</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>7. Don’t include voluntary workers or take into account the number of hours an employee works when calculating the number of employees.</p>

<p>Note: If the customer works for an international company, you must only consider the total number of employees based in sites in Great Britain when identifying the category of the employer.</p>

<h3>Recording application details</h3>

<p>8. You must identify the size of the employer by recording micro, small, medium or large in the notes space within the system. Change the cost share status if necessary.</p>

<p>9. In all cases, you must enter the cost share marker status and <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> start date on the appropriate IT system.</p>

<p>10. Details of the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> application history must always be recorded in the customer’s case. This ensures there’s a record of cumulative costs paid by the employer in repeat applications within the three year <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> period.</p>

<p>11. Once the three year <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> period ends, the cost sharing period starts again.</p>

<h3>Franchises</h3>

<p>12. A franchise is a right given to an individual or group, to market or sell a company’s goods or services within a certain area or location.</p>

<p>13. An individual or group who purchases a franchise is called a franchisee.</p>

<p>14. It’s the franchisee who is the employer and not the company whose goods or services are being marketed or sold.</p>

<p>15. You must establish the total number of people employed by the franchisee when considering cost share. (They may run more than one site).</p>

<p>16. If there’s still doubt after contacting the franchisee, you must use your discretion. Generally the benefit of doubt should be given to the franchisee.</p>

<h3>Calculating the threshold and ceiling</h3>

<p>17. The thresholds include VAT even if the employer may be able to claim it back at a later date.</p>

<p>18. Any contribution made by an employer, including voluntary contributions, must be deducted from the total cost before any mandatory cost share is calculated.</p>

<p>19. You mustn’t take into account any costs the employer met before the application was made.</p>

<p>20. Only apply one threshold where <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support benefits a number of individuals. For example, improved building access for several disabled employees.</p>

<p>21. A threshold per person must be applied in cases of bulk applications for equipment.</p>

<p>Note: For all calculations, you must round down.</p>

<h3>Order of deductions</h3>

<p>22. Follow the order bulleted below for any deductions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>deduct the NHS voucher from the full cost</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>deduct any voluntary employer contribution</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>deduct any Tech Fund contribution (if applicable) Note: this applies to steps 4 and 5 only. Not step 6 - see scenario 4 and scenario 5</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>deduct the appropriate employer threshold</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>deduct 20% employer mandatory cost share</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>deduct the social and domestic contribution based on the number of non-working days that the applicant benefits from the item, for example 2/7</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the remaining balance is the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> contribution</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For Example:</p>

<p>Note: Following the step-by-step worked examples below will ensure that your calculations are accurate and satisfy policy intent. All calculations must be rounded down.</p>

<h3>Social and Domestic Contribution</h3>

<p>23. Where a Social and Domestic Contribution is appropriate, it applies to all applications whether this is for a single item, (see scenario 1) or multiple items (see scenario 2). Where not all items are subject to S&amp;D contribution the Total Employer Contribution must be deducted from the cost of the S&amp;D eligible items first.</p>

<p>24. Depending on the costs of the items involved it is possible that even though some or all of the items would ordinarily attract a S&amp;D contribution, the mandatory cost share calculation may cover the full costs (see scenario 3).</p>

<p>25. Where an application covers multiple items that attract a S&amp;D contribution, you must clearly detail in the business case and offer letter, which items are subject to a S&amp;D contribution and the amount applicable to each item (see Note after scenario 2).</p>

<h3>Example calculations</h3>

<h4>Scenario 1. Single item calculation</h4>

<p>Terry works at Freshco, a large employer, full time, 5 days a week and has been awarded support with the costs of a specialised wheelchair to enable him to carry out his employment. The wheelchair will also be of benefit to Terry on his non-working days, the cost of the wheelchair is £10,000 and he has been provided with a NHS voucher to the value of £1000</p>

<h4>Scenario 2. Multiple item calculation not all subject to S&amp;D contribution</h4>

<p>Kevin has worked at X-Horst garages for 6 months with 64 colleagues. Following a workplace assessment, he has been awarded multiple items. The support includes</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an adapted wheelchair costing £10,000</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a desktop <abbr title="Pension Credit">PC</abbr> with assistive technology costing £8000</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a hearing aid costing £3000.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>He works 4 days a week and will be benefiting from the wheelchair and hearing aid both at work and on his non-working days; the <abbr title="Pension Credit">PC</abbr> will remain in his workplace. He does not have an NHS voucher.</p>

<h3>Employer involvement</h3>

<p>26. It’s the customer’s employer who will be the cost sharer, but sometimes a third party such as a provider will, contribute some or all of the cost.</p>

<p>27. It’s for the employer and the provider to decide who will contribute.</p>

<p>28. Involve employers as soon as possible in the application process and get their agreement to cost sharing before an application is approved.</p>

<h3>Contacting the employer</h3>

<p>29. You must first obtain the customer’s permission to disclose information, and record the outcome on the appropriate IT system, before an employer is approached.</p>

<p>Note: Permission can be given by different means for example, verbal, written or via an interpreter.</p>

<p>30. You can agree not to contact a customer’s employer, but only if there’s no requirement for the support to be used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>on the employer’s premises or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the employer isn’t required to confirm details of support received on the claim form</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>31. Cost sharing criteria still applies and you must be satisfied that the employer will meet the costs before you approve the application. In all cases consider appropriate review periods.</p>

<p>32. In all appropriate cases, an employer should be asked for a voluntary contribution whether or not cost sharing applies.</p>

<p>33. Any voluntary contribution made by an employer must be deducted from the total cost before you calculate any mandatory cost share contribution.</p>

<p>34. Always discuss with the employer the possibility of the customer taking the equipment with them if they go to another job with a new employer. Record the outcome on the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> IT system.</p>

<h3>Multiple employers</h3>

<p>35. Some customers will have more than one employer at the same time, but need the same level of support for each job.</p>

<p>36. You must calculate the total support costs (regardless of the number of employers) and negotiate a fair cost share for all employers if the customer’s cost share status is the same for all jobs.</p>

<p>37. You must ensure <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> pays no more than the share expected of it as part of the total cost.</p>

<p>38. Ownership of equipment will depend on the type of equipment needed. For example, computer software loaded onto an employer’s system would be jointly owned as all employers would require a licence to run it.</p>

<h3>Freelance workers</h3>

<p>39. Customers such as actors or people with technical jobs in the arts and media industries may have a series of employers or a series of short term contracts with one employer.</p>

<p>40. You don’t need to approve short term contracts with each employer if you are satisfied that the customer can be classed as a freelance worker.</p>

<p>41. If you’re in doubt about whether the customer is a genuine freelance worker, you can ask to see supporting documents such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>membership of a relevant professional body or union</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an appointment letter from the employer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the customer’s self employed tax reference</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>42. Store copies of any document seen in the case file.</p>

<p>43. Treat freelance workers in the same way as self-employed customers and record them as self-employed on the appropriate system.</p>

<h3>Job movers</h3>

<p>44. You must not consider cost share in cases where the customer moves from one employer to another. This applies even if there isn’t a break between jobs, provided they apply within the first six weeks of starting the new job.</p>

<p>45. Cost share should not be considered where a customer progresses to another job within the same company such as on promotion</p>

<p>or; are returning to work after encountering a disability whilst in employment for the first time.</p>

<p>46. Cost Share would be waived where the application is made either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>within the first 6 weeks in their new role (within the same company) or</li>
  <li>within 6 weeks of returning to work following encountering a disability/health condition for the first time</li>
</ul>

<p>47. Where someone applies to Access to Work outside of these timescales the employer would have to make the appropriate Cost Sharing contribution for that 3-year period. The customer must complete a new application and the application must be treated as a renewal and given a new <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> start date.</p>

<p>48. Cost share applies in the following situations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a change to the customer’s health condition or disability creating a new need for support, means a new application must be completed</li>
  <li>a change in a customer’s job description creates a new need but there is no fundamental change in their duties so should be treated as a repeat application within the existing <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> period</li>
  <li>a new employer who takes over the business but the customer’s job remains the same should be treated as a repeat application</li>
  <li>a new employer who takes over the business who changes the customer’s fundamental duties creating a new need for the customer, means a new application must be completed with a new <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> start date</li>
  <li>for customer’s moving at the same level in the same company</li>
  <li>a new role where the existing support they received for their last role is still appropriate as this has already been funded and should follow them</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Those who are changing job roles and their in-work support needs do not change, their support will be subject to the existing Cost Share rules as there are no disability need changes but instead a job role changes, and it is reasonable for the employer to enable that equipment to move with them. In extreme circumstances where this cannot be negotiated with an employer, Access to Work will consider these cases on a case-by-case basis considering things such as the size of the employer, their buying power etc.</p>

<h3>Self-employment</h3>

<p>49. If a customer becomes self-employed during the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> three-year period, they’ll no longer be subject to mandatory cost share. however, a voluntary contribution can still be requested.</p>

<p>50. Don’t take into account the fact that they are earning the equivalent of the national minimum wage when deciding if a self-employed customer is eligible for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>.</p>

<p>51. Customers who set up their own limited company and use PAYE, are treated as employed.</p>

<h3>Tech Fund</h3>

<p>52. Tech Fund is the name given to an exemption from mandatory cost share for <abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr> support for medium and large employers. This is so assistive technology can be tried out while human support is also in place.</p>

<p>53. This allows Access to Work (<abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>) to pick up the full cost of some assistive technology solutions for the customer if it can be demonstrated that in the long term, this will reduce support worker or travel cost awards.</p>

<p>54. The adviser must waive the requirement for mandatory cost share for the <abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr>, where <abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr> support is identified as potentially providing lower, long-term costs to <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> than already existing or proposed human support.</p>

<p>55. If the <abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr> is ultimately found not to suit the customer’s needs, mandatory cost share won’t be applied at any time once it has been waived.</p>

<p>56. Already existing human support is defined as human support that is currently in place for the customer.</p>

<p>57. Proposed human support is defined as human support that has been proposed by either the customer or the employer and is supported in principle by the employer in either case.</p>

<p>58. Following a work place assessment, the adviser must use their judgement to decide whether both the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the item is an assistive technology solution that qualifies for Tech Fund provision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there’s a potential cost saving over the course of the three-year period compared with <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> funding the human support</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>59. The mandatory cost share will only be waived under the Tech Fund provision if both the conditions above apply</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>60. Assistive technology only qualifies for Tech Fund provision if it supplements or replaces human support. For example, a motorised rise and fall desk to address a musculoskeletal condition does not qualify as there’s no alternative human support solution.</p>

<p>61. Other items not qualifying for Tech Fund include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>non-standard chair</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>non-standard mouse</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>non-standard keyboard</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: The above list is not exhaustive. The adviser must use their judgement on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>62. If funding is approved for some <abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr> that qualifies for the Tech Fund provision and for some <abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr> that does not, cost share will only be waived for the <abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr> that qualifies for Tech Fund provision.</p>

<p>63. Tech Fund is not exempt from social and domestic contributions.</p>

<p>64. If the adviser decides that the Tech Fund provision applies, they must decide on funding for both the <abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr> and the human support.</p>

<p>Note: The level of human support should be the same as it would be without assistive technology.</p>

<p>65. Explain to the customer, that <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> expects the need for the human support to reduce over a period of time. This wouldn’t be longer than their three-year award period.</p>

<p>66. Agree a review date with the customer to reflect this expectation.</p>

<p>67. Further reviews may be agreed as necessary during the award period until the customer is gaining the full benefit from the <abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr> according to their disability and job role.</p>

<p>68. Where possible, the customer’s reviews should be conducted by the adviser who originally dealt with the customer’s Tech Fund case.</p>

<p>69. Approve funding for both types of support that are to be in place at the same time. The customer can then try out the <abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr> to see whether it suits their requirements. They can also use their human support if necessary.</p>

<p>70. Don’t apply mandatory cost share to the <abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr>.</p>

<p>71. Once all agreed reviews have been completed, consider any further support needs on a case by case basis.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>confirm that any appropriate <a class="govuk-link" href="#training">training</a> has been undertaken</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>decide when to <a class="govuk-link" href="#reviews">review the case</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Procurement</h3>

<p>2. Once the business case has been approved, the required support can be purchased.</p>

<p>3. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> must take action to ensure the required support is in place as soon as possible. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> must also chase progress, take into account any unexpected delays and put temporary support in place where appropriate.</p>

<p>4. In some cases, the employer will recruit the support worker or pay for the adaptation of premises or purchase of equipment. When they have incurred costs they will claim reimbursement of the agreed amount from <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>.</p>

<p>5. Self-employed customers will procure support themselves.</p>

<p>6. Adaptations to premises or equipment can have long lead times. Additional unexpected delays can occur whilst work is being carried out. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> must monitor progress and provide or extend temporary support if required.</p>

<p>7. Employers may wish to use contractors of their choice to make adaptations rather than the contractor who has supplied the lowest suitable quote. They may also choose to have some other work done at the same time to minimise disruption to the workplace.</p>

<p>8. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will only pay the agreed costs based on the lowest estimate that satisfies the customer’s needs. The employer is responsible for any excess costs as well as any cost sharing arrangement.</p>

<h3>Special aids and equipment</h3>

<p>9. Where aids or equipment have been provided on a trial basis during the assessment stage, the supplier can be expected to complete the sale quickly when funding is approved. For other cases, ask the employer when delivery of the aid or equipment is expected. Follow this up to confirm delivery.</p>

<h3>Training</h3>

<p>10. Make sure equipment meets the customer’s needs, and that they’ve received all relevant training. If other people need to be trained in relation to the equipment, make sure that they’ve successfully completed the training and that cover has been considered for holidays or sickness.</p>

<h3>Ownership, insurance and disposals</h3>

<p>11. Aids or equipment purchased with <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support, are the property of the purchaser. This can be the employer or the customer. The purchaser is responsible for all maintenance, insurance and disposal costs when appropriate.</p>

<p>12. It’s very important you don’t give advice as to how unwanted items should be disposed other than allowing the customer to take equipment with them to a new job.</p>

<p>13. The employer retains their responsibilities for premises and equipment adapted with <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> funding.</p>

<h3>Transferability / portability of equipment</h3>

<p>14. Negotiate the transfer of equipment with the old and new employer when a customer changes job.</p>

<p>15. Customers should take their equipment with them if they move on to a new employer if the equipment is appropriate for the new job.</p>

<p>16. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will pay reasonable removal and transportation costs for the transfer of equipment between employers if it’s cost effective to do so.</p>

<p>17. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> advisers must consider purchasing new equipment if necessary to prevent delays in providing support.</p>

<h3>Delivery date</h3>

<p>18. You must identify the date that each element of support is expected to be delivered. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> must confirm that the support has been provided on the expected date. The date must be recorded on the system when each element is delivered.</p>

<p>19. As each element is delivered or implemented, you must check with the customer that it meets their assessed needs.</p>

<p>20. If the customer’s needs are not adequately met, record this as part of the case history. An updated business case will then be required to secure any additional funding required for alternative solutions.</p>

<h3>Delays</h3>

<p>21. Continue to monitor delivery until all approved elements are in place. If delivery delays occur, consider putting temporary support in place.</p>

<h3>Reviews</h3>

<p>22. Once all the required support is in place and has been confirmed as meeting the customer’s needs, regular reviews must be conducted.</p>

<h3>Annual reviews</h3>

<p>23. All cases must be reviewed annually as a minimum.</p>

<p>24. If an adviser has worked on the case in the last six months for example the customer has a change in circumstances or has requested additional support, the adviser must review the application at the same time.</p>

<h3>One-off support</h3>

<p>25. Where the customer was provided with one-off support, the review can be completed to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>confirm the customer’s work related needs have been met</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ask if there have been any change in the customer’s circumstances</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>offer the customer the option to discuss any additional requirements</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Ongoing support</h3>

<p>26. For customers who are receiving ongoing support, complete the review to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>confirm the support is being provided</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure the support continues to meet the customer’s needs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure claims for reimbursement are being made promptly</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure the amounts claimed are in line with the spend profiled for the customer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure any changes in the customer’s circumstances have been reported</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure any additional requirements for support are identified</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure the customer has been made aware of their renewal date</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Shorter review periods</h3>

<p>27. Shorter review periods are appropriate when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the customer has a temporary job</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the adviser has concerns about the long term viability of a business</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it hasn’t been possible at the initial assessment to define the exact level of support required</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the level of support required is expected to reduce over time as the customer becomes more familiar with their job or more able to use public transport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>temporary travel support has been awarded pending consideration of alternative travel arrangements. For example, the customer:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>is having their driving licence reinstated</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>has a support worker as their driver</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>is buying a vehicle</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>is having adaptations made to a vehicle</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>28. Where shorter review periods are required, they should normally be quarterly, unless it’s clear that the customer’s employment or the alternative arrangement will end earlier.</p>

<p>29. Where short reviews apply, the adviser must discuss the situation with the customer, review any evidence available and decide if <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support can be continued.</p>

<p>30. Awards can be extended for a further short period where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the customer receives another temporary job contract</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are reasons that the business cannot show viability</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are delays in the customer becoming familiar with their job or using public transport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>alternative travel arrangements will be finalised at a later date</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>31. The adviser will arrange another review in three, six or nine months if the award is extended for a short period.</p>

<p>32. You must ensure the customer is made aware of their duty to notify <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> immediately if there’s any change in their circumstances.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13 Change </span> of circumstances</h2>

<h3>Identifying changes of circumstances</h3>

<p>1. Customers must report changes in their circumstances to Access to Work (<abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>).</p>

<p>2. Remind customers of the need to report changes whenever a case is reviewed. Customers can report changes by various means of communication.</p>

<p>3. Customers in receipt of Other Government Benefits (<abbr title="other government benefit">OGB</abbr>) or credits, can report changes to another government office. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> accepts changes in customer’s circumstances details from Other Government Departments (<abbr title="other government departments">OGDs</abbr>).</p>

<p>4. You must seek confirmation from the customer that the change has happened where the change may have an impact on the amount of <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support payable.</p>

<p>5. The support must be reviewed on the whole to ensure it is still appropriate and meeting the customer’s needs and adjusted where appropriate.</p>

<p>6. Update systems with all relevant changes.</p>

<h3>Authorising changes to approved support</h3>

<p>8. A change in the customer’s circumstances or a change in the rates charged for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support may mean an increase in the authorised amount of <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support.</p>

<p>9. Flexibility exists to allow small increases in support without the need for approval of a new business case.</p>

<p>10. The decision to apply flexibility must be confirmed by an adviser not previously involved in assessing the customer’s needs. Confirmation that flexibility has applied must be recorded.</p>

<p>11. Flexibility cannot be allowed if the total amount of increases, including the increase currently being considered, since the last signed authorisation is £500 or more.</p>

<p>12. Flexibility cannot be allowed if it takes the total amount approved into a higher approval bracket.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>If an operations manager has authorised expenditure of £59,900, increases of, or totalling £100 or more cannot be given. This would take the total amount approved to the level where senior operations manager authorisation is needed.</p>

<h3>Changes to a customer’s health</h3>

<p>13. Some health conditions can switch unpredictably between periods when symptoms are stable to periods of deterioration. When a customer’s health deteriorates, there’s likely to be an impact on their ability to do their job. It may not be possible to fully re-assess the customer’s requirements until their health stabilises.</p>

<p>14. Record details of the change and consider booking a review at a suitable date in the future.</p>

<p>15. Consider whether temporary support could be put in place. This will enable the customer to retain their employment while their needs are reassessed or until they recover from the temporary change in their health or condition. Respond sensitively and flexibly to customers in these circumstances.</p>

<p>16. If increased support is needed, it must be supported by a revised business case and approved before more <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> payments are made.</p>

<p>17. The cost share decision applied to the existing award will apply to the extra needs for elements where cost share applies.</p>

<p>18. A change in the customer’s condition may lead to a reduction in the support required. Record the change and advise the customer that their requirements will be fully re-assessed at the end of the current <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> period.</p>

<p>19. The customer/employer will continue to claim repayment for elements of the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> funding that are still required. If the customer has a support worker supplied by an agency, advise the agency of the changes in support needed.</p>

<p>20. Where the customer or their employer, employ the support worker, <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can continue to fund the normal level of support for a maximum of four weeks. The profiled expenditure for the customer should be left unchanged, so that if the customer’s condition deteriorates again, the full amount of support originally agreed can be provided without delay.</p>

<p>21. All claims must be checked to make sure overpayments are not made.</p>

<h3>Change in personal details</h3>

<p>22. Most changes in personal details will have no impact on <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support. A change of address is likely to have an effect on Travel to Work (<abbr title="Travel to Work">TtW</abbr>) costs or on a support worker’s activities.</p>

<p>23. Customers or <abbr title="other government department">OGD</abbr> can report changes in the customer’s personal details.</p>

<p>24. Update the customer record with all relevant changes and details of any support that’s been reassessed.</p>

<p>25. Notify any other relevant <abbr title="other government department">OGD</abbr> or agency that needs the information. Record actions taken.</p>

<h3>Change of name</h3>

<p>26. If the customer’s name changes, update the customer’s record. Verify the bank account details and update them if necessary.</p>

<h3>Change of address</h3>

<p>27. If the customer changes address this is likely to have an effect on <abbr title="Travel to Work">TtW</abbr> costs or on support worker’s activities. You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>review all support to ensure it’s still appropriate and meeting the customer’s needs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>adjust the support where appropriate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>update the system with all relevant changes</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes to employment</h3>

<h4>Same employer, different job</h4>

<p>28. A new job with the same employer may result in a change in support.</p>

<p>29. Ensure the job is new by confirming new duties or change in earnings.</p>

<p>30. If it’s a new job, the case is treated as a new application. You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>consider if reasonable adjustments are appropriate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>create a new job entry and record the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> start date</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reassess the support needed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>identify changes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>apply <a class="govuk-link" href="#cost-share">cost share</a> if appropriate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>create an updated business case for extra costs and submit for approval.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>31. If new elements of support are to be supplied, monitor delivery and consider the need for temporary solutions until the required solutions are in place.</p>

<h4>New employer (new owner of business), same job</h4>

<p>32. Under the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/RedundancyAndLeavingYourJob/DG_10026691" rel="external"><abbr title="Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations">TUPE</abbr></a> regulations, the new owner of a business is obliged to take on the contractual obligations of their predecessor. This includes the cost sharing agreements with <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>.</p>

<p>33. If a customer makes contact because a new employer has taken over the business you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>update the employment details</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contact the new employer to confirm they will carry forward the existing support arrangements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make sure the new employer is aware of their ownership and maintenance obligations for any equipment provided</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>34. If the employer wishes to renegotiate support arrangements, for example providing a support worker from internal staff rather than on going cost share, you must review the business case.</p>

<p>35. The change can be approved if it means a reduction or no change in the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support.</p>

<p>36. Consider if the employer has withdrawn support.</p>

<p>37. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will not pay for support that appears to have been withdrawn to secure funding from <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>.</p>

<h4>New employer, different business, same job</h4>

<p>38. If the customer starts work for a new employer doing the same job for which they previously received <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support you must identify the elements transferable to the new employer and negotiate with both employers for them to be transferred.</p>

<p>39. Some elements will not be transferable and others no longer needed.</p>

<p>40. Identify all extra needs for support and their costs.</p>

<p>41. Reconsider and agree cost share for extra needs if appropriate. Create a new business case to include the revised needs.</p>

<p>42. If <abbr title="special aids and equipment">SAE</abbr> or <abbr title="adaptation to premises or equipment">APE</abbr> is being transferred from the previous employment, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>create nil cost elements for these</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>add any costs associated with the transfer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>submit the business case for approval</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>monitor the delivery of support</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Freelance workers</h3>

<p>43. Customers doing the same job on short contracts with various employers are treated as self-employed.</p>

<p>44. This allows the customer to take responsibility for their support needs and saves the adviser having to repeatedly negotiate with employers for the transfer of support.</p>

<h4>New location, same employer, same job</h4>

<p>45. An employer may ask an employee to work temporarily at a new location. They will take responsibility for normal extra costs resulting from the move.</p>

<p>46. If <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> provides significant support for the customer for example a support worker, it may not be reasonable for the employer to bear all the costs of maintaining this support to the new location.</p>

<p>47. You must negotiate with the employer making sure they make all reasonable adjustments.</p>

<p>48. Any requirement for more support must be shown on an updated business case and approved before extra costs are repaid.</p>

<p>49. If the new location is outside Great Britain (<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>) <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support can continue for a maximum of three months.</p>

<p>50. Where it’s known that a customer will be working abroad, set a review date on the appropriate system for 10 weeks’ time or the expected date of return, whichever is the shorter.</p>

<p>51. At the review date, confirm that the customer has or will return to working in <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> within the three-month limit.</p>

<p>52. If they’re not expected to return before the end of the three-month limit, you must advise the customer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>that support will end when the limit is reached</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they will need to make a new application if they return to <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>53. If the customer has exceptional reason for continuing to work outside <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> refer to the national policy team for approval before extending the support beyond three months.</p>

<p>54. When the three-month limit has been reached, end the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> award so payments stop.</p>

<h3>Change in employment status</h3>

<p>55. Support can continue where a customer is suspended from their employment but still employed.</p>

<p>56. This includes paying for support workers to allow the customer to take a full part in meetings that may impact on their employment.</p>

<p>57. Systems must be updated to make sure payments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>are not made for support no longer needed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the case is reviewed regularly to determine if the customer has resumed normal work or is no longer employed</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes to policy</h3>

<p>58. Changes to the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> policy may impact on individual customer payments.</p>

<p>59. Payments to customers or their employers must not be changed until their current agreement period, normally when three years, is finished (unless new policy announcement specifically states otherwise).</p>

<h3>Changes to available support</h3>

<p>60. Technological improvements may lead to a better way of overcoming a customer’s barriers to work.</p>

<p>61. If a customer requests more support due to the availability of a new form of support and their other circumstances remain the same, consider whether the new technology provides a more cost effective solution to the customer’s support needs.</p>

<p>62. If the new technology will reduce costs, complete a revised business case and submit for approval.</p>

<p>63. Tell customers their requirements will be fully reviewed at the end of their current <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> period.</p>

<p>64. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> staff should keep up to date with the introduction of new products and services that may help customers.</p>

<p>65. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> staff should alert other <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> staff at communications meetings if they learn of new products via the intranet, advertising, attendance at events or talking with the customer.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14 Review </span> of claims in payment</h2>

In this case, and with the approval of the Access to Work (<abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>) payment team manager, <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will accept a pro forma invoice with a claim to trigger payment direct to the supplier. For example, if the customer is employed by a micro-employer (less than 50 staff), a charity organisation or is self-employed. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> will accept a proforma if there are extenuating circumstances. This must be authorised by the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> payments manager.</p>

<h4>Frequency of claims for on-going support</h4>

<p>4. Encourage customers to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>make new claims on a regular basis, ideally on a four week cycle although variations are acceptable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>only send in new claims after the last day for which payment has been claimed for</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<h4>Incorrectly completed claim forms</h4>

<p>9. Payment teams mustn’t accept claim forms, where amounts have been amended or overwritten.</p>

<p>10. These should be returned to the customer with an explanation why it’s not possible to process the claim.</p>

<p>11. Ask the customer to send the claim back to us with mistakes corrected and signed against, not initialed, by the customer.</p>

<p>12. Claim forms signed prior to the last day for which support is claimed must be returned for re-signing at the appropriate time.</p>

<h4>Travelling with your support worker</h4>

<p>35. Travel receipts and invoices must be supplied for both the customer and support worker</p>

<p>37. Support worker claim forms should only show hours of support provided for the period stated.</p>

<p>38. Hours not used for this period should not be claimed or carried forward (banked).</p>

<p>39. Payments can only be paid for the support provided. The claim form should be signed by the customer / employer (support worker if the customer is self-employed).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15 Ceiling </span> cap</h2>

<p>1. All new applications are subject to a maximum annual award limit of twice the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ashe/annual-survey-of-hours-and-earnings/index.html" rel="external">national average salary</a>.  The figures are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>01 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 –  £65,180</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>01 April 2021 to 31 March 2022 – £62,900</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>01 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 – £60,700</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>01 April 2019 to 31 March 2020 – £59,200</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>01 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 – £57,200</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>01 April 2017 to 31 March 2018 – £42,100</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: This figure will be uprated annually each April.</p>

<p>2. Customers who are subject to the maximum annual award limit are subject to annual reviews where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>progress can be monitored</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>their needs are looked at again</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>extra advice and support are offered</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the new uprated limit is applied to their award</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3. Awards must be calculated in the usual way and a ceiling cap applied.</p>

<p>4. You must explore how the resources provided by <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can combine with reasonable adjustment to support the customer into work. If possible, discuss with customer and employer together.</p>

<p>5. This discussion must involve the customer and employer if appropriate. If the customer is self-employed, you must include their own business resources in the discussion.</p>

<p>Note: Before contacting the employer, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>get consent from the customer that we can contact their employer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make sure the customer understands why we are contacting them.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>6. If needs reduce below the level of the cap then rise above that level, advisers are permitted to use their discretion in applying the cap level to those whose requirements fall below the cap temporarily, for example a brief change of role or illness.</p>

<h3>Examples of how the Cap may apply</h3>

<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>Customer has one job.</p>

<p>Customer is capped and has a change of circumstances where their need for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support is assessed as still being over the cap limit. This means the customer is still subject to the cap.</p>

<p>Capped to capped</p>

<p>Under these circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>there will be no change in entitlement and the original award will continue</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there will be no change of circumstances letter issued to the customer the award will continue using existing dates i.e. no new award period.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: if the change of circumstances was the customer getting a new job (not an additional job), you must retain the capped amount for the new job. Treat this as a new application apply a new three year period and issue a new declaration letter to customer</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>Customer is uncapped and has a change of circumstances that increases their need for more <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support above the cap limit.</p>

<p>Uncapped to Capped</p>

<p>Under these circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>there will be no change in entitlement but a cap will be applied to the limit per annum</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you must close the existing element and start a new element for 12 months from the date of change</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>issue a revised entitlement letter to customer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>support is put in place for 12 months from the date of the change of circumstance application (or date of future change).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Example 3</h4>

<p>Customer has one (or more) jobs and takes on an additional job</p>

<p>Capped To Capped</p>

<p>Under these circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>there will be no change in entitlement and the original award continues</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an amended declaration letter will be issued to the customer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the award will continue with same dates i.e. no new award period</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you must convert the element to a single event cost at relevant amount, based on the current award</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you must record a new job on the IT system with a full business case but no element</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you must note that funding for their original jobs remains on the business case.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Example 4</h4>

<p>Customer takes on an additional job that increases their need past the cap limit.</p>

<p>Uncapped to Capped</p>

<p>Under these circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>issue a revised entitlement letter to the customer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>close the existing element for Job 1 and start a new element for 12 months from date of change</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enter all expenditure in Job 1 to ensure the cap is adhered to</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>record a new job on the  IT system with full business case but no element</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>note that funding remains in job 1 on the business case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Multiple elements</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Under these circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>combine all the elements into one single event cost (using ‘Support Worker’ element)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure notes are clear for the payments team</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>close the existing element and start a new element for 12 months if uncapped to capped</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>convert element to single event cost based on current award if capped to capped.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<span class="number">16 Communication </span> support at interview</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>1. Communication Support at Interview (<abbr title="communication support at interview">CSI</abbr>) is a fast track process that helps with the cost of employing an interpreter or communicator to accompany the customer to a job interview. This is when the customer would find it difficult to understand or to make themselves understood.</p>

<p>2. <abbr title="communication support at interview">CSI</abbr> is generally used by the deaf, hard of hearing or individuals with hearing loss. It is available to anyone who has a disability, illness or health condition that affects their ability to communicate.</p>

<p>If a person who is Deaf or has hearing loss, wants to know more about Communication Support at Interview (<abbr title="communication support at interview">CSI</abbr>) you should make them aware of the <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> Video which can be accessed from the Gov.uk pages for Access to work.</p>

<p>See: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-communication-support-at-a-job-interview-if-you-have-a-disability-or-health-condition-access-to-work">Apply for communication support at a job interview if you have a disability or health condition (Access to Work)</a></p>

<p>3. <abbr title="communication support at interview">CSI</abbr> is available for all job interviews, including internal promotion.</p>

<p>4. Access to Work (<abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>) pays 100% of all costs under <abbr title="communication support at interview">CSI</abbr>. There’s no cost sharing.</p>

<p>5. <abbr title="communication support at interview">CSI</abbr> cannot be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>communication within a job such as job induction and job reviews. Under these circumstances, consideration should be given to a <a class="govuk-link" href="#support-workers">Support Worker</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>customers attending interviews with Jobcentre Plus or other departmental staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>attending other departmental programmes</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>6. Interpreters or communicators must be employed to cover a format understood by the customer. For example, British Sign Language (<abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr>) or lip speaking.</p>

<p>7. More information about organisations that can help with the recruitment of suitably qualified interpreters can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nrcpd.org.uk/" rel="external">National Registers of Communication Professionals (<abbr title="National Registers of Communication Professionals">NRCP</abbr>)</a> working with Deaf and Deafblind people and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nubsli.com/" rel="external">National Union of British Sign Language Interpreters (<abbr title="National Union of British Sign Language Interpreters">NUBSLI</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>8. Other types of communication support such as advocacy can be provided for customers with learning difficulties or mental health problems.</p>

<p>9. <abbr title="communication support at interview">CSI</abbr> can be approved for up to three hours. In some circumstances, support can be provided for longer. For example, at a trade or aptitude test.</p>

<p>10. There’s no limit to the number of interviews a customer can receive support for. However, where they have repeated interviews which do not result in employment, you must consider a referral to Jobcentre Plus staff if appropriate.</p>

<h3>Eligibility</h3>

<p>11. To get communication support at a job interview the customer must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>be 16 or over</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>live in England, Scotland or Wales</p>
  </li>

    <p>have a health condition or disability which means the customer needs communication support at job interviews</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have an interview date for a paid job or apprenticeship in England, Scotland or Wales, or a Department for Education supported internship</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Application procedure</h3>

<p>12. All applications for <abbr title="communication support at interview">CSI</abbr> must be made before the job interview takes place.</p>

<p>13. Applications are made on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-communication-support-at-a-job-interview-if-you-have-a-disability-or-health-condition-access-to-work">gov.uk</a> website.</p>

<p>14. All applications must include quotes. These must be an all-inclusive rate that includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>support worker costs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>support worker travel costs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>administration costs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>VAT</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>15. The customer needs to tell <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the name of the company the job interview is with</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the date of the job interview</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how long the job interview is expected to last</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the name and contact details for someone at the company</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> must contact this person after the job interview to confirm the interview took place.</p>

<p>16. There’s no requirement for an <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> adviser to contact the potential employer before the job interview.</p>

<h3>Actions after the application</h3>

<p>17. You must share your decision with the customer using their preferred method of contact. This must be done within two working days.</p>

<p>18. A decision confirmation letter or claim form if appropriate must be posted to the customer or appointee.</p>

<p>19. The customer can book their support worker for the job interview once a decision has been made to pay for <abbr title="communication support at interview">CSI</abbr> support.</p>

<p>20. Payment can only be claimed once the job interview has taken place.</p>

<p>21. Before payment can be made, the customer must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide evidence of Interpreter or Communication Support Worker costs claimed, for example, an invoice or timesheets, and</li>
  <li>sign and return the declaration on the back of the decision letter or claim form</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> can only make payment if the cost on the invoice or claim matches the cost on the application.</p>

<p>22. Development of the Access to Work Integrated Service (AtWIS) system means from 10th September 2020 the whole of the <abbr title="communication support at interview">CSI</abbr> journey, from application to payment, will be managed entirely within the AtWIS digital service and will remove the dependency of DiSC.</p>

<p>23. As customers have up to 9 months to submit claim forms from when the costs were incurred, <abbr title="communication support at interview">CSI</abbr> applications from 10th September onwards, could be held in either AtWIS or DiSC.</p>

<p>24. All <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> colleagues who are responding to progress chasing enquiries or payment queries must, in the first instance, access AtWIS to locate the correct <abbr title="communication support at interview">CSI</abbr> application. If the application cannot be located colleagues must access DiSC to locate the application. This will ensure a swift resolution to the query and will prevent duplicate applications being made.</p>
