<h2>Submitting the nomination form</h2>

<p>The nomination form for all award categories can be found online at:</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homeofficesurveys.homeoffice.gov.uk%2Fs%2FJBGJX3%2F&amp;data=05%7C01%7CEmma.Marriott2%40homeoffice.gov.uk%7C8065267ec5c84b1137f308da48933965%7Cf24d93ecb2914192a08af182245945c2%7C0%7C0%7C637902094393400760%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=qO5Ik2gHI0KiiSLFudsS%2B36XM%2B3%2BcO7fCnoY5kgTg04%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="external">https://www.homeofficesurveys.homeoffice.gov.uk/s/JBGJX3/</a></p>

<p>Guidance for completion is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all sections of the form must be completed, or the nomination will not be shortlisted</li>
  <li>the selection panel will not consider self nominations from individuals or teams</li>
  <li>persons nominating individuals or teams can make a maximum of one nomination per application - you may make more than one nomination using separate forms</li>
  <li>for team nominations, please only nominate up to five team members. Where the team is larger than five, please detail a maximum of five members to represent the team</li>
  <li>we are unable to shortlist nominations where long service, extra hours or bravery are the sole case for nomination, as these are recognised by other awards</li>
  <li>please provide as much information as you can on what the nominee(s) has achieved within the word limit</li>
  <li>please be as specific as possible about the nominee’s impact - in previous years, some strong nominations have been unsuccessful because they do not provide enough specific detail and evidence of the nominee’s achievements for the judging panel to be able to compare them against others. Please also remember to be clear about the role and achievements of the nominee(s) rather than concentrating only on the wider project.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any queries or are unable to submit an online application, please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:LordFerrersAward@homeoffice.gov.uk">LordFerrersAward@homeoffice.gov.uk</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Nominations close at midnight on Tuesday 19 July 2022. We cannot accept late nominations.</p>
