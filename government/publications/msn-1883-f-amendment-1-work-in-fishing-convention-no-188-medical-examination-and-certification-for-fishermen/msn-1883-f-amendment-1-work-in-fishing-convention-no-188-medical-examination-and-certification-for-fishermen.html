<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>1.1 The Merchant Shipping (Work in Fishing Convention) (Medical Certification) Regulations 2018, (referred to in this Notice as “the Regulations”) will come into force on 30 November 2018. They put into UK law the medical certification provisions of the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Work in Fishing Convention (No. 188) (“the Convention”).</p>

<p>1.2 The medical fitness standards which fishermen must meet to obtain a medical certificate under these Regulations are published in MSN 1886 (M+F).</p>

<p>1.3 The working environment on a fishing vessel can be unforgiving and medical fitness is important because: -</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fishermen may work a long way from medical facilities which could put them at risk if they become ill while at sea; even when working relatively close to shore, it will take more time to reach emergency medical treatment, compared to someone working ashore;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A medical examination may help to prevent a fisherman being taken ill when at sea, by identifying when a fisherman has an increased risk of developing a medical condition or of sudden incapacity so that treatment can be obtained;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a fisherman working alone is taken ill, they may not be able to call for help or reach medical assistance;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some medical conditions will reduce the fisherman’s ability to undertake the strenuous physical activity involved in work in fishing;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one fisherman is unable to perform their duties properly because they have been taken ill, others working on the vessel or the vessel itself may be put at risk.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>1.4 The medical examination may also help to identify a medical condition, or risk of developing a medical condition, at an early stage so that action can be taken to prevent it developing or worsening.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Application - general</h2>

<p>2.1 The Regulations apply to UK-flagged fishing vessels wherever they may be, and for the purposes of inspection as a port State, to non-UK fishing vessels when in a UK port or UK waters. The requirement to hold a valid medical certificate applies to all fishermen on those vessels.</p>

<p>2.2 The requirement to hold a medical fitness certificate will apply to those working on fishing vessels as follows:</p>

<p>2.3 “Normally remains at sea for more than 72 hours” means not returning to port within a 72 hour period.</p>

<p>2.4 “at sea”, “sea service” etc. includes work on a fishing vessel in categorised or other internal waters.</p>

<p>2.5 A fishermen is every person including the skipper employed or engaged in any capacity on board any fishing vessel. This includes self-employed share fishermen. It does not include pilots or fisheries protection officers or other whose role requires them to work on board a fishing vessel for a purpose other than fishing.</p>

<p>2.6 “Fishing vessel owner” means the owner of a fishing vessel or any other organisation or person such as the manager, agent or bareboat charterer who has assumed the responsibility for the operation of the vessel from the owner and who, on assuming such responsibility, has agreed to take over the duties and responsibilities imposed on fishing vessel owners in accordance with the Convention, regardless of whether any other organisation or person fulfils certain duties or responsibilities on behalf of the fishing vessel owner.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Requirement for fishermen to hold a medical fitness certificate (Regulation 5)</h2>

<p>3.1 Any fisherman working on a fishing vessel must have a valid medical fitness certificate. The fisherman must ensure that their medical fitness certificate is on board the vessel while they are working.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any person working on a fishing vessel which</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- is 24m in length or over, or</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- normally remains at sea for more than 72 hours, or</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- operates more than 200 miles from the coastline of the UK or beyond the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continental shelf, or</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- is subject to inspection in a foreign port</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the valid medical fitness certification is</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) an ENG 1 issued by a medical practitioner approved by the MCA (known as an &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approved Doctor – see paragraphs 4.2 and 4.3); or</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) a certificate of medical fitness issued by the Maritime Authority of any country &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is recognised by the UK as equivalent to the UK certificate. The countries &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose certificates are recognised as equivalent are listen in MSN 1815. The &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certificate must show key information in English.</p>

<p>3.3 For any person holding a certificate of competence as a skipper on a fishing vessel of 16.5 m and over, the valid medical fitness certificate is an ENG 1 or recognised equivalent as set out in 3.2 above.</p>

<p>3.4 For persons <u>other than CoC holders</u> working on fishing vessels which</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- is under 24m in length; or</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- does not normally remain at sea for more than 72 hours</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The valid medical fitness certificate is either</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) an ENG 1 or recognised equivalent as set out in 3.2 above, or</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) and ML5 certificate (see section 7)</p>

<p>3.5  In either case, a certificate is only valid until the expiry date shown on the certificate. It must not have been withdrawn or suspended (see section 9).</p>

<p>3.6 It is an offense:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- to work on a fishing vessel without a valid medical fitness certificate;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- to work in a capacity or in a geographical area for which the medical fitness &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certificate is not valid by virtue of a restriction on the certificate (see paragraph 5.3)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- to work in such a way as to breach a condition, where the certificate has been issued &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subject to conditions (see paragraph 5.3)</p>

<p>3.7  It is also an offense to employ a fisherman to work on a vessel without a valid medical fitness certificate, or in a capacity which is not compliant with a restriction or condition. However, the owner should also consider whether it is possible to accommodate any restrictions by making “reasonable adjustments” to the fisherman’s duties or working environment, in compliance with the Equality Act 2010.</p>

<p>3.8 Exceptions</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A fisherman whose medical fitness certificate has expired during the course of a voyage may continue to work until the next port of call at which a replacement certificate can be obtained, or for up to three months from the date of expiry of the certificate – whichever is the sooner. The validity of the certificate cannot be extended. A replacement medical fitness certificate must be obtained at the next port at which it is possible to do so.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This exception should only be used where a certificate expires while in a location where it is impossible to obtain a valid medical certificate – e.g. in a foreign port where there is no UK Approved Doctor within reach and in a country from which the MCA does not accept the national medical fitness certificate or where this is not available to foreign nationals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In urgent cases, and with MCA’s express approval, a fisherman who has no valid medical fitness certificate may exceptionally join a vessel for a period not exceeding three months, provided that their last medical fitness certificate –</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Expired no more than one month ago; and</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Was valid for a full 24 months (or 12 months if the fisherman is under 18 years of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a case, the fisherman must obtain a replacement medical fitness certificate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the next port at which it is possible to do so. Approval should be requested from &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCA’s Medical Administration Team at the details at the end of this Notice.</p>

<p>3.9 A fisherman required to hold a valid medical fitness certificate must produce the certificate on demand to a proper authority (for example, an inspector appointed under Section 258 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, or a Port State Control Inspector).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Making an appointment for an ENG 1 medical examination</h2>

<p>4.1 A list of Approved Doctors with contact details is published on the MCA’s webpage</p>

<p>4.2 For MCA Approved Doctors in the UK: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mca-approved-doctors-uk-based">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mca-approved-doctors-uk-based</a></p>

<p>4.3 For MCA Approved Doctors overseas: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mca-approved-doctors-overseas">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mca-approved-doctors-overseas</a></p>

<p>4.4 Unless the fishing vessel owner, employer or manning agent has arrangements in place to use a particular Approved Doctor for all of their crew, the fisherman my contact any of the MCA Approved Doctors and ask for an ENG 1 medical examination.</p>

<p>4.5 Approved Doctors should be able to offer an appointment for an ENG 1 medical examination within one week of request. Where this is not possible, for instance because of holidays, the Approved Doctor should normally be able to suggest alternative Approved Doctors in the vicinity. However, sometimes the Approved Doctor who issues an ENG 1 may require the fisherman to return to them for any renewal, because they need to monitor a particular medical condition. Fishermen who are having difficulty in obtaining an appointment or feel there is a lack of availability in a specific area should notify the Medical Administration Team using the contact details provided at the end of this notice.</p>

<p>4.6  A fisherman attending a medical examination will be asked for personal and photographic identification which will be checked by the Approved Doctor. Any previous medical certificate (ENG 1 or equivalent), or Notice of Failure or Restriction (ENG 3) if applicable, should also be brought to the examination. In addition, if the fisherman has a medical condition on which they have received specialist advice, any medical information or reports from consultants should be brought if possible as they are likely to help the AD make a decision.</p>

<p>4.7 The Approved Doctor will charge a fee for the examination, which is set in legislation and published on the www.gov.uk website. Where the fisherman is employed or has an offer of employment, this cost should be met by the fisherman’s employer or company.</p>

<p><u>About the medical examination</u></p>

<p>4.8  The Approved Doctor will ask about the fisherman’s medical history, including whether they have had any previous medical examination for an ENG 1, and the outcome of that examination. The fisherman will be required to sign a declaration on the report of the medical examination confirming that the information they have given is correct.</p>

<p>4.9 The fisherman should also inform the Approved Doctor of any medical condition they are aware that they have, or any medical treatment they are undergoing/medication they are taking at the time of the examination. Knowingly withholding such information may be considered as obtaining a certificate under false pretences, which is an offence under fraud legislation.</p>

<p>4.10 The Approved Doctor will carry out an examination, including testing eyesight and colour vision. See Annex A for further detail.</p>

<p>4.11 The Approved Doctor will keep full clinical notes of any detailed medical examination, and records including a completed medical report form (known as an ENG 2) will be retained for 10 years. These records may be subject to clinical and administrative audit by the MCA to ensure that Approved Doctors are following MCA medical standards and procedures correctly. The fisherman will be required to give consent to this at the start of the medical examination.</p>

<p>4.12 Approved Doctors are also required to send to the MCA statistical returns (i.e. containing no identifiable personal information) on examinations carried out.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Statutory Standards of medical fitness</h2>

<p>5.1 The Approved Doctor’s decision on a fisherman’s medical fitness must follow the statutory medical and eyesight standards set out in Annex A to MSN 1886 (M+F) (available to download from the MCA web site www.gov.uk details at the end of this notice). The Notice also gives some information about factors the Approved Doctor will consider in reaching their decision.</p>

<p>5.2 Candidates for an ML5 medical certificate are also subject to the standards at Annex A of MSN 1886 (M+F)</p>

<p><b>5.3  Categories of medical fitness</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following categories are applied in assessing whether or not a fisherman is fit in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terms of the medical and eyesight Standards:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Category 1: Fit</b> for sea service, with no restrictions</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Category 2: Fit</b> for sea service, <b>but with restrictions</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Category 3: Temporarily unfit</b> for sea service. The Approved Doctor must specify &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the duration of the period of unfitness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Category 4: Permanently unfit</b> for sea service. This category will normally be &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;considered to last for a minimum of five years and may only be changed at a later &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;date if an Approved Doctor is presented with medical evidence of the reversal of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the original medical condition. Review by a medical referee may also be required.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Restrictions:</u> The Approved Doctor may issue a “Fit” certificate but specify &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restrictions on the geographical locations or duties in which the fisherman is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;medically fit to work – for example, the restriction “no solo watchkeeping” where &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is a risk of sudden incapacity. This will require discussion with the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fisherman about their current role and the type of fishing they engage in. This &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restriction will be written on the face of the ENG 1 certificate, so that any &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employer, the skipper, owner and the issuing authority for any Certificate of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competency issued can see it. It will not contain any medical information. Some &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restrictions may preclude the issue of certain certificates of competency. MCA will &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advise.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Conditions:</u> Alternatively, the Approved Doctor may set conditions for the issue of a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;medical fitness certificate, formally notifying the fisherman of measures that must &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be taken in order for their medical fitness to be maintained. This will be put in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;writing, but will not be written on the ENG 1 certificate since it may contain &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;confidential medical information. Sometimes however, the Approved Doctor will &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advise that the fisherman must make their employer or skipper aware of the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;condition agreed, for example where the fisherman is required to take regular &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;medication which must be carried on board.</p>

<p>5.4 If the Approved Doctor issues a medical fitness certificate to the fisherman with restrictions, or finds them temporarily unfit or permanently unfit, they will also issue a Notice of Failure/Restriction (form MSF 4106, known as the ENG 3) which the fisherman can use to apply for a review of the Approved Doctor’s decision (known as an “appeal” – see section 10).</p>

<p>5.5 the Approved Doctor should normally explain to the fisherman the medical reasons for the refusal of a certificate or the inclusion of a restriction, as this will help the fisherman to understand whether to apply for a review of the decision. (The exception would be if the Approved Doctor considers that such disclosure would be harmful to the fisherman’s health.)</p>

<p><u>Replacement certificate</u></p>

<p>5.6 The ENG 1 certificate is the property of the fisherman. If a certificate is lost or damaged, the fisherman may ask the Approved Doctor to issue a replacement certificate. This will be at the Approved Doctor’s discretion. The replacement certificate will be valid for the remaining validity of the original certificate. An administrative fee may be charged.</p>

<p>5.7 The Approved Doctor will notify MCA of the fisherman’s name, date of birth and the serial number of the original ENG 1 and the new certificate issued.</p>

<p>5.8  However, if a significant period of time as passed since the medical examination was carried out, the Approved Doctor may consider that a new examination is required so that they can issue a new certificate, which may be valid for up to two years, in which case the statutory fee for a medical examination will be payable.</p>

<p>5.9 Only the Approved Doctor who issued the original certificate can issue a replacement without conducting a full examination.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Validity of ENG 1 (Regulation 7)</h2>

<p>6.1 The medical fitness certificate will specify the date that the medical examination was carried out and the expiry date of the certificate.</p>

<p>6.2 The maximum validity period for any person of 18 years and over is 2 years, and for those under 18 years old, <u>1 year.</u></p>

<p>6.3 If there is a medical reason, an Approved Doctor may issue a certificate valid for a period of less than those in paragraph 6.2.</p>

<p>6.4 The fishing vessel owner, employer or skipper may at any time require a fisherman who holds a valid medical certificate to obtain a new certificate if, as a result of illness, injury or other reasonable cause, they believe the fisherman may no longer meet the medical fitness standards.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Application for an ML5 medical certificate</h2>

<p>7.1 The application for an ML5 certificate (referred to as the ML5 report form) can be downloaded from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ml5-medical-report-form-and-certificate-msf-4112">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ml5-medical-report-form-and-certificate-msf-4112</a></p>

<p>7.2 The ML5 report form can be completed by any doctor registered with the UK General Medical Council (GMC) and with a valid licence to practice. This allows a fisherman to ask their GP to complete the form. There is no prescribed fee for the doctor completing the ML5 form. The fee is at the discretion of the doctor completing the ML5 form.</p>

<p>7.3 The report form is designed in a question and answer format. If the doctor can complete the form with no ticks in any box indicating a medical problem, or any notes on medical conditions, the doctor may complete and issue the ML5 certificate.</p>

<p>7.4 However, if the doctor ticks the box against any of the medical conditions listed, or writes any comments in section 9 of the form, the doctor will not issue the certificate, and the applicant will have to be referred to an MCA-appointed medical assessor for a decision. In these circumstances the ML5 report can be referred to an MCA Medical Assessor for a decision based on the seafarer’s fitness to undertake their role and the Medical Standards in MSN 1886 (M+F). The ML5 referral is a paper based process that does not involve a face to face appointment. In order to start the referral process the applicant should complete Part D of the ML5 Medical Report (MSF 4112), and send the entire ML5 Medical Report to MCA Medical Administration Team, either by email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:medical@mcga.gov.uk">medical@mcga.gov.uk</a> or by post to the address at the end of this notice.</p>

<p>7.5 The applicant can provide further information regarding their fitness, this may include medical evidence from their GP, a specialist consultant or optometrist as appropriate. Medical evidence can be submitted with the ML5 form in an envelope marked “Private and Confidential” for forwarding to the MCA ML5 Medical Assessor.</p>

<p>7.6 Once the ML5 has been referred to the ML5 Medical Assessor, the Assessor has 10 working days to determine whether or not they can issue an ML5 medical certificate based on the evidence provided. The Assessor may also decide it is necessary to place restrictions on the seafarer’s area of operation or duties.</p>

<p>7.7 The ML5 Medical Assessor will sometimes issue a compliance letter to the applicant to accompany their medical certificate. This is to emphasize that the certificate is issued on the basis of the applicant’s current medical status, including any treatment or monitoring to which they are subject under their GP or consultant. Any change to that treatment may require a review of their medical certification.</p>

<p>7.8 The fisherman is not charged for a referral. In order to ensure that the referral is dealt with promptly, it is important to ensure that the medical assessor is provided with all available supporting information they may need to make their decision when the form is submitted.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Reporting of medical conditions (Regulation 9)</h2>

<p>8.1 If a fisherman is absent from work for 30 days or more (or expects to be) because of illness or injury, they must report the reason as soon as possible to an Approved Doctor (if practicable the one who issued their certificate). The Approved Doctor will advise whether a further statutory medical examination is required before the fisherman returns to work.</p>

<p>8.2 If a fisherman develops a medical condition or suffers an injury which may affect their fitness to work at sea, they must report this to an Approved Doctor and, if advised to do so, attend for a medical examination for re-issue of their medical certificate.</p>

<p>8.3 In either case, once the reason for absence or medical condition is identified, the fisherman’s medical fitness certificate is suspended until they have been advised by a medical practitioner whether they need re-examination, and if so have been re-examined.</p>

<p>8.4  Where a fisherman on a UK fishing vessel holds a medical certificate issued on behalf of another maritime administration, they should consult the issuing authority. If that is not practicable, advice should be ought from a UK Approved Doctor, who may advise that the fisherman undergoes an examination for an ENG 1 medical certificate.</p>

<p>8.5 A fisherman may at any time be required by the fishing vessel owner, their employer or skipper, if in accordance with their terms and conditions, to obtain a new certificate where as a result of illness, injury or reasonable cause it is believed the fisherman may no longer meet the appropriate minimum standards.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Suspension and cancellation of a certificate (Regulation 10)</h2>

<p>9.1 An <u>Approved Doctor</u> has the power to suspend or cancel a medical certificate if they have reasonable grounds for believing that:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) there has been significant change in the medical fitness of a person while holding &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a valid certification; <b>or that</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the person is not complying with the terms of a condition of issue of the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certificate; <b>or that</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) they did not have full details of the person’s condition at the time of examination, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and if they had done so he could not reasonably have considered that the fisherman &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;met the required standards; <b>or that</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the medical fitness certificate was not issued in accordance with the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulations.</p>

<p>9.2 The certificate may be suspended until the person holding it has undergone a further medical examination, or for a specified period, or permanently cancelled, depending on circumstances. The Approved Doctor has the right under the Regulations to require the holder to surrender their medical certificate.</p>

<p>9.3 A fisherman whose medical fitness certificate is suspended for more than three months or cancelled has a right of review (“appeal”) of that suspension or cancellation – see section 10.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Application for a review (“appeal” – Regulation 11)</h2>

<p>10.1 A fisherman (including any fisherman applying for their first ENG 1) may apply for a review of the decision of the Approved Doctor if they are found:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) permanently unfit (Category 4), or</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) temporarily unfit for more than 3 months (Category 3), or</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) fit only for restricted service (Category 2), or</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) if their certificate is cancelled or suspended for more than 3 months by an &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approved Doctor</p>

<p>10.2 There is no right of review against a condition notified by an Approved Doctor (see paragraph 5.3) or against a decision of temporary unfitness (Category 3) for 3 months or less.</p>

<p>10.3 To apply for a review the fisherman should complete the application form which forms part of the Notice of Failure/Restriction (ENG 3) issued by the Approved Doctor and send it to the MCA’s Medical Administration Team at the details at the end of this Notice. The application should be made within <b>one month</b> of the date of the ENG 3 being issued.</p>

<p>10.4 In signing the application for review, the fisherman is also giving consent for the Approved Doctor to release his or her ENG 2 report form and any other information provided to the Approved Doctor (including supplementary medical reports, GP letters, or any other information that led to the Approved Doctor’s decision) to the Medical Referee. If the applicant wishes to submit additional medical evidence in support of their application they should arrange for this to be sent to the medical referee before the appointment date.</p>

<p>10.5 The MCA’s Medical Administration Team will then arrange for the case to be reviewed by a medical referee appointed by the Secretary of State for Transport. There are referees located in different parts of the United Kingdom and MCA will offer a choice of the most convenient location.</p>

<p>10.6  Before applying for a review, the fisherman may wish to review MSN 1886 (M+F) which contains the medical fitness standards (the ENG 3 form will state which clause of the standards is relevant), seek independent medical advice from their GP, or perhaps from their federation/association or employer of fishing vessel owner. The cost of the review, and of any specialist reports required by the medical referee in order to make their decision, is met by the MCA. The fisherman is responsible for their travel costs to their appointment, and if having agreed the appointment time with the referee they fail to attend without giving due notice, may be required to cover the cost of the missed appointment.</p>

<p>10.7 Where a medical referee has determined that a fisherman is permanently unfit to go to sea, MCA will not normally allow a further application for review from that person within five years of that determination.</p>

<p>10.8 The medical referee will normally reach a decision within 2 months of the date on which the review was lodged with the MCA. However, this may take longer if further medical information is needed to make the decision.</p>

<h2>Annex A</h2>

<p><b>What is involved in a medical examination?</b></p>

<p><b>Length of appointment:</b> An appointment for a medical examination will normally be 30 – 40 minutes. The approved doctor (AD) may delegate some parts of the examination (measuring weight and height, blood pressure readings, vision test etc.) to another health professional in the practice, and the time spent with the AD may not be the whole appointment. The decision on fitness however will be taken by the AD.</p>

<p><b>Questions about medical history:</b> It is important that the candidate is open and honest about any medical condition they are aware of, and any medication they take or have taken. This will help the AD to make a good decision about the candidate’s fitness to work at sea, including any restrictions on the work that they can safely do. Knowingly withholding information may invalidate the medical fitness certificate, and it is a criminal offence to work without a valid medical certificate.</p>

<p>It may be necessary, with the candidate’s consent, for the AD to obtain information from the candidate’s General Practitioner or consultant or other doctor providing medical care to the candidate. When it is necessary to consult with other doctors, the usual ethical considerations about patient consent and medical confidentiality apply, but the decision on fitness for work at sea, in accordance with the required standards, rests with the Approved Doctor, subject to the review procedure (section 10 of this Notice).</p>

<p><b>Physical examination:</b> The AD will normally want to see the candidate unclothed, at least down to underwear, to assess their physique and mobility. They may, with the candidate’s permission, need to move underwear aside in order to complete the examination.</p>

<p>The AD will also be looking at –</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Posture, movement and gait</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Condition of skin, especially hands – including scars from past surgery or injury</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clinical test of hearing, examination of external ear and drum, and mobility</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clinical test of eye movements, pupil responses and visual fields</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Visual inspection of teeth, gums, mouth and tonsils; if necessary, the AD may ask for details of the candidate’s dentist regarding any recent dental appointments</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The examination of lungs and heart including auscultation and pulses</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Palpation of abdomen</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Standing examination of hernial orifices and leg veins</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simple neurological screen – reflexes, sensory function, motor co-ordination in arms and legs</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Routine tests</b></p>

<p>The following will be carried out at every full examination i.e. at least 2-yearly:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Height and weight</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>BMI (body mass index) calculated from height and weight</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pulse rate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blood pressure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Urine test with dipsticks for protein, glucose and blood</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spirometry or peak flow measurement if the candidate has a respiratory problem</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Vision – distant, near and colour vision tests (Ishihara plate test)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Colour vision:</b> if the candidate fails the Ishihara plate test, a supplementary test will be required for those with navigational lookout duties or engineers. See Appendix 1 to Annex A of MSN 1886 (M+F) and instructions at the end of this Annex.</p>

<p><b>Additional tests:</b> Depending on the candidate’s medical history and the findings of the routine test, the AD may require further information from the candidate’s GP or medical consultant. Alternatively, in accordance with international guidelines on medical examinations for seafarers, one or more extra medical tests or procedures may be required before they can make a decision on the candidate’s medical fitness:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Additional vision test</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chest X-ray</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Audiogram (hearing test)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Physical fitness assessment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dental check-up and treatment</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some ADs may be able to do the additional tests themselves or they may refer the candidate to someone else who has the correct equipment.</p>

<p>Where requested by the fishing vessel owner, the AD may also undertake immunisations or anti-malaria treatment (for those intending to call at ports in areas with risk of infection) – this is not part of the statutory medical examination.</p>

<p>An additional charge may be made for some tests or for reports The employer of fishing vessel owner is responsible for these changes (see paragraph 4.7 of this MSN)</p>

<p><b>Instructions for fishermen attending a CAD testing centre for colour vision test</b></p>

<p>The fisherman must take the following documents to the test centre:</p>

<p>A referral document, which can be any <u><b>one</b></u> of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>An ENG 3 form (MSF 4106)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A letter from the Approved Doctor</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An ML5 form (MSF 4112)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Application for a seafarer vision test sight test form (MSF 4100) if visual acuity and the Ishihara test were conducted by an optometrist</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The fisherman will also need to take:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Any normal glasses or contact lenses worn to correct for refractive errors <b>(colour correcting lenses or glasses are not permitted)</b></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A statutorily issued form of photo identification document (ID) such as a passport, driving licence or seafarer discharge book. A photocopy or scanned copy is <u><b>not</b></u> acceptable.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
