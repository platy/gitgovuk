<p>The <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> runs a Twitter account for news and updates on the Salisbury Plain Training Area using the Twitter hashtag #modontheplain. Follow us: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://twitter.com/mod_dio" rel="external">@mod_dio</a>.</p>

<p>March will be a very busy month as EX WESSEX STORM completes and the schools ramp up their training producing future commanders.  There will be a lot of individual troop/platoon and company/squadron training ongoing in preparation for bigger exercises later in the year.</p>

<h2>Dangerous trees</h2>

<p>The recent extreme weather events have had an adverse effect on lots of trees across the training area, and although there are moves to deal with the dangerous trees, there are still some in situ.  You are aware that the byelaws do not allow the public into wood blocks, but if a Public Rights of Way (<abbr title="Public Rights of Way">PROW</abbr>) goes through or runs alongside a treeline, please be careful.  If there are piles of logs on the training area, due to the harvest of trees affected by Ash Dieback, please stop your children climbing over these piles of logs, it is dangerous.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Salisbury Plain Training Area">SPTA</abbr> West</h2>

<p>A reminder that the public are not allowed to enter past the red line in <abbr title="Salisbury Plain Training Area">SPTA</abbr> West.  There has been an increase in the public being found inside the red line, but they have no authority to be there, whether the flags are flying or not. On the ground, that red line is denoted by signs informing the public of the danger and to keep out.</p>

<h2>Ash dieback on the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Estate &amp; Salisbury Plain Training Area</h2>

<p>The survey of ash dieback disease (caused by a fungal pathogen Hymenoscyphus fraxineus) is completed each year during the summer and autumn. We carry out that survey to monitor the condition of the trees; all ash trees have got the disease. Wherever possible, trees are left alone to resist the disease for as long as possible, then decay and collapse naturally. This preserved the trees for as long as possible and provides a wide range of wildlife with habitats. However, in areas where that natural and inevitable collapse would endanger training troops or other people, we remove the trees before they reach that state.</p>

<p>As people will know, we removed thousands of tons of diseased ash trees from the Avon Valley in what was probably the largest single tree safety operation ever undertaken in the UK. In the coming months we will be removing ash trees from roads around Everleigh village and there will be further roadside works next year. This will involve road closures and diversions, but we will be informing neighbours and interested parties directly as well as advertising these disruptions in the normal way.</p>

<p>We have been working in some of the larger woodlands as well, to make them safer for training troops. The felling in Ashdown Copse has been completed and the ground prepared for planting. Deer fences will now be erected and the open areas planted with new trees. We have also completed felling in Hill Wood, near Erlestoke and are in the process of felling ash and carrying out some thinning (when we remove a few trees to allow the remaining trees to grow bigger and better) to beech and fir plantations in Everleigh Ashes.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you have any questions or require any further information, please direct them to Iain Perkins, who will route them to the correct person. The following Helpline: 0800 0223 334 number can also be used for queries Landmarc.</p>
