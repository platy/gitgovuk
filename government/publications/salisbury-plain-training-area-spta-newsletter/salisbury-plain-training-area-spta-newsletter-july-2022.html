<h2>July 2022 Newsletter</h2>

<p>July will see the deployment of EX IRON STORM in the first 3 weeks of July. This is an armoured exercise, and is a free flow exercise. It will see lots of wheeled and armoured vehicles moving both day and night about the area. During the rest of July the area will have lots of other activity both on foot and vehicles.</p>

<h2>Dangerous trees</h2>

<p>The recent extreme weather events have had an adverse effect on lots of trees across the training area, and although there are moves to deal with the dangerous trees, there are still some in situ. The byelaws do not allow the public into wood blocks, but if a Public Rights of Way (<abbr title="Public Rights of Way">PROW</abbr>) goes through or runs alongside a treeline, please be careful. If there are piles of logs on the training area, due to the harvest of trees affected by Ash Dieback, please stop your children climbing over these piles of logs, it is dangerous.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Salisbury Plain Training Area">SPTA</abbr> West</h2>

<p>A reminder that the public are not allowed to enter past the red line in <abbr title="Salisbury Plain Training Area">SPTA</abbr> West. There has been an increase in the number of members of the public being found inside the red line, but they have no authority to be there, whether the flags are flying or not. On the ground, that red line is denoted by signs informing the public of the danger and to keep out.</p>

<h2>Useful information</h2>

<p>The Headquarters of Salisbury Plain Training Area now has a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/HQSalisburyPlainTrainingArea/" rel="external">Facebook page</a> and a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://twitter.com/hqspta?lang=en" rel="external">Twitter account</a>.</p>

<p>Please join and follow us.</p>

<p>We encourage estate users to report illegal activity. Call 999 for emergencies, but for other suspected illegal activity on Salisbury Plain Training Area, please contact the Ministry of Defence Police on 01371 854444. A detachment is permanently based on Salisbury Plain and will respond.</p>

<h2>Byelaw governance: antisocial behaviour</h2>

<p>Parish members are encouraged to report all illegal activity on Salisbury Plain including: illegal off-roading, illegal motor biking, drone use, poaching, hare coursing, petty theft, camping on MoD land, kite flying to the Ministry of Defence Police on 01371 854444.</p>

<p>If serious crime is experienced 999 should be dialled. Once reported please inform range control on the Plain watch number: 01980 674951 or email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PLAINWATCH@landmarc.mod.uk">PLAINWATCH@landmarc.mod.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Access</h2>

<p>Salisbury Plain Military Lands, Bulford, Larkhill and Imber Range Byelaws regulate access to <abbr title="Salisbury Plain Training Area">SPTA</abbr>.  Always comply with local signs and flags.  Rights of way in Range Danger Areas are closed when red flags are flying or when the signage restricts unauthorised access. This newsletter is published up to 6 weeks before the event and changes may occur.</p>

<p>Access timings for the next week can be found on the <abbr title="Salisbury Plain Training Area">SPTA</abbr> Walks Line:  (01980) 674763 or on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wiltshire-byelaws"><abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Byelaws Wiltshire</a> website.</p>

<h2>Wildfire</h2>

<p>A wildfire is an uncontrolled blaze triggered by a heat source fuelled by weather, wind, dry underbrush and vegetation. Wildfires can burn acres of land and consume everything in their paths in minutes. Approximately 80% of wildfires are started by human interaction and <abbr title="Salisbury Plain Training Area">SPTA</abbr> is no different in this respect. A number of wildfires have already been extinguished this year that were a direct result of recreational activity on the Plain. This must serve as timely reminder that especially while we experience some otherwise favourable temperatures and glorious sunshine, setting any kind of fire or using a BBQ on <abbr title="Salisbury Plain Training Area">SPTA</abbr> is banned. The type of grassland on <abbr title="Salisbury Plain Training Area">SPTA</abbr> ignites incredibly easily and burns furiously in these conditions, getting to an uncontrollable state extremely quickly. All fires on <abbr title="Salisbury Plain Training Area">SPTA</abbr> should be reported to Range Control â 01980 674951.</p>

<h2>Operation (Op) Aston</h2>

<p>Op Aston is a joint operation between <abbr title="Salisbury Plain Training Area">SPTA</abbr> core staff, Ministry Of Defence Police&nbsp; (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr>) and the Wiltshire Police Force.&nbsp; Primarily, the Police attendees are from Rural Crime, whereas <abbr title="Salisbury Plain Training Area">SPTA</abbr> are stakeholders within the Rural Crime Partnership.&nbsp;&nbsp;The operation was conducted on Sunday 1 May 2022 between 10am to 4pm,  but due to commitments Wilts Police could not attend. The aims of the operation: 1. To stop and engage with all off-road activity, inform and educate on good practice and deal with Byelaw infringements effectively.  2. To show a presence in order to operate as an effective deterrent to any criminal activity across <abbr title="Salisbury Plain Training Area">SPTA</abbr>.</p>

<p>During this Op, there were minimum military units training and <abbr title="Salisbury Plain Training Area">SPTA</abbr> was overall quieter than normal with regards to weekend activities.&nbsp; This may have been due to the presence of so many authority personnel, which is an achievement of one of the aims.  In addition, the reduction in illegal activity could be down to the efforts of the staff, the Police and members of the public reporting this type of activity and themselves complying with the Byelaws. The Op is regarded as a success and there are more users educated on the rights and wrongs of using <abbr title="Salisbury Plain Training Area">SPTA</abbr> as a playground.</p>

<h2>Ministry of Defence Police (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr>) Salisbury Plain</h2>

<p>The return of the hot weather has seen a downturn in numbers visiting the Plain for illegal activity, perhaps theyâve all gone to the coast.</p>

<p>Stats from&nbsp; May the 1st&nbsp;to todayâs date are -</p>

<p>40 Fixed Penalty Notices (Fines ) for offences ranging from illegal off-roading to No MOT.</p>

<p>14 Offenders summoned to Court for traffic offences such as driving with no insurance or no driving licence</p>

<p>11 vehicles seized including motocross bikes, 4x4s and pit bikes for offences of no insurance or SORN.</p>

<p>Users of the Plain are reminded that they must be fully road legal and stick to the byways and permissive by when driving on the Plain.</p>

<p>A total of 16 Solar Panels were stolen from Knook Camp in May, anyone with any information regrading this is requested to contact PC 1337 TALBOT on <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:MDP-SalisburyPlain-GMB@mod.go.uk"><abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr>-SalisburyPlain-GMB@mod.go.uk</a></p>

<p>There has been an increase of reports in relation to suspected Hare Coursing on <abbr title="Salisbury Plain Training Area">SPTA</abbr>. This is illegal under Sect 1 of the Hunting Act and offenders often cause criminal damage to the Tenant Farmland and fencing. Anyone seeing any Hare Coursing in progress are requested to call 999, anyone with any information in relation to any offences on the Plain are asked to call the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr> <abbr title="Headquarters">HQ</abbr> Control room on 01371 854444 or email the team at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:MDP-SalisburyPlain-GMB@mod.uk"><abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr>-SalisburyPlain-GMB@mod.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Please report any incidents or crimes to the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr> control room 24hrs on 01371 854444.</p>

<p>Please act responsibly on Salisbury Plain and follow the Government guidelines.</p>

<p><strong>In an emergency always, call 999</strong></p>
