<p>The DIO runs a Twitter account for news and updates on the Salisbury Plain Training Area using the Twitter hashtag #modontheplain. This account now has over 7000 followers. &nbsp;If you would like to follow us, go to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://twitter.com/mod_dio" rel="external">@mod_dio</a>.</p>

<h2>August 2022 Newsletter</h2>

<p>Early August will see lots of dismounted activity with the &nbsp;Exercise WESSEX STORM starting in late August and running into September.&nbsp; The Plain will have lots of wheeled vehicles and dismounts exercising both day and night throughout the month of August.</p>

<h2>Dangerous Trees</h2>

<p>The recent extreme weather events have had an adverse effect on lots of trees across the training area and although there are moves to deal with the dangerous trees, there are still some which require making safe.&nbsp; You are all aware that the Byelaws do not allow the public into wood blocks, but if a PROW goes through or runs alongside a treeline, please be careful.&nbsp; If there are piles of logs on the training area, due to the harvest of trees affected by Ash Dieback, please stop your children climbing over these piles of logs, it is dangerous.</p>

<h2>SPTA WEST</h2>

<p>A reminder that the public are not allowed to enter past the red line in SPTA West.&nbsp;There has been an increase in the public being found inside the red line, but they have no authority to be there, whether the flags are flying or not. On the ground, that red line is denoted by signs informing the public of the danger and to keep out.</p>

<h2>Useful information</h2>

<p>The Headquarters of Salisbury Plain Training Area now has a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/HQSalisburyPlainTrainingArea/" rel="external">Facebook page</a> and a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://twitter.com/hqspta?lang=en" rel="external">Twitter account</a>.</p>

<p>Please join and follow us.</p>

<p>We encourage estate users to report illegal activity. Call 999 for emergencies, but for other suspected illegal activity on Salisbury Plain Training Area, contact the Ministry of Defence Police on 01371 854444. A detachment is permanently based on Salisbury Plain and will respond.</p>

<h2>Byelaw governance – antisocial behaviour</h2>

<p>Parish members are encouraged to report all illegal activity on Salisbury Plain including illegal off-roading, illegal motor biking, drone use, poaching, hare coursing, petty theft, camping on MoD land and kite flying to the Ministry of Defence Police on 01371 854444.&nbsp; If serious crime is experienced 999 should be dialled. Once reported please inform range control on the Plain watch number: 01980 674951 or email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PLAINWATCH@landmarc.mod.uk">PLAINWATCH@landmarc.mod.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Access</h2>

<p>Salisbury Plain Military Lands, Bulford, Larkhill and Imber Range Byelaws regulate access to SPTA. Always comply with local signs and flags. Rights of way in Range Danger Areas are closed when red flags are flying or when the signage restricts unauthorised access. This newsletter is published up to 6 weeks before the event and changes may occur. Access timings for the next week can be found on the SPTA Walks Line: (01980) 674763. Link - <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wiltshire-byelaws#full-publication-update-history">Gov.UK - Government Publications - MOD Byelaws Wiltshire</a></p>

<h2>Wildfire</h2>

<p>A wildfire is an uncontrolled blaze triggered by a heat source fuelled by weather, wind, dry underbrush and vegetation. Wildfires can burn acres of land and consume everything in their paths in minutes. Approximately 80% of wildfires are started by human interaction and SPTA is no different in this respect. A number of wildfires have already been extinguished this year that were a direct result of recreational activity on the Plain. This must serve as timely reminder that especially while we experience some otherwise favourable temperatures and glorious sunshine, setting any kind of fire or using a BBQ on SPTA is banned. The type of grassland on SPTA ignites incredibly easily and burns furiously in these conditions, getting to an uncontrollable state extremely quickly. All fires on SPTA should be reported to Range Control – 01980 674951.</p>

<h2>Impact Area Wildfire</h2>

<p>As many of you will be aware, there was a large fire within the impact area which started on the 11 Jul 22. The fire burnt for several days due to the inability to access the Central Impact Area. The Impact Area contains large amounts of Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) which makes it impossible for firefighting vehicles and aircraft to firefight. The training taking place which ignited the fire was Pre Deployment Training (PDT) for operations overseas. We are aware that the smoke generated from this fire had a considerable detrimental effect on the population and we would like to assure you that we do everything we can in these situations to minimise the effect on the general public.</p>

<h2>Operation (Op) Aston</h2>

<p>Op Aston is a joint operation between SPTA core staff, Ministry Of Defence Police&nbsp; (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr>) and the Wiltshire Police Force.&nbsp; Primarily, the Police attendees are from Rural Crime, whereas SPTA are stakeholders within the Rural Crime Partnership.&nbsp;&nbsp;The operation was conducted on Sunday 01 May 22 between 1000-1600hrs, but due to commitments Wilts Police could not attend. The aims of the operation are as follows: 1. To stop and engage with all off-road activity, inform and educate on good practice and deal with Byelaw infringements effectively.  2. To show a presence in order to operate as an effective deterrent to any criminal activity across SPTA.</p>

<p>During this Op, there were minimum military units training and SPTA was overall quieter than normal with regards to weekend activities.&nbsp; This may have been due to the presence of so many authority personnel, which is an achievement of one of the aims.  In addition, the reduction in illegal activity could be down to the efforts of the staff, the Police and members of the public reporting this type of activity and themselves complying with the Byelaws. The Op is regarded as a success and there are more users educated on the rights and wrongs of using SPTA as a playground.</p>

<h2>Ministry of Defence Police (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr>) Salisbury Plain</h2>

<p>The last 3 months has seen a reduction in Criminal activity and traffic offences on SPTA. The hot weather and the cost of fuel is no doubt keeping people away.&nbsp;However, alongside ongoing investigations the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr> on SPTA issued the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>46 Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs)&nbsp; (offences such as illegal off-road driving, no seat belt, no MOT, fines range from £50 to £100)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>18 Traffic Offence Reports (TORs) submitted&nbsp;(offenders reported/summonsed to court for offences such as no insurance, driving without due care or attention, drug and drink driving and dangerous driving)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Vehicles seized for Offences - 15</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>SPTA Bylaw Warning Off Notices issued - 5</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cannabis Warnings - 5</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A continued drop in FPNs issued but a significant rise in more serious traffic offences being committed and reported for prosecution. With the grass currently being cut by the Tenant Farmers we are expecting an increase in Criminal Activity on the Plain in the form of Hare Coursing and the other offences that seem to accompany the offenders (criminal damage, farm thefts and public order offences). As such, expect to see a higher Police presence on the Plain during the early mornings and evenings. We would also like to remind dog walkers and other people taking advantage of the permissive access on the Plain that they must park within 15 yards of the public highways. We have had numerous reports of persons parking and driving contrary to Sect 34 of The Road Traffic Act 1988 and causing obstructions and annoyance to Tenant Farmers carrying out their activities and driving, cycling, riding horses and walking amongst exercising troops.</p>

<p>The rise in temperature of late has seen an increase in the number of wild swimmers and people wading in and around C Crossing and Gunville Cottage. Whilst we understand the need to enjoy the cool waters, please remember to respect our neighbours by keeping any music played to a minimum, taking all litter home with you and obeying the no access signs where placed upon the banks.</p>

<p>In relation to any offences on the Plain you are asked to call the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr> HQ Control room on 01371 854444 or email the team at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:MDP-SalisburyPlain-GMB@mod.uk"><abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr>-SalisburyPlain-GMB@mod.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Please report any incidents or crimes to the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr> control room 24hrs on 01371 854444.</p>

<p>Please act responsibly on Salisbury Plain and follow the Government guidelines.</p>

<p><strong>In an emergency always call 999</strong></p>

<h3>Ash dieback up-date on the MOD Estate &amp; Salisbury Plain Training Area</h3>

<p>SPTA continues to be the focus for much of the ash dieback works on DTE. By the end of this month, we will have carried out felling at Round O and will be able to bring that back in bounds to troops. We are also carrying out bat surveys at Tilshead Down so that we can remove large ash trees that have been deteriorating for some years and are now in such a state that that plantation has been out of bounds for some time. The information from the bat surveys will be used to make the trees safe in ways that do not harm bats or their roosts. Mark Hedley, SW Region Forest Works Manager is putting tenders out for three packages of roadside tree removal. As soon as we have firm dates for that work, you will hear about it as we warn people about road closures and diversions. Lastly, if you have visited Everleigh Ashes since we carried out works there, you will have seen that we have been developing a method of making trees safe by removing branches but leaving the main stem. This means that the tree is much safer for people to be beneath, but has a chance of survival if it proves to be resilient to the ash dieback disease. If the tree succumbs to the disease, then the dead stem will slowly rot in situ, providing habitat for a whole host of wildlife. It will look a bit odd at first as we are used to seeing ‘tidy’ forestry, but within a few years the woodland wildlife will be reaping the benefits.</p>
