<span class="number">4. </span>Reminder: FE workforce collections</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>FE workforce staff and vacancy data collection</h3>

<p>We have extended the deadline for returning FE workforce data to Friday 22 October 2021 at 4pm. This provides an additional 4 weeks for the data return.</p>

<p>Providers are encouraged to send a return to familiarise themselves with the data items required and the methods of completing the data return. If you haven’t already, please submit your data.</p>

<p>Returned data provides an initial view of the sector to support policy development and allows for feedback across the sector.</p>

<p>The data return will be mandatory for the 2021 to 2022 academic year.</p>

<p>You should complete a return if you receive funding through one or more of the funding models listed in the governor collection section below. Returns are not required if you are a school or academy which returns the school workforce census or a HE provider which returns the HESA staff record.</p>

<p>More information is available in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-education-workforce-data-collection" class="govuk-link">technical specification and support manual</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>FE workforce governor data collection</h3>

<p>We would like to remind FE and sixth form colleges that the FE workforce governor data collection is now open, for 2020 to 2021 academic year. The collection closes on 22 October 2021 at 4pm. This is an annual return.</p>

<p>The governor data collected will provide a snapshot of board composition in the FE sector to the Department for Education and used to feedback for 2020 data to the sector.</p>

<p>The supporting guidance to assist providers with making a return is available on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-education-workforce-data-collection" class="govuk-link">FE Workforce page</a>.</p>

<p>You should complete this return if your organisation is an FE or sixth-form college and receives funding through one or more of the models listed below.</p>

<h3>

<p>We would like to remind the sector that the Register of Apprenticeship Training Providers (the Register) is open only to new providers that are able to fulfil a gap in provision identified by an employer.</p>

<p>Employer providers must follow the published process, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-of-apprenticeship-training-providers" class="govuk-link">full details on this process</a> can be found on GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: list of declared subcontractors</h2>

<p>The final publication of the 2020 to 2021 list of declared subcontractors has been published on GOV.UK. It is based on information from declarations submitted by ESFA funded providers. </p>
