<p>What has changed</p>

<p>The advice on ending isolation for coronavirus (COVID-19) patients remaining in hospital has changed. Inpatients can end self-isolation after 10 days subject to a clinical risk assessment.</p>

<p>There are additional recommendations on stepping down isolation for severely immunocompromised patients.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Scope</h2>

<p>This guidance has been written by UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) primarily for a health and care professional audience in England with input from NHS England. Country specific advice may be available for each country across the United Kingdom. Please refer to <a href="http://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/a-to-z-of-topics/covid-19/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Health Protection Scotland</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://phw.nhs.wales/topics/latest-information-on-novel-coronavirus-covid-19/" rel="external">Public Health Wales</a>, or <a href="https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/covid-19-coronavirus" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>This guidance provides advice on appropriate infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) precautions for patients recovering or recovered from symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19, and who are remaining in hospital, being discharged to their own home, or being discharged to residential care. Hospital discharges are covered by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hospital-discharge-service-policy-and-operating-model/hospital-discharge-service-policy-and-operating-model" class="govuk-link">NHS hospital discharge service: policy and operating model</a>.</p>

<p>Immunocompetent individuals can be advised on discharge to follow the self-isolation requirements from the date of symptom onset or the date of their positive COVID-19 test if they did not have any symptoms.</p>

<p>For patients who have remained asymptomatic or whose fever has resolved, the risk that they remain infectious after the 10th day of isolation is low, and the majority can end their isolation after 10 days. A longer isolation period is recommended for individuals with severe immunocompromise whose condition may delay them clearing the virus.</p>

<p>Patients who are still within their isolation period but who are otherwise clinically fit for discharge can be discharged to their home or to a social care setting with appropriate isolation advice.</p>

<p>For patients being discharged to social care settings refer to guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/designated-settings-for-people-discharged-to-a-care-home" class="govuk-link">designated settings</a> and the ‘safe discharge from the NHS to social care settings’ section in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-adult-social-care-action-plan">Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) adult social care plan</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Stepping down COVID-19 isolation precautions for patients staying in hospital</h2>

<p>For inpatients with COVID-19, isolation should continue until 10 days after the onset of symptoms (or their first positive COVID-19 test if they do not have any symptoms), provided the clinical criteria below are met.</p>

<p>Clinical criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>clinical improvement with at least some respiratory recovery</li>
  <li>absence of fever (temperature greater than 37.8°C) for 48 hours without the use of medication</li>
  <li>no underlying <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-stepdown-of-infection-control-precautions-within-hospitals-and-discharging-covid-19-patients-from-hospital-to-home-settings/guidance-for-stepdown-of-infection-control-precautions-and-discharging-covid-19-patients#immsupp" class="govuk-link">severe immunosuppression</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>A cough or a loss of, or change in, normal sense of smell or taste (anosmia), may persist in some individuals for several weeks, and are not considered an indication of ongoing infection when other symptoms have resolved.
This guidance does not apply if there are any additional indications for ongoing isolation and transmission based precautions (for example <abbr title="Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus">MRSA</abbr> carriage, C.difficile infection, diarrhoea).</p>

<p>For clinically suspected COVID-19 patients who have tested negative and whose condition is severe enough to require hospitalisation, the isolation period should be measured from the day of admission.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Immunocompetent patients</h3>

<p>Immunocompetent patients do not routinely need to be re-tested by <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test before stepping down isolation.</p>

<p>A risk assessment using the hierarchy of controls is required for those patients who meet the clinical criteria for stepping down isolation after 10 days. Consideration should be given to the vulnerability of other patients, the wearing of masks by patients, physical distancing and ventilation. Additional mitigations such as the use of LFD testing may be considered.</p>

<h3 class="2">
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Severely immunocompromised patients</h3>

<p>See the <a href="#immsupp" class="govuk-link">section below for the definition of severe immunosuppression</a>.</p>

<p>It is possible for severely immunocompromised patients to remain infectious for prolonged periods, even if they do not display any symptoms of COVID-19. The isolation period for these patients whilst in hospital should be at least 14 days.</p>

<p>In severely immunocompromised patients, resolution of symptoms should not be used as a marker of decreased infectiousness and these patients should be isolated in side rooms, cubicles or cohorted until they return a negative <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. Staff should strictly adhere to recommended <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-guidance-for-maintaining-services-within-health-and-care-settings-infection-prevention-and-control-recommendations"><abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures</a> throughout the inpatient stay.</p>

<p>Severely immunocompromised patients can end their isolation after a single negative <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result taken no earlier than 14 days after the onset of symptoms (or their first positive COVID-19 test if they do not have any symptoms). 
Asymptomatic patients with a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result after 14 days can end their isolation if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Ct value of their <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test is greater than 35, and</li>
  <li>they have either a positive anti-spike-antibody test or a negative LFD antigen test</li>
</ul>

<p>Some severely immunocompromised patients may have been treated with monoclonal antibodies (<abbr title="monoclonal antibodies">mAb</abbr>). For re-testing advice refer to the clinical commissioning policies for monoclonal antibodies or the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1027799/Interim_surveillance_protocol.pdf">UKHSA surveillance protocol</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Other immunocompromised patients</h3>

<p>The evidence on duration of infectiousness in patients who are mildly immunocompromised is less clear. Testing in this patient group can be considered, especially:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to support the optimal use of side rooms, or where side rooms are not available</li>
  <li>to support transfer or discharge including for those being discharged to a household where someone has an underlying health condition that puts them at higher risk of severe illness if they were infected with COVID-19</li>
  <li>if they have had monoclonal antibodies or new antiviral agents as part of their treatment of COVID-19. Refer to clinical commissioning policies on Ronapreve and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-genomic-surveillance-of-patients-who-are-treated-with-neutralising-monoclonal-antibody-or-immunosuppressed" class="govuk-link">UKHSA surveillance protocol</a> for more information</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Discharge of COVID-19 patient to own home</h2>

<p>This can be done when the patient’s clinical status is appropriate for discharge, for example, once assessed to have stable or recovering respiratory function, and any ongoing care needs can be met at home. Consider testing the patient 48 hours prior to discharge if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they will require repeated hospital day case or other care, especially if severely immunocompromised</li>
  <li>a member of their household has an underlying health condition that puts them at higher risk of severe illness if they were infected with COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<p>They should be given clear safety-netting advice for what to do if their symptoms worsen.</p>

<p>Immunocompetent patients should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">Stay at Home guidance for households</a> on discharge. If patients are febrile on discharge, they should continue to self-isolate until their fever has resolved for 48 consecutive hours without antipyretic medication (unless otherwise advised by a healthcare professional, for example if another reason for persistent fever exists).</p>

<p>When discharging patients, it is best practice to provide written instructions on any ongoing isolation recommendations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>How to transfer COVID-19 patients home</h3>

<p>Transport home can be arranged via a variety of routes.</p>

<p>If the patient has their own car at the hospital, and is well enough, they may drive home.</p>

<p>If they are taking shared transport, their status and isolation needs should be communicated with transport staff (for example, ambulance crews and relatives). Those transporting them should not themselves be at greater risk of severe infection.</p>

<p>If isolation is to continue in a residential setting, the following guidelines apply to all methods of transport:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the patient should be given clear instructions on what to do when they leave the ward to minimise risk of exposure to staff, patients and visitors on their way to their transport</li>
  <li>the patient should wear a surgical facemask for the duration of the journey, and advised that this should be left on for the entire time if tolerated (not pulled up and down)</li>
  <li>the patient should sit in the back of the vehicle with as much distance from the driver as possible (for example, the back row of a multiple passenger vehicle)</li>
  <li>where possible use vehicles that allow for optimal implementation of social distancing measures, such as those that have a partition between the driver and the passenger or larger vehicles that allow for a greater distance between the driver and the passenger</li>
  <li>vehicle windows facing the outside environment should be (at least partially) open to facilitate a continuous flow of air</li>
  <li>vehicles should be cleaned appropriately at the end of the journey</li>
  <li>ensure the patient has a supply of tissues and a waste bag for disposal for the duration of the journey; the waste bag should then be taken into their house, put into another waste bag and held for a period of 72 hours before disposal with general household waste</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Other household members in an individual’s home setting</h3>

<p>If the discharged patient is returning to a shared household during their isolation period, other household members should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<p>If there are any individuals with an underlying health condition that puts them at higher risk of severe illness with COVID-19 who live in the household and are currently not infected, it is highly advisable, where possible, for patients to be discharged to a different home until they have finished their self-isolation period. If these individuals cannot be moved to a different household, then ensure that the discharged patient is advised on strict infection prevention control measures as outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Discharging COVID-19 patients to a single occupancy room in a care facility, including nursing homes, residential homes and designated settings</h2>

<p>This can be done when the patient’s clinical status is appropriate for discharge, for example, once assessed to have stable or recovering respiratory function, and any ongoing care needs can be met at the residential care facility.</p>

<p>Any COVID-19 patient who is being discharged to a care facility within their 14-day isolation period should be discharged to a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/designated-settings-for-people-discharged-to-a-care-home/discharge-into-care-homes-designated-settings" class="govuk-link">designated setting</a>, where they should complete their remaining isolation.</p>

<p>Immunocompetent patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 and have already completed their isolation period should be exempt from testing by <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> prior to hospital discharge within 90 days from their initial illness onset or test, unless they develop new COVID-19 symptoms. In this case, a clinical assessment should be made to determine subsequent onward movement.</p>

<p>However, if the positive COVID-19 test was more than 90 days ago, the patient should be tested again 48 hours prior to discharge and the result of this repeat test relayed to the receiving organisation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Additional measures</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Ongoing medical needs for discharged COVID-19 patients within their isolation period</h3>

<p>Should any patient deteriorate following discharge, either at home or in a care setting, they or their carer should seek advice from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://111.nhs.uk/" rel="external">NHS 111 online</a> or by telephone, or through pre-existing services such as GP practice links with care homes. In an emergency, they or their carer should call 999 for assistance. In either case, they should inform the call attendant that they have been recently discharged from hospital with confirmed COVID-19.</p>

<p>If there are professional care needs at the patient’s own home, visiting carers should follow the appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> precautions outlined in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-domiciliary-care" class="govuk-link">home care guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Specific instructions for ongoing medical needs for severely immunocompromised COVID-19 patients and those who have received critical care</h3>

<p>The isolation policy for patients admitted to hospital is longer than those in the community, as there are uncertainties about the duration of infectiousness for patients with underlying immune problems that may delay them clearing the virus.</p>

<p>As described in <a href="#Section2.2" class="govuk-link">section 2.2</a>, testing for virological clearance is encouraged in <a href="#immsupp" class="govuk-link">severely immunocompromised patients</a>. For these patients, <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures should be continued unless there has been virological evidence of clearance prior to discharge. This is different to other advice sections but reflects the complex health needs of such patients and likelihood for prolonged shedding, with risk of spread in healthcare settings. Such patients may be retested at first follow-up appointment to help inform actions at any next medical appointment.</p>
