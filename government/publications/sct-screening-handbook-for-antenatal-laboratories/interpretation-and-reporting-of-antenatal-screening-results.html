<p>These guidelines should provide enough information to allow all normal, and over 95% of abnormal, results to be reported in a standardised manner. There will always be some situations that need further tests, or family studies, before a useful clinical result can be achieved because of the diversity of haemoglobin variants and thalassaemia syndromes. Appropriate clinical referral is needed in these cases to make sure the risk to the pregnancy is fully and correctly assessed.</p>

<p>If an individual had a blood transfusion and any of the transfused red cells are still present, misleading data and conclusions may result. This is also true for undeclared bone marrow transplants and gene therapy. It is essential that clinicians realise this fact. Laboratories must have a universal footnote on all haemoglobinopathy results, for example, ‘unless otherwise stated, result assumes no bone marrow transplant, gene therapy or recent transfusion’ or ‘result valid if not transfused and no history of bone marrow transplant or gene therapy’.</p>

<p>Laboratories should treat haemoglobin values of less than 80g/L with caution. There are multiple conditions that can cause severe anaemia in pregnancy, including iron deficiency, haemolytic anaemia, HbH disease, or β thalassaemia intermedia. Laboratories should review these on a case-by-case basis. If necessary, they should discuss such cases with a senior scientist or clinician to consider appropriate further action, including molecular testing and/or testing of the baby’s biological father.</p>

<p>It is not possible to separate all haemoglobin variants using screening methods and a second haemoglobin variant may be migrating/eluting with any other haemoglobin, including HbA. This is a particular issue in <abbr title="high performance liquid chromatography">HPLC</abbr> instruments which use a stepwise buffer gradient, notably the co-elution of Hbs S and C. Conversely, such gradients may also split other haemoglobin variants into 2 peaks, for example HbD<sup>Punjab</sup>. In other cases, such as when thalassaemia and haemoglobin variants are co-inherited, one condition may be masking another.</p>

<p><abbr title="high performance liquid chromatography">HPLC</abbr> instruments separate adducted fractions of haemoglobins. These fractions must not be added to the assumed parent peak. Addition of adducted peaks can lead to incorrect results. No additional testing is necessary if the HbA<sub>2</sub> is raised (but not greater than 8%) and the red cell indices are typical of a carrier of β thalassaemia. It is important to be aware that HbF levels are highly variable in β thalassaemia carriers.</p>

<p>Antenatal screening results must be interpreted and reviewed by 2 people, one of whom must be a registered scientist.</p>

<p>Final validation must be by a person with suitable expertise, as demonstrated by current competency testing.</p>

<p>Further tests required:</p>

<p>Specific HbS test.</p>

<p>It is recommended to perform a validated specific HbS test on all haemoglobin variants detected. If the variant has features suggestive of HbS and the test is positive, then no further testing is usually required. See <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/sct-screening-handbook-for-antenatal-laboratories/antenatal-screening#laboratory-screening-techniques">section 5.1 of Antenatal screening</a> for more information on the need for caution when using the sickle solubility test for confirmatory purposes with certain instruments. If the variant has features suggestive of HbS and the test is negative further investigations must be undertaken.</p>

<p>For all other variants see the minimum testing requirements (table below) to support the presumed identity of the listed haemoglobin variants when using <abbr title="high performance liquid chromatography">HPLC</abbr> or <abbr title="capillary electrophoresis">CE</abbr> as the first test. Laboratories may choose to perform additional or more specific techniques but must use a method with a different scientific principle to the primary method.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Interpretation of relative proportions</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Hb Variant (V) between 30 and 40% (25 and 35% if HbV is HbE).</h3>

<p>These values include both typical ratios and possible α<sup>+</sup> thalassaemia carriers. The screening algorithm does not aim to detect the latter.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Hb Variant (V) between 40 and 50% (35 and 50% if HbV is HbE).</h3>

<p>Is the band/peak in the HbA position actually HbA? If the HbV &gt; HbA the possibility exists of Hb V/β<sup>+</sup> thalassaemia with an unusually high expression of HbA. Test biological father, and consider referral for molecular testing, depending on his results.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>HbV ≥ 50%</h3>

<p>Consider Hb V/β<sup>+</sup> thalassaemia. Cases of Hb V/β<sup>+</sup> thalassaemia will usually have a reduced <abbr title="mean cell haemoglobin">MCH</abbr>. Consider the HbA<sub>2</sub>, although the presence of a haemoglobin variant may affect the values obtained on many systems. Ensure that red cell indices are reviewed and where V/β<sup>+</sup> thalassaemia is suspected further investigation is required. In the case of V/β<sup>+</sup> thalassaemia the antenatal risk is for both HbV and β thalassaemia.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>HbV ≤ 30% (≤ 25% if HbV is HbE) and <abbr title="mean cell haemoglobin">MCH</abbr> &lt; 25pg</h3>

<p>HbV carrier with possible co-existing α thalassaemia or iron deficiency. The α thalassaemia risk needs to be considered in the light of the family origins of both biological parents – see algorithm for α thalassaemia. The major risk is for HbV, but the risk of Hb Bart’s hydrops fetalis syndrome must not be overlooked especially if HbV is HbE.</p>

<p>In all the above cases use report format 2 or 8 as appropriate. See <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/sct-screening-handbook-for-antenatal-laboratories/recommended-report-formats">Recommended report formats</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>HbS</h3>

<p>Be aware that with some <abbr title="high performance liquid chromatography">HPLC</abbr> systems adducts of HbS may elute in the HbA window and may be mistaken for a small amount of HbA, so a person with sickle cell disease may appear to have Hb S/β<sup>+</sup> thalassaemia. If there is doubt as to the identity of this small peak an alternate method to confirm or refute the presence of HbA must be used.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>HbC</h3>

<p>The position of HbC relative to other haemoglobins can vary considerably depending upon the system used. On some <abbr title="high performance liquid chromatography">HPLC</abbr> systems, HbC gives a small additional peak of adducts of HbC in the HbS window. Other systems underestimate the HbA<sub>2</sub> level in the presence of HbC. This should not cause a diagnostic problem except when differentiating between Hb C/β<sup>0</sup> thalassaemia and Hb CC when it is essential to review the red cell indices.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>HbD</h3>

<p>The position of HbD will depend upon the system in use. Some systems underestimate the HbA<sub>2</sub> level in the presence of HbD<sup>Punjab</sup>. This should not cause a diagnostic problem except when differentiating between Hb D/β<sup>0</sup> thalassaemia and Hb DD when it is essential to review the red cell indices.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>HbE</h3>

<p>With some <abbr title="high performance liquid chromatography">HPLC</abbr> methods, HbE appears as a peak in the HbA<sub>2</sub> window, so the levels of both HbE and HbA<sub>2</sub> cannot be estimated accurately. The percentages given above can vary depending on the analyser in use. The HbE mutation creates an alternate splicing site in the messenger RNA resulting in reduced expression. This, together with the instability of HbE, means there is less of the variant when compared with other β chain mutations phenotypically. There is often associated microcytosis and slightly raised HbA<sub>2</sub>. Where they are measured separately the reference range for HbA<sub>2</sub> is unlikely to apply.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>HbO<sup>Arab</sup>
</h3>

<p>HbO<sup>Arab</sup> appears in different positions on different analysers but frequently appears in close proximity to HbC.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span>Hb Lepore</h3>

<p>Hb Lepore appears in different positions depending on the analyser used. It frequently appears as an oddly shaped elevated HbA<sub>2</sub> peak with values up to 15% and therefore the levels of neither Hb Lepore nor HbA<sub>2</sub> can be estimated accurately. By IEF there is a band in HbG <sup>Philadelphia</sup> position and by alkaline electrophoresis, a band just faster than HbS, but this may be difficult to separate from HbS. The <abbr title="mean cell haemoglobin">MCH</abbr> is usually &lt; 27pg.</p>

<p>The α thalassaemia risk needs to be considered in the light of the family origin of both biological parents – see algorithm for α thalassaemia. The major risk is for Hb Lepore, but the risk of Hb Bart’s hydrops fetalis syndrome must not be overlooked.</p>

<p>There is a risk in the pregnancy associated with the presence of Hb Lepore. Use report format 2 or 8 as appropriate. See <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/sct-screening-handbook-for-antenatal-laboratories/recommended-report-formats">Recommended report formats</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Homozygotes and compound heterozygotes</h2>

<p>Where a single major peak (band) is detected, co-existing β thalassaemia must always be considered. The red cell indices and HbA<sub>2</sub> level need to be reviewed. Remember to allow for the variable nature of HbA<sub>2</sub> levels in the presence of Hb variants. Refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/sct-screening-handbook-for-antenatal-laboratories/antenatal-screening#problems-with-the-measurement-and-interpretation-of-hbasub2sub">Problems with the measurement and interpretation of HbA<sub>2</sub></a>. Once coexisting β thalassaemia has been excluded, the presence of single peak/band is most likely due to homozygosity for a Hb variant. Compound heterozygotes for haemoglobin variants usually have 2 peaks/bands equating to the 2 haemoglobin variants present, but it is possible for these to co-migrate.</p>

<p>The α thalassaemia risk needs to be considered in the light of the family origins of both biological parents. See <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/sct-screening-handbook-for-antenatal-laboratories/antenatal-screening#screening-for-carriers-of-alpha-zero-thalassaemia">section 10 of Antenatal screening</a>.</p>

<p>The risk in these pregnancies is associated with the haemoglobin variant detected and possible co-existing thalassaemia. Use report format 8.

      <p>There are several D haemoglobins, but the screening programme aims to detect HbD<sup>Punjab</sup>. When HbD is detected and it cannot be differentiated, testing of the baby’s biological father will identify pregnancies at potential risk. The HbD will need to be confirmed as HbD<sup>Punjab</sup> if the baby’s biological father is found to have HbS. This will also apply if the biological mother has HbS and the baby’s biological father is found to have HbD. In such cases confirmatory testing must be either DNA or mass spectrometry.&nbsp;<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
