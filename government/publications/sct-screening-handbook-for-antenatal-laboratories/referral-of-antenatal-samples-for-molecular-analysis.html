<p>Most pregnancies at risk of clinically significant β thalassaemia or sickle cell disease are identified initially through the antenatal screening programme. The diagnosis of α thalassaemia is more complicated because DNA analysis is the only way to distinguish between α<sup>+</sup> thalassaemia, non deletional α thalassaemia and α<sup>0</sup> thalassaemia.</p>

<p>Due to the high frequency of α<sup>+</sup> thalassaemia in some populations and the low cost benefit ratio in a screening programme, DNA confirmation is not required for all possible cases of α thalassaemia. The screening programme relies on a strategy for diagnosis of α<sup>0</sup> thalassaemia by combining haematological tests and details of family origin<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Although the antenatal screening programme guidelines are designed to identify most carriers for serious haemoglobinopathies, including thalassaemias, the screening protocols will not identify every pregnancy at risk for every haemoglobinopathy. For example, they are not designed to pick up pregnancies at risk for Haemoglobin H (<abbr title="haemoglobin H">HbH</abbr>) disease or the extremely rare cases of pregnancies where the family origins on the family origin questionnaire <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/family-origin-questionnaire-sickle-cell-and-thalassaemia-screening">(<abbr title="family origin questionnaire">FOQ</abbr>)</a> are low risk for Hb Bart’s hydrops fetalis syndrome.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Testing of the baby’s biological father</h2>

<p>This must be performed according to screening protocols as for maternal phenotype testing. If the baby’s biological father has a phenotype that can interact with the maternal phenotype – see <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1039978/Referral_guidelines_for_antenatal_screening_specimens_final.pdf">Referral guidelines for antenatal screening specimens</a> – then they should be counselled. If prenatal diagnosis (<abbr title="prenatal diagnosis">PND</abbr>) is being considered, refer to the following guidelines for sample requirements and recommendations. Seek advice if there is concern around timeliness of <abbr title="prenatal diagnosis">PND</abbr> testing.</p>

<p>If the baby’s biological father is unavailable for testing or his haemoglobinopathy status is unknown the programme supports the women being offered <abbr title="prenatal diagnosis">PND</abbr>. <abbr title="prenatal diagnosis">PND</abbr> can be undertaken without the DNA of the baby’s biological father, although in some circumstances the diagnosis will not be able to be given with such a high degree of certainty as when the baby’s biological father’s mutation is known.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Referral of blood samples for DNA analysis</h3>

<p>The blood samples must be accompanied by an appropriately completed laboratory referral form (obtained from the referral laboratory) and the laboratory notified before sending samples to the genetic hubs, and ultimately to the commissioned hubs for specialist haematology. Screening results must be included in the referral information. This includes full blood count (<abbr title="full blood count">FBC</abbr>), <abbr title="high performance liquid chromatography">HPLC</abbr> or <abbr title="capillary electrophoresis">CE</abbr> results with the percentage of all haemoglobins detected and any relevant clinical information.</p>

<p>Prior notification for <abbr title="prenatal diagnosis">PND</abbr> samples is essential, as is inclusion of screening results (which must include <abbr title="full blood count">FBC</abbr>, <abbr title="high performance liquid chromatography">HPLC</abbr> or <abbr title="capillary electrophoresis">CE</abbr> results providing the percentage of all haemoglobins detected) in the referral information.</p>

<p>DNA laboratories must take the phenotypic information into account when compiling the final interpretive report.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Haemoglobin variants</h2>

<p>If both biological parents carry HbS, or one carries S and one carries C then blood samples are not required immediately to confirm the mutation by DNA analysis.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="prenatal diagnosis">PND</abbr> is accepted, fresh blood samples from both biological parents should be sent at the same time or before the fetal sample.</p>

<p>If one biological parent carries HbS and the other is a suspected carrier of HbO<sup>Arab</sup>, HbD<sup>Punjab</sup>, HbE, Hb Lepore or a type of β thalassaemia (including δβ thalassaemia) then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>confirmation of the biological parents’ mutations before <abbr title="prenatal diagnosis">PND</abbr> testing is advisable, provided it does not limit options available by affecting timelines</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if <abbr title="prenatal diagnosis">PND</abbr> is accepted, a fresh maternal sample (and paternal sample), if not previously tested as above, should be sent at the same time, or before the fetal sample</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If one biological parent carries HbS and the other is thought to carry deletional hereditary persistance of fetal haemoglobin (<abbr title="hereditary persistance of fetal haemoglobin">HPFH</abbr>) then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="prenatal diagnosis">PND</abbr> is not usually indicated</li>
  <li>it is important to make sure that deletional <abbr title="hereditary persistance of fetal haemoglobin">HPFH</abbr> is differentiated from δβ thalassaemia (these cases may require mutational analysis)</li>
</ul>

<p>Carriers of deletional <abbr title="hereditary persistance of fetal haemoglobin">HPFH</abbr> have a raised HbF level of approximately 20 to 30% and are usually associated with normal red cell indices. It is important to differentiate deletional <abbr title="hereditary persistance of fetal haemoglobin">HPFH</abbr> from δβ thalassaemia. The carrier state for δβ thalassaemia is associated with a reduced mean cell haemoglobin (<abbr title="mean cell haemoglobin">MCH</abbr>) and an HbF level usually in the range of 5 to 15%. Non-deletional <abbr title="hereditary persistance of fetal haemoglobin">HPFH</abbr> usually results in a more modest increase of HbF (less than 10%) in adults and is found in many populations. It is usually associated with normal red cell indices.</p>

<p>If one biological parent carries HbE and the other carries β thalassaemia, Hb Lepore, δβ thalassaemia, or is thought to carry α<sup>0</sup> thalassaemia, then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>confirmation of the biological parents’ mutations before fetal sampling is advisable, provided it does not limit options available by affecting timelines</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if <abbr title="prenatal diagnosis">PND</abbr> is accepted, a fresh maternal sample (and paternal sample), if not previously tested as above, should be sent at the same time or before the fetal sample</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that in people of high-risk family origins for α<sup>0</sup> thalassaemia, there is a possibility of a hidden risk to the fetus of homozygous α<sup>0</sup> thalassaemia, as the carrier state for α<sup>0</sup> thalassaemia can be masked. It is important to determine the α genotype by DNA analysis.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Beta thalassaemias</h2>

<p>If one biological parent carries β thalassaemia, Hb Lepore, δβ thalassaemia and the other carries β thalassaemia, Hb Lepore, δβ thalassaemia, HbO<sup>Arab</sup> or HbS, then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>confirmation of the biological parents’ mutations before fetal sampling is advisable, provided it does not limit options available by affecting timelines</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if <abbr title="prenatal diagnosis">PND</abbr> is accepted, a fresh maternal sample (and paternal sample), if not previously tested as above, should be sent at the same time or before the fetal sample</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that in people of high-risk family origins for α<sup>0</sup> thalassaemia, the carrier state for α<sup>0</sup> thalassaemia may also be present. It is important to determine the α genotype by DNA analysis.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Alpha thalassaemias</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Coinheritance of α thalassaemia with other haemoglobin variants</h3>

<p>Blood samples should not be sent to confirm and identify α thalassaemia, unless both biological parents are of high-risk family origins for α<sup>0</sup> thalassaemia. There is rarely clinical interaction between α thalassaemia and other haemoglobin variants. Unless there are high-risk family origins, the type of α thalassaemia is almost always the α<sup>+</sup> thalassaemia type, which usually poses no serious genetic risk to the fetus.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Alpha plus thalassaemia (α<sup>+</sup> thalassaemia or -α/αα and -α/-α)</h3>

<p>This is found in all ethnic groups, with a high (10 to 30%) carrier frequency in some parts of Africa, in African-Caribbeans and in South and Southeast Asia. Even if both biological parents are carriers, there is no risk to the fetus. Homozygous α<sup>+</sup> thalassaemia (-α/-α) is not a clinically significant disorder with respect to genetic or obstetric complications, but can cause diagnostic confusion with α<sup>0</sup> thalassaemia or iron deficiency.</p>

<p>Heterozygotes (-α/αα) generally have an <abbr title="mean cell haemoglobin">MCH</abbr> of 25 to 28pg and a normal HbA<sub>2</sub> level. Approximately one third of cases will be silent.</p>

<p>Homozygotes (-α/-α) generally have an <abbr title="mean cell haemoglobin">MCH</abbr> below 25pg and some have <abbr title="haemoglobin H">HbH</abbr> inclusions, as do carriers for α<sup>0</sup> thalassaemia (- -/αα).</p>

<p>Individuals may be heterozygous for an α globin gene deletion (carrier genotype: -α/αα) or a rarer point mutation in one alpha globin gene affecting gene expression (carrier genotype denoted: α<sup>T</sup>α/αα if the mutation is on alpha 1, or αα<sup>T</sup>/αα if mutation is on alpha 2), commonly called a non-deletional mutation. There are 2 common deletions (-α<sup>3.7</sup> and –α<sup>4.2</sup>) and a number of less common non-deletional mutations, some of which also produce unstable haemoglobin variants which may be observed as minor peaks in relatively fresh blood samples.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Alpha zero thalassaemia</h2>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>This carries the potential for a clinically significant condition.</p>
</div>

<p>If both biological parents are carriers of α<sup>0</sup> thalassaemia (- -/αα), the pregnancy has a 1 in 4 risk of producing a fetus with Hb Bart’s hydrops fetalis syndrome (- -/- -) and the mother is at risk of obstetric complications, particularly in the third trimester of pregnancy. The mutations leading to Hb Bart’s hydrops fetalis syndrome are almost always alpha globin gene deletions.</p>

<p>If one biological parent carries α<sup>0</sup> thalassaemia (- -/αα) and the other α<sup>+</sup> thalassaemia (either -α/αα or -α/-α), there is a risk of having a child with <abbr title="haemoglobin H">HbH</abbr> disease (- -/-α). This disorder is usually associated with a moderate anaemia but typically requires little clinical intervention. Therefore <abbr title="prenatal diagnosis">PND</abbr> is not usually indicated for <abbr title="haemoglobin H">HbH</abbr> disease unless there are known higher risk mutations that can result in <abbr title="haemoglobin H">HbH</abbr> hydrops such as Hb Constant Spring or Hb Adana.</p>
