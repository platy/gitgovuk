<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction from Amy Rees, Director General of Probation and Wales</h2>

<p>Welcome to the latest bulletin, reporting on key updates and progress across our three probation programmes – reform, workforce and recovery.  You will read more from Jim Barton and Ian Barrow below.</p>

<p>As we move into the Autumn season, we have updated our recovery measures across England and Wales to be able to respond to the introduction of local restrictions. For the Probation System, we remain prepared and ready with delivery and contingency plans in place to enable our regions to adapt quickly to changing circumstances.  It remains key that we balance our recovery with ongoing and changing requirements. Our focus, as always, is on the safety of our people – our staff, those under our supervision and the public.</p>

<p>As well as a high level of activity across our programmes, there is a real impetus across the probation system in general.  You will no doubt have seen or heard the Lord Chancellor recently setting out the government’s proposals for changes to the sentencing and release framework in the new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-smarter-approach-to-sentencing">White Paper</a>. This includes key considerations for probation work and community sentence management so we are thinking about what this will mean for our future design work and we will be closely monitoring how the paper progresses.</p>

<p>We have also had confirmation that Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) has secured planning permission to open a new Approved Premises with 26 bed spaces in the South West of England. We are expecting the new site to be operational from the beginning of the next financial year. Our Approved Premises play a critical role in resettling offenders transitioning from prison to the community and this is part of our plan to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/public-safety-boost-with-more-secure-accommodation-for-prison-leavers">expand capacity and improve security</a> across our current Approved Premises estate, so that an extra 1,700 prison leavers will receive closer supervision each year.</p>

<p>Planning for the winter months and the possible scenarios we may face continues to be a major focus for us.  We have learnt a great deal from the way we have responded to coronavirus</p>

<p>I hope you find this bulletin helpful and we look forward to updating you on the latest developments in the next issue.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Update from Jim Barton, SRO, Probation Reform Programme</h2>

<p>Since our last update, the reform programme has continued adapting and updating our plans, following the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-take-control-of-unpaid-work-to-strengthen-community-sentences">changes to probation</a> announced in June by the Lord Chancellor, Robert Buckland QC MP.  We remain on track for the safe and stable transition to the NPS by June 2021.</p>

<p>Our Design Authority Board has recently agreed to make changes to our future delivery in some important areas, namely court work, sentence management, in-house unpaid work and accredited programmes, the victim contact scheme and resettlement support for those on remand. We published an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/891752/Update_to_the_Draft_Target_Operating_Model_for_Probation_Services_in_England_and_Wales.pdf" rel="external">update document to explain some of the changes made</a> to reflect the impact of Covid-19.  The details of what the announcement document means are incorporated into the on-going design work for our proposed future model for probation services with the final Target Operating Model due to be published in February 2021.</p>

<p>Our Final Business Case, which sets out the required levels of investment needed in the probation services, is being submitted to HM Treasury in November.</p>

<p>Finally, over 200 organisations have now submitted a response to qualify for the Probation Services Dynamic Framework.  Bids have been received in the first competition, for education, training and employment services and on 28 September we launched the second competition, for accommodation services.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Update from Ian Barrow, SRO, Workforce Programme</h2>

<p>I am pleased to update you on the considerable progress that the Workforce Programme has been making, following the launch of our new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/probation-workforce-strategy">Workforce Strategy</a> on July 30.</p>

<p>One of our key priorities, as set out in the Strategy, is to create a more diverse workforce where everyone feels included and supported. As part of this commitment, we have been holding a series of virtual workshops with NPS and CRC staff to help us better understand the current issues and what measures we need to take to achieve this ambition. The results of these workshops will be used as part of the development of the first Probation Workforce Equalities, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy, which we hope to launch early next year. The strategy aims to looking at ways to diversify entry routes, enhance qualification routes, improve staff experience, retention and career opportunities, and create schemes to advance under-represented groups into the probation workforce and senior leadership roles. We have been really excited by the level of interest and engagement so far!</p>

<p>In another key area, targeted at retaining talented people, we have also launched the Probation Service Officer (PSO) Progression Pilot. This Pilot gives experienced and able PSOs the opportunity to progress internally and qualify as a Probation Officer. It compresses the 21-month PQiP course into 13 months and is designed to allow those without a prior degree qualification to access the PQiP. This pilot is initially being trialed across the Eastern England, Kent, Surrey &amp; Sussex, West and East Midlands regions.</p>

<p>These are just two examples of the work that we are doing as we implement our Workforce Strategy. We will continue to work closely with members of staff, probation leaders, trade unions, our key stakeholders and organisations as we develop and implement our plans.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Update from Ian Barrow, SRO, Recovery Programme</h2>

<p>We continue to make good progress in our recovery work and are now moving through Step 3 of our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-probation-roadmap-to-recovery">Recovery Roadmap</a>.  We know that a tremendous amount of work is taking place across the probation system and we are extremely grateful for everyone’s contributions towards this.</p>

<p>We continue to review our exceptional delivery arrangements and are seeing steady increases in face to face appointments taking place; offices re-opening where it is safe to do so and in unpaid work delivery.  We are now also able to re-commence programme delivery and so we are implementing an accredited programmes prioritisation framework.</p>

<p>Our approach to recovery remains that the health and safety of our staff, service users and the public is our primary priority.  We continue to tailor what we do according to local circumstances, and we are supporting our probation regions in making the decisions which are right for them and what is happening in their areas.  Where local lockdowns or additional restrictions are coming into effect, Regional Directors are ensuring they review their plans and make any changes necessary.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Hidden Heroes</h2>

<p>On the 29th September, the Butler Trust in partnership with HMPPS organised Hidden Heroes Day to recognise and celebrate the outstanding work of our staff working in probation, prisons, courts, approved premises and youth justice every single day, particularly during this challenging time.  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hiddenheroes.uk/thank-you-hiddenheroes-day/" rel="external">Read more about #Hidden Heroes Day</a>.</p>
