<p>The HMPPS probation programme has produced this bulletin to update stakeholders on progress made to reform the Probation Service. If you have any questions for the programme please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:strengthening.probation@justice.gov.uk">strengthening.probation@justice.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>
<p>An update from Jim Barton, Senior Responsible Officer for the Probation Programme.</p>

<p>Welcome to the Probation Programme’s new stakeholder bulletin. In these regular updates we will provide information on our progress on reforms to the Probation Service.</p>

<p>Further to the publication of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/802175/strengthening-probation-consultation-response.PDF" rel="external">the new model for probation in May 2019</a>, these bulletins form part of our commitment to transparency as we implement these important reforms. We have already consulted extensively and will continue to work closely with our partners across England and Wales to ensure we get the changes right.</p>

<p>We will tell you about planned stakeholder events, provide updates on the design of future probation services and let you know how we plan our transition to the future model. There will also be updates on commissioning, and news about the changes being introduced in Wales. We’re also keen to hear from you if there’s any additional information that would be useful.</p>

<p>Focusing firstly on design, I would like to thank everyone who took part in the programme’s engagement events during June, July and August. A wide range of partners and providers joined National Probation Service (NPS) staff and Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC) staff at the events, sharing with the programme their ideas on further refining the future model for probation. Topics for discussion included how we get the best from both Innovation Partners (and whether that’s the right name) and Dynamic Framework partners; the relationship between the NPS and service providers; and where best to focus additional investment in the Probation Service.</p>

<p>The programme team is now working through these ideas and considering them all as part of the new design. This is an important piece of work and we expect to publish more information about the new model later this year. Over the past month we have also been working closely with NPS and CRC leaders on the new structure - making sure the new design uses the best from both the NPS and the CRCs’ current operating models.</p>

<p>We know there is concern that further structural change could potentially distract from our shared priorities - to sustain performance and support service users. And at a meeting on 17 July in Birmingham, NPS and CRC senior leaders took joint responsibility for delivering on those two important priorities.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this update. I hope you find it useful.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Service design</h2>
<p>The design of future probation services in the NPS and contracted providers.</p>

<p>Following publication of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/819884/The_Proposed_Future_Model_for_Probation_-_A_Draft_Operating_Blueprint.pdf" rel="external">draft operating blueprint</a> in June, the service design team has engaged stakeholders and the market to make sure that future designs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improve services</li>
  <li>get better outcomes for service users</li>
  <li>build confidence in the system</li>
  <li>support probation staff.</li>
</ul>

<p>In recent weeks there have been 27 market and stakeholder engagement events with more than 1,000 attendees, including probation leaders, practitioners, trade unions and potential providers from the private and voluntary sector. These events have informed our approach to competing services and key design areas such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advice to court and offender management</li>
  <li>accredited programmes and unpaid work</li>
  <li>rehabilitation and resettlement service</li>
  <li>regional outcomes and the innovation fund.</li>
</ul>

<p>There has been a focus on the impact of the design on vulnerable offenders, including those with protected characteristics under the Equalities Act, and the programme recently met the Transition to Adulthood Alliance to consider how it will affect 18 to 25 year-olds. The programme is arranging similar sessions over the next month to consider its effect on women, BAME service users and people with disabilities.</p>

<p>The above work helps us to develop a clearer view of what future probation services should look like. Later this year we will publish a first iteration of the operating model for probation and this will offer more detail.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Commissioning updates</h2>
<p>How we are planning to purchase and manage commissioned or grant funded services.</p>

<p>The programme will procure key services from the private and voluntary sector. These services include unpaid work, accredited programmes, and other resettlement and rehabilitative interventions. The programme will hold two competitions: Innovation Partners to deliver accredited programmes and unpaid work, and Dynamic Framework to secure other rehabilitative and resettlement interventions.</p>

<p>Following discussions at market engagement events, at staff engagement events and with stakeholders and partners, the programme is giving further consideration to the services that will sit in both the Innovation Partner contracts and on the Dynamic Framework. On 8 August we held a webinar to discuss the split between dynamic framework and innovation partner services. Further information is available in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/strengthening-probation-building-confidence-consultation-events-and-materials?utm_source=84f6ef26-7d15-41c7-9da3-e435e14b708f&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=govuk-notifications&amp;utm_content=immediate">published event materials</a>.</p>

<p>Engagement with the market will continue over the summer to inform design requirements and commercial strategies for both Innovation Partners and Dynamic Framework. In the autumn we will start to prepare the market for both competitions. There will be separate events to support each competition.</p>

<p>During market warming, draft procurement and tender documents will be shared with interested bidders before the launch of competition and one-to-one supplier events.</p>

<p>Please go to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/strengthening-probation-building-confidence#events">programme’s event pages</a> to find out about future engagement events. Please note: You may need to access the individual event pages from your personal computer or phone as some organisations may restrict access to the Eventbrite site.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Probation structures</h2>
<p>The design and development of new probation structures.</p>

<p>As part of continuing work to design the new regional probation structure, on 28 June the decision was made to revise the new regional probation structure - creating a stand-alone Greater Manchester region and a North West region made up of Cheshire, Merseyside, Cumbria and Lancashire. This means there will be 12 regions across England and Wales (11 in England and one in Wales).</p>

<p>This change helps to balance the significant caseload volumes in the original North West region and provides a key opportunity to realise the benefits of delivering within the devolved landscape of Greater Manchester, as well as helping to drive local engagement in Cheshire, Merseyside, Lancashire and Cumbria.</p>

<p>Building on this, the programme is now reviewing the NPS operational management structures within each region. This will account for the additional caseload volumes resulting from the plan - integrating responsibilities for the supervision of low, medium and high risk-of-harm offenders under the NPS.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Transition</h2>
<p>How we are changing from current to future services.</p>

<p>While it is too early to provide much detail about the transition of staff to the new model, the programme is committed to supporting everyone through these changes and we will work to minimise concerns.</p>

<p>We have held meetings in every region to gather information about local arrangements as part of the planning process.</p>

<p>If you have questions please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:strengthening.probation@justice.gov.uk">strengthening.probation@justice.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Update from Wales</h2>
<p>An update from HMPPS Wales.</p>

<p>Under Government proposals, responsibility for all offender management in Wales will transfer to the NPS. This model, presented in the 2018 consultation, builds upon the existing structural differences in Wales, including the devolved responsibilities of the Welsh Government and the strong partnership arrangements that are in place.</p>

<p>The arrangements for HMPPS in Wales are currently different to those in England. The existing structure of the Directorate combines prison and probation services under the same management line, and the Wales CRC is co-terminus with the existing NPS Wales division. This unique situation creates an opportunity to transfer responsibility for all offender management into the NPS earlier than in England, and the programme aims to do this by the end of this year.</p>

<p>But in both England and Wales the timeline for future commissioning of services will be the same. Kent, Surrey, Sussex (KSS) CRC will retain responsibility for interventions in Wales until the end of current CRC contracts - expected in spring 2021.</p>

<p>HMPPS in Wales and KSS CRC have been working together – continuing to develop the new service design and working closely on plans to transition offender management into the NPS.</p>

<p>Over the summer Local Delivery Units (LDUs) and CRC Heads have delivered a series of briefings with staff across all divisions, outlining plans for the transition. They have given staff the opportunity to put their questions directly to the probation changes team and to senior leaders.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Professional recognition</h2>
<p>What we will support the probation workforce and related professionals.</p>

<p>In April 2019, alongside announcements about wider reforms to the probation system, a commitment was made to increase the professional recognition of those working across probation services. The Probation Professional Recognition Programme (PPRP) has been created to deliver this ambition. The programme draws on experience across project delivery, HR, training and development as well as from those with the knowledge and experience of working in probation. The creation of this blended team means that the right people with the right skill-set are in place at all levels to enable successful delivery. The programme is working closely with other reform programmes across HMPPS and across the probation landscape to ensure alignment. If you have any questions please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ProbationProfessionalRecognitionProgramme@justice.gov.uk">ProbationProfessionalRecognitionProgramme@justice.gov.uk</a></p>
