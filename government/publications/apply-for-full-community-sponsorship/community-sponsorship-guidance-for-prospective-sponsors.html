<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Thank you for your interest in community sponsorship; one of the most direct ways that local communities can provide support to vulnerable people fleeing conflict.</p>

<p>The UK has a long history of supporting refugees in need of protection. Our resettlement schemes have provided safe and legal routes for tens of thousands of people to start new lives in the UK. The UK welcomes refugees through the global UK Resettlement Scheme (UKRS), the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) as well as through the Community Sponsorship and Mandate Resettlement Schemes.</p>

<p>Community sponsorship is a way for local communities, civil society organisations, charities, and faith groups to be directly involved in helping refugees settle in the UK. Community sponsors provide emotional and practical support to empower families to rebuild their lives in safety, and to become self-sufficient members of their new community. Being a sponsor also benefits the local community through enabling the generosity of local people and creating new bonds between those involved.</p>

<p>Many organisations and individuals are already actively involved in supporting refugees to resettle in the UK. This document sets out a framework that enables community groups to take the lead role in resettling refugee families. It explains how the process will work, the criteria prospective sponsors must meet, and how to apply.</p>

<p>There is also an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-full-community-sponsorship">application form</a> and further information available including <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1044339/Application_Form_Guidance2.pdf" rel="external">application guidance notes</a>, guidance for local authorities in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-full-community-sponsorship/community-sponsorship-guidance-for-local-authorities">English</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-full-community-sponsorship/community-sponsorship-guidance-for-local-authorities-welsh">Welsh</a>, and a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1061712/CS_Agreement_Version_5.0.pdf" rel="external">sample sponsor agreement</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to contact the Home Office about the Community Sponsorship Scheme, please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:communitysponsorship@homeoffice.gov.uk">communitysponsorship@homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Additional support and guidance are available from <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.resetuk.org/" rel="external">Reset Communities and Refugees</a>, the capacity building organisation for community sponsorship.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The UK operates four resettlement schemes: the UK Resettlement Scheme (UKRS), Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS), Community Sponsorship Scheme, and Mandate Resettlement Scheme.</p>

<p>Our resettlement schemes play a key role in the global response to humanitarian crises: saving lives and offering stability to refugees most in need of protection. We work closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the global refugee agency, to identify those living in formal refugee camps, informal settlements and host communities who would benefit most from resettlement to the UK.</p>

<p>Local authorities, community sponsorship groups and the voluntary sector play a vital role in helping those arriving here to feel welcome and to adjust to a new life in the UK.</p>

<h2>What is community sponsorship?</h2>

<p>Community sponsorship enables community groups to directly welcome and support a resettled family into their local community. It is designed and delivered in partnership with local communities and promotes positive resettlement outcomes, both for the resettled families and for those who support them.</p>

<p>Refugees resettled through the Community Sponsorship Scheme complement those resettled to local authorities through the UKRS, underlining the critical role that communities can play in the global response to humanitarian crises.</p>

<h2>What does a community sponsor do?</h2>

<p>Community sponsorship is a significant undertaking and you should not underestimate the commitment and resilience the people involved will need to show as you welcome a refugee family to the UK.</p>

<p>As a community sponsor, you will be allocated a family fleeing conflict, and it will be your responsibility to support the resettled family from the moment of arrival in the UK. This will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meeting the family at the airport</li>
  <li>providing a warm welcome and cultural orientation</li>
  <li>providing housing</li>
  <li>supporting access to medical and social services</li>
  <li>supporting access to English language tuition</li>
  <li>supporting registration with local Job Centre Plus and assistance with navigating social welfare provision</li>
  <li>support towards employment and self-sufficiency</li>
</ul>

<p>Your formal responsibility to support the resettled family will last for one year, with the exception of housing, for which the responsibility lasts for 2 years. You may choose to provide support beyond this, according to the needs of the resettled family. Further details on the minimum requirements for supporting a resettled family can be found in Annex A.</p>

<h2>What is a resettled family?</h2>

<p>Resettled families are people in need of protection, who have fled conflict or persecution in their home country and who need to be resettled from their host country to the UK. The UK prioritises resettlement for those who cannot be supported effectively in their region of origin. We work closely with UNHCR to identify the people that they deem in need of resettlement from their registered population from around the globe.</p>

<p>Each resettled family will be different, but they will all have suffered the loss of their home. Many will have lost loved ones, friends and family, and witnessed the horrors of war. Some may have specific medical needs or disabilities.</p>

<p>It is important to recognise that not all resettled families will initially be happy to have come to the UK. The relief at arriving in a safe place will be countered by grief over what has been left behind and possibly survivors’ guilt as well.</p>

<p>This is where community sponsors can help: supporting a resettled family by making them feel welcome in the UK, helping them to adjust and make a new life for themselves. The support of a community sponsor will have a crucial impact on the family’s future happiness and wellbeing.</p>

<p>Upon arrival, the resettled family will be granted indefinite leave to remain and are entitled to the same rights as any person settled in the UK.</p>

<h2>Community sponsorship case studies</h2>

<p>These case studies illustrate the experiences of two different families resettled to the UK through community sponsorship. The case studies are representative of actual community sponsorship experiences, but details have been changed to respect the privacy of resettled families. Every resettled family is different as is every community sponsorship experience.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Case study 1</h3>

<p>A Syrian family made up of a husband and wife, two adult sons and one younger daughter were resettled in a city in the UK. The family witnessed killings and serious injuries and the two sons were considered draft evaders, as they were wanted for military conscription. This left the family living in fear of the prospect of returning to Syria and risking detention, or the forceful conscription of the sons into the Syrian army.</p>

<p>When the family arrived in the UK, they spoke no English, however within a month the sons both gained a good understanding of the language. Initially, the father’s progress was slower than that of other family members, but all made great improvements and no longer required the constant service of an interpreter after 6 months.</p>

<p>After the first few months, family tensions began to surface which threatened their stability. The community sponsorship group decided to speak to the family openly, explaining that the situation was counter-productive to their resettlement. They supported the family by arranging mediation sessions with trained professionals, which focused on finding solutions to the causes of their tension, some of which stemmed from the frustration of adjusting to life in the UK, and an identified need to address the trauma family members had experienced in Syria. While there was some stigma associated with accessing mental health support, the sponsor group was able to help gain support for family members who needed it.</p>

<p>After almost a year in the UK, the father found work in a cafe for a short period of time where he made many friends. The eldest son found employment in the same cafe, whilst working towards applying for a place at university. The second oldest son works for a restaurant chain, where he has been identified by senior management as a “rising star” and will be working in their head office while they support him to complete his GCSE examinations. The mother is working with a confectionary company, developing her business skills and English language. As part of the programme, she sells sweets in a market on Sundays. The daughter is doing well in school and has made many friends.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Case study 2</h3>

<p>A Syrian family made up of a wife, and two young daughters were resettled to a city in the UK. Prior to their arrival in the UK, the whole family fled to Iraq to escape the crisis in Syria, once in Iraq the husband returned to Syria and the wife has not heard from him since, he has been presumed dead. The wife and her daughters remained in Iraq. Whilst living in Iraq, the family were at risk of abuse and exploitation due to them living in an all-female household.</p>

<p>Now in the UK, the family settled into life in the local area quickly and have done their utmost to integrate into the community. Even with the mother’s limited English language skills, she has made friends with a neighbour who lives next door. She has also been able to attend her job centre appointments independently. The family are able to budget and manage their own accounts, although the benefit cap does not allow much for extra treats.</p>

<p>Although the family loved the house they were provided with, the bathroom was causing the mother some distress as it was agreed the bathroom wasn’t suitable for a young family. After communicating this, the sponsor group helped to make the necessary changes to the bathroom and this is now more suited to the family’s needs.</p>

<p>The mother is happy with the opportunities her daughters are receiving in the UK. The youngest daughter is very happy in school and is up by 7am to get ready. The eldest daughter is finding it more difficult as she is having to repeat her school year. She has found it hard seeing the friends she made last year in different classes. It can be very hard to adjust when you are a teenager and new situations are going to take some time to get used to. She loves to study and learn things and would like to work in medicine when she leaves school.</p>

<p>The family are very keen to become self-sufficient and the mother continues to want the best for herself and her daughters.</p>
</div>

<h2>Can anyone be a community sponsor?</h2>

<p>Supporting a resettled family is a significant responsibility. The Home Office will approve every sponsor and a separate approval is required for each resettled family that a group sponsors. The approval process is designed to establish that the prospective sponsor:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has sufficient resources (housing, financial and personnel) to support a resettled family</li>
  <li>works within a framework with clear responsibilities and structures in place</li>
  <li>has a credible plan for supporting that family, backed by relevant experience</li>
  <li>does not present a risk to those they support</li>
</ul>

<p>You can apply to be approved as a sponsor using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-full-community-sponsorship">application form</a>. The Home Office will assess your suitability to be a community sponsor, according to a set of criteria, set out below.</p>

<h2>What training and support is available?</h2>

<p>The Home Office funds an organisation called <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.resetuk.org/" rel="external">Reset</a> to provide training and support to both prospective and approved community sponsor groups.</p>

<p>Reset provides training for all sponsor groups in the UK. This training supports sponsor groups with preparing for the arrival of a resettled family and empowering families on their integration journey after their arrival.</p>

<p>They also provides advice, guidance and support to sponsor groups throughout the entire journey of community sponsorship, from application through to supporting a resettled family once they have arrived. They also share good practice and can help groups to work in partnership with relevant organisations.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h2>Summary of the application process</h2>

<p>1. Community group forms, finds or creates a lead sponsor organisation</p>

<p>2. Group starts to fundraise, agree policies and prepares an application</p>

<p>3. Local authority gives consent to a prospective sponsor to operate as a community sponsor in their area</p>

<p>4. Prospective lead sponsor submits application for approval as a community sponsor</p>

<p>5. Due diligence checks are completed on the lead sponsor and organisation pre-approval visit is arranged</p>

<p>6. Application considered against criteria for approval</p>

<p>7. Approval granted</p>

<p>8. Agreement with sponsor signed</p>

<p>9. Matching of a refugee family to the group</p>

<p>10. Sponsor and local authority consider and jointly agree proposed family</p>

<p>11. Resettled family arrives (typically 6-12 weeks after allocation is agreed)</p>

<p>12. Monitoring of sponsor delivery and resettled family progress</p>
</div>

<h2>Types of approval</h2>

<p>Your group will receive full approval and a resettled family will be matched to you when you have demonstrated that you have met all of the criteria set out below.</p>

<p>Recognising that some groups may need time to secure the necessary financial resources, and in order to minimise the need to hold housing empty, you may also apply to receive approval in principle with conditions.</p>

<p>This allows your application to be approved against most of the criteria, giving your group certainty that, if you can meet the financial resources and housing criteria at the end of the process, you will receive full approval.</p>

<p>Note, however, if more than 6 months have passed or circumstances have changed, you will be asked to submit updated documents.</p>

<h2>What criteria must a community sponsor meet?</h2>

<h3>Organisation status and lead sponsor</h3>

<p>Your organisation must have status as either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a charity, registered with the Charities Commission in England and Wales, the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR) in Scotland, or the Charities Commission for Northern Ireland</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an individual or body falling within section 10(2)(a) of the Charities Act 2011</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a Community Interest Company, registered with Companies House</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There must be a named individual with responsibility for the sponsorship arrangement, the ‘lead sponsor’. The lead sponsor should hold a permanent and senior position within the organisation.</p>

<p>Typically, they will be a senior member of staff or Trustee of the charity or community interest company or have been appointed to the role of lead sponsor on behalf of a senior person in the organisation.</p>

<p>There must be a clear line of accountability between the lead sponsor and the personnel delivering the resettlement plan.</p>

<h3>Financial resources</h3>

<p>The amount community sponsors need to raise can vary significantly, depending on the in-kind support they are able to draw on, but the amount can typically range from around £5,000 to £20,000.</p>

<p>As part of your application, you will be asked to confirm you have available funding of at least £9,000.00. We recommend you include a forecast budget of anticipated expenditure, taking into account the social welfare income the family might receive and the expected cost of accommodation.</p>

<p>Community sponsor groups will be entitled to claim void rental costs, capped at 8 weeks’ local housing allowance rate for 3-bedroom properties and smaller, and 12 weeks’ local housing allowance rate for over 4 bedroom properties.</p>

<p>Community sponsor groups will be able to make a claim after the resettled family has arrived. Once a family has arrived, the Community Sponsorship Team will provide details about how to make a claim.</p>

<h3>Housing</h3>

<p>You must be able to demonstrate that you have suitable and sustainable accommodation for a resettled family, and that it will be available for them to use for a minimum of two years.</p>

<p>If you do not have accommodation immediately available but are able to demonstrate that you will be able to obtain appropriate accommodation, then we may approve your application in principle, with the condition that suitable accommodation is secured before final approval.</p>

<p>The cost of the accommodation must be affordable, taking into account the social welfare income the family will receive. If this is not the case, you must demonstrate how you will meet the additional cost.</p>

<p>You are required to establish a relationship with the local police. Upon receipt of the address of the property and local police contact details from yourself, the Home Office will arrange for the police consultation form to be completed.</p>

<p>You are required to provide written confirmation that you have given the local authority the opportunity to inspect your property. Further details on housing requirements can be found in the statement of requirements at Annex A.</p>

<p>Community sponsor groups will be entitled to claim void rental costs, capped at 8 weeks’ local housing allowance rate for 3-bedroom properties and smaller, and 12 weeks’ local housing allowance rate for over 4 bedroom properties.</p>

<p>Community sponsor groups will be able to make a claim after the resettled family has arrived. Once a family has arrived, the Community Sponsorship Team will provide details about how to make a claim.</p>

<h3>Local authority consent</h3>

<p>Many local authorities in the UK have resettled refugees, and they also play an important role in community sponsorship. Reset have a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://resetuk.org/toolkits/for-local-authorities" rel="external">community sponsorship toolkit for local authorities</a> that can be used.</p>

<p>Local authorities need to consent to each community sponsorship arrangement in their area. This is because local authorities will need to consider the local impacts of the resettlement of additional families to their area, including on local services. Local authorities will also want to satisfy themselves that they have no objection to your sponsor group supporting a resettled family.</p>

<p>You must obtain written evidence from the local authority (the format to be determined by the local authority area, which may differ, for example between unitary and two-tier authorities) that they consent to your group submitting an application to the Home Office. It is open to the local authority to decide on how consent will be considered locally.</p>

<p>Some grounds on which a local authority might object are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>insufficient capacity to provide the required local services in the proposed housing area (e.g., through a lack of school places)</li>
  <li>concerns about community tensions in the proposed housing area</li>
  <li>where there are strong reasons to believe that a community sponsor is not suitable to undertake the resettlement of vulnerable adults and children</li>
</ul>

<p>The regional Strategic Migration Partnership (contact details at Annex B) will be able to advise you on the appropriate person to consult within the local authority.</p>

<p>You will need to approach your local authority and ask them to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>put you in contact with the local authority safeguarding team (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Safeguarding-policy">safeguarding policy</a>)</li>
  <li>consider inspecting your proposed accommodation</li>
  <li>support your engagement with relevant partners, such as the police, job centres, Prevent contacts</li>
  <li>support you through the schools’ admissions process</li>
</ul>

<p>After your group has been approved as a community sponsor, your local authority must also agree to the allocated family to be resettled (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#What-happens-after-approval">what happens after approval</a>).</p>

<h3>Plan for resettlement</h3>

<p>In your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-full-community-sponsorship">application form</a> you are asked to complete a detailed and credible resettlement plan to illustrate how you will deliver effective resettlement support in accordance with the statement of requirements (at Annex A). You must demonstrate your group’s capacity and capability to resettle a refugee family.</p>

<p>An <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1044339/Application_Form_Guidance2.pdf" rel="external">application guidance document</a> is also available and further advice can be found on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://training-resetuk.org/toolkit/making-an-application/writing-your-application" rel="external">Reset</a>.</p>

<h3>Safeguarding policy</h3>
<p>You must have a robust safeguarding policy and procedures in place.</p>

<p>The policy should cover how you will ensure the suitability and good character of the people providing support to a resettled family. This should include consideration of whether <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/disclosure-barring-service-check">Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks</a> are appropriate.</p>

<p>The policy must evidence appropriate reporting and escalation procedures within your organisation to ensure safeguarding concerns are dealt with appropriately.</p>

<p>A template to support you in developing your safeguarding policy can be found within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1044339/Application_Form_Guidance2.pdf" rel="external">application guidance document</a>. You must submit confirmation that you have sent your safeguarding policy to the local authority safeguarding team, to give them an opportunity to comment on your policy.</p>

<h3>Complaints policy</h3>

<p>You must compose a complaints policy, which is made available to the resettled family, whereby they can escalate concerns about the support they receive or about individuals providing that support. A template to support you in developing your complaints policy can be found within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1044339/Application_Form_Guidance2.pdf" rel="external">application guidance document</a>.</p>

<h3>Training</h3>

<p>Before you can be matched with a resettled family you will be required to confirm that you have completed the relevant training on community sponsorship, delivered by Reset. This will help you prepare for welcoming resettled families and empowering them to settle into their new communities.</p>

<p>The programme of training will include areas such as cultural awareness, safeguarding issues when working with resettled families, empowerment and arrival planning.</p>

<h2>How will the Home Office process applications for approval as a community sponsor?</h2>

<p>The Home Office will assess the evidence you provide in your application. We will also carry out security and criminal records checks and may arrange a meeting with you to assess your application in more detail. Details of these checks can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-full-community-sponsorship">application form</a>.</p>

<h3>Checks on personnel</h3>

<p>We will conduct checks on your organisation and the named lead sponsor. This includes checks against our records and other third parties such as the Police National Computer, or its equivalent in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>We may also conduct checks on individual members of your organisation, or the personnel listed in your application form. Where this is the case, you will be notified in writing and the individuals’ permission will be sought.</p>

<p>We may make these checks when considering your application and may repeat them at any time.</p>

<p>If we consider that your organisation or the lead sponsor are not fit and proper to assume the responsibility of resettling a vulnerable family, we may refuse your application or revoke your approval.</p>

<p>Reasons for this include but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the provision of false or inaccurate information</li>
  <li>vocal or active opposition to fundamental UK values (or tolerance of such opposition) including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, universal human rights, gender equality, equality of opportunity, mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs and freedom of speech</li>
  <li>criminal convictions</li>
  <li>immigration offences</li>
  <li>other illegal activity</li>
</ul>

<p>It is the responsibility of the named lead sponsor to ensure that any individual and collaborating organisations that will be involved in supporting a resettled family are suitable to do so, taking into account any convictions, activities, or opposition to UK values, which might call into question an individual’s or organisation’s appropriateness and suitability to deliver any aspect of community sponsorship.</p>

<p>If we consider that any individual or collaborating organisation that plans to be involved in the support of a resettled family is not fit and proper, we may require that you withdraw their involvement or we may refuse your application or revoke your approval.</p>

<h3>Pre-approval meetings</h3>

<p>We will arrange a meeting with you before a decision on your application is made. You will be given advance notice of the meeting.</p>

<p>A meeting will allow a more detailed assessment of your application and provides you with an opportunity to ask any questions that you may have.</p>

<p>We will invite representatives from your local authority to attend the meeting as well. In particular, we may check that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the information you provided is accurate</li>
  <li>you are able to support a resettled family, demonstrated through the answering of scenario-based questions</li>
  <li>your safeguarding policies and procedures are appropriate</li>
  <li>you have undertaken the necessary planning and preparation in readiness for a family arriving</li>
</ul>

<h3>Successful application</h3>

<p>If you meet all of our criteria, we will approve your application. Under certain circumstances, we may approve your application in principle subject to your group fulfilling any outstanding criteria, such as demonstrating that your group has secured suitable and sustainable accommodation or providing evidence that your group has adequate funding.</p>

<p>If your organisation has not been allocated a resettled family within six months of being approved, we will review your application. At this point you may be asked to submit updated documents to confirm the information provided is still accurate.</p>

<h3>Unsuccessful application</h3>

<p>If you do not meet all of the criteria for sponsorship, as set out above, then your application will be refused.</p>

<p>The information you provide will be taken into account in considering your application, as will any inconsistencies arising from that information and the information we obtain from our checks. As a result, your application may be refused if you fail to provide accurate information.</p>

<p>You will receive notification should your application be refused. There is no right of appeal.</p>

<p>A new application will not be considered until 180 days have passed since a decision was made to refuse your application. If a new application is made, there is no guarantee that this new application will be successful.</p>

<h2>What happens after approval?</h2>

<h3>Agreement</h3>

<p>Your lead sponsor will sign a formal agreement with the Home Office, setting out your responsibilities and those of the Home Office. You should read this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1061712/CS_Agreement_Version_5.0.pdf" rel="external">agreement</a> in full before submitting an application.</p>

<h3>Allocating a family for resettlement</h3>

<p>The Home Office will ensure that security checks are carried out on all individuals to be resettled in the UK. We will arrange for the resettled family’s visa and travel to the UK, and delivery of their biometric residence permit shortly after arrival.</p>

<p>We will work with the sponsor and local authority to agree the allocation of a suitable family. The Home Office will identify and propose a suitable family for resettlement. The community sponsor and the local authority will be expected to confirm that the proposed family can be accommodated, usually within five working days of receiving the referral. You will be provided with background information about the family and relevant medical documents to support your preparations.</p>

<p>Once we have successfully allocated a family to a community sponsor group, that family will be notified. Flights will then be arranged, with their arrival planned for approximately six to twelve weeks after the family has been notified. The date of arrival will be agreed with the community sponsor.</p>

<h3>Arrival</h3>

<p>You will make arrangements to meet the resettled family at the airport and commence delivery of your resettlement plan.</p>

<h2>What is the sponsor’s obligations following approval?</h2>

<h3>Record keeping and privacy</h3>

<p>You must keep records and copies of the resettled family’s key documents, including their UNHCR registration, entry clearance document, their biometric residence permit, national insurance number and NHS number. You must ensure that data is held securely, in accordance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018.</p>

<p>Maintaining the privacy of the resettled family is important and you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not issue anything that identifies the resettled family externally as refugees</li>
  <li>get informed consent from the resettled family in relation to any proposed media exposure, requests or interest</li>
</ul>

<h3>Post-arrival support and evaluation</h3>

<p>You will be required to provide relevant information to the Home Office to support the monitoring and evaluation of your sponsorship arrangement and the wider sponsorship scheme. This is likely to include evidence of the delivery of your resettlement plan, as well as outcomes for the resettled family.</p>

<p>Reset, with the support of the Home Office, will arrange post-arrival support meetings with you after a resettled family has arrived. This will either be an in-person visit or by digital communications and will support monitoring and evaluation of your sponsorship arrangement.</p>

<p>The post arrival meetings will be arranged with you and your Lead Sponsor, when we will meet with your sponsor group, and separately with the resettled family.</p>

<h3>Use of information</h3>

<p>We may use the information that you provide to us when you apply for permission to sponsor, or at any time throughout the period of your sponsorship agreement, in accordance with the Home Office Personal Information Charter.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances, details may be passed to other government departments and agencies, local authorities and fraud prevention agencies (such as HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), Department for Work and Pensions and Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance System (CIFAS) for immigration purposes, the prevention of fraud and criminality and/or to help them carry out their functions.</p>

<p>These bodies may provide the Home Office with information about you and your employees. Understanding when information may be passed to other bodies and how that may be used can be found through our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office/about/personal-information-charter">personal information charter</a>.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/personal-information-use-in-borders-immigration-and-citizenship">Borders, Immigration and Citizenship privacy information notice</a> reflects your rights under data protection legislation including the General Data Protection Regulation and lets you know how the Home Office looks after and uses your personal information within the borders, immigration and citizenship system. It also explains how you can request a copy of your information.</p>
