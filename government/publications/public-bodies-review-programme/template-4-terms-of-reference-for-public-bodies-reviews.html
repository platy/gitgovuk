<h2>How to use this document</h2>

<p>This template is intended to provide a suggested format and content for a Public Body review terms of reference (ToR).</p>

<p>Review Teams are not obliged to use this template, and should use it where helpful. This template is not intended to be fixed in both format and content. Review Teams should use it flexibly in applying it to the review in question. The template should be customised to meet the needs of the particular review.</p>

<h2>How to draw up a terms of reference</h2>

<p>The Review Team should draw up the terms of reference in adherence with the overall guidance for the reviews programme. More information regarding the reviews process and the role of the terms of reference can be found in Chapter 8 of the guidance.</p>

<p>Please refer to paragraphs 54-60 in the guidance for advice on drawing up the ToR if the body being reviewed is a Public Sector Research Establishment (PSRE) or Scientific Advisory Council.</p>

<h4>Scope and Purpose of the Review</h4>

    <p>Details of any other reporting or decision-making lines relevant and specific to this review, for example, a departmental non-executive director (NED).</p>

<p>Further information on the establishment of a challenge panel can be found at paragraphs 154-158 of the guidance.</p>

This should also include milestones where ministerial agreement needs to be sought, and other relevant milestones. This should take into account external communications arrangements.</p>

<p>Ministers will determine the final timing and manner of publication of the review and the Government’s decisions on the review.</p>
