<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>The Public Bodies Reviews Programme is underpinned by a set of quadrants which outline the expectations for departments and their Arm’s Length Bodies (ALBs) and some indicators of good practice. These requirements can also be used to inform the focus and scope of a review of an ALB. They can also be used for public bodies that are not classified as ALBs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The requirements have been developed as part of a suite of tools and guidance for conducting these reviews. It is expected that, when referring to these requirements for the purpose of an ALB, Review Teams and Lead Reviewers will do so with reference to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jCtdSDZcv5wPpQJzETzA38f65y54lWLPtUUpTmBOmDA/edit" rel="external">Public Bodies Reviews Programme Guidance</a>.</p>

<p>These requirements are a baseline, and some indicators of good practice, that outline the fundamental expectations of ALBs and their sponsor departments. These provide a benchmark for performance to ensure that ALBs/public bodies are operating in accordance with the existing government standards, guidance and legal requirements that are set out in various codes, guidance and laws.</p>

<h3>How to use</h3>

<p><strong>This document is primarily intended for Lead Reviewers to use during an in-depth review. It is recognised that Lead Reviewers will want to use the whole or parts of this document based on the elements they wish to explore during their in-depth review and the type of body they are reviewing. </strong></p>

<p>This document does not replace the standards, requirements and guidance from which much of its content is drawn. Readers should refer to the source documents for full context and information. Nor do any of the expectations set out in this document overwrite the need for public bodies and departments to follow the law.</p>

<p>There is no ‘one size fits all’ for these requirements. The ‘<strong>comply or explain</strong>’ principle applies here.</p>

<p>There will be circumstances where some requirements will not apply to an ALB/public body and/or its board or sponsor department, these might include proportionality, cost effectiveness or the specific legal status and/or functions of the ALB.</p>

<p>The sponsoring department and its ALB/public body should be confident in ‘explaining’ where it believes it, or its ALB/public body, does not need to ‘comply’.</p>

<p>The Cabinet Office will continue to evolve this document in the coming years to ensure we learn lessons from what is, and is not working.</p>

<p>Supporting guidance<br> These requirements are drawn from the following sources:</p>

<p>The Cabinet Office will publish a Sponsorship Code of Good Practice in 2022.</p>

<h3>Terminology</h3>

<p><strong>Principle:</strong> The state that the ALB should achieve if requirements and best practice is met.</p>

<p><strong>Theme:</strong> The specific areas that should be addressed to meet each requirement’s principle. This also makes clear the minimum expectation that the ALB and department should achieve in each area.</p>

<p><strong>Indicators:</strong> The reference points used in the review to indicate whether the expectations, and ultimately the principles are being reached. These indicators are expressed using the following terminology:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Shall:</strong> denotes a requirement: a mandatory element.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Should:</strong> denotes a recommendation: an advisory element, or outline good practice.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Efficacy</h2>

<h3>Efficacy requirements</h3>

<p>These requirements will set out expectations to ensure the ALB meets the conditions to be an ALB, with a clear purpose, in the correct delivery model and the expectations that the ALB performs effectively and delivers services that meet the needs of citizens.</p>

<p><strong>The requirements can be used for the following purposes:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>to assure that the ALB has a clear mandate and remains relevant;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to consider the current delivery model of the ALB and its effectiveness; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to ensure that the ALB is aligned with the strategic priorities of the Department and wider government objectives.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>

<p>The requirements have been organised under four key thematic areas (and sub-themes) and numbered. These are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Function</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Form</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Outcome for citizens</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Performance</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The ALB has a clear purpose and appropriate delivery model to deliver effective outcomes for citizens.</p>

<h3>Theme 1: function of ALB</h3>

<p>The sponsor department is assured that the ALB has a clear mandate, is up to date and remains relevant.</p>

<h4>Indicators</h4>

<p>All ALBs shall continue to meet one of the government’s ‘Three Tests’:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>i. Is this a technical function, which needs external expertise to deliver?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ii. Is this a function which needs to be, and be seen to be, delivered with political impartiality?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>iii. Is this a function that needs to be delivered independently of ministers to establish facts and/or figures with integrity?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The department can evidence that they have considered the Three Tests.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>The sponsor department shall demonstrate that there is a clear rationale as to why the function of the ALB needs to continue:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The ALB has a clear purpose, strategy and values and these should be set out in the Framework Document, Corporate and Business Plans and other strategy documents.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The impact of COVID19 and EU exit has been considered and where any changes to the ALBs mandate/purpose is clearly articulated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The function of the ALB contributes to economic growth (if applicable).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The function of the ALB is a justifiable use of taxpayers’ money.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ALB contributes to the core business of the sponsor department:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>There is a clear link between the ALBs objectives and the sponsor department objectives. These are accessible and clear.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ALB contributes to wider government policy objectives:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Aligned with the Prime Minister’s priorities, manifesto commitments or other priorities, including the government’s commitment to net zero by 2050.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Aligned to departmental priority outcomes.</p>
      </li>

        <p>Aligned to Outcome Delivery Plans.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Governance</h2>

<h3>Governance requirements</h3>

<p>These requirements set out the expectations of governance for Arm’s-Length Bodies (ALBs) boards, chairs and non-executives. These requirements apply to the boards of ALBs, their chair and non-executive members (NEDs). We have tried to differentiate where they apply to the board as a whole, the chair and/or the NEDs individually.</p>

<p>The requirements can be used for the following purposes:<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To support a governance review of an ALB, either as a formal or informal review.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To support a board effectiveness review.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To identify areas where the ALB’s governance can be improved as part of a ‘health check’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A reference document setting out key requirements for ALB boards and non-executives.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>The requirements have been organised under six key thematic areas (and sub-themes) and numbered. These are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Delivering wider government objectives;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Purpose, leadership and effectiveness;</p>

  <li>
    <p>Effective financial and risk management and internal control; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transparency.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Accountability</h2>

<h3>Accountability requirements</h3>

<p>These requirements will set out expectations on accountability, relationships between departments and ALBs, and the support and challenge offered to ALBs via the critical ‘sponsoring’ relationship departments have with their ALB.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The requirements can be used for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To support a review on the accountability requirements of an ALB, either as a formal or informal review.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To identify areas where the ALB’s relationship and accountabilities with its sponsor department can be improved.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A reference document setting out key requirements and indicators for accountability.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>The requirements have been organised under four key thematic areas (and sub-themes) and numbered, these are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Effective sponsorship;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accountability of ALB to the department;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accountability of ALB to Parliament; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accountability of ALB to other governmental functions.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Ministers are ultimately accountable to Parliament for their ALBs and therefore their ALBs, while ‘at arm’s length’, are usually ultimately accountable to their ministers. Sponsors ensure that clear accountability arrangements are in place between the ALB and the department. There are different types of accountabilities that will be considered within these requirements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Overarching – ministerial</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Operational – normally the AO/CEO and chair</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Financial and Risk – AO and PAO</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Theme 1: effective sponsorship</h3>

<p>Sponsor team demonstrates appropriate links to the ALB that can facilitate the delivery of the government’s objectives.</p>

<h4>Indicators</h4>

<p>The relationship between the sponsor department and ALB shall be conducted in line with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/partnerships-with-arms-length-bodies-code-of-good-practice">the Partnership code of practice</a> and meets the requirements of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/managing-public-money">Managing Public Money</a>. Please see the Governance requirements which provide the governance structures and processes that ensure the sponsored body maintains high standards of probity in the management of public funds.</p>

<p>While the Principal Accounting Officer (PAO) retains accountability for the use of public funds, they will be supported by a ‘sponsor team’, led by a ‘senior sponsor’ who is usually a Senior Civil Servant (SCS).</p>

<p>The Departmental sponsor team shall:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Establish clear accountabilities and clarity of expectation for both individuals and organisations, in terms of roles and responsibilities and in how they will deal with each other that is open, honest, supportive and challenging.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set clear, appropriate and proportionate sponsoring arrangements through their Framework Document, which is adhered to by both parties, and updated regularly (at least every three years and when there is a significant change).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure that there is a clear statement of the ALB’s purpose and objectives (likely set out within the Framework Document), that is agreed by the ALB, as well as HMT where needed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have a senior sponsor who is responsible for managing the relationship with an ALB on behalf of the minister and the AO.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure there is a clear articulation of financial and operational freedoms and delegations to the ALB.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure that day-to-day management is delegated to a supporting sponsor, sponsor team or equivalent (that is, secretariat).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidence that regular and formal accountability meetings are in place between the department and the ALB which are attended by the ALB’s CEO and senior sponsor and which allow adequate discussion of progress, risks, and financial performance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write an annual letter to the ALB chair (‘a chair’s letter’), setting out the department’s shorter-term priorities and expectations for the ALB chair and their organisation in regard to good governance and strategic objectives. Departments may wish to comply or explain against this requirement if they believe it is not proportionate or appropriate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure that where the department has separated its sponsorship functions (that is, client and corporate/stakeholder) there is clarity as to what each of the sponsorship functions are for, and how they work together.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The department sponsor team should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Share best practice and encourage collaborative working between the department and their sponsored body, and with other ALBs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidence ability to exercise constructive and proportionate challenge, for example, evidenced in meeting minutes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Act as an intermediary between the department and the sponsored ALB, facilitating contact between the ALB and others within the department and across Whitehall.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure that the right balance is struck between ensuring clear accountability arrangements are in place and enabling the ALB the freedom to deliver and innovate as per the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/partnerships-with-arms-length-bodies-code-of-good-practice">partnership code</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The ALB shall:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Evidence clarity in the relationship, and accountabilities, between the executive and non-executive.</li>
</ul>

<p>The ALB should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure a policy of ‘no surprises’ underpins the relationship between itself and the sponsoring department.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidence of regular and proactive engagement between the sponsor team and ALB.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Invest time and energy in their relationship with the senior sponsor and the sponsor team.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Financial</h5>

<p>On behalf of the PAO, the Department sponsor team shall:</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through its Departmental Accounting Officer (AO),<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup>ensure that the ALB AO is satisfactorily discharging their responsibility for the use of public money.</p>
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If appropriate, review annual reports and accounts, to assess whether propriety, regularity and value for money have been achieved and seek explanations for unusual trends or figures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure that the framework document (or equivalent) agreed between the ALB and the department provides for the sponsor department to exercise meaningful oversight of the ALB’s strategy and performance, pay arrangements and/or major financial transactions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For pay decisions, prior to a request for approval of Civil Service Human Resources/HM Treasury ensure the following individuals are consulted: i) the lead of the profession ii) the PAO and iii) Remuneration Committee.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be aware of which <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/cabinet-office-controls">Cabinet Office Controls</a> apply to the ALB and the specific ways in which they are applied.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is recognised that non-ministerial departments may have different arrangements for which the ‘comply or explain’ principle applies.</p>

<h5>Performance and reporting</h5>

<p>The department sponsor team shall:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Facilitate the setting of annual objectives which are specific and include ‘what’ needs to be achieved and by when – ensuring that these objectives flow through into the relevant ALB corporate and business plans.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set clear frameworks around government and/or departmental policy, from which ALBs can align their objectives, and set appropriate and effective Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Monitor performance against these agreed measures. Monitoring may take place through a programme of regular, recorded accountability meetings with the ALB, proportionate to its size and complexity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Appraise ministers and the Accounting Officer on the performance of the ALB, at an appropriate frequency.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If appropriate, ensure the ALB is aware of, and actively supporting, the department’s Outcome Delivery Plan.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Theme 2: benchmarking cost</h3>

<p>The ALB should consider how it can make efficiency improvements through the use of benchmarking against similar organisations.</p>

<h4>Indicators</h4>

<p>All ALBs should seek to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Understand how its costs compare to other similar organisations in improving its efficiency performance, as outlined in pillar 2 (area 6) of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/785553/public_value_framework_and_supplementary_guidance_web.pdf">Public Value Framework</a>.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set out how they are using benchmarking data to improve policy or drive efficiencies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undertake internal and external (including international) comparisons.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have a clear understanding of best practice, both domestically and internationally and a plan for implementation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where clear cost comparisons are difficult to establish, work with other similar organisations to build common understandings around cost to support future benchmarking efforts.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Theme 3: digitisation</h3>

<p>The ALB should consider whether making shifts to digital channels will generate efficiency.</p>

<h4>Indicators</h4>

<p>All ALBs should seek to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Analyse the success of any previous adaptations made to service delivery, such as throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, through digitisation or automation.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Learning should also be taken from other agencies that have undergone similar shifts.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Considerations should include the output, in terms of number of transactions, and the impact on user experience.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider the possible savings that would be made by expanding use of digital channels.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>This should include the expected average cost reduction per transaction for each service that is digitised.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>ALBs should also consider resultant longer term cost reductions, for example the reduced costs associated with property, and the impact on staffing spend.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Highlight efficiency gains from digitising internal processes.</p>

    <ul>

</ul>

<h3>Theme 4: workforce</h3>

<p>The ALB should consider possibilities to both improve the productivity of, and ensure efficient spending on, its workforce. Where appropriate, workforce levels should be reducing.</p>

<h4>Indicators</h4>

<p>All ALBs should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Consider whether efficiency and efficacy gains can be made by improving the skills and productivity of the workforce and the processes they follow, by ensuring, if applicable, that employees have access to training and opportunities to develop.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>ALBs should consider if training will allow for greater employee progression and staff retention.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>ALBs should have due regard to the priority on people set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/declaration-on-government-reform">declaration on government reform</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>

        <p>Ensure their staff are measured/developed against the various profession/function capability requirements.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The current levels of spending on consultancy and contingent labour, and whether this spending can be reduced through upskilling the workforce of the ALB.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>ALBs should avoid over reliance on external support, ensuring that consultancy engagements follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/987126/The_Consultancy_Playbook.pdf">Consultancy Playbook</a>.</p>

<h2>Annex B: Rules on lobbying, attendance at conference, advertising, marketing and PR for public bodies</h2>

<p>The rules set out below reflect the long standing principles that public bodies must be politically impartial and must at all times ensure the proper use of public money. All Public bodies<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup> must comply with these restrictions. Departments should ensure that these rules are reflected in individual bodies’ Framework Documents.</p>

<h3>Lobbying</h3>

<p>Public bodies must never employ external firms or consultants to influence or attempt to influence Parliament, the Government or political parties<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup>. This includes attempting to influence the awarding or renewal of contracts and grants and attempting to influence legislative or regulatory action. To do so would be a clear misuse of public money.</p>

<p>Public Bodies that award grants should in turn ensure the conditions for such grant awards include the lobbying restrictions captured within the Grants Functional Standards (GovS15)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Attendance at Party Conference</h3>

<p>Public bodies must abide by Cabinet Office rules on attendance at Party Conferences. It should be exceptional for board members or staff of Public bodies to attend Party Conferences in an official capacity. Any requests to attend must be approved by both the sponsoring department and the Cabinet Office.</p>

<h3>Advertising</h3>

<p>Public bodies must comply with Government conventions on publicity and advertising. They should ensure that any publicity or advertising is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Relevant to their responsibilities;</li>
  <li>Objective and explanatory;</li>
  <li>Not party political and not liable to misrepresentation as being part political; and</li>
  <li>Produced and distributed in an economic and relevant way, having regard to the need to justify the costs as proper expenditure of public funds</li>
</ul>

<p>Public bodies must seek advice from their sponsoring department in all cases where the use of publicity and advertising might be regarded as novel or contentious.</p>

<h3>PR and Marketing</h3>

<p>It should be exceptional for Public bodies to use Public Relations (PR) or marketing consultants. Any requests to use PR or marketing consultants must be agreed by both the sponsoring Department and the Cabinet Office.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Annex C: Using the requirements in ALB reviews</h2>

<p>The following can be used by Review Teams when undertaking an in-depth ALB review against the requirements in this document. This guidance has been provided to support these teams by providing a set of questions or areas that can be looked into as part of a full-scale review of an ALB.</p>

<h3>Efficacy</h3>

<p>Review Teams should use the efficacy quadrant to identify areas where improvements can be made to make sure that the ALB is operating as effectively as possible. A proportionate approach should be taken, as some of the efficacy requirements may not apply to all ALBs – for example, due to classification or size.</p>

<p>The following areas should be considered when considering the efficacy quadrant.</p>

<h4>Function</h4>

<p>This theme sets out the requirement for ALBs to have a clear mandate, which is up to date and remains relevant. The body in question must continue to meet one of the government’s ‘Three Tests’ for an ALB, and there must be a clear rationale that the function/service needs to continue.</p>

<h4>The ‘Three Tests’</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Is this a technical function, which needs external expertise to deliver?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this a function which needs to be, and be seen to be, delivered with political impartiality?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this a function that needs to be delivered independently of ministers to establish facts and/or figures with integrity?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If, following consideration, the body no longer meets one of the of the three tests then the Review Team should speak to the Public Bodies Team in Cabinet Office about the process that would need to be followed. This should clearly be set out in the recommendations and include consideration of what form, if any, the public body should take. The Cabinet Office must also be consulted over any proposals to reclassify or declassify ALBs. Cabinet Office and/or Treasury approval is required for mergers, restructures and closures of ALBs – for non-ministerial departments the approval of the Prime Minister’s Office is also required given this represents a Machinery of Government change. Where the merger of two bodies creates a new ALB, the process for the creation of a new ALB should be followed in the  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/686716/The_Approvals_Process_for_the_Creation_of_New_Arm_s-Length_Bodies.pdf" rel="external">Approvals Guidance</a></p>

<h4>Form</h4>

<p>This theme sets out the requirement for ALBs to be the correct and appropriate delivery model. Reviews should fully examine the alternative delivery models and not assume that the status quo is the most suitable. Annex A sets out alternative delivery models that should be considered.</p>

<h4>Outcomes for citizens</h4>

<p>This theme sets out the requirements for the ALB and its sponsoring department to ensure that it has the correct systems and knowledge in place to deliver effective outcomes for all citizens.</p>

<p>The Review Team should consider the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Is the ALB clear about the requirements it must meet as set out in the Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED) and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/letter-to-ministers-on-public-sector-equality-duty-assessments">correspondence from the Minister Levelling Up Communities and Equalities from December 2021</a>?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the ALB ensure that its staff are fully aware of and able to implement these requirements?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many judicial reviews has the ALB lost, on what grounds, and the rationale for this number.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the ALB have a clear plan for engagement with stakeholders/citizens, following best practice <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gcs.civilservice.gov.uk/guidance/professional-standards/">guidance</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-functional-standard-govs-011-communication">the communication functional standard</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/785553/public_value_framework_and_supplementary_guidance_web.pdf">Pillar 3 and 4 of the Public Value Framework</a>?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the ALB have a clear and accessible complaints policy?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the ALB have a process in place to effectively use the data from complaints to improve its service delivery?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are there any consistent themes raised in the complaints?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the ALB have a clear, published process for the public around making an FoI request?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the ALB meet its deadlines for FoI requests?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there a link between FoIs and complaints?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the ALB had any decisions or enforcement notices from the ICO due to non compliance with the FoI Act?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the ALB utilise the products that GDS provide on behalf of government?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the ALB ensure that its digital services are designed as end-to-end services, from a citizen’s or users’ viewpoint?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How could the ALB improve its digital services to meet the needs of citizens and users?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the ALB have a data management strategy?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the ALB clear about its requirements under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps">accessibility regulations</a> (2018)?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the ALB have a location strategy, aligned with the Places for Growth strategy which have been included in the sponsor department plans?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Devolution and Union:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If the ALB has a UK-wide remit, How does it ensure that through the use of data and evidence, its decisions are taken with an appropriate understanding of the needs of citizens and communities around the UK? or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the ALB does not have a UK-wide remit, How does the ALB ensure that it has considered opportunities to collaborate and share learning with relevant public bodies in other parts of the UK?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Performance</h4>

<p>This theme sets out the requirements for the ALB and its sponsoring department to have clear, measurable key performance indicators (KPIs). The KPIs should be aligned to the departmental strategic objectives through its outcome delivery plan and should also be aligned to wider government objectives.</p>

<p>The Review Team should consider the following:</p>

<h3>Governance</h3>

<p>Good corporate governance is central to the effective operation of all organisations, including public sector bodies. It provides a robust, effective and accountable framework within which our public services can excel.</p>

<p>Review teams should use the governance quadrant to assess how far the corporate governance of the ALB is compliant with the relevant requirements and expectations. These requirements draw on best practice from the private sector (2018 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.frc.org.uk/document-library/corporate-governance/2018/uk-corporate-governance-code-2018">FRC Code</a>) and public sector requirements (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/managing-public-money">Managing Public Money</a> , 2017 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/corporate-governance-code-for-central-government-departments-2017">Corporate Governance Code of Good Practice</a>).</p>

<p>This should include an assessment of the ALB board, chair and non-executives, and might also consider the relationship with the sponsor department, Ministers and the Principal Accounting Officer (PAO). This element is further elaborated by the Accountability Requirements &amp; Guidance – a review should take this into consideration.</p>

<p>In line with the governance requirements, the following could be considered when making an assessment of the corporate governance of the ALB during a review:</p>

<h4>Comply or explain</h4>

<p>The ‘comply or explain’ approach is the standard approach to corporate governance in the UK. In keeping with this approach, the sponsoring department and ALB board should identify any areas of non-compliance and explain why an alternative approach has been adopted, and how this approach contributes to good corporate governance.</p>

<h4>Delivering on wider government objectives</h4>

<p>This theme outlines the expectation that an ALB should deliver on broader government objectives, for example in its business planning or strategy to ensure it reflects:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Levelling Up;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Net Zero;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Education, Jobs and Skills;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Health and Social Care; and/or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Crime and Justice.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Reviews Teams should also consider:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Where the ALB is responsible for policy that is devolved, is there evidence of collaboration with counterparts in the devolved administrations?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the ALB have a strategy for engaging with counterparts in devolved administrations?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the board undertaken any other work to ensure that the Union is upheld within the work of the ALB?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there a commitment to inclusive working practices in the business/ strategic planning of the board, and are there examples of this working in practice?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the board seek advice or guidance from other organisations to improve its approach to delivering wider government objectives?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Purpose, leadership and effectiveness</h4>

<p>This theme outlines the requirements for the board to ensure the board is fit for purpose and effective.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Purpose: An organisation’s purpose underpins everything it does. It is the responsibility of a board to set an ALB’s purpose, and ensure that its values and culture align and filter down through all levels of the organisation.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Has the board established a clear purpose and set of values for the ALB?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Does the board assess and monitor the culture? If it is not satisfied that policy, practices and behaviour throughout the ALB are aligned with its purpose, values and strategy, does the board seek assurance that management has taken corrective action?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Has the board ensured that the purpose and values are reflected in all relevant frameworks, including the Framework Document, Corporate and Business Plans, and other strategy documents?</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leadership, composition and membership</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Are the accountabilities of the board, the chief executive as AO, and sponsor department Permanent Secretary and PAO to Parliament clear?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Are the roles and responsibilities of the chair, the board, and non-executives clearly set out in writing?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Does the board have sufficient independence? Are there appropriate independent non-executive directors to provide support and challenge?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Is the board representative? Is there a balance of diversity in regards to different experiences, skills mix and background, gender, ethnicity, age, disability, sexual orientation, faith perspectives, and place as laid out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/812694/20190627-CO_Diversity_Action_Plan_FINAL-6.pdf">2019 Diversity Action Plan</a>?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Do the boards of NDPBs meet all additional requirements in regards to composition, and committees, as laid out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/managing-public-money">Managing Public Money</a>?</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>&nbsp;Effectiveness</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Are the board’s and committees’ terms of reference maintained? When were they last updated? Are they publicly available?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Does the board have a schedule of delegation for all board committees?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Are these documents sufficiently granular; are they clear about which specific subject matters must be approved/endorsed or discussed by the board?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Does the ‘Governance Statement’ in the Annual Reports and Accounts include a schedule of regular board meetings, and the attendance record of individual members?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When was the last internal board effectiveness review conducted?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When was the last external board effectiveness review conducted?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Who led these reviews? Did they have appropriate input from the sponsor department, the Chief Executive, ministers, and other board members? Were any significant governance issues raised?</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Appointments, skills and training</h4>

<p>This theme outlines the requirements for the board to ensure that it is balanced and diverse, and to ensure the fair appointment of members. It also outlines the requirements of the board to provide suitable training and development for its members.</p>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Skills and training&nbsp;</p>

    <ul>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Has the chair carried out appropriate succession planning; working with the departmental senior sponsor to consider the skills and diversity needs of the board now and in the future? Is the pipeline and strategy around appointments clear?</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Conduct and behaviour</h4>

<p>This theme outlines the requirements for the board to ensure that its members work at the highest personal and professional standards, promoting the values of the organisation and good governance.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Where appropriate, does the board have a Code of Conduct that sets out the standards of personal and professional behaviour expected of all non-executive board members? Does this Code of Conduct:</p>

    <ul>

</ul>

<h4>Effective financial risk management and internal control</h4>

<p>This theme outlines the requirements that an ALB must have in place to ensure effective governance, risk management and internal controls.

  <li>
    <p>Effective financial management</p>

    <ul>

            <p>Are there current barriers to undertaking these improvements? If so, what are they and how could the ALB and the sponsor department address them?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Is there anything further that the board can do within its remit to assure itself, the ALB and the sponsor department that the management of information is following good or best practice where possible?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Transparency</h4>

<p>This theme outlines the requirements for the ALB board to be open, transparent, accountable, and responsive in its communications with the public and other key stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Is there evidence that the board proactively publishes data in an open and accessible format in line with guidance (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/how-to-publish-central-government-transparency-data">How to Publish Central Government Transparency Data</a>)?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there evidence that the board has considered holding open meetings, that these are accessible in a way that is reasonable and in line with the remit of the ALB?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could more be done to ensure that meetings are accessible, or that the outputs from the meetings (for example, minutes of board meetings) are made accessible after the fact?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are there any barriers that have previously prevented a transparent approach to board and annual meetings that could be addressed going forward?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the board satisfied that the ALB offers transparent communication with the public, if providing services to them?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the board satisfied that there are clear and effective procedures for handling complaints about the ALB? This can be addressed in line with the Efficacy requirements that address compliance with relevant complaint frameworks (Page 9 of the Efficacy requirements). This could include asking the board whether they are satisfied as to the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Is there evidence of effective handling of complaints in line with the framework presented in the requirements?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Are there examples where this has not happened that have raised concern? If so, What are the reasons for this?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Does the ALB communicate its performance and delivery clearly to the public?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Does it have clear and easily accessible objectives that the public can address?</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Accountability</h3>

<p>Arm’s length bodies (ALBs) are accountable to their sponsoring department, the Principal Accounting Officer (PAO) and the Secretary of State. It is the role of sponsors to support sponsored bodies in being accountable, high-performing organisations, delivering value for money services as outlined in their business plan and supporting the department in achieving its objectives.</p>

<p>Effective relationships between sponsoring departments and arm’s length bodies are critical to the delivery of high-quality public services; all sponsors must strike a balance between control and allowing the sponsored body to operate independently day-to-day. Sponsors must establish good governance structures and processes, and maintain good relationships in order to attain this balance.</p>

<p>In practice, Senior sponsors within departments are responsible for managing the relationship with an ALB on behalf of the minister and the AO. Day-to-day management will usually be delegated to a supporting sponsor or sponsor team.</p>

<p>When making recommendations that can address accountability between the sponsor department and ALB, a review should consider the following factors;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the classification of the ALB, for example, executive agency, non-ministerial department, non-departmental public body;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the size of, and resource within, the ALB;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the sponsorship model operating within the department, including the size and resource of the sponsorship team;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the wider accountabilities of the ALB to other bodies beyond the department, for example, Parliament, the Charity Commission, the Financial Reporting Council;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Service Level Agreements, or Memorandums of Understanding, that are in place between the sponsor department and the ALB, in addition to the framework document; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the overall departmental objectives, and to what extent the ALB can achieve or contribute to these.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In line with the Accountability requirements, the following areas should be considered when addressing Accountability in an ALB review:</p>

<h4>Effective sponsorship</h4>

<p>The relationship between the sponsor department and ALB shall be conducted in line with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/partnerships-with-arms-length-bodies-code-of-good-practice">the Partnership code of practice</a>  and meet the requirements of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/managing-public-money">Managing Public Mone</a>y.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Are the roles and responsibilities of both the ALB and sponsor department clear to both parties and do they facilitate the delivery of government objectives? The following should be considered:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>How does the department make sure that the sponsoring relationship is conducted in line with the partnership code of practice?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What evidence is there of clear accountabilities and expectations in terms of roles and responsibilities for both individuals and organisations?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Does the framework document set out the appropriate, proportionate, clear sponsoring arrangements?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What arrangements are in place for the day to day management of the sponsoring relationship?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Is there evidence that the framework document is adhered to by both the department and ALB?&nbsp;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Is a senior sponsor in place to manage the relationship between the minister and AO?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Has the department separated out its sponsorship function? If yes, what evidence is there that the department ensures clarity on what each of the sponsorship functions are for and how they work together?</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What evidence is there of the sponsor team supporting the relationship between the ALB, ministers and the PAO? The following could be considered:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>How does the department demonstrate that it is appraising ministers and the PAO on the performance of the ALB? At what frequency does this take place?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Has a departmental NED been given responsibility for the ALB and/or has direct links with the ALB board?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Does the department send out an annual chair’s letter? If so, is there evidence that this is an effective line of communication between the department and the ALB?</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What evidence is there of the sponsor team fostering a relationship with the ALB that can facilitate the delivery of government’s objectives? The following could be considered:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are regular, formal accountability meetings in place between the department and ALB? How often do these meetings occur? Who attends?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How are the financial, operational freedoms and delegations articulated to the ALB?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the department share good practice and encourage collaborative working with other ALBs?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What arrangements are in place to effectively manage the performance of the ALB? Is there evidence of how this has worked in practice?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What mechanisms are in place for sponsor teams to feed insight from their ALB into policy teams, ensuring that policy development is informed from a delivery perspective?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What evidence is available to demonstrate constructive and proportionate challenge?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the department ensure that the right balance is struck between clear accountability arrangements are in place and enabling the ALB the freedom to deliver and innovate (in line with the partnership code)?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Is there evidence of good or best practice for striking this balance?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What evidence is there of clear remits within the ALB that ensure the ALB is aware of its accountability processes?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Can the ALB clearly evidence clarity in the relationship and accountabilities of its executive and non-executive directors?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Accountability of ALB to the department</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What processes are in place for the ALB to report management information (MI) to the department?</p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the department clearly articulated the minimum MI reporting requirements expected from the ALB?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do the department and ALB meet to discuss MI reporting? How regularly are meetings held?</p>

<h3>Efficiency</h3>

<p>This government wants ALBs that are accountable, efficient and effective, as such the review must be used to carefully consider the efficiency of the ALB. When conducting a review, Lead Reviewers are required to identify where savings to Resource Departmental Expenditure Limits (RDEL) of <u>at least</u> 5% can be made for an average review. The Review Team should use the efficiency requirements to identify where efficiency gains, both cashable<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">[footnote 24]</a></sup> and non-cashable, can be made within the ALB. For clarity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>cashable benefits refer to benefits that will lead to immediate reductions in overall budgets; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>non-cashable benefits will increase efficiency and productivity, but not necessarily be reflected by a short-term budget reduction.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Where a review is unable to identify immediate cashable benefits, it should be recognised that improvements in the efficiency of processes and systems within the ALB could generate cashable savings in the medium-to long-term.</p>

<p>All types of expenditure (CDEL, RDEL and AME) should be considered within this review. A proportionate approach should be undertaken when reviewing ALBs using the efficiency requirements – recognising that not all requirements and possible efficiency gains outlined will apply to all ALBs.</p>

<p>When making recommendations on areas to achieve efficiency gains, reviews should consider the barriers to implementation. Actions to meet the efficiency target must be reflected in the review recommendations and recorded and quantified in the published review report. Reviews should consider the ease of implementation and the possible investment that may be required to achieve certain benefits. A judgement should be made as to whether the cost of implementation will be exceeded by the efficiencies that will be generated, recognising that not all benefits will be represented by short-term and cashable gains.</p>

<p>The following areas should be considered alongside the efficiency requirements:</p>

<h4>Financial management</h4>

<p>The financial management theme outlines the procedures that all ALBs are expected to have in place. Reviews should look for evidence of an ongoing process used effectively by the ALB, and ensure that the process is in line with the guidance outlined within the requirements. The Review Team should also consider any opportunities to strengthen financial management processes, and consider the benefits that this may bring. For each functional area, the Review Team should consider the questions outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jCtdSDZcv5wPpQJzETzA38f65y54lWLPtUUpTmBOmDA/edit">overall functional standards section</a> , as well as any specific considerations outlined below. All processes should adhere to the requirements set out in the functional standard, and any other guidance linked.</p>

      <li>
        <p>How much of this relates to statutory requirements?</p>
      </li>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Reviews into financial management should also look at the quality of the overall processes. Pillar 2 (area 4 and 5) of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/785553/public_value_framework_and_supplementary_guidance_web.pdf">public value framework</a>  highlights the processes that should be in place for an ALB to effectively and regularly review its spending, ensuring that this continues to achieve value for money, and is focussed to help meet the overall set goals of the ALB. To facilitate regular reviews of spending, ALBs must ensure that sufficient quality data is available throughout the delivery chain to do so.</p>

<h4>Benchmarking costs</h4>

<p>In the benchmarking costs theme, reviews should look at how the ALB can make efficiency improvements through the use of benchmarking against similar organisations. Review Teams should consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Does the ALB use benchmarking data to improve policy or drive efficiencies? If yes, how does the ALB use this data?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the ALB does not benchmark its costs, why? Are all elements of the ALB’s work and costs without comparison, or are there some aspects which could be benchmarked?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against which organisations does the ALB benchmark its costs against (both international and domestic comparisons)? Are these effective comparisons?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the ALB understand how its costs compare to other similar organisations in improving its efficiency performance, as outlined in pillar 2 (area 6) of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/785553/public_value_framework_and_supplementary_guidance_web.pdf">Public Value Framework</a>?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What action has the ALB taken following benchmarking exercises to increase efficiency?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Digitisation</h4>

<p>In the digitisation theme, reviews should look at the efficiency gains that can be achieved by shifting services to digital platforms. For all ALBs, even those that cannot make efficiency gains in this area, it should be ensured that current digital services are in line with the existing guidance set out in the efficiency requirements, and that these services are accessible for all users.</p>

<p>The Review Team should consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The feasibility and benefits of shifting services to digital channels</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>How are services currently delivered?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What is the completion rate for each channel (examples include online, via telephone or face-to-face)?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What proportion of completed transactions are from digital channels? Has this been increasing or decreasing in recent years?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What is the number of FTEs per channel?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What is the cost per transaction for each channel?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What is the user satisfaction for each channel?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What user needs need to be met by the service?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Will a shift to digital continue to meet these needs, or improve the service for the user?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What will the cost of the shift be? Will investment be required to expand digital capability? Will benefits outweigh costs?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Will a shift to digital reduce the cost per transaction?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Would the ALB be able to scale down its physical property spending if services were shifted to digital platforms?</p>
      </li>

        <p>How will the ALB ensure that services remain <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps">accessible for all users</a> ?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How does the ALB encourage users to shift to online services?</p>
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Workforce</h4>

<p>In the workforce theme, reviews should seek to identify any ways in which an ALB can improve the productivity of, or reduce spending on, staff. With the drive to become a more modern civil service, ALBs should seek to develop the skills and expertise of their own staff, reducing reliance on external support where possible.</p>

<p>The Review Team should consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Is there a plan to reduce the workforce in line with the civil service headcount reduction target? If not, why?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do staff have access to regular training?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do staff feel sufficient training is provided? Do staff believe they have skills they need to undertake their roles?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there an opportunity for staff to progress upwards within the ALB?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the level of staff turnover? How does this compare with other comparable organisations?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the current level of spending on staff, and how has this changed in recent years?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the ALB previously breached public sector pay policy?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How much does the ALB spend on consulting?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Does the ALB have any known skill gaps?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Are these consulting services crucial to the functioning of the ALB?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What services does the ALB require consultation services for?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Could this spending be reduced by upskilling existing staff?</p>
      </li>
      <li>

        <p>Does the ALB maximise value for money when sourcing consultancy services, following the guidance in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/987126/The_Consultancy_Playbook.pdf">consultancy playbook</a>?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Has the ALB used the services provided by the Government Consultancy Hub?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Does the ALB benchmark its expenditure on consultancy?</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can spending on staff be reduced as a result of changes to services provision found in the digitisation section, such as a shift of services to digital channels or the shared services strategy?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In what locations does the ALB have FTEs, and how many are in each location?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How much is spent on property in each location?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What savings could be made by moving roles out of London? What plans are in place to move roles out of London?</p>
