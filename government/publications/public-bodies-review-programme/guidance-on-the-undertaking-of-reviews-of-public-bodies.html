<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p>Public bodies, which include those known as arm’s length bodies, are a critical delivery arm of the government. They deliver public services and goods across the United Kingdom, ranging from the National Health Service, the Civil Aviation Authority to the numerous National Park authorities in England.</p>

<h3>Accountable, efficient and effective public bodies</h3>

<p>The pandemic has stretched public bodies and required them to respond and adapt at a pace and scale that is unprecedented. It has also demonstrated the urgent need for public service reform, as articulated in the Declaration on Government Reform. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> For public bodies that means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>i. Ensuring they are a necessity. Government must assess whether a function should be delivered by the State, or whether an alternative is more fitting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ii. Greater accountability. Democratic accountability, and the robust debate it entails, helps to create better outcomes for the public. Public bodies should not be making decisions which should be the remit of ministers - instead they must have a laser like focus on delivery. Bodies must also appropriately contribute to the government’s priorities - working together with the government as one team.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>iii. Reduced burden on the taxpayer. The impact of the pandemic on the public finances is significant. This comes at a time when the cost of our arm’s length bodies has continued to grow – by 2020 arm’s length bodies spend over £220 billion a year, and employ over 300,000 people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>iv. A culture of efficiency and transparency. Public bodies must spend taxpayer money with greater care. Effective public body boards will be at the heart of this mission - they will be charged with creating a culture of efficiency throughout their organisations. Public bodies must also be responsive and open to their users, the public. Performance, expenditure and other data should be shared openly.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is why I am pleased to launch the Public Bodies Review Programme, to ensure every pound of taxpayer money spent has to be spent, and if so, delivers the best possible outcomes for the citizen. Reviews will consider whether the body should be abolished or retained; whether it should continue to deliver all of its functions; and whether it has an effective relationship with its department.</p>

<p>The outcome of this work should see powers returned to accountable ministers, greater efficiency and where appropriate, the state stepping back both financially and from people’s lives. Bodies will make the most of Brexit opportunities, reflect the society they serve, improve their use of data and work as a coherent system rather than in silos.</p>

<p>I know departments and their public bodies will welcome this opportunity to ensure they are match fit.</p>

<p>The Rt Hon Jacob Rees-Mogg MP</p>

<p><strong>Minister for Brexit Opportunities and Government Efficiency</strong></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>1. Arm’s length bodies (ALBs) are an important element of departmental delivery chains. There now exists a complex landscape of public bodies which includes 295<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> classified as ALBs, which account for over £220 billion of taxpayers’ money.</p>

<p>2. Reviews are one of the principal levers by which ministers, departments and ultimately the public can influence, and be informed about, ALBs and their sponsorship teams. While the Cabinet Office, together with Her Majesty’s Treasury, owns the overall governance framework for ALBs, it is for Secretaries of State to manage their ALBs, account for them to Parliament and ensure that they deliver outstanding public services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. ALBs are distinct from their departments, with varying levels of independence or ‘lengths of the arm’, across the landscape. Despite the different degrees of independence of ALBs, permanent secretaries remain the Principal Accounting Officer. As set out in Managing Public Money,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> they are responsible to Parliament for their use of public funds.</p>

<p>4. Ultimately, ministers are accountable to Parliament for the performance and policy framework of their ALBs, and exercise control through a range of measures, including appointments to ALB boards, the sign-off of corporate and business plans and Framework Documents. It is essential that ministers and permanent secretaries are assured that ALBs are operating effectively.</p>

<h3>Lessons learned</h3>

<p>5. The government’s approach for public body reviews builds on the 2010 - 2015 Public Bodies Reform Programme and the 2015-2020 Tailored Review programme. Departments reported that benefits of the Tailored Review programme included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>greater flexibility and closer working between the department and the body being reviewed;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the focus on governance, and related recommendations, strengthened internal assurance; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the reviews served as a health check for their organisation, to help support departmental findings and actions being taken to resolve issues.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>6. However, the Tailored Review programme had a number of weaknesses that are addressed in the new programme. These included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an overly narrow focus on governance as opposed to wider priorities such as efficiency and effective delivery,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a tendency to focus on the ALB’s features, rather than the nature of the relationship between the ALB and the sponsor department;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the raising of issues already identified by the departments, rather than adding value by diagnosing unforeseen risks and issues; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>34%<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> of the planned ALB reviews were undertaken between 2016 and 2020.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>7. The new reviews programme is designed to meet the government’s vision of public bodies that are accountable, effective, efficient, and aligned to the government’s priorities. It features several distinct differences to the Tailored Review programme:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>i. <strong>Broad focus with clear expectations</strong>: with new requirements covering governance, accountability, efficacy and efficiency of ALBs – setting minimum expectations. These reviews are expected to address both the ALB and how the department sponsors it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ii. <strong>Proportionate and flexible by</strong>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>focusing on those bodies of highest risk as determined by their Principal Accounting Officer (PAO) and ministers; not ‘reviews for reviews’ sake’;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>allowing the review to reflect the distinct characteristics of the body through a methodology and approach that can be adapted;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>utilising a new self assessment tool to help department’s determine the depth of their review; and</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>departments, who are expert, will lead reviews. This will inject greater pace by removing Cabinet Office from unnecessary process, such as the sign-off of terms of reference.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>iii. <strong>Independent challenge</strong>: Each review will be led by an independent reviewer. The Cabinet Office will maintain a pool of Lead Reviewers to support departments.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>8. Departments are also encouraged to both utilise data and consider their delivery system as a whole:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>i. <strong>Data</strong>: The pandemic has shone a light on the power of data to inform decision-making. Reviews should be evidence rich in themselves, and where possible, recommend improvements to enable public bodies to better use data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ii. <strong>Systems thinking</strong>: The department should map its delivery system in order to assure itself that the changes it makes through a review improve the system as a whole for the public.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Purpose of this Guidance</h2>

<p>9. The Cabinet Office has developed this guidance to provide information to sponsor departments, ALBs, Review Teams and Lead Reviewers.</p>

<p>10.The guidance has been developed with the understanding that the public body landscape across the UK government is varied. Specific elements of the guidance may need to be adapted accordingly.</p>

<p>11.Departments are strongly encouraged to use this guidance when reviewing public bodies outside of the formal ALB classification<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>. Such bodies should be reviewed by departments with the aim of identifying an appropriate administrative classification where possible. Departments should set out why any high-risk unclassified bodies have not been reviewed.</p>

<p>12. Reviews are likely to vary in size and scale and the approach outlined in this guidance supports such proportionality and flexibility. The reviews can range from light-touch exercises largely undertaken via a self-assessment to a team of people working to support a Lead Reviewer on full-scale review.</p>

<p>13. This guidance should be read in conjunction with the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>i. Requirements for Reviews of Public Bodies; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ii. Self-Assessment Model.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>14. Departments and ALBs should refer to these documents, published separately, when undertaking a review.</p>

<h2>Purpose of ALB Reviews</h2>

<p>15. An ALB review must first and foremost assure the public, ministers and the Principal Accounting Officer (PAO) that the ALB’s function remains useful and necessary.&nbsp;</p>

<p>16. Secondly, a review should assess whether there are more efficient and effective alternatives to deliver the government’s objectives. This can include merging the body with a similar body, and closing the body and bringing its functions back to the department.</p>

<p>17. A review should provide an opportunity for departments to ensure they are satisfied that the ALB is operating with a clear purpose and using an appropriate delivery model.</p>

<p>18. Reviews should consider whether decisions are appropriately being taken by the ALB or whether those decisions would be best taken by ministers in the department. When answering these questions, reviewers should at all times bear in mind the government’s ‘three tests’ for the existence of a public body<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>19. An ALB review should result in recommendations that address these questions. Recommendations should be tangible and provide assurance to ministers and the public that the ALB is best placed to deliver the government’s objectives.</p>

<p>20.Where it is agreed that an ALB should be retained, the following must be reviewed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the ALB’s capacity to deliver more effectively and efficiently, including identifying the efficiency savings;</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>When conducting a review, Lead Reviewers are required to identify where savings to Resource Departmental Expenditure Limits (RDEL) of at least 5% can be made for an average review.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>This is the expectation for a typical review. It is expected that this target is met where there is not a pre-existing efficiency savings target set for the body in question.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Actions to meet the efficiency target must be reflected in the review recommendations and recorded and quantified in the published review report.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>As with all review recommendations, ministers are able to accept or reject the recommendation.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Where agreed as a recommendation, the target of at least 5% should be achieved by the body within 1-3 years.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the performance of the ALB, including its contribution to the government’s objectives, and the processes in place for making such assessments; and</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the control and governance arrangements in place to ensure that the ALB and its sponsor are complying with recognised principles of good governance and meeting their legal requirements.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>21. It is for departments to consider how best to structure and carry out these reviews and act on their recommendations, in accordance with the principles set out in this guidance.</p>

<h3>Role of the Cabinet Office in ALB reviews</h3>

<p>22. The Cabinet Office will provide advice and challenge to departments by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>i. overseeing the overall programme of reviews, setting direction for it and monitoring its effectiveness;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ii. challenging departments if it believes that high-risk bodies are not being prioritised for review;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>iii. maintaining tools and guidance to support departments in undertaking their reviews, including the Cabinet Office’s Lead Reviewer pool;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>iv. looking for systemic issues by monitoring data gathered from reviews. For example, departments will share Self-Assessment Models;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>v. requiring departments to keep it updated on the commencement and progress of reviews and the implementation of recommendations; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>vi. managing interdependencies on behalf of the Minister for Brexit Opportunities and Government Efficiency, including the role of the Efficiency and Value for Money Committee.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Scope and Approach</h2>

<p>23. The public bodies directly in scope for this guidance are those that have been administratively classified by the Cabinet Office<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup> as ALBs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>i. Non-Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ii. Executive Agencies (EAs); and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>iii. Non-Ministerial Departments (NMDs).&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>24. However, departments can apply the principles within this guidance to any and all of their public bodies that they may wish to review.</p>

<p>25. When conducting a review of a public body classified to the Central Government sub-sector by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) but not administratively classified as an ALB, the departmental review must consider the appropriate administrative classification for the body.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup></p>

<p>26. Departments should engage the Cabinet Office on the appropriate classification and approval process. The Cabinet Office expects departments to carefully consider if currently unclassified bodies should be classified as ALBs, in line with the  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/519571/Classification-of-Public_Bodies-Guidance-for-Departments.pdf" rel="external">Public Bodies Handbook - Part 1, Classification of Public Bodies: Guidance for Departments</a>.</p>

<p>27. If departments review a public body that holds more than one administrative classification, such as NMDs that are also EAs, departments should consider whether this classification remains appropriate or if adopting a single administrative classification would be more effective.</p>

<p>28. In limited cases, departments may wish to review public bodies that are awaiting classification by the ONS. In such cases, departments should engage HM Treasury and the Cabinet Office.</p>

<h3>Timing</h3>

<p>29.  Proportionality is a central part to this programme and department’s ministers and their Principal Accounting Officer (PAO) should determine the most appropriate frequency of review of their ALBs.</p>

<p>30. The government recognises the National Audit Office’s (NAO’s) criticism<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup> that previous review programmes have not been sufficiently proportionate and have failed to meet their ambition of reviewing every ALB within a Parliament. That is why the new reviews programme requires departments to confirm to the Cabinet Office and HM Treasury a prioritised list of ALBs for review, based on factors including their assessment of risk that the body poses (see paragraph 123). The government wants to invest scarce resources in reviews that will deliver impactful change for the citizen, not reviews for reviews’ sake.</p>

<p>31. The Cabinet Office and HM Treasury reserve the right to challenge the department’s proposed prioritisation of reviews. For example, a low-risk ALB must not be prioritised for review over a major delivery body with significant risks in the belief that doing so demonstrates swift progress.&nbsp;</p>

<p>32. The Cabinet Office recognises that ALBs may also be subject to other forms of scrutiny, in which case the PAO and minister(s) may wish to take that scrutiny into account when prioritising their bodies for review.</p>

<p>33. It remains government policy that a new ALB should be reviewed 18-24 months after the start of full operations.</p>

<p>34. Having considered the delivery system as a whole from a user’s perspective, departments should ensure they explore options for conducting joint or clustered reviews of organisations both within their department, and more widely across government.</p>

<p>35. It may also be appropriate to consider the timing of the review with regard to any forthcoming relevant public appointments.</p>

<h3>Pace</h3>

<p>36.  Reviews should be completed thoroughly and rigorously, but also as quickly as possible to minimise the disruption to a department’s business. The review of a smaller public body could be completed within a month, and even major reviews should aim to take no more than six months.</p>

<p>37. In order to complete the reviews at an appropriate pace, departments should allocate sufficient resources to them to enable them to be delivered within the agreed timeframe. Investing in sufficient capable resources can lead to recommendations that far outweigh the cost of the review.</p>

<p>38. The Cabinet Office will no longer approve the terms of reference and final report prior to publication, to both empower departments and increase pace.</p>

<h3>Inclusivity</h3>

<p>39. Reviews should be open and inclusive. The department and ALB should welcome the opportunity for independent challenge and support the Lead Reviewer and their team in accessing the data they need. Establishing a positive ‘one team’ culture during a review can help to ensure that recommendations, and their implementation, have buy-in.</p>

<p>40. In addition, key stakeholders, including the public in the case of some reviews, should have the opportunity to provide input to the review where relevant and appropriate (see paragraphs 151-152).</p>

<p>41.  When conducting a review, the Review Team must comply with the Public Sector Equality Duty, in line with the Minister for Levelling Up Communities and Equalities’ <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/letter-to-ministers-on-public-sector-equality-duty-assessments">correspondence of December 2021</a>. It should have regard to the equality impact of any of its recommendations on the staff of the body or the customers who benefit from the public services that the body delivers. An acknowledgement that this has been done should be included in the output from the review, and a record of these considerations should be retained. Legal advice should be sought where appropriate.</p>

<p>42. Departments should also consider whether and, if so, how they might involve Parliament in the review process. They may wish to announce the start and conclusion of the review by way of a written ministerial statement (WMS) and alert the relevant committee(s) when starting the review.</p>

<p>43. Departments may wish to limit the number of statements they lay by making an annual announcement setting out the reviews they propose to deliver throughout the financial year.</p>

<p>44. In keeping with the core principles underpinning all reviews, engagement should be proportionate, timely and provide clear value for money for users and taxpayers.</p>

<h3>Relationship with existing guidance</h3>

<p>45. The tools provided for departments to undertake these reviews do not replace existing guidance for ALBs, unless this is specifically stated. The tools and guidance primarily aim to consolidate and collate existing guidance and departments should consult all relevant existing guidance where appropriate for the review in question. This might include:</p>

<p>47. This list will be kept under review by the Cabinet Office.</p>

<h3>Functional Standards</h3>

<p>48.  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/functional-standards">Functional standards</a> exist to create a coherent, effective and mutually understood way of conducting business within government organisations and across organisational boundaries. The functional standards outline the requirements for each type of functional work, covering governance, roles and accountabilities, and the practices required for the specific function.</p>

<p>49.  These standards provide a stable basis for assurance, risk management, and capability improvement in order to support value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

<p>50.  A review should look to ensure that the requirements within the functional standards are in place within the ALB, and then look to highlight areas where these practices can be strengthened. To do so, the department and ALB will need to take into account where the functional standards apply to the ALB.</p>

<p>51. Questions that should be considered when using the functional standards include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Does the ALB have a clear understanding of how well it is meeting the functional standard?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How well defined are the areas to be prioritised for improvement?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How effective are the plans to drive continuous improvement against the standards?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>52.  When undertaking a review, departments will want to consider how any assessment of the ALB against the functional standards can be used as part of the evidence base for the review. Functional leads in the department should have undertaken assessments of the ALB against these functional standards and will be able to provide important evidence to support the review.</p>

<p>53. For further information on each individual functional standard, and how to apply them please refer to this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/functional-standards">page</a>. If you have any comments or questions, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:standards@cabinetoffice.gov.uk">standards@cabinetoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>Public Sector Research Establishments (PSREs)</h3>

<p>54.  Public sector research establishments (PSREs) are a diverse collection of public bodies carrying out research. This research supports a wide range of government objectives, including informing policy making, statutory and regulatory functions and providing a national strategic resource in key areas of scientific research. They can also provide emergency response services. They interact with businesses around a wide array of innovation-related functions.</p>

<p>55.  When conducting reviews of PSREs, departments should consult <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-sector-research-establishment-value-framework">the PSRE Value Framework.</a>  This is a tool developed by the Government Office for Science through consultation with PSREs, departments and external organisations that will support departments in conducting effective reviews of PSREs. It will enable departments to understand a PSRE’s performance and value for science and technology, and to think critically about how they could be better utilised. This framework should be used during the review process to ensure a consistent standard of reviews of PSREs across government.</p>

<p>56.  This guide is to be used alongside the methodology described in this review guidance and other Cabinet Office guidance. Given the nature of work conducted by PSREs, reviewers should consult departmental Chief Scientific Advisors (CSAs) when scoping the review to ensure the right aspects of PSRE activity are considered.</p>

<p>57. The Government Office for Science can advise Review Teams on conducting reviews of PSREs. For more information, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:rdstrategy@go-science.gov.uk">rdstrategy@go-science.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>Scientific Advisory Councils (SACs)</h3>

<p>58. Scientific Advisory Committees or Councils (SACs) help government departments (and other executive public bodies) access, interpret and understand the full range of relevant scientific information, and to make judgements about its relevance, potential and application. Such committees give advice on a very wide range of issues, ranging from the food we grow and eat, to the quality of our environment, the safety of our roads and transport, and the design of buildings we live and work in. They review, and sometimes commission scientific research, and offer independent expert judgement, including highlighting where facts are missing and where uncertainty or disagreement exists. SACs may be required to provide advice on the state of current knowledge, the application of information to specific issues, or both.</p>

<p>59. Those SACs that are NDPBs are subject to review. The Government Office for Science should be consulted as part of reviews of such advisory NDPBs, at a minimum as part of the development of the terms of reference of the review, and then later in the process once emerging recommendations are in place.</p>

<p>60. Further advice on the operation of Scientific Advisory Councils is available in guidance maintained by the Government Office for Science, including the principles of scientific advice to government and the Code of Practice for Scientific Advisory Committees.</p>

<h3>Shared Services</h3>

<p>61. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-shared-services-strategy-for-government">The Shared Services Strategy</a>  brings together the core functions of a business into a single simplified centre to save time, cut back-office red tape and offer better value for money to the taxpayer. This new streamlined approach allows for higher productivity and standardisation of business needs at a lower cost and with a better user experience and accessibility.</p>

<p>62. ALBs are within the scope of the Strategy, and are expected to join their sponsoring department’s Shared Service Centre, as set out in the  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-shared-services-strategy-for-government">Shared Services Strategy for Government</a>.</p>

<p>63. ALBs not joining the Shared Service Centre in the immediate future, for example, due to contractual commitments, are expected to progress with alignment to Strategy workstreams in preparation for joining their Centre. These workstreams include alignment to global processes and standards, data convergence, process transformation and quality and performance.</p>

<p>64. Reviews should consider ALB alignment to the strategy and roadmap for the ALB to join its Shared Service Centre.</p>

<h3>Devolution and strengthening the Union</h3>

<p>65. It is essential to have considered fully the extent to which an ALB’s functions are directly or indirectly delivered in a devolved context.</p>

<p>66. In the government’s response to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-dunlop-review-into-uk-government-union-capability">Lord Dunlop’s review</a> of how the UK government and devolved administrations can work more effectively together on behalf of all citizens, the government committed to helping public bodies work in a way that represents and strengthens the UK.</p>

<p>67. Review Teams can draw upon support from the UK Governance Group (UKGG) or the Northern Ireland Office to better understand devolution issues in the policy and delivery areas in question. They can also access the  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/devolution-toolkit">Devolution Toolkit</a>.</p>

<p>68. Understanding the remit and reach of the body, dependencies and stakeholders within each of the UK’s nations, should be a fundamental part of scoping and undertaking the review.</p>

<h2>Key Principles</h2>

<p>69. As described earlier, this new programme of reviews has learnt lessons from the previous review programmes and, therefore, has been designed to meet the following principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Useful</strong> to both sponsor department and ALB.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Informed</strong> by relevant expertise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Proportionate.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Constructively critical, rigorous and open.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Realistic.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>70. <strong>Useful to both the sponsor department and ALB:</strong> Reviews should generate benefits for the ALB, department and central government, and ultimately to the public and end users of the service. They should identify where elements need strengthening, and put in place constructive means to do so.</p>

<p>71. The review should not be seen as a punitive measure or an exercise with predetermined aims, but rather a collaborative exercise to ensure that the ALB and the department are working effectively together.</p>

<p>72. <strong>Informed by relevant expertise:</strong> Reviews should be led by suitably qualified Lead Reviewers and supported by departments. Departments will need to ensure that the relevant spending team at HM Treasury is engaged when appropriate. Departments may wish to consider the merits of bringing in independent expertise, for example, from the private sector.</p>

<p>73. Departments should ensure they have the right expertise to drive efficiency within the ALB. Even if the review itself does not drive monetised savings, it should shine a light on the processes and structures that could.</p>

<p>74. In the case of clustered reviews, where bodies are sponsored by different departments, consideration should be given to which department should lead and how best to involve the other department(s).</p>

<p>75. <strong>Proportionate:</strong> The new review programme provides a set of consistent requirements that set a minimum benchmark for all ALBs and departments to meet. Beyond that, reviews should be proportionate to the ALB.</p>

<p>76. Reviews should be aligned to wider policy or strategic reviews and support commitments set out in the government’s manifesto, Outcome Delivery Plans<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup> and the Spending Review.</p>

<p>77. <strong>Constructively critical, rigorous and open:</strong> Reviews should be constructive and challenging, surfacing issues and probing for solutions. It is expected that, where a review identifies the need for change, recommendations are transformative and bold where they need to be. Reviews should solicit input from stakeholders – including the public, where appropriate.</p>

<p>78. The ultimate aim of the review is to focus on delivering tangible recommendations that provide assurance to ministers and the public that the ALB is best placed to deliver public services and goods.</p>

<p>79. <strong>Realistic:</strong> The reviews should be focused on issues the ALB/department can control and put right, rather than comment on wider issues. This principle should manifest itself in realistic and proportionate recommendations set within an achievable timeline.</p>

<h2>The requirements that underpin ALB reviews: Governance, Accountability, Efficacy and Efficiency</h2>

<p>80. The new review programme is underpinned by a set of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-bodies-review-programme/requirements-for-reviews-of-public-bodies">requirements for use in reviews</a> which outline the minimum expectations for departments and ALBs, and some indicators of good practice. They are split into the following quadrants:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>i. Efficacy</strong> – this quadrant outlines the expectations on form and function, thereby ensuring that the ALB meets the conditions to be an ALB, with a clear purpose, in the correct delivery model. It also sets out the expectations that the ALB performs effectively and delivers services that meet the needs of citizens.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>ii. Governance</strong> – this quadrant sets out the expectations to be met by ALB boards and their supporting committees.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>iii. Accountability</strong> – this quadrant sets out expectations on the lines of accountability and communication between departments and ALBs, and the support and challenge offered to ALBs via the critical ‘sponsoring’ relationship departments have with their ALB.&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>iv. Efficiency</strong> – this quadrant sets out the expected financial management processes in place in line with current guidance, and outlines the expectations for the identification of cashable efficiency gains that can be made through a change in practices, for example, by digitisation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>81. <strong>As per paragraph 20, when conducting a review, Lead Reviewers are required to identify where savings to Resource Departmental Expenditure Limits (RDEL) of at least 5% can be made for an average review. </strong></p>

<p>82. The requirements include the fundamental expectations ALBs and departments are expected to meet. They are in place to ensure that ALBs are operating in accordance with guidance and legal requirements.</p>

<p>83. These requirements should be used by departments to drive improvements to ALBs and departments. The requirements should also inform the terms of reference of the review. They will be managed by the Cabinet Office and will be reviewed as appropriate.</p>

<p>84. Not all aspects of all the requirements will be implemented identically across all ALBs, as ALBs vary significantly.</p>

<p>85. The requirements deliberately set a minimum baseline, other than in a few specific instances. They do not aim to set out best practice, as consideration of best practice will often be specific to the ALB.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>86. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1070832/self-assessment-model.xlsx" rel="external">Self-Assessment Model (SAM)</a> has been designed to align with these same quadrants and should be undertaken at the beginning of each review. Chapter 8 provides more information and should be read alongside the SAM itself.</p>

<p>87. There is additional guidance for using the requirements when undertaking a full-scale review of an ALB at the end of the Requirements document.</p>

<h2>People: Ministers, Principal Accounting Officers, ALB leadership, Lead Reviewers and the Review Team</h2>

<p>88. It is the responsibility of departments to resource reviews appropriately. While departments will be responsible for reviews, the review leadership will be external to the ALB under review.</p>

<p>89. Reviews will be led by an independent Lead Reviewer and will be supported by a departmental Review Team, who are independent from the team sponsoring the ALB.</p>

<h3>Ministers</h3>

<p>90. Ministers are ultimately accountable for their department’s public bodies and will want to define their role in the review process. Generally, this will involve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>decide which bodies are reviewed and when by writing an annual prioritisation letter to the Minister for Brexit Opportunities and Government Efficiency and Chief Secretary to the Treasury;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>decide on and appoint the Lead Reviewer;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>decide whether a body merits an in-depth review or not;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if appropriate, request a challenge panel is established;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>accept or reject the recommendations suggested; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hold to account the department and public body for the implementation of the recommendations.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Principal Accounting Officers</h3>

<p>91. Principal Accounting Officers (PAOs) are responsible for Managing Public Money and managing risk. While they delegate these responsibilities to the ALB’s Accounting Officer, they retain ultimate accountability. The PAO’s role in the Review process is to advise their ministers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>on which bodies should be prioritised for review.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of suitable Lead Reviewer candidates;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>on the depth of review required;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether to accept recommendations or if to reject with good reason,&nbsp; with particular regard to value for money; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to ensure timely implementation of recommendations.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>92. The PAO will ensure there is suitably skilled resource to support the Lead Reviewer via the Review Team and support from the functions. Lastly, the PAO is encouraged to ‘set the tone’ for the review so that the department and ALB work constructively together to support the Lead Reviewer.</p>

<h3>ALB leadership</h3>

<p>93. The chair of the ALB’s board should be informed about any proposed review. In particular, the chair and their board (including the executive, where the board has one) will have the opportunity to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ensure a collaborative and open approach is taken towards the review and that the Lead Reviewer and the Review Team are provided with all the information they need;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>comment on the proposed terms of reference for the Review;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>meet regularly with the Lead Reviewer and ensure their board is supportive and open in any interviews the Lead Reviewer requests;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>comment on the proposed recommendations from the Review; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>work with the department as ‘one team’ to implement recommendations in a timely manner.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Lead Reviewers</h3>

<p>94. Lead Reviewers are responsible for ensuring a proportionate and rigorous review of the ALB is conducted, and are ultimately accountable for the recommendations of the reviews they lead.</p>

<p>95. It is important for Lead Reviewers to be both objective and perceived as objective. They will provide assurance to ministers, the department and the ALB that a review has been conducted with a level of independence and that, as a result, recommendations are produced that will facilitate the continuous improvement of the ALB where necessary.</p>

<p>96. The department should assure itself that the Lead Reviewer is suitable for the role.</p>

<p>97. The Lead Reviewer should be sufficiently independent to enable objective analysis of the ALB and department during the review. This is best ensured by the Lead Reviewer being external to both the sponsor department undertaking the review and the ALB being reviewed.</p>

<p>98. The independence and objectivity of the Lead Reviewer are ultimately a matter for the judgement of the reviewing department’s ministers, and it is for departments to manage this risk appropriately.</p>

<p>99. Lead Reviewers can be sourced from a pool held by the Cabinet Office (see below for more details).</p>

<p>100. Departments can also appoint a Lead Reviewer independent of this pool, in order to utilise skills or experience that may be pertinent to the review of a specific ALB. Departments should submit possible candidates to their ministers, who will appoint the Lead Reviewer.</p>

<p>101. Due to the different sizes of ALBs and depth of the reviews, the nature of the role and expected time commitment of the Lead Reviewer will vary. For a list of potential responsibilities, please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-bodies-review-programme/template-1-lead-reviewer-role-specification?preview=6606313">Lead Reviewer role specification, Template 1</a>.</p>

<h3>Cabinet Office Lead Reviewer Pool</h3>

<p>102. The Cabinet Office’s Public Bodies Team holds a pool of potential Lead Reviewers. Individuals in the Pool are willing to undertake this role. They have been nominated by other government departments as suitable against the criteria set out by the Cabinet Office in the role specification.</p>

<p>103. When a department wishes to use the Pool to select a Lead Reviewer, they should contact the Cabinet Office Public Bodies Team at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:publicbodiesreform@cabinetoffice.gov.uk">publicbodiesreform@cabinetoffice.gov.uk</a> for access.</p>

<p>104. The Pool will contain the names and relevant details of the potential Lead Reviewers, and contact details of the department which nominated the candidates. When selecting reviewers from the Pool, the reviewing department will coordinate contact with the Lead Reviewers via the nominating department.</p>

<p>105. It is then advised that the reviewing department conduct any further conversations or checks on shortlisted Lead Reviewers ahead of advising on the appointment. It is the reviewing department’s responsibility to ensure they have an appropriate reviewer.</p>

<p>106. The Cabinet Office Public Bodies Team will seek to ensure that the Pool is kept up to date annually, and will, as part of the annual prioritisation process outlined in paragraphs 122-131, ask departments to confirm if they would like any individuals to be removed from the Pool, and to submit new candidates.</p>

<p>107. As the reviews progress, the Cabinet Office will invite feedback from departments on the Pool and on the role of Lead Reviewers.</p>

<h3>Review Team</h3>

<p>108. The Lead Reviewer will be supported by a Review Team made up of individuals from the department undertaking the review. It is the responsibility of departments to adequately resource their reviews. Departments will select their own Review Team, and the size of the Review Team will therefore be dependent on the nature of the ALB under review.</p>

<p>109. The departmental Review Team should be independent of the ALB, and its sponsoring team. This independence will allow for the review to consider the sponsor relationship between the ALB and the department more objectively.</p>

<h3>Roles within the Review Team</h3>

<p>110. The capacity and capability of the Review Team is for the department to decide based on the complexity and level of risk posed by the body. However, for a medium-sized body that poses medium risk, the standard roles expected in the Review Team may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Head of the Review Team;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Analysis; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secretariat.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Capabilities of the Review Team</h3>

<p>111. For a high-profile body, the Review Team may be led by a senior civil servant. They would support the Lead Reviewer to manage complex relationships with senior officials within the department and the ALB, as well as ministers. For lower-risk and less high-profile bodies, the Principal Accounting Officer may be satisfied that a smaller and less senior Review Team is sufficient.</p>

<p>112. The capabilities needed within the Review Team are likely to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an understanding of public finance / Managing Public Money and the Public Value Framework;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>analysis and the understanding of complex evidence bases (for example, to review-relevant ALB data);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>legal issues (if the body has a statutory footing) or other legal duties it must discharge;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an understanding of good governance principles; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>strong stakeholder management skills.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>113. The Review Team should be supported by the department’s functions as appropriate.</p>

<h3>Responsibilities of the Review Team</h3>

<p>114. The responsibilities of the Review Team will vary depending on the review but may include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Accessing the Lead Reviewer Pool and shortlisting Lead Reviewers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seeking approval for the different stages of the review via submissions to ministers, for example, for Lead Reviewers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Supporting the handling of the review within the department, ensuring that the PAO, ministers and the ALB are engaging, as needed, with the review.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Onboarding the Lead Reviewer (for example, arranging IT if needed).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensuring the Lead Reviewer is briefed on the background and context of the ALB.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensuring appropriate engagement between the Lead Reviewer and public body, key stakeholders, and other key officials.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arranging interviews etc. for the Lead Reviewer with relevant stakeholders, and collating input from stakeholders, including the public, where relevant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensuring that the review is done in a timely manner and following the Cabinet Office’s public body reviews guidance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidence gathering and analysis and, if required, supporting the mapping of the wider delivery system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assisting with the writing of the final recommendations and report.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Review Team’s relationship with the Arm’s Length Body and Sponsor Team</h3>

<p>115. The Review Team should build a trusting and effective relationship with both the ALB sponsor team and the ALB itself. It is important that there is open, two-way discussion between the department and the ALB. The Review Team must be open and transparent with the ALB, explaining the rationale for its requests and actions, and should expect the same in return.</p>

<h3>Role of the Arm’s Length Body in relation to the Review Team</h3>

<p>116. The ALB should work in an open and transparent manner with the Review Team to ensure all relevant data is shared in an ‘open book’ approach to its performance and finances.</p>

<h3>Further Information on the Review Team</h3>

<p>117. Reviews will vary considerably in terms of scope and scale. Departments will want to consider the role of the Review Team, and the roles within it, in line with their ambition for the review (for more information on this, see Chapter 8).</p>

<h2>Process and methodology</h2>

<p>118. This section outlines the guidance for how to undertake a review. For guidance on timing, pace, and inclusivity of engagement, please refer to Chapter 4: Scope and Approach.</p>

<h4>Recommended review process:</h4>

<p>119. Departments should review this guidance and consider the best process for setting up a review of an ALB. The Cabinet Office suggests the following five stage outline. This outline may be adapted as appropriate:</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/148264/1.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>120. The stages can be carried out as follows:</p>

<h5>Stage 1 – Self-assessment:</h5>

<p>A self-assessment should be conducted. Depending on the outcome of the self-assessment and any other relevant factors, a decision will be taken by the responsible sponsoring minister, with a view from the Principal Accounting Officer (PAO), on whether:</p>

<ul>
  <li>i. to move to Stage 2 and appoint a Lead Reviewer; or</li>
  <li>ii. to move straight to Stage 4</li>
</ul>

<h5>Stage 2 – Appointment of Lead Reviewer and evidence gathering</h5>

<p>Appointment of a Lead Reviewer by the department, direction set for review, and agreed in the terms of reference. Evidence gathering and analysis begins, undertaken by the Lead Reviewer and Review Team.</p>

<h5>Stage 3 – Full-scale review</h5>

<p>External research/inspection/interview is led by the Lead Reviewer and supported by the Review Team.</p>

<h5>Stage 4 -Submission of the Lead Reviewer’s report to ministers or submission of self-assessment outcome showing no need for a full-scale review</h5>

<p>Detailed review report produced by the Review Team and the Lead Reviewer submitted to the PAO for review, followed by submission to the relevant minister for final approval, or submission of self-assessment outcome showing no need for a full-scale review.</p>

<p>If, after Stage 1, the self-assessment showed that either the ALB and the department are in sufficiently good health or that the identified issues can be managed through proportionate actions, then the outcome of the self-assessment should be submitted to ministers. This outcome may include recommendations, in this case, recommendations should be put to ministers, published in a manner determined by ministers, and implemented by the department. Ministers may decide to ignore this conclusion following self-assessment and request a full-scale review.</p>

<h5>Stage 5 – Publication</h5>

<p>Publication of the recommendations and a summary of the review by the department, the timing and manner of which to be determined by departmental ministers.</p>

<h5>Stage 6 - Post-Review</h5>

<p>Implementation of recommendations by the department. The Cabinet Office will request updates on progress to provide assurance that departments are implementing recommendations.</p>

<p>121. Once a review is completed, the department should notify the Cabinet Office Public Bodies Team to support their oversight of the departments’ progress.</p>

<h3>Annual prioritisation</h3>

<p>122. Ahead of the start of this programme, departments were asked for their rolling three-year plan for reviews.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup> This process will be repeated at the end of every calendar year for the duration of the programme. These annual prioritisation letters, and subsequent responses from the departmental minister, should be copied to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.</p>

<p>123. Departments, as agreed with their ministers and Principal Accounting Officer (PAO), should use this letter to prioritise reviews of their public bodies. Departments should prioritise reviews based on the risk carried by their ALBs and the changes they have experienced since their last review. Prioritisation should also consider such factors as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Views of Ministers and Principle Accounting Officers:</strong> Departmental assessment of the risks and opportunities presented in their public body landscape, including ministerial and permanent secretary views.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Financial:</strong> Significant changes to expenditure and number of full-time employees; findings from Spending Reviews. Relevant National Audit Office/Public Accounts Committee reports.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>HM Treasury and Cabinet Office views:</strong> The relevant HM Treasury Spending Team should be consulted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Timing:</strong> The length of time since the ALB’s last review.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Delivery:</strong> The centrality of the body to the delivery of wider government objectives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Changes in context:</strong> A change in external context and/or any events that has significantly affected the ALB’s delivery, performance or operations (for example, COVID-19); a ‘trigger event’, such as a leadership change.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Users:</strong> Views of the body’s users, of the public and of Parliament.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Founding legislation:</strong> If appropriate, how the body is, or is not, complying with its original purpose enshrined in legislation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>New bodies:</strong> It is a requirement to review a new body in line with the approval conditions set when it was established. This is usually within&nbsp; 18-24 months of the commencement of full operations.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Functional views:</strong> Functional leads within the department should be asked for their view.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Shareholding:</strong> If appropriate, views from UK Government Investments.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>124. The team prioritising reviews should consult relevant departmental functional leads on the ALB’s risk profile.</p>

<p>125. Departments should write back promptly to the minister responsible for public body policy in the Cabinet Office and Chief Secretary to the Treasury with their plan outlining what reviews are scheduled to take place during the upcoming three years, with the following degrees of commitment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Year 1 (February 2022/end of financial year 2022/23): Reviews that will take place; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Year 2 (2023/24) and 3 (2024/25): Reviews planned to take place.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>126. It is for the PAO, in partnership with relevant ministers in the department, to decide on the ALBs they prioritise for reviews each year. This prioritisation may be amended during the annual update to reflect changes in circumstances.</p>

<p>127. Departments are no longer required to review all of their ALBs over the course of a Parliament – although departments with a small number of ALBs are likely to meet this aim.</p>

<p>128. Additionally, the Cabinet Office and HM Treasury reserve the right to comment on the decisions made by departments on their prioritisation plans, and will consider the new bodies that have been formed by departments in the last 18-24 months.</p>

<p>129. The Minister for Brexit Opportunities and Government Efficiency and/or the Chief Secretary to the Treasury may respond to the prioritisation and review plans outlined by departments as required.</p>

<p>130. At the end of each calendar year, the Minister for Brexit Opportunities and Government Efficiency will write to departments reflecting on the reviews completed, and request an updated three-year rolling prioritisation plan. It will also provide an opportunity for the Cabinet Office to consider whether any adjustments need to be made to the review programme.</p>

<p>131. The annual prioritisation letter should also be an opportunity for ministers and the PAOs in departments to update the Cabinet Office on progress over the last year, and outline how the department is implementing recommendations.</p>

<h3>Self-Assessment</h3>

<p>132. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1070832/self-assessment-model.xlsx" rel="external">Self-Assessment Model (SAM)</a>, underpins the proportionate principle of the review programme. The SAM consists of a set of questions for departments and ALBs to use as a desk-based ‘health-check’ of the ALB, and to review the relationship with the sponsoring department. The SAM contains guidance for the department to complete it in partnership with the ALB.</p>

<p>133. The SAM has been designed to be used for those bodies prioritised for review by the department. Departments should use the SAM as a factor when considering whether a prioritised body merits a full-scale review.</p>

<p>134. What the results of the SAM say about the ALB and the sponsorship of the ALB will be for the department to interpret.</p>

<p>135. It is expected that the SAM should be completed with the support of both the sponsor team and the ALB. The ALB and the department may decide to each complete the SAM, as this may support the self-assessment to help the ALB and department identify differences in conclusion, and work to resolve them. Responses must be consolidated when returning them to the Cabinet Office.</p>

<p>136. A Review Team may not be in place by this point, as some departments will only set one up for full-scale reviews. In this instance, departments will need to consider how to resource the completion of the SAM and take into account that they must be assured that the conclusions are factually accurate and objective. For example, the sponsorship team should not complete questions regarding their own capability.</p>

<p>137. During this process, the department will need to align their research with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-bodies-review-programme/requirements-for-reviews-of-public-bodies">Requirements for Reviews of Public Bodies</a>. It is also important to consider if and where the results of the SAM identify ‘triggers’ for a full-scale review. Further information on conducting evidence gathering and stakeholder engagement can be found in paragraphs 149-153.</p>

<p>138. The SAM, in combination with departmental knowledge informed by the considerations listed in paragraph 123, will help to determine whether the department and ALB recommend a further in-depth review. This analysis will also help the ALB and its sponsor department to identify the scope of the review. It is possible that the self-assessment is deemed a sufficient and adequate review of the ALB, and no further work is required.</p>

<p>139. Once a SAM is completed, the department will determine and follow an appropriate internal clearance process to conclude this stage – both the PAO and responsible ministers in the sponsor department must be engaged. The conclusion should outline either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>i. the need for a full-scale review and its scope; or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ii. an explanation as to why a full review is not required.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>140. Where the department is satisfied that a full-scale review is not required following a self-assessment, recommendations can still be produced to improve any identified concerns. Such recommendations should be agreed, implemented and reported on in the same manner as a full-scale review.</p>

<p>141. If it is determined that a full-scale review is required, this should be agreed in partnership with the ALB and relevant teams within the departments. It is recommended that both ministers and the PAO are involved in the decision to move to a full-scale review.</p>

<p>142. Please refer back to paragraph 119 to see the role of the SAM in the context of the review steps. Conclusions from the SAM should be submitted to the Cabinet Office via <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:publicbodiesreform@cabinetoffice.gov.uk">publicbodiesreform@cabinetoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>Commencing a full-scale review</h3>

<p>143. The self-assessment will be one way of identifying the need and scope for a full-scale review of an organisation. However, paragraph 123 also highlights other factors that a minister, PAO and department will need to consider when making this decision.</p>

<p>144. Once the decision is made to move to a full-scale review, the department will ensure that there is a Review Team in place and will appoint a Lead Reviewer to undertake the review (see Chapter 7).</p>

<p>145. To commence a review, the PAO, relevant minister or senior sponsor in the department should consider writing to the Lead Reviewer with an explanation of the need for the review and a justification for its scope. This letter should reference the findings of the self-assessment, and any additional factors outlined in paragraph 123.</p>

<p>146. The PAO, department and ministers should ensure that the ALB being reviewed is engaged in the commencement of a full-scale review. The Senior Sponsor should be proactive in ensuring there is dialogue between the department and ALB. It is recommended that the ALB chair is consulted regarding the review and its aims.</p>

<p>147. Once a Lead Reviewer is in place, the terms of reference will be drawn up by the Review Team in consultation with the ALB, department and Lead Reviewer. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-bodies-review-programme/template-4-terms-of-reference-for-public-bodies-reviews">Template 4</a> can be used to inform the terms of reference. Departments should amend this template as required.</p>

<p>148. Departments are strongly encouraged to consult with their relevant HM Treasury Spending Team when considering the terms of reference. The Cabinet Office does not need to formally approve the terms of reference, but departments are welcome to consult the Public Bodies Team.</p>

<h3>Evidence Gathering and Stakeholder Engagement&nbsp;</h3>

<p>149. Evidence to support the review should be gathered both at the self-assessment stage, and if a full-scale review takes place. As the department will determine the depth and scope of any review, it will be for the department to clearly outline in the terms of reference (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-bodies-review-programme/template-4-terms-of-reference-for-public-bodies-reviews">Template 4</a>) who they will be collecting evidence from and why.</p>

<p>150. Departments must ensure that the ALB has a clear role in the gathering of evidence. The ALB should support the department in undertaking the review by proactively engaging throughout the process and providing all required evidence in a timely manner. If this does not take place, the Senior Sponsor or PAO should meet with both the ALB and Lead Reviewer to discuss.</p>

<p>151. In addition and where relevant and appropriate, key stakeholders should have the opportunity to provide input into the review. Departments and Lead Reviewers are strongly encouraged to consider whether users or customers are considered in this. This should be noted in the terms of reference and can also be reflected in the review report and recommendations.</p>

<p>152. If the organisation directly provides services to the public, the sponsor department and Lead Reviewer should consider launching a light touch consultation or call for evidence.</p>

<p>153. Similarly, if the ALB partners with specific entities (sector-based groups, suppliers, delivery partners), due consideration should be given to how evidence should be gathered and analysed from these.</p>

<h3>Challenge Panels</h3>

<p>154. A department may wish to consider the establishment of a challenge panel. The panel should have a chair who is independent of the review. Other members of the panel are then at the discretion of the department’s ministers and PAO. The panel could include external representation, for example when a department wants to bring in sectoral expertise.</p>

<p>155. The panel’s role would be to hear from the Lead Reviewer, understand the evidence base, and challenge emerging thoughts and recommendations in a rigorous and constructive manner.</p>

<p>156. For particularly complex or sensitive reviews, the sponsor department’s ministers and PAO may also wish to consider the need for a ministerial challenge panel. The panel would have representation of ministers from the sponsor department and, for example, ministers from other departments.</p>

<p>157. The ministerial challenge panel’s role would be similar to the challenge panel described above. This level of panel should seldomly be used and only deployed for the most sensitive or high-risk bodies when radical transformation or system-wide change is envisioned.</p>

<p>158. Both of these panels can provide additional scrutiny and potentially lead to better informed recommendations, however both will add cost, time and complexity to the review. Ministers and the PAO will want to carefully consider this trade-off before pursuing either option.</p>

<h3>Reporting Findings</h3>

<p>159. Following HM Treasury’s Spring Statement in March 2022, Lead Reviewers may be asked to report interim findings to the Cabinet Committee on Efficiency and Value for Money<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Drawing Conclusions and Developing Recommendations</h3>

<p>160. Delivering specific, measurable, realistic, evidence-based and time-bound recommendations from the findings of the review is key to instigating change. Previous reviews have occasionally resulted in long lists of unachievable recommendations. Furthermore, a lack of tracking of the implementation of recommendations has prevented benefits from being realised.</p>

<p>161. It is the Lead Reviewer’s role – with the Review Team – to develop and draft the review’s conclusions. As with the rest of the review, the Lead Reviewer should be supported – but not unduly influenced – by the department, and empowered to make evidence-based findings and recommendations.</p>

<p>162. The Lead Reviewer should ensure that the ALB is informed of, and has the chance to comment on, the findings and recommendations of the review.</p>

<p>163. The Lead Reviewer may wish to draw attention to how the ALB contributes to a wider outcome delivery system – where multiple public bodies and departments need to work in partnership to deliver an outcome for the public, and how changes can positively influence that system. In particular, the Lead Reviewer may wish to draw attention to issues that could not be resolved within the scope of a review.</p>

<p>164. The Lead Reviewer’s findings should lead on to their recommendations, clearly. Recommendations should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>i. Strategic</strong> – recommendations should not be unnecessarily numerous, and should focus on the fundamental issues affecting the ALB rather than minor logistical issues<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup>;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>ii. Targeted</strong> – the recommended solution should be tangible and actionable;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>iii. Measurable</strong> – it should be clear if and how the recommendation has been implemented; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>iv. Time-bound</strong> – a target date should be given for implementation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>165. The actual format of the final review and any annexes are not prescribed here, as they will be determined by departmental ministers, based on the nature of the review undertaken. However, the published review documentation may consist of the SAM, and a report outlining the methodology of the review, the findings, and the recommendations.</p>

<p>166. For reviews that stop at the SAM stage, this may be restricted to the SAM, a short account of the ALB and any required recommendations.</p>

<p>167. The Cabinet Office does not need to approve the final review outputs prior to publication unless there has been requested involvement.</p>

<h3>Agreeing and implementing recommendations</h3>

<p>168. The Lead Reviewer should provide their report and recommendations to the department (that is the minister, PAO and Senior Sponsor), who will then consider the report and respond to it.</p>

<p>169. If the department rejects a recommendation, or pledges to complete it in a different way or to a different timescale, it should set out why it has done so.</p>

<p>170. While the department has the final decision on whether to accept or reject a recommendation, it is critical that it engages the ALB in this process to ensure that both the department and the ALB are ‘one team’ in delivering the review’s recommendations.</p>

<p>171. The process of responding to recommendations should be as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>i. The report and recommendations are provided to the department and shared with the ALB’s leadership;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ii. The department carefully considers the findings and recommendations, and discusses them with the ALB;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>iii. Ministers will then consider the recommendations. The department should provide justifiable reasons for not accepting recommendations. The department should aim to adjust recommendations if this will help them to be implemented – for example, the target date for a recommendation may be revised.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>iv.The recommendations and the department’s responses should be published, with the timing and manner of publication to be determined by departmental ministers. The publication should clearly set out whether the recommendation is accepted and when it will be implemented or rejected, and if it is rejected the rationale for why.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>v. The department should track its implementation of the recommendations, keeping the PAO and ministers informed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>172. As part of the annual communication between Cabinet Office ministers and the minister in the sponsor department, departments will be expected to provide updates on the implementation of recommendations.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Publishing the report and recommendations</h3>

<p>173. Transparency is vital to improving the trust and confidence in public bodies, and regular reviews are one way of contributing to this goal. The department should ensure that the high-level outcomes of the review are appropriately reported, with the timing and manner of publication determined by departmental ministers.</p>
