<p>If you have a bankruptcy order, you must follow certain restrictions. The restrictions start once your bankruptcy order is made. They stop once your bankruptcy ends (you are discharged), or if the bankruptcy is annulled (cancelled) before you are discharged.</p>

<p>Further restrictions will apply for an additional 2 to 15 years after you are discharged, if you have a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bankruptcy-additional-effects-of-a-bankruptcy-restrictions-order-or-undertaking">bankruptcy restrictions order or bankruptcy restrictions undertaking</a>.</p>

<p>Bankruptcy restrictions are legal restrictions meant to protect the public and allow you to make a fresh start.</p>

<p>This guidance explains the main consequences of a bankruptcy order and is not a full list. As a bankrupt it is your responsibility to follow restrictions that apply to you.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Restrictions under insolvency legislation</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/360" rel="external">Obtaining credit</a>
</h3>

<p>If you borrow or obtain £500 or more (for example under a hire purchase or conditional sale agreement), either alone or with another person, you must tell them that you are bankrupt. Failure to disclose your bankruptcy is a criminal offence.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/360" rel="external">Working as a self employed sole trader or  in partnership</a>
</h3>

<p>If you are self employed or are going to start your own business (sole trader), you must use the same name the bankruptcy order was made in. Or you must clearly show that name in all correspondence, invoices or advertising.</p>

<p>Failure to disclose your name is a criminal offence.</p>

<p>For example, if Bert Jones, an undischarged bankrupt, wished to start his own business and trade as ‘Cheese Emporium’, he would have to disclose that the proprietor of that business was Bert Jones. You can still trade in partnership, but you must disclose that you are a partner in the business.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/46/section/11/2001-12-01" rel="external">Acting as a company director</a>
</h3>

<p>You need the permission of the court to act as a company director. This includes directly or indirectly, taking part in, or having a concern in the promotion, formation or management of a limited company.</p>

<p>Acting as a director or managing a company when bankrupt is a criminal offence.</p>

<p>This also applies to membership of a Limited Liability Partnership.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/358" rel="external">Absconding with property and possessions</a>
</h3>

<p>You must hand over the assets (items you own) which make up your bankruptcy estate to your trustee. It is a criminal offence if you abscond (leave, attempt or prepare to leave), England or Wales, with any item belonging to your trustee worth more than £1,000.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/1024/article/17.17/made" rel="external">Creditors’ and liquidation committees</a>
</h3>

<p>You may no longer be a member of a creditors or liquidation committee. If you are a member of one, your bankruptcy trustee will replace you.</p>

<p>You cannot represent another committee member while you are an undischarged bankrupt.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/390" rel="external">Insolvency practitioner</a>
</h3>

<p>You cannot act as an insolvency practitioner while you are an undischarged bankrupt. It is a criminal offence to act as an insolvency practitioner when not qualified to do so.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.7 </span><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/13/section/66" rel="external">Enlisting in the police or armed forces</a>
</h3>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.8 </span>Membership of professional bodies</h3>

<p>If you are a member of a professional body, contact them to find out if any restrictions apply to you as an undischarged bankrupt.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Public offices</h2>
