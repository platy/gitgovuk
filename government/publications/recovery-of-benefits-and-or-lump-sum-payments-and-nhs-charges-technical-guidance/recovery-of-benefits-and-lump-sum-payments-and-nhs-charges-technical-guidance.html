<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide (Z1) is for general guidance only and should not be regarded as a substitute for the legislation contained in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/27/contents" rel="external">Social Security (Recovery of benefits) Act 1997</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Background</h3>

<p><abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> Great Britain (<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>) operates primarily to deliver the following legislation: The Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997, the Road Traffic (<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Charges) Act 1999 and The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003.</p>

<p>The Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997 introduced a recovery scheme with effect from 6 October 1997. The scheme placed the liability to repay social security benefits on the compensator and not the injured person. Part IV of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, Part IV of the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) 1992 and Sections 2 (1)(1A)(3) and (6) of the Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948 were repealed.</p>

<p>The Social Security Act 1998 introduced changes to the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997 which provide clearer grounds for review, 2 new grounds for appeal and for appeals to be heard by appeal tribunals instead of Medical Appeal Tribunals (MATs). These provisions are effective from 29 November 1999.</p>

<p>The Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008 introduced changes to the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997, which provides for the recovery of lump sum payments. These changes are effective from 1 October 2008, and apply to all cases settled on or after that date.</p>

<p>The Mesothelioma Act 2014 introduced changes to the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997, which provides for the recovery of lump sum payments made under the Diffuse Mesothelioma Payment Scheme. These changes are effective from 1 July 2014.</p>

<p>On 5 April 1999 the Road Traffic (<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Charges) Act 1999 came into force. This Act allows <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> to recover <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> hospital charges arising from road traffic accidents where a compensation payment is made on or after 5 April 1999.</p>

<p>On 2 April 2001 the Health and Personal Social Services Act (Northern Ireland) 2001 was introduced and allows for the recovery of health services charges by <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> in Northern Ireland (<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>).</p>

<p>On 29 January 2007 Part 3 of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 which allows for the recovery of the costs of providing treatment to an injured person in all cases where that person has made a successful personal injury claim against a third party was commenced.</p>

<p>The equivalent legislation in Northern Ireland is The Recovery of Health Services <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges (Northern Ireland) Order 2006.</p>

<h3>

<p>The above list is not definitive, nor is it an interpretation of the law. It is for general guidance only, and should be treated as such.</p>

<p>Where the amount of compensation in respect of a particular head of compensation is less than the amount of a listed benefit to be recovered, the compensator is liable to pay the difference. They may not reduce payment against any other head of compensation to take account of the recovery of a listed benefit.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Examples of offsetting for benefit recovery only</h3>

<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>An award of compensation totalling £100,000 is agreed and broken down as follows: £40,000 in respect of general damages (pain and suffering), £30,000 in respect of loss of earnings and £30,000 in respect of loss of mobility.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> Certificate lists Incapacity Benefit totalling £5,000, Income Support totalling £10,000 and Disability Living Allowance (mobility component) totalling £10,000.</p>

<p>A compensator may not under any circumstances offset against the general damages element of the award. Incapacity Benefit and Income Support can be offset against the loss of earnings head of compensation, as set out in Section 8 and Schedule 2 to the Recovery of Benefits Act. Therefore a total of £15,000 can be deducted from the loss of earnings sum, leaving £15,000 to be paid to the injured person.</p>

<p>Similarly, the compensator may offset the £10,000 <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> (mobility) against the loss of mobility head of compensation, leaving £20,000 to be paid to the injured person.</p>

<p>The injured person has settled their claim for a total of £100,000. Following offsetting, they receive £75,000 from the compensator in addition to the £25,000 they have already received from the state benefits system, thus avoiding double compensation.</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>An award of compensation totalling £100,000 is agreed and broken down as follows: £40,000 in respect of general damages (pain and suffering), £30,000 in respect of loss of earnings and £30,000 in respect of loss of mobility.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> Certificate lists Incapacity Benefit totalling £20,000, Income Support totalling £50,000 and Disability Living Allowance (mobility component) totalling £30,000.</p>

<p>A compensator may not under any circumstances offset against the general damages element of the award. Incapacity Benefit and Income Support can be offset against the loss of earnings head of compensation, as set out in section 8 and Schedule 2 to the Recovery of Benefits Act. Therefore a total of £30,000 is deducted from the loss of earnings sum, leaving nothing to be paid to the injured person, but the Certificate shows that £70,000 should be repaid to the Secretary of State. As the compensator can only offset £30,000 they are still liable for the total amount shown on the Certificate and must pay the difference (£40,000) themselves.</p>

<p>The compensator may offset the £30,000 <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> (mobility) against the loss of mobility head of compensation, again leaving nothing to be paid to the injured person.</p>

<p>The injured person has settled their claim for a total of £100,000. Following offsetting, they receive £40,000 by way of general damages, thus avoiding double compensation.</p>

<p>In assessing damages in respect of any accident, injury or disease, the amount of any listed benefits paid or likely to be paid is to be disregarded</p>

<p>Where the amount of compensation in respect of a particular head of compensation is less than the amount of a listed benefit to be recovered, the compensator is liable to pay the difference - they may not reduce payment against any other head of compensation to take account of the recovery of a listed benefit.</p>

<p>Heads of compensation are defined in Schedule 2 to the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997.</p>

<p>Under the provisions of the Mesothelioma Act 2014 any compensation payment made under the Diffuse Mesothelioma Payment Scheme is to be reduced by the amount of the recoverable benefit. This is in addition to any reduction in respect of a recoverable lump sum payment as described in section 1.3.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>Lump sum payments recoverable under the 1997 Act</h3>

<p>Lump sum payments recoverable under the 1997 Act include those made under:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers’ Compensation) Act 1979</li>
  <li>the 2008 Diffuse Mesothelioma Scheme</li>
  <li>the 2014 Diffuse Mesothelioma Payment Scheme</li>
  <li>any ex-statutory payment that was paid because the person did not qualify for a payment under the 1979 Act</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example of offsetting for lump sum payments and benefit recovery</h4>

<p>An award of compensation totalling £60,000 is agreed and broken down as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£15,000 in respect of general damages</li>
  <li>£25,000 in respect of loss of earnings</li>
  <li>£20,000 in respect of loss of mobility</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> Certificate lists lump sum payments totalling £20,000, Income Support totalling £15,000 and Disability Living Allowance (mobility component) totalling £10,000.</p>

<p>The compensator must offset the £20,000 lump sum payment from the general damages first, which would leave an outstanding balance of £5,000. An offset may then be applied to any of the remaining heads of compensation, that is, the compensator may offset the outstanding balance of £5,000 plus the £15,000 Income Support from the loss of earnings head of damage and the £10,000 <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> (mobility) from the loss of mobility head of compensation.</p>

<p>The injured person has settled their claim for a total of £60,000. Following offsetting, they receive £15,000 from the compensator in addition to the £45,000 they have already received from the state benefits system, thus avoiding double compensation.</p>

<h3>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Guidance for compensators</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Recovery procedures</h3>

<p>When you receive a claim for compensation, you should send form CRU1 to <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> within 14 days. This does not mean that you have accepted any liability for the accident, injury or disease.</p>

<p>A Certificate will be automatically issued in cases where the required mandatory information has been provided and no recoverable benefits have been identified. If this is not possible, <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will send you a form CRU4 for use when applying for a Certificate or a Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges.</p>

<p>If you do not have a Certificate when you are ready to settle the claim, you must apply for one by returning form CRU4. You should contact <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> immediately if you have not received an acknowledgement of your request within 14 days.</p>

<p><abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will issue the Certificate within 4 weeks of receiving a request (see also <a class="govuk-link" href="#having-the-certificate-renewed">having a Certificate renewed</a>).</p>

<p>The Certificate will specify the total amount of recoverable benefits and lump sum payments. In the case of recoverable benefits and lump sum payments, you become liable to pay <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> immediately before you pay any compensation payment.</p>

<p>A Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges will be sent separately. Please see the section that deals specifically with the <a class="govuk-link" href="#the-law---nhs-charges"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will also send a copy of the Certificate to the injured person or their representative.</p>

<h4>Help us to help you</h4>

<p>In order for <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> to provide a prompt and accurate service it is essential that you tell <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> about claims as early as possible. If you delay sending <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> the information on form CRU1, you may experience difficulties and further delay when you request a Certificate. <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> must notify the Department’s benefit paying offices that a compensation claim has been made as soon as possible. Failure to notify <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> at the early stage of a claim for compensation may mean archived records need to be retrieved from storage, so you may have to wait longer for an urgently required Certificate.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Completing form CRU1</h3>

<p>You must give <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> the following information on form CRU1 when someone claims compensation from you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the injured person’s full name and address (if the injured person has previously been known by a different name, for example a maiden name, it would be helpful if you could include this detail)</li>
  <li>their date of birth</li>
  <li>National Insurance number, if known</li>
  <li>the date of the accident, incident or injury</li>
  <li>a full description of the nature of the accident, incident, injury or disease</li>
  <li>whether the accident was a road traffic accident (<abbr title="road traffic accident">RTA</abbr>) which occurred prior to 29 January 2007</li>
  <li>if the person attended an <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> hospital because of the <abbr title="road traffic accident">RTA</abbr>, the injury or the incident on or after 29 January 2007 (at any time for any treatment, examination etc.)</li>
  <li>the full name and address of the hospitals or trusts the injured person attended or was admitted to (in order of attendance)</li>
  <li>if you are claiming an exemption under the Road Traffic Act 1988 (section 144) you must state the category of exemption (See Para. 7.5) for <abbr title="road traffic accident">RTA</abbr>’s prior to 29 January 2007</li>
  <li>whether or not the injured person was employed at the date of incident</li>
  <li>where the date of incident is before 6 April 1994, details of the injured person’s employment (if known) – this will enable <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> to obtain information about Statutory Sick Pay (<abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr>) that may have been paid</li>
  <li>the reference number you use to identify the case. If your reference number changes before the claim is settled, you should inform <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> of the new reference number</li>
  <li>to help <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> process the claim, please tell <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> whether the claim is public liability (<abbr title="The person claiming compensation under the 2008 Diffuse Mesothelioma Scheme">P</abbr>), motor (M), employer (E), clinical negligence (C) or other (O)</li>
  <li>if a claim is registered as ‘M’ liability but the accident occurred during a person’s employment you must notify <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> of that fact – this is because the injured person may have claimed Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit</li>
  <li>in ‘E’ liability cases if <abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr> was paid before 6 April 1994 the compensator must provide details of the <abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr> when applying for a Certificate</li>
  <li>if a solicitor is acting on your behalf you must show their name, address and reference number on form CRU1. This will ensure that correspondence is sent to the correct address</li>
</ul>

<p>You must notify <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> in writing if you take over a claim from another compensator. You should not complete form CRU1 if that form was submitted by the original compensator.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Failure to provide the information listed above could cause a delay in CRU issuing Certificates.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>See our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compensation-recovery-unit-forms">Compensation Recovery Unit forms</a> page for a copy of our CRU1 form. Please send completed forms to the address at the bottom of the CRU1.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Obtaining a Certificate</h3>

<p>A Certificate will be automatically issued in cases where the required mandatory information has been provided and no recoverable benefits have been identified.  If this is not possible <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will send you a form CRU4 for use when applying for a <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> Certificate or a Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Important: You should not return form CRU4 to CRU until you are ready to settle the claim.</p>
</div>

<h4>Statutory Sick Pay (<abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr>) Employer liability cases only</h4>

<p>Where the date of incident is before 6 April 1994 (or in disease cases where <abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr> may have been paid before that date) you should ask the relevant employer for details of any <abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr> that the injured person was paid as a direct result of the accident, injury or disease.</p>

<p>Complete form CRU4 to show the gross amount of <abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr>. Make sure you do not include any Occupational Sick Pay that may have been paid with the <abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The amount shown on the Certificate will include 100% of <abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr> paid before 6 April 1991 and 80% of <abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr> paid from 6 April 1991 to 5 April 1994.</p>

<p><abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr> ceased to be recoverable from 6 April 1994. Details of <abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr> paid after this date are not required.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Urgent requests for Certificates</h3>

<p>Under the law, <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> has up to 28 days to issue a Certificate. However, in certain circumstances, a request for a Certificate to be issued urgently may be granted.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span>The Certificate</h3>

<p>A Certificate cannot be treated as being valid prior to the date of the request and will remain in force until the date specified on the Certificate for that purpose (s4 (4)).  The Certificate will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>details of the injured person’s identity and where appropriate the date of the incident which gave rise to the compensation claim</li>
  <li>the total of each recoverable benefit paid up to a specified date</li>
  <li>the total amount of each recoverable lump sum payment paid</li>
  <li>the rate expected to be paid for a short future period if benefit is still in payment</li>
  <li>a note to say whether any of the above amounts or dates have been estimated</li>
  <li>the date the Certificate ceases to be valid</li>
  <li>the total amount to be repaid to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions</li>
</ul>

<p>The law provides that a compensator must apply for a Certificate prior to making a compensation payment. If the compensator settles a compensation claim without a Certificate that covers the actual date of settlement, <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will issue a one day Certificate valid only for the date of settlement. The one day Certificate may include benefits that have not been taken into account during the negotiation process but will be recoverable. It is therefore important that you request a Certificate prior to making a compensation payment.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Important: The validity period of a Certificate varies according to the circumstances of the case.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span>Powers to estimate</h3>

<p>The law allows <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> to estimate any amount, date or period specified in the Certificate (Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997, Section 5(4)) also Reg 4(1)(a) and 9(3) of the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) (Lump Sum Payments) Regulations 2008</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.7 </span>Issue of the Certificate</h3>

<p><abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will send you the Certificate, and, at the same time, a copy will be sent to the injured person or their representative.</p>

<p>You should <a class="govuk-link" href="#reviews-mandatory-reconsideration-and-appeals">write to <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> if you want the Certificate to be looked at again</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.8 </span>Increase of recoverable benefits included on Certificates</h3>

<p><abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> may become aware that further recoverable benefits should have been included on that Certificate that is currently in issue.</p>

<p>During the validity period of a Certificate the amount of recoverable benefit shown cannot be increased, except where the compensator has provided <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> with incorrect or insufficient information.</p>

<p>However, if recoverable benefits are inappropriately omitted from a Certificate, and a compensation payment is not made during the period of validity of that Certificate, the additional recoverable benefits will be listed on any further Certificates issued.</p>

<p><abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will notify you in writing as soon as possible if a future Certificate will be affected as explained above.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.9 </span>Increase of lump sum payments included on Certificates</h3>

<p>If <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> become aware that recoverable lump sum payments have been paid after a Certificate has been issued, a revised Certificate will be issued to include the lump sum payment amount and the revised Certificate will supersede any previous Certificate.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.10 </span>Having the Certificate renewed</h3>

<p>The compensator should only request renewal Certificates when they are ready to settle the claim. Persistent requests for renewal Certificates when the claim is not ready to be settled generates extra work and expense for everyone and may cause delays.</p>

<p><abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> cannot normally issue a new Certificate until the one currently in issue expires. If, however, a compensation claim is close to being settled and the Certificate in issue will expire before the settlement takes place, a request for a renewal Certificate will be considered.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.11 </span>What to do after the Certificate is issued</h3>

<p>Please tell <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> as soon as possible when you know the outcome of the claim even if it was unsuccessful. Form CRU102 should be used for this purpose. Failure to do this may result in you incurring costs for the retrieval of files from storage. <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will not pay the retrieval costs where a compensator has not informed them of the date the compensation payment was made in final discharge of the claim.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> has not been notified about the outcome of a compensation claim after 2 years from when it was registered, <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will issue form CRU250 to ask for an update on the progress of the claim.</p>

<p>When compensation has been paid you must send <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> the form CRU102, together with a cheque for the amount specified on the Certificate. Cheques should be crossed and made payable to ‘Department for Work and Pensions only’ (in Northern Ireland ‘Social Security Agency only’). Do not send a cheque without attaching form CRU102.</p>

<p>Please ensure the correct <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> reference number is shown on the remittance advice note, along with your claim reference number and if possible the incident or accident date or the name of the injured person.</p>

<p>You may send one cheque in respect of any number of claims. In order that <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> may allocate a bulk payment correctly to each case, the cheque must be accompanied by a schedule detailing all the <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> reference numbers and the amount due for each individual case. The total amount on the schedule should be checked to ensure the cheque is for the correct amount. If you choose this option you should bear in mind that the liability to pay <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> arises immediately before making the compensation payment, and the <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> may enforce this debt through the courts at any point from the 15th day following the date the compensation was paid.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.12 </span>Making direct payments to the <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> bank account</h3>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.13 </span>Penalty for default</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may take action against you to secure payment of the recoverable amount if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make a compensation payment but do not apply for a Certificate</li>
  <li>fail to repay the specified amount</li>
</ul>

<p>If you obtain a Certificate and make the appropriate compensation payment but fail to pay the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will send you a reminder. Payment must be made immediately you receive the reminder. If your records show that you have already sent <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> a payment, you should contact <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> immediately providing all of the relevant details (for example, the cheque number or BACs reference number and the date it was cashed). If you have not sent <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> a payment because you do not agree with the amount on the Certificate, then you may <a class="govuk-link" href="#reviews-mandatory-reconsideration-and-appeals">request a review</a>.</p>

<p>In accordance with Section 7-(3)(4)(5) of the 1997 Act, and Regulation 11 of the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) (Lump Sum Payments) Regulations 2008, failure to pay <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> the amount shown on the Certificate may result in legal action being taken against you.</p>

<p>The Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997, Section 6 Liability to pay the Secretary of State amount of benefits, and Section 7 Recovery of payments due under Section 6.

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Professional negligence</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#professional-negligence-1">See the section on Complex cases – Professional negligence</a></p>

<p>If a claim is made in respect of professional negligence and the particulars of claim, statement of claim or letter before action does not include a claim for compensation as a result of the original accident, injury or disease, form CRU1 does not need to be completed. If details of benefits paid are required, a request should be made to the relevant <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefit paying office. If you have already sent a CRU1 for such a case, you should let <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> know as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Where compensation is also to be paid as a result of the original accident, injury or disease, form CRU1 must be submitted by the compensator.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Compensation for criminal injuries</h3>

<p>The Compensation Recovery Scheme does not apply to criminal injuries cases. If details of social security benefits are required they should be obtained from the relevant <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefit paying office.</p>

<p><abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> can only provide details of benefits paid as a result of an accident, injury or disease for which compensation has been claimed.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Complex cases</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Interim payments</h3>

<p>If a compensator makes an interim compensation payment, they are liable to pay <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all recoverable benefits paid up to the date of the interim payment</li>
  <li>any lump sum payments paid up to the date of the interim payment</li>
</ul>

<p>If a further compensation payment is subsequently made in final discharge of the claim, or an agreement is made under which an earlier compensation payment is treated as having been made in final discharge of the claim, the relevant recovery period will end at that time, if it has not already done so. The compensator will also be liable for the repayment of any additional benefits paid during this period.</p>

<p>The compensator should apply for a fresh Certificate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>before making any further payment, or</li>
  <li>reaching an agreement that a previous payment was in final settlement of the claim</li>
</ul>

<p>This Certificate will show details of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all recoverable benefits and lump sum payments</li>
  <li>the balance to be paid by the compensator</li>
</ul>

<p>In cases where there are recoverable benefits and a further compensation payment is made, the compensator may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>aggregate the payments already made with the payments about to be made to <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> and the injured person, and</li>
  <li>use these aggregate amounts when calculating the reductions that may be made under Section 8 of the 1997 Act. See also Regulation 9 of the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Regulations 1997</li>
</ul>

<p>In cases where there are recoverable lump sum payments and a further compensation payment is made, the compensator may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>aggregate the payments already made with the payments about to be made to <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> and to <abbr title="The person claiming compensation under the 2008 Diffuse Mesothelioma Scheme">P</abbr>, and</li>
  <li>use these aggregate amounts when calculating the reductions that may be made under Regulations 10 and 14 of the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) (Lump Sum Payments) Regulations 2008</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>Multiple compensators (multi-comps)</h3>

<p>A multi-comp case is where there is one incident but more than one compensator or insurer involved.</p>

<p>In multi-comp cases the Certificate belongs to the case, not the individual compensator or insurer.</p>

<p>Once a compensation payment is made the compensator or insurer is liable to pay the Secretary of State an amount equal to the amount shown on the Certificate.</p>

<p>Each compensator who makes a payment to the injured person is liable to repay the amount shown on the Certificate at the date of their settlement.</p>

<p>If the settlement date is the same for all compensators involved in the claim they should work together to apportion their individual liability to ensure <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> receives the total amount on the Certificate.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span>Example of a multi-comp settlement</h3>

<p>The claim settles and compensator 1 pays compensation to the injured person before compensator 2. The total amount of recoverable benefits due at the settlement is £10,000.</p>

<p>The compensators have the following agreement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Compensator 1 – 25% liable.</li>
  <li>Compensator 2 – 75% liable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Section 6 (1) of the 1997 Act states; “A person who makes a compensation payment in any case is liable to pay to the Secretary of State an amount equal to the amount of the recoverable benefits”.</p>

<p><abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> receives £2,500 from compensator 1 who is issued with form CRU18A for the outstanding amount. This is because there are no provisions within the 1997 Act that allow for apportionment. When a compensator makes a compensation payment they are liable for the total amount on the Certificate regardless of their percentage liability to the injured person.</p>

<h4>Multi-comp cases involving the Financial Services Compensation Scheme</h4>

<p>The total amount on the Certificate will be pursued and any shortfall created by the involvement of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme must be repaid by the solvent compensators involved in the claim.</p>

<p>Each compensator may make only those reductions to the injured person’s compensation allowed by Section 8 of the 1997 Act and Regulations 10 and 11 of the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) (Lump Sum Payments) Regulations 2008 in relation to the compensation they are paying to the injured person and the benefits and lump sum they are repaying to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003, gives provision for apportionment of liability to pay <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges where more than one compensator is involved.</p>

<p><abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> can apportion the amount of relevant <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges that would be payable if there were only one compensator, if evidence is provided to enable the <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> to determine the liability, of each compensator. Apportionment cannot be applied to the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span>Structured settlements</h3>

<p>If a compensator, in final settlement of a claim, enters into an agreement for the making of periodical compensation payments (whether of an income or capital nature) or for the making of such payments and lump sum payments and those payments would fall to be treated as compensation payments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the date of the agreement will be treated as the day of a single compensation payment and liability will end at that time, if it has not done so already</li>
  <li>any further payments made otherwise than under the agreement will be disregarded for the purpose of determining the end of the relevant period in relation to that further payment</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.5 </span>Payments into court (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)</h3>

<p>Where compensation is paid into court the compensator remains liable to pay any recoverable benefits and lump sum payments due to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The compensator must obtain a Certificate and lodge it with the payment into court. The payment into court should be net of any recoverable benefits and lump sum payments and net of any allowable deductions specified in Schedule 2 of the 1997 Act (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#listed-benefits-recoverable-under-the-1997-act">listed benefits recoverable under the 1997 Act</a>, and <a class="govuk-link" href="#lump-sum-payments-recoverable-under-the-1997-act">lump Sum Payments recoverable under the 1997 Act</a>).</p>

<p>The Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) made amendments to the Civil Procedure Rules, which are incorporated into the 44th update that came into force on 6 April 2007.</p>

<p>One of the main changes was to abolish Part 36 Payments into Court. The policy intent behind the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997 was always to end the relevant period (if it had not already ended) once a payment had been made to the injured party.</p>

<p>The specific intention behind Regulation 8 (Payments into Court) was to cease the relevant period before the injured person received the money but only where a payment had been made into Court. This was on the basis that the compensator had actually paid the money.</p>

<p>Under the new rules there is only an offer, which does not trigger the Act and so the relevant period will end when payment in final discharge is actually made, reflecting what may be described as the core policy of the Act.</p>

<p>Section 16 of the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997 and Regulation 8 of the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Regulations 1997 refer to Payments into court.</p>

<span class="number">7.6 </span>Insurer’s liability</h3>

<p>Further information about cases where the amount of benefits to be repaid and the amount of the compensation exceed the insurer’s maximum liability may be obtained from <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.7 </span>Clinical negligence</h3>

<p>Clinical negligence cases are treated as multiple claims as more than one incident would have occurred.</p>

<p><abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> has a small team of specialists who deal with clinical negligence cases.  This is because consideration must be given to causation and prolongation to determine how much of the benefit was paid as a result of the actual negligence, and how much was paid for the original incident.</p>

<p>It is important that the form CRU1 is submitted as soon as possible after you have been notified of the clinical negligence claim. This will help <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> to provide you with a prompt and accurate service.</p>

<p>You should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/cru">contact <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr>’s Clinical Negligence Team</a> if you want any further information about clinical negligence cases.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.8 </span>Goodwill payments</h3>

<p>A goodwill payment, usually in the form of gift vouchers or the like, is sometimes made in response to a complaint about a product or incident. For example, if someone slips in a retailer’s premises and only suffers a minor injury, inconvenience or embarrassment or if the consumption of foodstuffs is alleged to have caused a stomach complaint.</p>

<p>If such a payment is made at the time of the complaint or incident, <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> does not need to be informed.</p>

<p>However, if such a payment is made at a later date, benefits or <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> treatment may have been received. In these cases, a form CRU1 must be submitted, especially compensation is being sought in respect of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>loss of earnings</li>
  <li>cost of care</li>
  <li>loss of mobility</li>
</ul>

<p>For <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges, where incidents or injuries were caused on or after 29 January 2007, liability to pay <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges arises where a compensation payment is made in respect of an allegation of liability for injuries suffered and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> treatment was received. ‘Compensation payment’ includes not just payments of money but payment in kind, which might include, for example, provision of free rehabilitation services. If such a payment is made, it does not matter if it was made as a goodwill payment as liability to pay <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges would still be incurred. Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="#the-law---nhs-charges">the law – <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges</a> for further information.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.9 </span>Professional negligence</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#professional-negligence">See the section on Requests and notifications not appropriate for <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> – Professional negligence</a></p>

<p>Where a claim is made for professional negligence and the particulars of claim, statement of claim or letter before action includes a claim for compensation as a result of the original accident, injury or disease, form CRU1 must be submitted and any listed benefits and lump sum payment paid in consequence of the original accident, injury or disease will be recoverable.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.10 </span>Property damage only claims</h3>

<p>You must notify <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> on form CRU1 if a claim for property damage includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a claim for loss of earnings</li>
  <li>a loss of mobility</li>
  <li>cost of care</li>
  <li>any other element of compensation</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Guidance for claimants’ representatives</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span>General information</h3>

<p>The compensator will give <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> your details when they notify <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> of your client’s compensation claim.</p>

<p>You should always give the compensator your client’s full name, address, date of birth and, where known, their National Insurance number. You should also provide as much information as possible about the injured person’s injuries or nature of the disease.</p>

<p>If your client has had a road traffic accident or attended hospital for an injury on or after 29 January 2007, it is essential that you provide details of the hospitals attended, and whether the accident happened during the course of the injured person’s employment.</p>

<p>If you give incorrect or incomplete details it may cause delay or inaccuracies in calculating the amount of recoverable benefit and lump sum payment.</p>

<p>If your client has been known by any other name, for example a maiden name, please give details.</p>

<p>Once the <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> are in receipt of all of the necessary information and a Certificate is requested by the compensator, you will be sent a copy of the Certificate when it is issued so that you can verify the information contained and you are in possession of the same information as the compensator.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span>Offsetting of recoverable benefits</h3>

<p>The Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997 (c. 27) includes provisions (Section 8 and 8A) allowing compensators to offset or deduct some of the recoverable benefits that they have to repay from the compensation payment.</p>

<p>The compensation payment can be reduced by the amount of recoverable benefit to the extent that it is paid under the same head of damages. The benefits are allocated to particular heads of damages under Schedule 2 to the Act. No reduction can be made to compensation on account of general damages.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State can not and does not get involved in negotiations between the injured party’s representatives and the compensator. However, customer complaints have highlighted the fact that some claims which were settled on a ‘global basis’ (with reduction on account of benefit and lump sums not being made under Section 8 or 8A) resulted in the subsequent reduction of the recoverable benefit being refunded to the compensator whilst the injured party received no additional money. This is correct and the compensator is in no way acting improperly – it is simply a consequence of the nature of the agreed settlement.</p>

<p><abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> fully appreciate that it is up to the injured party and their representative to negotiate an acceptable offer with the compensator, and in some cases injured parties or their representatives will consider that a global settlement without reference to Section 8 or 8A is in the best interests of the injured party. <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> do not in any way want to influence such decisions or to comment on the merit of any particular settlement.</p>

<p>However, <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> would like to draw your attention to two consequences of applying reductions on account of benefit received that are not calculated and applied under the legislative provisions of Section 8 or 8A. These are that the injured party is not party to any appeal, and, if following review or appeal, recoverable benefits are reduced, the refund will be paid to the compensator and not passed on to the injured party.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span>Offsetting of recoverable lump sums</h3>

<p>In addition to the offsetting of recoverable benefits, Regulations 12 and 12A of the 2008 Lump Sum payment regulations provide for the compensation payment to be reduced by the amount of the recoverable lump sum payment. This is not subject to heads of damage.</p>

<p>Under the provisions of the Mesothelioma Act 2014 any compensation payment made under the Diffuse Mesothelioma Payment Scheme is to be reduced by the amount of the recoverable benefit, in addition to any recoverable lump sum payment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.4 </span>Reviews and appeals</h3>

<p>If the injured person disagrees with the amount of benefit and or lump sum payment specified on the Certificate, they may ask for it to be reviewed (see Section 6 Reviews and Appeals). If necessary a fresh Certificate will be issued.</p>

<p>The injured person may also appeal against a Certificate. An appeal cannot be made until after final settlement of the claim and the compensator has repaid the total amount of recoverable benefits and or lump sum payments to the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>An injured person may only appeal if the amount of compensation they receive was reduced by the compensator to take account of benefit and or lump sum payment recovery in accordance with Section 8 or 8A of the 1997 Act and Regulation 12 or 12A of the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) (Lump Sum Payments) Regulations 2008.</p>

<p>If an appeal is made by either party and the amount of recoverable benefit is reduced then the Secretary of State will refund the relevant amount to the compensator. If there has been a reduction in the compensation under Section 8 or 8A or 12 and 12A then the compensator is obliged to recalculate the compensation award and make any necessary refund to the injured person. For recoverable benefits, if no offset has been made or the offset has been made, but not under Section 8 or 8A, then the compensator can retain the refund.</p>

<p>Regulation 4 of the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Regulations 1997 and Regulation 16 of the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) (Lump Sum Payments) Regulations 2008 refers to information to be provided by the injured person.</p>

<p>If you are pursuing a claim for professional negligence or criminal injuries compensation, or need benefit details outside the five-year statutory period on behalf of your client please contact their benefit paying office.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Reviews, mandatory reconsideration and appeals</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span>Reviews</h3>

<p>The compensator, the injured person, or either party’s representative may ask <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> to review any aspect of a Certificate at any time. A review request should be made in writing and must give the reasons why it is thought the Certificate is wrong. Any evidence that is thought to be helpful should also be included with the review request.</p>

<p>A review may be made on the following grounds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Certificate was issued in ignorance of, or based on a mistake as to, a material fact</li>
  <li>a mistake was made (whether in computation or otherwise) in the preparation of the Certificate</li>
  <li>incorrect or insufficient information was supplied to the Secretary of State by the person who applied for the Certificate and, as a result, the amount of benefit or lump sum payment specified in the Certificate was less than it would have been had the information supplied been correct or sufficient</li>
  <li>a ground for appeal is satisfied under Section 11 of the 1997 Act</li>
</ul>

<p>When a Certificate is reviewed, <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> looks at all the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>benefits and lump sum payments listed as recoverable</li>
  <li>amounts paid</li>
  <li>periods over which they have been or are likely to be paid</li>
</ul>

<p>Any errors, omissions or other changes, which may affect the outcome of the review, will be taken into account, even if they are unrelated to the reasons for requesting the review.</p>

<p>Once the review is complete, <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will take one of the following actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirm in writing that the Certificate is correct</li>
  <li>revoke the Certificate and issue a fresh one</li>
  <li>change the Certificate and issue a fresh one</li>
</ul>

<p>If a revised Certificate is issued, it will cover the same period as the Certificate it replaces.</p>

<p>A fresh Certificate showing an increase in the amount of recoverable benefits will only be issued if the person who applied for the Certificate gave <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> incorrect or insufficient information. If this happens, the compensator will be liable to pay the difference to <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Lump sum payments</h4>

<p>If <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> become aware that recoverable lump sum payments have been paid after a Certificate has been issued, a revised Certificate will be issued to include the lump sum payment amount. The revised Certificate will supersede any previous Certificate.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span>Mandatory reconsideration</h3>

<p>This section deals with the steps to follow if the compensation claim is settled and the Compensator has paid <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> all the monies due as listed on the Certificate.</p>

<p>The Welfare Reform Act 2012 introduced changes from 28 October 2013 to the appeals process so that more disputes against <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> decisions can be resolved without the need for referral to Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service">HMCTS</abbr>). The key changes to the appeals process from the above date are mandatory reconsideration and direct lodgement.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> must be given the opportunity to formally reconsider its decision before an appeal can be made. This is known as mandatory reconsideration. You should, therefore, ask <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> for a mandatory reconsideration if you want the Certificate to be looked at again. <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will then look at all of the evidence and decide if the Certificate should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>changed and a partial refund issued</li>
  <li>revoked and a full refund issued</li>
  <li>confirmed as correct</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be given an explanation of the decision in writing. This is known as a mandatory reconsideration notice.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You must ask for a mandatory reconsideration within one month of paying CRU the money due as listed on the Certificate.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.3 </span>Appeals</h3>

<p>If you still think the Certificate is wrong after you have received your mandatory reconsideration notice, you can make an appeal.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>An appeal cannot be made until the compensation claim is settled and all monies due as listed on the Certificate have been paid in full to the CRU.</p>
</div>

<p>An appeal may be made by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a compensator</li>
  <li>an injured person whose compensation payment was reduced in accordance with section 8 or 8A of the 1997 Act or Regulation 12 or 12A of the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) (Lump Sum Payments) Regulations 2008</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The injured person (or their representative) must provide documentary evidence, such as the Consent Order, to confirm that a section 8 etc. deduction was made on their compensation payment.</p>
</div>

<p>Your appeal must be made in writing and sent directly to <abbr title="Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service">HMCTS</abbr>. You will be sent 2 copies of the mandatory reconsideration notice, one to be sent with your appeal and one for you to keep. Your appeal will not go ahead unless you include a copy of this notification with your appeal. The mandatory reconsideration notice will also tell you where to send your appeal form.</p>

<p>You must make your appeal within one month after the date the mandatory reconsideration notice was sent to you. If your appeal is late, <abbr title="Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service">HMCTS</abbr> may ask you to explain why it was not made on time. Your appeal may not be allowed to go ahead if you do not have a good reason why it was late.</p>

<p>An appeal must be made on one or more of the following grounds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any amount, rate or period specified in the Certificate is wrong</li>
  <li>the Certificate shows benefits and lump sum payments which were not paid as a result of the accident, injury or disease</li>
  <li>benefits and lump sum payments listed which have not and are not likely to be paid to the injured person have been brought into account</li>
  <li>the compensation payment made was not as a consequence of the accident, injury or disease</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use the tribunal’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-sscs3-notice-of-appeal-against-a-decision-of-the-department-for-work-and-pensions-compensation-recovery-unit">Notice of Appeal form</a> to make your appeal.</p>

<p>Using this form will help you to make sure that all the information the tribunal needs is included.</p>

<p>After <abbr title="Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service">HMCTS</abbr> has received your appeal and mandatory reconsideration notice, they will ask the <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> to prepare a written response to the appeal.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>CRU will treat a request for an appeal that does not comply with the above grounds as being invalid and refer it back to HMCTS with a request for it to be struck out. A tribunal judge will then decide if the appeal can be accepted as being valid.</p>
</div>

<p>Recovery of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges is subject to 2 separate schemes, governed by separate legislation. The guidance below relates to cases where the incident occurred on or after 29 January 2007, however it will also largely apply to accidents that occurred prior to 29 January 2007. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#road-traffic-accidents-occurring-prior-to-29-january-2007">specific information relating to accidents (<abbr title="road traffic accident">RTA</abbr> cases only) that occurred prior to 29 January 2007</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.2 </span>Personal Injury cases occurring on or after 29 January 2007</h3>

<p>For personal injury compensation claims with a date of incident on or after 29 January 2007 <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/43/part/3" rel="external">Part 3 of The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003</a> applies (“The 2003 Act”). A person is liable to pay the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges if they make a compensation payment in consequence of any injury suffered where the injured person has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>received <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> treatment at an <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> hospital</li>
  <li>been provided with <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> ambulance services</li>
</ul>

<p>In this instance the injury may be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>physical</li>
  <li>psychological</li>
</ul>

<p>In <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/43/part/3" rel="external">Section 150 (3) of The 2003 Act</a>, a compensation payment is defined as a payment, made:</p>

<ul>
  <li>by, or on behalf of, a person who is, or is alleged to be, liable to any extent in respect of the injury, or</li>
  <li>in pursuit of a compensation scheme for motor accidents</li>
</ul>

<p>The definition of ‘compensation payment’ covers any payment made, even where liability is denied or payment is made in respect of costs only, for example. The definition also includes payments made in money’s worth, which would include, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gift vouchers</li>
  <li>providing physiotherapy</li>
</ul>

<p>These would constitute a compensation payment.</p>

<p>Although disease cases are generally not included in the recovery scheme, <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/43/part/3" rel="external">Section 150 (5) and (6) of The 2003 Act</a> does allow recovery in disease cases where the disease in question is directly attributable to an injury suffered by the claimant.</p>

<p>The 2003 Act applies to almost all compensators. The provisions under the 2003 Act are not restricted to payments made as a result of being an authorised insurer (as applicable to incidents occurring prior to 29 January 2007). The person making the payment in the compensation claim will be liable to pay the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges. This includes the general public, as well as businesses and other organisations.</p>

<p>The 2003 Act applies to cases involving foreign nationals, foreign compensators and for incidents and injuries sustained abroad, where <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> treatment and ambulance services were provided to the injured person on their return to England, Scotland or Wales.</p>

<p>When completing the CRU1 form to notify <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> of a claim for compensation ensure that, where appropriate, it contains the name and address of the hospital where treatment was provided as a result of the incident. This is a requirement of <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/43/section/160" rel="external">Section 160 of The 2003 Act</a> and is subject to compliance checking.</p>

<p>For incidents that happened before 29 January 2007 you should only notify the <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> hospital details where the incident involved the use of a motor vehicle on a road. This could include cases registered as Employer or Public liability.</p>

<p>When <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> receive the hospital details they will immediately begin their enquiries with the relevant trust to establish the treatment that was provided. Where <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> are not given enough information for the trust to trace the relevant treatment, the <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will need to make further enquiries with the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>compensator</li>
  <li>injured person’s representative, or</li>
  <li>the injured person directly</li>
</ul>

<p>These enquiries can be lengthy and the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Certificate cannot be issued until they are complete. It is therefore essential that accurate information be provided to <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> at the outset.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will not issue the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges until the compensator requests it and enquiries are complete, unless the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> enquiries are complete when a <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> Certificate is issued. When issued, the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges will normally be valid from the date of the incident until a final compensation payment is made.</p>

<p>The compensator must pay the amount shown on the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges to <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> within 14 days of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>making a compensation payment (interim or final), or</li>
  <li>the issue of the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges, if that is after the date of the compensation payment</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will repay the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges directly to the responsible <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> body and ambulance service that provided treatment or ambulance services, within 40 days of receipt.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.4 </span>
<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges tariff</h3>

<p>The amount of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges will depend on when the incident or injury occurred. The charges will relate to either treatment provided with admission to hospital or treatment provided without admission to hospital, but not both. This is because outpatient treatment is superseded by inpatient treatment.</p>

<p>‘With admission’ charges are calculated according to the number of days the injured person stayed in hospital. This is subject to a minimum of one day when the casualty is released on the day of admission. This is known as a ‘day case’ and therefore inpatient treatment does not necessarily involve an overnight stay. Where the casualty is admitted to hospital for more than one day the date of discharge is not included in the calculation.</p>

<p>Under the 2003 Act, ambulance charges for the purposes of transporting the patient to hospital are recoverable per person, per journey, regardless of numbers carried by an individual ambulance. This applies to each ambulance journey to hospital, or transfer between hospitals, in relation to treatment of the injuries for which compensation is paid. The ambulance charge will only apply to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> ambulance journeys and does not include the charity funded air ambulances.</p>

<p>There is a limit to the amount of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges that can be recovered which is known as the “capped” tariff amount. The tariff for treatment and ambulance costs is reviewed each financial year.</p>

<p>*For Scottish cases, the effective date for increased charges is 12 June 2009</p>

<h4>An example of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges</h4>

<p>A patient had an accident on 10 September 2009 and was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>taken by ambulance to Accident and Emergency to hospital A where they were treated as an outpatient</li>
  <li>transferred and admitted to hospital B for 7 days</li>
  <li>transferred again to a specialist unit in hospital C for 10 days</li>
</ul>

<p>All 3 ambulance charges would be recoverable (a total of £513) as would treatment at hospital B and C (total of 17 days inpatient amounting to £11,815). The Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges would be for £12,328. Outpatient treatment at hospital A is disregarded as superseded by inpatient treatment.</p>

<p>Had the injury led to 100 days treatment at hospital C, the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> certificate would show a total charge of £74,878 capped at £41,545.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.6 </span>The relevant <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> recovery period</h3>

<p>The period in respect of which <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges may be recovered by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> begins on the first day that treatment was provided following the incident.</p>

<p>The period ends on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the day a compensation payment is made in final discharge of a claim</li>
  <li>the date an agreement is made under which an earlier compensation payment is treated as having made in final discharge of any claim, or</li>
  <li>when the appropriate tariff limit is reached</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.7 </span>
<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> exempt payments</h3>

<p>Please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/43/schedule/10" rel="external">Schedule 10 of Part 3 of the 2003 Act</a> for listed exemptions of repayment of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges.</p>

<p>If you consider your client is exempt from repayment of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges, please let <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> know, providing all relevant information. You need to do this on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>A compensator who is exempt from repayment of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges will not be issued with a Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges, unless <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> has been notified of the exemption after a Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges has been issued. In these circumstances, <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will revoke the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges and issue a fresh copy. You must therefore inform the <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> if you receive a Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges on a case that you consider to be exempt.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.8 </span>The Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges</h3>

<p>Separate legislation covers the recovery of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges and the recovery of benefits schemes. Therefore, the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges is issued separately to the benefits Certificate.</p>

<p>There is no time limit in the legislation in which <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> must issue the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges. <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will issue the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges as soon as is reasonably practicable.</p>

<p>The compensator does not have to be in possession of the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Certificate at the time they settle the injured person’s compensation claim as the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges cannot be offset against the compensation payment awarded. Therefore, the amount of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges should not be relevant to the negotiation process. However, if the compensator has not already applied for a Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges, they must do so within 14 days of making the compensation payment.</p>

<p>Please contact <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> if you requested a Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges, but did not receive it by the time of making a final compensation payment. This is particularly important if you notified <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> of hospital attendance and expect <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges to have been incurred. We will tell you if the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges has been issued or if enquiries are still ongoing. This will help to avoid you receiving a demand for payment after your file has been closed.</p>

<p><abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will issue a Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges for all cases (except disease claims) that occurred after 29 January 2007. Therefore, if you have not received your Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges, you should not assume that there are no charges to pay.</p>

<p>The Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>details of the injured person’s identity</li>
  <li>the date of personal injury which gave rise to the compensation claim</li>
  <li>the name and responsible body (<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Trust or Health Board) at which the treatment took place</li>
  <li>details of the amount of treatment provided, with or without admission</li>
  <li>the name of the responsible ambulance trust who provided the service</li>
  <li>the validity period of the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges</li>
  <li>the total <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges due to be repaid up to the maximum recoverable amount</li>
</ul>

<p>If there is more than one compensator involved in the compensation claim, provisions under the 2003 Act allow apportionment of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges between the compensators. Please advise <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> as soon as possible if you are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apportioning liability with one or more compensators</li>
  <li>not working together with one compensator co-ordinating</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will then advise you of the evidence of the agreement over liability that must be provided before a revised Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges can be issued.</p>

<p>A Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges will usually, be valid for the life of the claim. If the compensator advises that no <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> treatment was provided, then <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will issue a nil Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges. It should be noted that <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> performs compliance checks, and where treatment is identified, a revised Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges may be issued. The revised <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Certificate will supersede the previous Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges. This procedure also applies to those cases which have already been settled.</p>

<p>Please tell <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> as soon as possible when you know the outcome of the compensation claim, even if you did not make a compensation payment or you are in possession of a ‘nil’ certificate. This will allow us to close our records. Form CRU102, which accompanies the <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> Certificate should be used for this.</p>

<p>Payment of the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges should only be sent to <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> when a compensation payment has been made to the injured person. If you send a payment to <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr>, and a compensation payment has not been made to the injured person, <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will refund the payment. The compensator will then be required to resubmit payment at the appropriate time.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.9 </span>Changes to the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges</h3>

<p>Normally the amount of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges, contained in the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges, cannot be increased where <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> has been supplied with the information in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/43/section/160" rel="external">Section 160 of The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003</a>/<a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2006/20063388.htm" rel="external">regulation 5 of The Personal Injuries (<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Charges) (General) and Road Traffic (<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Charges) (Amendment) Regulations 2006</a>.</p>

<p>If a compensator has provided <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> with incorrect or insufficient information, the <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> is legally entitled to increase the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges. <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/43/section/156" rel="external">Section 156 (6) of The 2003 Act</a>. Therefore, <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> can increase the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges if incorrect details are provided regarding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the injured person</li>
  <li>the injury</li>
  <li>the date of incident</li>
  <li>the hospital details</li>
  <li>any other material fact</li>
</ul>

<p>There are no time limits for compensator error reviews. We can conduct an error review after the compensator has settled the claim.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.10 </span>
<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> reviews</h3>

<p>If you think that the information on the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges is wrong, you can ask <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> to look at the case again by way of a review. A review request should be made in writing and must provide the reasons why you think the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges is wrong. Any relevant evidence that is thought to be helpful should also be included with the review request.</p>

<p>For incidents after 29 January 2007, Section 156 of the 2003 Act and <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2006/20063398.htm" rel="external">The Personal Injuries (<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Charges) (Reviews and Appeals) and Road Traffic (<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Charges) (Reviews and Appeals) (Amendment) Regulations 2006</a> provide that a review request must be submitted:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whilst the claim is live</li>
  <li>within three months from the date that the compensation payment was made to the injured person, or</li>
  <li>within three months of the issue of the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges if it was issued after the final compensation payment was made to the claimant</li>
</ul>

<p>A review may be made on the following grounds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a mistake (whether in computation or otherwise) occurred in the preparation of the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges</li>
  <li>the amount specified in the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges is in excess of the amount due</li>
  <li>it appears that a ground for appeal is satisfied</li>
</ul>

<p>When a review request is received, <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will look at the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges recorded</li>
  <li>the information provided by the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Trust, Ambulance Trust or Health Board</li>
</ul>

<p>Any errors, omissions or other changes, which may affect the outcome of the review, will be taken into account, even if unrelated to your reasons for requesting the review.</p>

<p>If there is no reason to change the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges, <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will ask the appropriate <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Trust or Health Board to check their records and confirm that the treatment details provided are correct, and relate to the incident for which compensation has been claimed.</p>

<p>Once the review is complete, <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirm in writing that the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges is correct</li>
  <li>revoke or change the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges and issue a revised version</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> can only increase the total amount of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges when the compensator has provided incorrect or insufficient information. Where this occurs the compensator will be liable to pay the difference to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#changes-to-the-certificate-of-nhs-charges">Changes to the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The Welfare Reform Act 2012 introduced changes to the appeals process so that more disputes against <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> decisions can be resolved without the need for referral to Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service">HMCTS</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="#appeals">Appeals section</a> explains the changes to the appeals process for <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> Certificates from 28 October 2013. The key changes are mandatory reconsideration and direct lodgement. However, Certificates of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges are not subject to mandatory reconsideration but are subject to direct lodgement to <abbr title="Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service">HMCTS</abbr> from 7 November 2013.</p>

<p>If you think that the information on the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges is wrong, you can still ask <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> to look at the case again, by way of a review, before you consider making an appeal.</p>

<p>A review request should be made in writing and must provide the reasons why you think the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges is wrong. Any relevant evidence that is thought to be helpful should also be included with the review request – please see <a class="govuk-link" href="#nhs-reviews"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> reviews</a> for further information.</p>

<p>If you think the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges is wrong following a review, you can make an appeal. Your appeal must be made in writing, giving reasons why you think the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges is wrong. You should use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-sscs3-notice-of-appeal-against-a-decision-of-the-department-for-work-and-pensions-compensation-recovery-unit">appeal form for Compensation Recovery Unit on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>Your appeal must be sent directly to <abbr title="Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service">HMCTS</abbr>. The address to send your appeal to is on the form. You must also include a copy of the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges with your appeal, otherwise <abbr title="Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service">HMCTS</abbr> will send it back to you.</p>

<p>You must make your appeal no later than 3 calendar months after the latest of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the date on the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges, or</li>
  <li>the date on which the compensation payment was made to the injured person, or</li>
  <li>if the Certificate has been reviewed, the date the Certificate was confirmed or a fresh Certificate was issued</li>
</ul>

<p>If your appeal is late, <abbr title="Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service">HMCTS</abbr> will contact you to ask why it was not made on time. Your appeal may not be allowed to go ahead if you do not have a good reason why it was late.</p>

<p>An appeal must be made on one or more of the following grounds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an amount specified in the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges is incorrect</li>
  <li>an amount specified takes into account treatment which is not <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> treatment received by the injured person, in respect of their injury, at an <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> hospital</li>
  <li>the ambulance which transported or treated the injured person, is not an <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> ambulance service</li>
  <li>the payment on the basis of which the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges was issued is not a compensation payment</li>
</ul>

<p>After <abbr title="Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service">HMCTS</abbr> has received your appeal and Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges, they will ask <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> to provide a written response to the appeal.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>CRU will treat a request for an appeal that does not comply with the above grounds as being invalid and will refer it back to HMCTS with a request for it to be struck out. A tribunal judge will then decide if the appeal can be accepted.</p>
</div>

<h4>Waiver applications</h4>

<p>In cases of exceptional financial hardship, the requirement to pay <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges, before an appeal can be made, may be waived. An application for a waiver must be sent to <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> no later than 3 months after the date on the Certificate, or if later, the date on which the compensation payment was made. The application must also provide details of the exceptional financial hardship that would be caused if <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges were paid.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>A decision to waive the requirement to pay NHS charges before an appeal is made does not signify that payment of NHS charges will be waived if a tribunal confirms the Certificate of NHS charges.</p>
</div>

<p>The tribunal may decide that the amount on a Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges is correct or it may increase or decrease the amount of charges to be paid.</p>

<p>Following the decision of the tribunal, <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirm the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges</li>
  <li>issue a revised Certificate</li>
  <li>revoke the Certificate</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Where the amount on a Certificate of NHS charges is increased following an appeal the compensator will be liable to pay the balance of NHS charges to DWP.</p>
</div>

<p>Where the amount on the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Certificate is reduced, the balance will be recovered from the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Trust, Ambulance Trust or Health Board and will be refunded to the compensator.</p>

<p>An appeal to the Upper Tribunal against the decision of an appeal tribunal may be made on the grounds that the appeal tribunal’s decision was erroneous in law. An appeal can be made by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Compensator</li>
  <li>the Secretary of State</li>
  <li>Scottish Ministers</li>
</ul>

<p>Before you can appeal to the Upper Tribunal, you must have received a written statement of the appeal tribunal’s decision, and applied to <abbr title="Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service">HMCTS</abbr> for permission to appeal.</p>

<p>The appeal tribunal will send you details of how to appeal and the time limits after your appeal has been heard.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.1 </span>Contributory negligence</h3>

<p>The 2003 Act allows for a reduction in the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges to take account of contributory negligence in cases where the amount of compensation paid to the claimant has been reduced to reflect their proportion of responsibility for their injuries. The provision is not retrospective and only applies to incidents that happened after 29 January 2007. This provision only relates to the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges and is not part of <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1997/ukpga_19970027_en_1" rel="external">The Recovery of Benefits Act 1997</a> – the recoverable benefits cannot be reduced in the same way.</p>

<p>The following legislation covers Contributory Negligence reviews:</p>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/43/section/153" rel="external">Section 153 (10) of The 2003 Act</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.2 </span>Contributory negligence – the process</h3>

<p>A claim for a reduction in the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges is defined as a qualifying claim where there is an agreement by the injured person that damages payable under the terms of settlement are to be reduced to reflect their share of responsibility for the injury and a final compensation payment is made.</p>

<p><abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> need evidence that the injured person has accepted this as part of the settlement terms. Therefore a revised Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges can only be applied for when the claim is fully settled.</p>

<p>There are specific review regulations regarding contributory negligence claims. These mean that the evidence in support of the review must be sent to <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> within 3 months of the claim becoming a qualifying claim, unless the reduction for contributory negligence resulted from a Court Order. In most cases this will be 3 months from the date of the final compensation payment to the injured person.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of a review request <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will check the evidence and, if acceptable, issue a new Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges stating the revised amount of charges owed. When notifying <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> of contributory negligence some compensators work out the reduction before requesting the review and send in the charges with their evidence.</p>

<p>If this is done the percentage of the contributory negligence will be rounded up or down to the nearest full percentage point. If a claimant has accepted one-third of the responsibility the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges would be reduced to 67% of the total. If the claimant accepted they were two-thirds responsible, the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges would be reduced to 33%.</p>

<p>This is to make the calculation of charges as straightforward as possible as the amount owed would vary depending upon whether it was calculated as 66.7%, 66.67% or 66.667%. This could lead to a variation in the amount owed, depending upon the original <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charge.</p>

<p>We consider this to be fair to both the compensator and the trust that provided treatment as the charges may be rounded up or down. Where the compensator does not round to the nearest full percentage point we will need to issue a refund or request further payment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.3 </span>Contributory negligence – evidence required</h3>

<p>Before <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> can review the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges, we must be satisfied that the claimant has accepted:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that they were partly responsible for their injuries, and</li>
  <li>a reduction in their compensation due to their responsibility</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the issue of contributory negligence was settled outside of the Court process, the legislation states that <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> must be sent a signed report. This should include a statement that it is agreed by the claimant that their damages are to be reduced to reflect their share of the responsibility. It also needs to clearly demonstrate how much the damages have been reduced by. This can either show the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>percentage of responsibility accepted</li>
  <li>amount that:
    <ul>
      <li>would have been paid had there been no contributory negligence, and</li>
      <li>was paid due to the contributory negligence</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> reduce the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges by the same proportion as the reduction in damages, this proportion must be clearly demonstrated. We cannot allow the review where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the amount or percentage of the reduction is not documented</li>
  <li>there is no signed acceptance from the injured person’s side</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> try and be flexible in the evidence we accept and will consider, for example, a report detailing the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>agreement signed by both sides</li>
  <li>offer and acceptance letters that clearly show the:</li>
  <li>acceptance of responsibility by the claimant</li>
  <li>amounts or percentage of agreed responsibility involved</li>
</ul>

<p>The legislation stipulates a signed report. Therefore <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> cannot accept notes from a telephone call or email exchanges (unless printed and signed by the claimant to demonstrate acceptance of the terms). If you intend to request a reduction in the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges, you need to consider how the agreement with the claimant is documented.</p>

<p>The evidence must refer to a reduction in the payment of damages on account of the claimant’s share of responsibility for the accident. <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> cannot allow the review where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a reduction in damages has been agreed to speed up the negotiation process</li>
  <li>it is stated that the claimant does not accept any blame</li>
</ul>

<p>The legislation allows for a reduction only in cases where the claimant has agreed, in a fair manner, that they were partly responsible. Where it is apparent that no degree of responsibility has been accepted by the claimant the review request will be disallowed.</p>

<p>In response to customer feedback <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> have produced an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compensation-recovery-unit-forms"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges, contributory negligence: request liability review form – CRU1503</a> that compensators can use when their negotiation process has not produced the required evidence. Where the information is provided and it is signed by the claimant or their representative (it cannot be signed electronically), it should provide satisfactory evidence to allow <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> to review the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Certificate. It is not mandatory to use this form. <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> continue to offer compensators the flexibility in providing their evidence as long as it meets the requirements contained in Section 3 of <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2006/20063388.htm" rel="external">The Personal Injuries (<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Charges) (General) and Road Traffic (<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Charges) (Amendment) Regulations 2006</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.4 </span>Goodwill or ex gratia payments</h3>

<p>Liability to pay <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges arises where a compensation payment is made in consequence of an injury, whether physical or psychological.</p>

<p>The term compensation payment is defined as a payment made:</p>

<ul>
  <li>by, or on behalf of, a person who is, or is alleged to be, liable to any extent in respect of the injury, or</li>
  <li>in pursuit of a compensation scheme for motor accidents</li>
</ul>

<p>The term includes payment of costs only, and payment in money’s worth, which would include, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gift vouchers</li>
  <li>providing physiotherapy</li>
</ul>

<p>The legislation is clear that liability to pay <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges arises in cases where there is an allegation of liability for an injury and any form of payment follows. Legislation explicitly states that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>liability to pay <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges arises from making voluntary payments, and</li>
  <li>it is irrelevant whether compensation payments are made with or without an admission of liability</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030043_en_10#pt3-pb1-l1g150" rel="external">Section 150 of the 2003 Act</a> applies.</p>

<p>The explanatory notes which accompany the act state that ex gratia payments are not covered by the scheme. The definition of an ex gratia payment is a payment where there could be no liability in law to make a compensation payment. It would include scenarios such as diplomatic immunity or personal claims against the Queen.</p>

<p>Payments made in cases where there could be a liability in law (as opposed to fact) are therefore not ex gratia cases, and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges are payable. A payment made whilst denying liability is not considered to be an ex gratia payment and liability to pay <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges would be incurred.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.5 </span>Interim compensation payments</h3>

<p>When a compensator makes a compensation payment they will be liable to repay any <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges incurred up to the date of that payment. The legislation states that liability to pay <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges is triggered by making a compensation payment. It does not specify a final compensation payment. <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/43/part/3" rel="external">Section 150 of The 2003 Act</a> refers.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.6 </span>Fatal accidents and The Fatal Accidents Act 1976</h3>

<p>For accidents which occurred on or after 29 January 2007, <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges will not be recoverable for fatal accidents where compensation has been paid solely in accordance with The Fatal Accidents Act 1976. However, if compensation (or an element) was paid under The Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934, there will be a liability to pay <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges.</p>

<p>As <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will not be aware of the Act that the claim is being made under, we will always issue a Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges in these cases. You will need to notify <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> if you consider that <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges are not payable and provide the documentation which demonstrates that the compensation payment was made solely under The Fatal Accidents Act 1976. <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> will not be able to review the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> certificate without this confirmation.</p>

<p>The Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 allows claims to be made on behalf of the deceased’s estate. These may have been made for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pain, suffering and loss suffered by the deceased</li>
  <li>loss of earnings and cost of care prior to their death</li>
</ul>

<p>The Fatal Accidents Act 1976 gives an independent right of action to relatives or ‘dependants’ of the deceased. This will typically involve things like the costs incurred or loss of income as a result of the death. The compensator will need to demonstrate that any payment was made solely under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 if they feel that the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges are not recoverable. <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges will be recoverable where no evidence can be provided of the Act under which payment was made.</p>

<p>Regardless of the Act under which the compensation payment falls no <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges are payable where the injured person has been declared dead on arrival at the hospital.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.7 </span>Frequently asked questions</h3>

<h4>Who is liable to pay <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges?</h4>

<p>From the 29 January 2007 anyone who is, or is alleged to be, liable for an injury (physical or psychological) and then makes a compensation payment is liable for the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges, regardless of what that payment is for. This applies to individuals as well as businesses and other organisations. The only exceptions are where there could be no liability in law (diplomatic immunity etc.) and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Trusts where they also provided the treatment.</p>

<p>For incidents prior to 29 January 2007, only compensation payments involving the use of a motor vehicle on the road would attract the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges. Cases registered as Employer and Public liability claims may incur liability if the use of a motor vehicle was involved, depending upon the type of insurance policy from which compensation was paid. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#road-traffic-accidents-occurring-prior-to-29-january-2007">road traffic accidents occurring prior to 29 January 2007</a> for further information.</p>

<h4>Will the claimant make up the difference in cases where the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges has been reduced to reflect contributory negligence?</h4>

<p>No. The hospital that provided treatment receives a reduced payment. <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> therefore need to see the appropriate evidence to show why the payment has been reduced.</p>

<h4>Does contributory negligence apply to <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> benefits?</h4>

<p>No. The provision to reduce <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges to reflect the claimant’s share of responsibility is only contained in the Health and Social Care (Community Health Standards) Act 2003 and therefore does not affect <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> benefits. It only applies to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges for incidents occurring on or after 29 January 2007.</p>

<h4>Why can’t emails or telephone conversation notes be used as evidence in contributory negligence cases?</h4>

<p>The relevant legislation stipulates that <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> must have a signed report detailing the terms of the agreement and that those terms were agreed in a fair and open manner. Email and telephone notes do not constitute a signed report.</p>

<h4>The claimant accepted they were one-third responsible for their injuries and we paid accordingly.  Why did you ask for more money?</h4>

<p>Contributory negligence figures are subject to rounding up or down to the nearest full percentage point. The <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> system automatically recognises a shortfall or overpayment and issues a notification accordingly.</p>

<h4>Why did I not receive my Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges in 28 days?</h4>

<p>There is no legislative time limit for the issue of the Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges. This is because it can take significantly longer for <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> to complete their enquiries, especially where <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> need to contact the claimant for further information if the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Trust have difficulty in tracing the treatment provided.</p>

<p><abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> may also be aware of a future operation or ongoing treatment related to the incident and would therefore refrain from issuing the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Certificate until complete or, if sooner, when a final compensation payment was made. The Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges is normally valid for the life of the claim, unless <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> discover any further information that should have been provided earlier, and therefore <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> need to ensure it is accurate before it is issued.</p>

<p>A Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges is not required prior to settlement as the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges cannot be offset against the compensation payment. However if the claim is settled without processing a Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges you must apply for one immediately, if you have not already done so.</p>

<p>You can help <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> speed up the process by providing relevant and accurate information when registering the claim. Claims should be notified to <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> as soon as you receive them. If any hospital details are established after this, then they must be forwarded to <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> immediately.</p>

<h4>I have only received a ‘nil’ benefits Certificate. Does that mean there are no <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges even though I notified <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> of a hospital?</h4>

<p>No. Because the recovery of benefits and the recovery of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges are covered by separate legislation you will receive separate Certificates. A ‘nil’ Certificate relates to the benefits only. A Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges will be issued in all cases where the date of incident was after 29 January 2007 (except for disease claims).</p>

<h4>I have not received my Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges. What should I do?</h4>

<p>As stated above a Certificate of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges will be issued for all cases registered with <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr>, other than disease claims. However, the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Certificate may take longer to issue than the benefits Certificate. Therefore, you should contact <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> for an update on the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Certificate to see if it has been issued or if enquiries are ongoing. This is particularly the case where you have notified <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> treatment. We recommend you do this before you close your file.</p>

<p>An appeal for incidents which occurred before 29 January 2007 must be made within 3 months of the date on which the compensator made full repayment of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges to <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr>. Repayment of charges before appeal cannot be waived.</p>

<h4>Fatal accidents</h4>

<p><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges are recoverable in fatal accident cases occurring before 29 January 2007 including cases where a compensation payment is made in accordance with the Fatal Accidents Act 1976.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges will not be levied when the victim was certified dead on arrival at the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> hospital.</p>

<h4>Foreign compensators</h4>

<p>Where the accident took place on a road in Great Britain involving a foreign compensator, charges will not be payable where compensation is paid from a policy issued outside of Great Britain. Where an accident occurred abroad it is unlikely that <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges will be recoverable if <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> treatment was involved, as the accident is likely to involve a foreign compensator from outside of Great Britain. <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> treatment received by a foreign national in the UK could attract <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges where compensation was paid from a Great Britain based insurance policy.</p>

<span class="number">12. </span>The law in Northern Ireland – <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.1 </span>
<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> cases involving Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>The law on the Health Services charges scheme in Northern Ireland (<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>) is contained in part II of the Health and Personal Social Services Act (<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>) 2001. This Act equates to the Road Traffic (<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Charges) Act 1999 and introduced changes in respect of the recovery of Health Services (HS) hospital charges arising from road traffic accidents. The administrative arrangements introduced by the Act apply to all compensation payments made on or after 2 April 2001 irrespective of the incident date. However, the charges vary depending on the incident date.</p>

<p>In line with the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> scheme, the <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> scheme was expanded on 29 January 2007.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.2 </span>Injured person resident in Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>Where the injured person is a resident of Northern Ireland, for benefit recovery purposes the claim is handled by the Northern Ireland Compensation Recovery Unit. Where treatment has been provided at a hospital in England, Scotland or Wales, the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Compensation Recovery Unit (<abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>) will need to be involved to recover any potential <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges. The following procedures are in place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on receipt of a CRU1 from the compensator the claim will be taken onto both <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> and <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> systems, and you will be notified that this has been done</li>
  <li>the claim will have 2 reference numbers, one relating to the <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> (<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>) and one relating to the <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> (<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> (<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>) will issue an <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Certificate and <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> (<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>) will issue the benefits Certificate and HS Certificate</li>
  <li>you will be liable to repay any <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges to <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> (<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>) and any benefit recovery and HS charges to <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> (<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Where an injured person makes a compensation claim for personal injury and has received hospital treatment in Northern Ireland as well as England, Scotland or Wales, charges will be recoverable under both:</p>

</ul>

<p>For accidents before 29 January 2007 hospital treatment will only be recoverable under the Great Britain scheme or the Northern Ireland scheme, not both. <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> (<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>) could only recover for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> treatment if the compensation payment was made from a policy issued in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/ukpga_19880052_en_1" rel="external">The Road Traffic Act 1988</a>. <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> (<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>) could only recover the HS charges if the compensation payment is from a policy issued in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1981/154" rel="external">The Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1981</a></p>

<span class="number">12.3 </span>Injured person resident in England, Scotland or Wales</h3>

<p>Where the injured person is a resident of England, Scotland or Wales for benefit recovery purposes the claim is handled by <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> (<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>). Where treatment has been provided at a hospital in Northern Ireland, <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> (<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>) may recover the HS charges.</p>

<p>The following procedures are in place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on receipt of a CRU1 from the compensator, the claim will be taken onto both systems, (<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> and <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>) and you will be notified accordingly.</li>
  <li>the claim will have 2 reference numbers, one relating to <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> (<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>) and one relating to <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> (<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>).</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> (<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>) will issue a HS Certificate while <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> (<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>) will issue a benefits Certificate and an <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Certificate</li>
  <li>you will be liable to repay any HS charges to <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> (<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>) and any benefits and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> charges to <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> (<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Where an injured person makes a compensation claim and has received treatment as a result of that injury at a hospital in Northern Ireland as well as England, Scotland or Wales, hospital treatment charges will be recoverable under both:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030043_en_10#pt3" rel="external">The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003</a></li>

</ul>

<p>The charges cap is not shared between the 2 countries and therefore charges would be incurred up to the limit for both of the respective caps.</p>

<p>For accidents before 29 January 2007 any hospital treatment will only be recoverable under the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> scheme or the Northern Ireland scheme, not both. <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> (<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>) could only recover for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> treatment if the compensation payment was made from a policy issued in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/ukpga_19880052_en_1" rel="external">The Road Traffic Act 1988</a>. <abbr title="Compensation Recovery Unit">CRU</abbr> (<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>) could only recover the HS charges if the compensation payment is from a policy issued in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1981/154" rel="external">The Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1981</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.4 </span>Disclosure of information</h3>

<p>The claimant may apply for access to all <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> records. In certain circumstances this information may be provided to an appointee appointed by the Secretary of State or an attorney under Power of Attorney.</p>

<p>A solicitor representing the claimant can have copies of documents relating to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> records following an incident/condition for which compensation has been claimed providing a written letter of authority from the claimant is produced.</p>

<p>A request for access to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> records by a defendant or their representative (following a claim to compensation) will be denied unless a court order which identifies specifically the document required is produced. However, the Social Security (Recovery of Benefit) Act 1997 allows the defendant to have ‘particulars’ of benefits shown on a Certificate. This may mean a full explanation of the benefit award but not necessarily copies of the documents concerned. If a claim has been settled or ongoing, written authority from the claimant must be obtained before consideration is given to the release of copy documents.</p>

<p>If a claimant contacts the Department directly (and not through a solicitor) then the full <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> records may be released. If there is agreement for the defendant to see these records, it is the responsibility of the claimant to forward the documents.</p>

<p>Where compensation is sought for professional negligence and the particulars of a claim are such that the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997 does not apply, benefit information will not be supplied to the Defendant as ‘offsetting’ is not appropriate under the 1997 Act.</p>
