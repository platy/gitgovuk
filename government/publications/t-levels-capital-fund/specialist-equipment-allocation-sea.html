<h2>Background to the T Level capital fund</h2>

<p>T Levels capital funding is split into 2 separate funding streams:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the buildings and facilities improvement grant (BFIG)</li>
  <li>the specialist equipment allocation (<abbr title="specialist equipment allocation">SEA</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The BFIG is a bid-based funding pot for T Level providers to refurbish existing facilities or build brand new buildings. Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-levels-capital-fund">T Levels capital fund guidance</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Specialist equipment allocation</h2>

<p>The guidance below is relevant to providers who have previously received <abbr title="specialist equipment allocation">SEA</abbr>, and those planning to deliver T Level routes for the first time in wave 4 (delivery from September 2023).</p>

<p><abbr title="specialist equipment allocation">SEA</abbr> is a payment available to all eligible T Level providers when they begin delivery of a T Level route for the first time. In waves 1, 2 and 3 the allocation was based on the number of students a provider expected to have in the 4th year of T Level delivery (steady state). We will confirm how we will allocate <abbr title="specialist equipment allocation">SEA</abbr> in wave 4 later in the year.</p>

<p>We will continue to make <abbr title="specialist equipment allocation">SEA</abbr> payments at the route level (e.g. digital or health and science), irrespective of the number of individual T Levels you plan to deliver within that route, and you will only receive funding once per route. We will not make additional <abbr title="specialist equipment allocation">SEA</abbr> payments if you plan to deliver new T Level pathways in the future which are not captured within the student number projections included in your bid.</p>

<p>Providers delivering T Level routes for the first time from September 2023 (wave 4) do not need to apply to receive <abbr title="specialist equipment allocation">SEA</abbr>. They will receive an allocation automatically.</p>

<h2>Eligibility for <abbr title="specialist equipment allocation">SEA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Any provider on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/providers-selected-to-deliver-t-levels">T Level provider list</a> delivering a T Level route(s) for the first time in academic year 2023 to 2024 is eligible to receive wave 4 <abbr title="specialist equipment allocation">SEA</abbr> funding.</p>

<p>If you are a new provider in 2023 you must register to deliver T Levels by 29 July 2022 (midnight) to receive <abbr title="specialist equipment allocation">SEA</abbr>. Find more information on how to register for delivery from 2023  in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-register-to-deliver-t-levels-in-2023-to-2024-academic-year">how to register to deliver T Levels in 2023 to 2024 academic year</a> guidance.</p>

<h2>Timetable for receiving <abbr title="specialist equipment allocation">SEA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>We intend to make payments to all eligible providers in early 2023. We will confirm how we will allocate <abbr title="specialist equipment allocation">SEA</abbr> in wave 4 later in the year.</p>

<h2>Grant requirements</h2>

<p>You cannot use <abbr title="specialist equipment allocation">SEA</abbr> to support building work and must only use it to help buy the industry standard specialist equipment you need to deliver T Levels. If your allocation is spent on equipment that is not primarily used for supporting T Level delivery, we reserve the right to reclaim funding.</p>

<p>Your total spend per pupil should be roughly equal to the amount you were originally allocated for that route, as set out in your grant offer letter. If you plan to reduce the number of places you are offering on a course with a high per pupil allocation and increase the number of places on a course with a lower per student allocation, we will not allow you to transfer all spare equipment allocation from that route to another.</p>

<p>We will however allow you to move a small proportion of funding – up to a maximum of 20% – between T Level routes if you can provide a valid rationale for why this change is needed to support delivery. You should tell us in your monitoring form A return (more information below) if you plan to move some of your allocation across routes.</p>

<p>You are required to provide 2 returns to us:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Monitoring form A: where you are required to set out how you plan to spend your allocation. We intend to complete spot checks on these returns and will inform you if any equipment is identified as ineligible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring form B: where you are required to confirm what you have purchased and the cost of the equipment. You should provide invoices and other supporting documents alongside this return. We will review this form in full and may ask you to provide further information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We will use your monitoring forms to determine whether or not we will need to reclaim funds. You can find information regarding the completion of these forms in your grant offer letter.</p>

<h2>Eligible equipment</h2>

<p>You must account for the equipment you purchase as a capital asset primarily used to support the delivery of T Levels. You should consult the relevant technical specification to find the suggested equipment requirements for each T Level.</p>

<p>Below are some examples of the types of equipment providers have previously purchased using <abbr title="specialist equipment allocation">SEA</abbr>. Please note that the equipment you can purchase using <abbr title="specialist equipment allocation">SEA</abbr> includes but is not limited to:</p>

<p>Construction:</p>

<ul>
  <li>workbenches</li>
  <li>CNC machine</li>
  <li>electrical components and circuits</li>
  <li>hand tools and equipment</li>
</ul>

<p>Digital:</p>

<ul>
  <li>VR equipment</li>
  <li>laptops</li>
  <li>headsets</li>
</ul>

<p>Education and Childcare:</p>

<ul>
  <li>baby simulators</li>
  <li>baby changing unit</li>
  <li>child sensory items</li>
</ul>

<p>Health and Science:</p>

<ul>
  <li>blood pressure monitor</li>
  <li>first aid kit</li>
  <li>mannequins</li>
  <li>hospital bed</li>
  <li>wheelchair</li>
  <li>anatomage table</li>
</ul>

<h2>When we will reclaim funding</h2>

<p>In addition to reclaiming any funding spent on non-T Level equipment, we reserve the right to reclaim funding in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if your projected number of students decreases significantly. We will use your October 2022 student number return as the basis from which we will make this decision. We will not provide additional funding if your student number projections increase</li>
  <li>if you drop T Level routes from your planned delivery</li>
  <li>if you defer delivery by more than one academic year, or defer delivery before you have spent your <abbr title="specialist equipment allocation">SEA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>if you do not spend your allocation by the date set out in your grant offer letter and have not sought an extension from us. We will consider extensions for extenuating circumstances, but you must inform us at the earliest opportunity</li>
</ul>

<h2>Match Funding</h2>

<p>We ask that you provide a funding contribution equal to 50% of the specialist equipment value, but only if that is something you can afford. Match funding is not an absolute requirement, and we will leave you to decide whether you are able to afford this match funding.</p>

<p>Should you be able to provide a match funding contribution, you must not use capital funding from other government bodies as part of this contribution. We will ask you for information on the sources of, and amount of money you have invested.</p>
