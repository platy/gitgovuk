<h2>Ministerial foreword</h2>

<p>In January 2021, the 4 nations of the United Kingdom published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-rare-diseases-framework"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework</a> outlining national priorities for improving the lives of those affected by rare conditions. One year on, in this first England Rare Diseases Action Plan, we report on progress made, and take a significant step forward in transforming the collective priorities of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework into tangible and concrete action.</p>

<p>Rare conditions are those that affect fewer than one in every 2,000 people. There are an estimated 7,000 different conditions and, owing to their rarity, people living with rare diseases face specific challenges with the health and care system, and with wider public services. The rare disease community includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>those living with genetic and non-genetic conditions</li>
  <li>those with a diagnosis and those who may never receive one</li>
  <li>newborns, children and adults</li>
</ul>

<p>While individually rare, rare diseases are collectively common. 1 in 17 people are affected by a rare condition at some point in their lifetime: in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> alone, this amounts to over 3.5 million people.</p>

<p>Despite the immense strain coronavirus (COVID-19) has placed on the health and care system, the actions described in this plan are far-reaching and diverse, from piloting new approaches for patients with undiagnosed rare conditions through to monitoring the uptake of drugs for rare diseases to promote equal access throughout the country, determining how best to include rare diseases in health profession education and improving the way decisions are made on newborn screening for rare diseases.</p>

<p>These commitments have been developed collaboratively with our delivery partners across the health landscape and in close consultation with members of the rare disease community. To ensure delivery and accountability, each action lists an owner, desired outcomes and, crucially, how we will measure and report on progress.</p>

<p>An important step in addressing the challenges faced by the rare disease community, this action plan is the first in a series of annual updates reporting progress made and new initiatives. Over the course of this year, we will continue to work with delivery partners and the rare disease community to monitor progress, drive change, and step up engagement with other organisations with crucial roles in supporting people living with rare disease.</p>

<p>While the framework and action plan represent the governmentâs primary commitments to the rare disease community, it is also important to recognise the strengths of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> in science and research, and the promise of wider initiatives in addressing the challenges of rare disease. Government strategies, including <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/genome-uk-the-future-of-healthcare">Genome <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a>, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-future-of-uk-clinical-research-delivery">Future of <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Clinical Research Delivery</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/life-sciences-vision">Life Sciences Vision</a>, will all support work to continue improving the lives of patients â from those affected by the most common conditions to the very rarest of diseases.</p>

<p>This action plan, developed in close collaboration with the rare disease community, continues to build upon existing <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> strengths and addresses areas of weaknesses, translating ambition into progress.</p>

<p>Thank you to all involved in the development of this plan and its future implementation â from officials working across the health and care system through to the clinicians and researchers, the dedicated patient organisations, and, most importantly, those personally affected by rare disease.</p>

<p>Maria Caulfield MP</p>

<p>Parliamentary Under Secretary of State (Minister for Patient Safety and Primary Care), Department of Health and Social Care</p>

<p>Rt Hon Sajid Javid MP</p>

<p>Secretary of State, Department of Health and Social Care</p>

<h2>Executive summary</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> government and devolved administrations published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-rare-diseases-framework"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework</a> in January 2021, setting out a shared vision for addressing health inequalities and improving the lives of people living with rare diseases across the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. The framework outlined 4 key national priorities as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>helping patients get a final diagnosis faster</li>
  <li>increasing awareness among healthcare professionals</li>
  <li>better co-ordination of care</li>
  <li>improving access to specialist care, treatment and drugs</li>
</ul>

<p>To turn this vision into action, each of the 4 <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations has committed to developing nation-specific action plans detailing how the priorities identified in the framework will be addressed.</p>

<p>This is Englandâs first Rare Diseases Action Plan, developed together with delivery partners across the health system and in close consultation with the rare disease community. It sets out specific, measurable actions for the next year under each of the 4 priority areas, including the outcomes that we aim to achieve.</p>

<p>Key commitments in this action plan include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improving how decisions are made on newborn screening for rare diseases</li>
  <li>designing an ethically approved research pilot using whole genome sequencing to screen for genetic conditions in healthy newborns</li>
  <li>piloting new approaches for diagnosis and care of patients with undiagnosed rare conditions</li>
  <li>determining how best to include rare diseases in <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> health professional education and training frameworks</li>
  <li>developing a toolkit to increase the effectiveness of virtual consultations for patients with rare diseases</li>
  <li>supporting rapid access to drugs for patients with rare diseases in the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>monitoring the overall uptake of drugs for patients with rare diseases and mapping this access across the country</li>
</ul>

<p>By bringing together many key organisations within the health system to deliver this action plan, we have a unique opportunity to tackle the challenges facing those living with rare diseases. Over the course of the coming year, we will monitor the progress of these actions closely, seeking input from those living with rare diseases to ensure we are measuring the outcomes that matter most.</p>

<p>However, we know that there is more to do, particularly as the health system begins to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. While delivery of this first action plan is underway, we will continue to explore future directions and develop new actions, informed by the needs of the diverse rare disease community.</p>

<p>Through this action plan, we will take the first steps in England towards achieving our overarching vision â delivering improvements in diagnosis, awareness, treatment and care, and creating lasting positive change for those living with rare diseases.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>On 9 January 2021, the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-rare-diseases-framework"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework</a> outlining a national vision for how the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> will improve the lives of those living with rare diseases.</p>

<p>All 4 nations of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> have committed to developing clear and tangible action plans to deliver on our collective framework. This publication is Englandâs first Rare Diseases Action Plan, developed together with delivery partners across the health system and representatives of the rare disease community to bring about specific and measurable improvements for people living with a rare disease.</p>

<p>It is currently estimated that there are over 7,000 rare diseases, with new conditions continually being identified as research advances. While around 80% of rare diseases have an identified genetic origin, they can also be caused by other factors such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>disordered immunity</li>
  <li>infections</li>
  <li>allergies</li>
  <li>deterioration of body tissues and organs</li>
  <li>disruption to development while in the womb</li>
</ul>

<p>Although rare diseases are individually rare, they are collectively common â with 1 in 17 people being affected by a rare disease at some point in their lifetime. In the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, this amounts to over 3.5 million people. It is important that the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> and other services provide this large and diverse patient population with the best possible care.</p>

<p>Rare diseases can be both life limiting and life threatening, and disproportionately affect children. 75% of rare diseases affect children and more than 30% of children with a rare disease die before their fifth birthday.</p>

<p>People living with rare diseases and their families often face a lifetime of complex care, leading to a profound impact on their education, financial stability, physical mobility and mental health. It is vitally important that their voices are heard and acted on when developing wider policy.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework</h3>

<p>Development of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework was based on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-rare-diseases-framework/the-uk-rare-diseases-framework#annex-a">outcomes of the âNational conversation on rare diseasesâ</a>, which was launched by the government in 2019. The conversation gathered views across the rare disease community on the major challenges faced by people affected by rare conditions across the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>An impressive 6,293 responses were received, which helped identify 4 high-level priority areas to bring about real change, forming the basis of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework. The 4 priorities are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>helping patients get a final diagnosis faster</li>
  <li>increasing awareness among healthcare professionals</li>
  <li>better co-ordination of care</li>
  <li>improving access to specialist care, treatment and drugs</li>
</ul>

<p>To turn these priorities into a reality, we recognise that significant action is needed across the health and social care system. In addition to the 4 priorities, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework identifies 5 underpinning themes on which we will focus in support of the 4 priorities to improve the lives of those living with rare diseases. These themes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>patient voice</li>
  <li>national and international collaboration</li>
  <li>pioneering research</li>
  <li>digital, data and technology</li>
  <li>wider policy alignment</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-wide implementation</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework is a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-wide document. However, each of the 4 <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations has its own delivery or implementation group, responsible for drafting and monitoring nation-specific action plans. All 4 nations have committed to publishing their action plans by the end of 2022.</p>

<p>Throughout development of the action plans, each nation is engaging with members of the rare disease community to make sure the work is both relevant and fit for purpose. Once published, action plans will be reviewed regularly to measure progress, update actions or add new ones.</p>

<p>Developing nation-specific action plans involves balancing the specific health needs of the individual <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations with the governmentâs commitment to health equity and avoiding disparities.</p>

<p>To further help with implementation of the Framework, 2 <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-wide boards have been created, the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Disease Framework Board â providing high-level co-ordination of rare disease policy and action plans across the 4 <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Forum â providing a way to engage a wide range of stakeholders in the rare disease community for advice and input (see Figure 1 below). The forum has 2 parts, both of which feed into the strategic <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework Board, as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>a core membership that meets twice a year</li>
      <li>an online knowledge and collaboration platform for continual engagement with a broad range of stakeholders</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Figure 1: governance structures for implementing the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework</h4>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="UK Rare Diseases Framework governance structures. Delivery/implementation groups develop nation-specific action plans. UK Rare Diseases Framework Board provides strategic oversight and UK Rare Diseases Forum engages with the community." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/143927/England_Rare_Diseases_Action_Plan_Figure_1_Organogram_960x640.png"></div></figure>

<p>As shown above, delivery or implementation groups are responsible for developing nation-specific action plans. The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-wide <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework Board provides strategic oversight and facilitates alignment of policy across the 4 <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations. The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Forum, also <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-wide, provides a means of engagement with the community.</p>

<h3>England Rare Diseases Action Plan</h3>

<p>The England Rare Diseases Framework Delivery Group develops, oversees and co-ordinates delivery of Englandâs action plans. In addition to representatives of rare disease patient and public voice and the clinician community, it has brought together publicly funded delivery partners across the health system as major funders of rare diseases research, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Improvement (<abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (<abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Health Education England (<abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (<abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr>, <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Digital)</li>
  <li>Genomics England</li>
  <li>the National Institute for Health Research (<abbr title="National Institute for Health Research">NIHR</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Medical Research Council</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the course of 2021, the delivery group has met every 6 weeks to develop and agree on actions that have formed the basis of the plan. Following publication of this action plan, the delivery group will continue to meet to co-ordinate and report on delivery, and develop actions for our second action plan in 2023.</p>

<p>As well as the publicly funded delivery partners (listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annexb">Annex B</a> whose actions are described here, there are also many other organisations with crucial roles in supporting people living with rare diseases and bringing about much needed change. These organisations include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>charities</li>
  <li>patient advocacy groups</li>
  <li>philanthropically funded organisations</li>
  <li>independent policy institutes</li>
  <li>industry</li>
</ul>

<p>This action plan sits within this wider system and will help to facilitate continued engagement, increased co-ordination and more joined-up working with others.</p>

<h3>Community engagement</h3>

<p>In developing the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Disease Framework, and now this action plan, we have placed the needs of those living with rare diseases at the forefront.</p>

<p>With the support of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://geneticalliance.org.uk/" rel="external">Genetic Alliance <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a>, we recruited representatives of patient and public voice to both the England Rare Diseases Framework Delivery Group and <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework Board. We have used the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Forum online platform to engage continuously with a broad range of people from the rare diseases community, providing an opportunity for discussion and feedback, as well as a source of updates on progress and related initiatives. We have also held two community roundtables to seek input on the draft actions and action Plan, again with participants recruited with support from Genetic Alliance <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>In November 2021, we launched a targeted online questionnaire to gather detailed feedback on draft actions from people and organisations across the rare disease community. The questionnaire was open for 3 weeks and received 92 responses from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>people living with a rare disease</li>
  <li>carers and family members</li>
  <li>rare disease charities</li>
  <li>healthcare professionals</li>
  <li>industry partners</li>
  <li>researchers</li>
</ul>

<p>We also held a workshop in partnership with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://breaking-down-barriers.org.uk/" rel="external">Breaking Down Barriers</a> (a network of over 50 organisations working together to improve the lives of families from diverse and marginalised communities) to better understand health inequalities experienced by people from diverse and marginalised communities affected by rare conditions.</p>

<p>Our delivery partners have also proactively engaged and sought extensive feedback from the rare diseases community as they have developed their actions. For example, <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> hosted engagement sessions with more than 80 individuals representing over 50 different organisations, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>patient charities</li>
  <li>patient advocacy groups</li>
  <li>medical royal colleges</li>
  <li>academics</li>
</ul>

<p>Further details of engagement activities can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annexc">Annex C</a>.</p>

<h2>Progress to date</h2>

<p>It is now a year since the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework was published. Alongside the work to produce this Action Plan, progress has already been made against the priorities of the Framework. Some of this progress is summarised below, with further details provided in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annexd">Annex D</a>.</p>

<p>Significant steps forward have been made in helping patients receive a diagnosis faster, with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/genomics/nhs-genomic-med-service/" rel="external"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Genomic Medicine Service</a> (<abbr title="Genomic Medicine Service">GMS</abbr>) carrying out over 600,000 genomic tests in England over the last year, many of which are for rare diseases.</p>

<p>The roll-out of the whole genome sequencing clinical service began in November 2021. Seven <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Genomic Medicine Service Alliances have been established to support the embedding of genomic testing in end-to-end clinical pathways.</p>

<p>An initial national dialogue was held to explore public views on the implications of whole genome sequencing for newborns, and found the public was broadly supportive provided appropriate safeguards and resources are in place.</p>

<p>Additionally, the power of whole genome sequencing (<abbr title="whole genome sequencing">WGS</abbr>) to uncover new diagnoses for people living with rare diseases has been demonstrated through research such as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2035790" rel="external">100,000 Genomes Project</a> and a study focusing on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj-2021-066288" rel="external">use of <abbr title="whole genome sequencing">WGS</abbr> for investigating suspected mitochondrial disorders</a> â both of which resulted in improved clinical decision-making for patients or their relatives.</p>

<p>Over the course of 2021, <abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr> has continued to develop bespoke education resources to underpin the implementation of the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <abbr title="Genomic Medicine Service">GMS</abbr> and raise awareness of rare disease among healthcare professionals.</p>

<p>Alongside this, work is ongoing to improve co-ordination of care across the health and social care system. This includes the <abbr title="National Institute for Health Research">NIHR</abbr>-funded <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/epidemiology-health-care/research/applied-health-research/research/health-care-organisation-and-management-group/concord" rel="external">CoOrdinated Care of Rare Diseases (<abbr title="CoOrdinated Care of Rare Diseases">CONCORD</abbr>) study</a>, which aims to understand how care for people living with rare disease and common chronic conditions is currently co-ordinated, and how they would like it to be co-ordinated.</p>

<p>On access to specialist care, treatment and drugs, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nice.org.uk/about/what-we-do/our-programmes/nice-guidance/nice-technology-appraisal-guidance/changes-to-health-technology-evaluation" rel="external"><abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> recently announced a package of changes it will be making to its methods and processes for health technology evaluation</a>. The changes will ensure its methods and processes are suited to new and emerging types of technology, and provide more equitable access for those with severe diseases. Changes to methods and processes that are relevant to rare diseases are included in this action plan.</p>

<p>In March 2021, we published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-future-of-uk-clinical-research-delivery">Saving and Improving Lives: The Future of <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Clinical Research Delivery</a> setting out our ambition to create a patient-centred, pro-innovation and digitally enabled clinical research environment. Implementing the vision will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>unleash the true potential of our clinical research environment to improve health</li>
  <li>capitalise on our renowned research expertise</li>
  <li>make the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> one of the best places in the world to design and deliver research</li>
</ul>

<p>Further significant developments included <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> the agreement of a number of âsmart dealsâ to secure innovative medicines. These included the 3 following treatments for patients with spinal muscular atrophy (<abbr title="spinal muscular atrophy">SMA</abbr>):</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr> has published studies on the impact of COVID-19 on the health of people with non-genetic rare diseases, helping to steer policy and leading to further pioneering research (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#annexd">Annex D</a> for further details).</p>

<h2>Current context</h2>

<p>Progress in developing this action plan has taken place against the backdrop of the current COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused significant disruption to health and care services. The effects are ongoing, with the emergence of the Omicron variant and the need to support the vital increase in the vaccination programme having had a significant national impact on the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>.</p>

<p>The impact of the pandemic has been particularly severe on the rare disease community, as highlighted by the Action for Rare Disease Empowerment (<abbr title="Action for Rare Disease Empowerment">ARDEnt</abbr>) report <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.camraredisease.org/ardent/" rel="external">Making the Unseen Seen: Rare disease and the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic</a> and a 2020 EURORDIS-Rare Disease Europe Rare Barometer survey <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.eurordis.org/publication/how-has-covid-19-impacted-people-rare-diseases-0" rel="external">How has COVID-19 impacted people with rare diseases?</a>.</p>

<p>A focus on COVID-19 has meant that some routine and primary care services have been scaled back, leading to delays or cancellations in diagnostic testing, transfusions, surgeries, scans and routine appointments.</p>

<p>Similarly, safety considerations, redeployed staff and travel restrictions have caused additional barriers to rare disease research, where cohort sizes are already small.</p>

<p>Resources have also been diverted to much-needed COVID-19 initiatives, including the development of both vaccines and therapeutics against severe disease. This has affected the operations of many other services and, while we recognise these need to be built back up, this will take time.</p>

<p>Plans are underway to put workforce and technology at the heart of long-term planning across the health service. It was recently announced that <abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr>, <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Digital, NHSX and <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> are to become one organisation. This will enable patients to benefit from the best care possible, thanks to a highly skilled workforce and faster digitalisation services. By transitioning these organisations into one, the government and the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> are ensuring the health and social care sector is fully equipped to face the future and deliver for patients. While work will be needed to finalise logistics, the changes will ultimately:</p>

<ul>
  <li>better support the recovery of the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>address waiting list backlogs</li>
  <li>support hardworking staff</li>
  <li>drive forward an ambitious agenda of digital transformation and progress</li>
</ul>

<p>Our commitment to improving the lives of those living with rare diseases remains as strong as ever, and we will look to learn lessons from the experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic. While ambitious, this action plan is therefore also realistic, recognising that it may take time to implement change within the current context.</p>

<p>The actions this year build on the existing strengths of our delivery partners and, in many cases, highlight work already underway. However, by publishing them as actions together in this plan, we aim to increase transparency and visibility of progress for the rare diseases community.</p>

<p>We know that it has not been possible to address all the communityâs concerns within this first action plan, and we will continue to engage with the rare disease community to determine how further progress can be made in future annual updates to the action plan.</p>

<p>Below, we set out our plans for the year ahead. Additionally, the âFuture directionsâ section of this action plan lists further focus areas identified by the rare disease community to which we will turn our attention over the course of the next year, as services begin to recover from the pandemic.</p>

<h2>Addressing the priorities of the framework: actions for 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>The 4 priorities of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework have been highlighted as major challenges by the rare disease community. Progress in these areas is vital to meet our commitment to improve the lives of those living with rare conditions.</p>

<p>Here, we describe actions under each of the 4 priority areas for the next year, including the outcomes that we aim to achieve. Each action is described below with further information provided in Table 1 in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annexa">Annex A</a> This table provides details on each actionâs owner alongside how progress will be measured. This will be reported publicly to aid transparency and accountability, and make progress as visible as possible to the rare diseases community. As well as these specific actions, which we will measure and report on, the narrative text below also describes many supporting activities that will all contribute to making progress on the aims of the framework.</p>

<p>Funding for all the actions listed below is already committed, either through delivery partnersâ existing organisational budgets, or accounted for in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/autumn-budget-and-spending-review-2021-documents">2021 Autumn Budget and Spending Review</a>. In this budget, the Chancellor announced a Â£5 billion investment over the next 3 years to increase health-related research and development. This includes funding to support Genomics Englandâs research initiative, a national research pilot testing 100,000 newborns using <abbr title="whole genome sequencing">WGS</abbr> to detect rare diseases with a genetic cause.</p>

<h3>Priority 1: helping patients get a final diagnosis faster</h3>

<p>Getting a rapid and accurate diagnosis is of vital importance for people living with rare diseases and their loved ones. An accurate and timely diagnosis can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>facilitate access to treatment and care</li>
  <li>provide a possible prognosis</li>
  <li>offer options for family planning</li>
  <li>provide a means of connection with a supportive community</li>
  <li>open up the possibility of involvement in research, including clinical trials</li>
</ul>

<p>In some cases, if a condition is diagnosed before the onset of symptoms, it may be possible to limit or even prevent harm.</p>

<p>Importantly, a correct diagnosis also ends what, for many, can be a lengthy âdiagnostic odysseyâ. The complex nature of many rare conditions means that patients may undergo multiple referrals, inconclusive tests and sometimes incorrect diagnoses before a final diagnosis is reached, during which time their condition may deteriorate, as well as having a negative impact on mental health.</p>

<p>Delayed diagnosis may also mean missing the window of opportunity for certain treatments, such as gene therapies, resulting in poorer outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated challenges in patients receiving a timely diagnosis.</p>

<p>Alongside great personal cost, research from 2018 estimated that, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://imperialcollegehealthpartners.com/new-report-reveals-undiagnosed-rare-disease-patients-cost-nhs-excess-3-4-billion/" rel="external">over a 10-year period, the âdiagnostic odysseyâ for rare diseases has cost <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England in excess of Â£3.4 billion</a>.</p>

<p>Genomics offers enormous potential for increasing diagnosis of rare disease and several of the actions under priority 1 make use of advances in genomics. This is a strength in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and our 2020 strategy <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/genome-uk-the-future-of-healthcare">Genome <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>: the future of healthcare</a> sets out our ambition to create the most advanced genomic health system in the world. However, it is important to recognise that 20% of rare diseases do not have a known genetic basis and many rare diseases remain undiagnosed.</p>

<p>We have taken this into account throughout this action plan and, under this priority, action 5 is specifically focussed on patients with undiagnosed rare conditions.</p>

<h4>Action 1: improving how decisions are made on newborn screening for rare diseases</h4>

<p>Newborn screening plays an important role in diagnosing rare diseases early, offering opportunities for treatment, management and support - often before symptoms even develop. This is particularly important because 75% of all rare diseases affect children, accounting for about a third of infant mortality in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> National Screening Committee (<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="National Screening Committee">NSC</abbr>) advises ministers and the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> in all 4 <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> countries on all aspects of screening. Using research evidence, pilot programmes and economic evaluation, the committee assesses the evidence for national screening programmes against a set of internationally recognised criteria, taking a range of different factors into account.</p>

<p>Proposals to screen for new conditions are considered in an annual call for topics that runs between September and December each year. Currently, 9 rare conditions are screened for in newborns through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/newborn-screening/blood-spot-test/" rel="external"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> newborn blood spot screening srogramme</a>.</p>

<p>As part of Englandâs Rare Diseases Action Plan, the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> commits to improving how decisions are made across the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> on newborn screening for rare diseases. In the year ahead. this will be actioned through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="National Screening Committee">NSC</abbr> with a broader remit, revised terms of reference and greater collaboration with researchers and stakeholders, including those with an interest in rare disease</li>
  <li>the establishment of a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="National Screening Committee">NSC</abbr> Bloodspot Task Group to identify practical and innovative approaches to facilitate research and evidence, which will inform evaluations of blood spot screening</li>
</ul>

<p>Opportunities will also be taken to engage internationally, and learn from and contribute to international best practice on screening. Work is underway to produce a paper that compares the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="National Screening Committee">NSC</abbr> bloodspot screening policy processes and programme delivery to proposed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.eurordis.org/newbornscreening" rel="external">EURORDIS newborn screening criteria</a> to identify any areas of good practice and areas for improvement. This will provide an understanding of how <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> screening policy and practice compares with an important patient-defined checklist.</p>

<p>Further details of <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="National Screening Committee">NSC</abbr>âs international activities are provided in the âNational and international collaborationâ section.</p>

<p>The new <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="National Screening Committee">NSC</abbr> is set to commence work in summer 2022.</p>

<h4>Action 2: <abbr title="whole genome sequencing">WGS</abbr> to screen for genetic conditions in healthy newborns</h4>

<p>Scientific advances mean that there are an increasing number of conditions where interventions are available to reduce or avoid harm, or improve long-term outcomes, if the condition is detected early. <abbr title="whole genome sequencing">WGS</abbr> could significantly increase the diagnoses of genetic conditions not currently covered by the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> newborn blood spot screening programme.</p>

<p>Guided by the outputs of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/public-dialogue-on-the-use-of-whole-genome-sequencing-in-newborn-screening">public dialogue on <abbr title="whole genome sequencing">WGS</abbr> in newborns</a> published in July 2021, Genomics England and <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> are leading a programme to explore the benefits, risks and broader implications of <abbr title="whole genome sequencing">WGS</abbr> in newborns.</p>

<p>This includes <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/newborns" rel="external">co-designing and running an ethically approved research pilot using <abbr title="whole genome sequencing">WGS</abbr> to screen for rare genetic conditions in healthy newborns</a>. New funding for this research pilot was announced in the October 2021 Spending Review. The research pilot will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sequence the genomes of up to 100,000 newborns and follow their progress to better understand the clinical benefits and potential risks of newborn genomic screening, aiming to accelerate diagnoses and access to treatments for rare genetic conditions</li>
  <li>be designed through careful consultation with the rare disease community, healthcare professionals, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> National Screening Committee and other key stakeholders â for instance, through their <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Steering Group</li>
  <li>include careful testing of how the whole pathway â from diagnosis through to genetic counselling and care â can be rolled out within the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>, if there is proven benefit</li>
  <li>ensure robust processes are in place for consent, return of results, data use and access</li>
  <li>develop a framework to identify genes for targeted analysis, based on clinical and genomic evidence and wide consultation. Outputs from the consultation to date have led towards a focus on diseases that present in early childhood for the research pilot, where an outcome-changing action would be available if they were detected earlier</li>
  <li>improve understanding of the patient experience of genomic newborn screening</li>
  <li>provide evidence to support the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="National Screening Committee">NSC</abbr> to make recommendations for future <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> screening programmes</li>
</ul>

<h4>Action 3: continuously develop the National Genomic Test Directory</h4>

<p>For the approximately 80% of rare diseases with a genetic origin, the systematic application of genomic technologies has the potential to transform patientsâ lives. It can enable quicker diagnoses in both adults and children, and match patients to the most effective medications and interventions.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/genomics/nhs-genomic-med-service/" rel="external"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Genomic Medicine Service</a> (<abbr title="Genomic Medicine Service">GMS</abbr>) continues to support the implementation of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a national network of 7 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/genomics/genomic-laboratory-hubs/" rel="external"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Genomic Laboratory Hubs</a> and 7 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/blog/nhs-genomic-medicine-service-alliances-to-help-embed-genomics-into-patient-care-pathways/" rel="external"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <abbr title="Genomic Medicine Service">GMS</abbr> Alliances</a>
</li>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/national-genomic-test-directories/" rel="external">National Genomic Test Directory</a>
</li>
  <li>an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/genomics/genomic-research/nhs-genomic-medicine-service-research-collaborative/" rel="external"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <abbr title="Genomic Medicine Service">GMS</abbr> Research Collaborative</a>
</li>
  <li>an integrated clinical genomics service</li>
</ul>

<p>The National Genomic Test Directory sets out the genomic testing strategy, which is delivered through the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <abbr title="Genomic Medicine Service">GMS</abbr>. It currently includes 357 rare and inherited clinical indications, and is reviewed every year to make sure it reflects the latest scientific and technological developments, including new rare disease clinical indications.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <abbr title="Genomic Medicine Service">GMS</abbr> continues to expand the range of testing technologies it offers as it moves towards targeted and personalised care â including single gene tests, larger next-generation sequencing panel tests to help diagnose based on broader phenotypes, exome sequencing and <abbr title="whole genome sequencing">WGS</abbr> â to help improve diagnostic yield.</p>

<p>In 2022, steps will be taken to continuously <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/national-genomic-test-directory-supporting-material/" rel="external">develop the National Genomic Test Directory by adding new tests for rare diseases</a> where there is scientific and clinical evidence to do so.</p>

<h4>Action 4: further develop the Genomics England clinical research interface</h4>

<p>Over the next year, Genomics England commits to further developing its clinical research interface so that, when genomic researchers find information of relevance to an individualâs health, it can be passed back to the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>. This will support researchers and clinicians in collaborating to resolve complex or novel findings from genome data.</p>

<p>This action builds on existing systems and processes in place for participants from the 100,000 Genomes Project and patients accessing the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <abbr title="Genomic Medicine Service">GMS</abbr>, who have opted to make their de-identified data available to researchers from academia or industry in the National Genomic Research Library. The library is a comprehensive database that provides access for approved researchers to de-identified genomic data, health data and samples.</p>

<p>This action to further develop the clinical research interface should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enable more rare disease patients to receive a diagnosis</li>
  <li>foster collaboration between researchers and clinicians</li>
  <li>accelerate new discoveries</li>
</ul>

<p>The number of diagnoses returned to the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> through the clinical research interface will be publicly reported with the goal of returning at least 100 diagnoses a year.</p>

<h4>Action 5: pilot new approaches for patients with undiagnosed rare conditions</h4>

<p>While advances in genomics offer powerful tools to increase diagnosis, it is critical to support those living with undiagnosed rare diseases and the healthcare professionals caring for them to reach a rapid diagnosis. This includes those whose conditions do not have a known genetic cause, but who would, like all patients, benefit from a recommended care package and better signposting to existing services.</p>

<p>This year, <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> will pilot new approaches for patients with undiagnosed rare conditions through a combination of outpatient appointments, inpatient stays and assessment by multiple clinicians.</p>

<p>Following consultation with rare disease patients and their families, these pilots are currently under design, but examples could include a holistic one-stop paediatric clinic or a more targeted adult neurology clinic, or the use of virtual expert multidisciplinary teams.</p>

<p>All of these will benefit from input from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>clinicians</li>
  <li>genetic counsellors</li>
  <li>clinical scientists</li>
  <li>healthcare professionals with specific expertise in the management of syndromes without a name (<abbr title="syndromes without a name">SWAN</abbr> conditions)</li>
  <li>potentially, psychological support, depending on the outcome of the intervention and patient need</li>
</ul>

<p>Pilot approaches will be developed in April 2022, with sites selected during summer 2022.</p>

<h4>Measuring changes in the âdiagnostic odysseyâ</h4>

<p>To understand whether these actions have been successful in leading to improvements in the time to diagnosis, particularly for those with non-genetic rare conditions, there is a need to develop an effective and efficient methodology to measure changes in the diagnostic odyssey over time.</p>

<p>A recently published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://openresearch.nihr.ac.uk/documents/2-3" rel="external">report has demonstrated the feasibility of studying the diagnostic odyssey for both genetic and non-genetic rare diseases in secondary care</a>, using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/hospital-episode-statistics" rel="external">Hospital Episode Statistics</a> data for 3 exemplar conditions (tuberous sclerosis complex, Bardet Biedl syndrome and the non-genetic condition ANCA-associated vasculitis). The report also sets out a number of recommendations for future evaluations.</p>

<p>Over the coming year, we will explore ways to build on these findings and monitor the impact of interventions on the length of the diagnostic odyssey.</p>

<h4>Rare disease research</h4>

<p>Research is a key driver of innovation in rare disease diagnostics and underpins several of the actions described above.</p>

<p>Further detail of steps we will take to make sure that research is funded to improve our understanding of rare disease and help patients get a final diagnosis faster can be found in the âPioneering researchâ section of this action plan.</p>

<p>The âNational and international collaborationâ section also highlights that the small numbers of patients with individual rare diseases necessitates a collaborative approach to research across the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, within Europe and globally.</p>

<h4>Supporting those without a diagnosis</h4>

<p>Receiving a diagnosis can unlock a wealth of opportunities for rare disease management and treatment. However, for some people living with extremely rare diseases, the complex and rare nature of their conditions may mean that they never receive a diagnosis, even after all the appropriate genomic or non-genomic diagnostic tests have been carried out and all relevant experts consulted.</p>

<p>We are committed to ensuring that these people and their families also receive the support and care they need, and that the healthcare professionals who care for them are equipped to manage their condition, including signposting to sources of support within the rare diseases community, such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.undiagnosed.org.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="syndromes without a name">SWAN</abbr> <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3>Priority 2: increasing awareness among healthcare professionals</h3>

<p>Raising awareness of rare diseases within the health system is crucial to improving the speed and accuracy of diagnoses, as well as ensuring patients receive the best possible clinical care, particularly in medical emergencies.</p>

<p>With over 7,000 rare diseases, it is not possible for healthcare professionals to receive comprehensive training on every condition. It is therefore important that they are aware of rare diseases more broadly and are alert to considering them. This includes providing training and resources to enable healthcare professionals to recognise rare diseases in patients and be aware of potential specialist treatment needs, as well as signposting to support and care pathways.</p>

<h4>Action 6: develop an innovative digital educational resource</h4>

<p>Alongside the steps we are taking to create the most advanced genomic health system in the world, healthcare professionals must be offered resources and training to extend their knowledge of genomics, particularly given its application in diagnosing certain rare diseases.</p>

<p><abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr> is developing an innovative digital educational resource called <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.genomicseducation.hee.nhs.uk/about-us/genotes-genomic-notes-for-clinicians/" rel="external">GeNotes</a> to help healthcare professionals make the right genomics decisions at each stage of a clinical pathway by providing concise âjust-in-timeâ clinical information to support patient management.</p>

<p>Content is developed by clinicians who are members of expert working groups that cover different clinical specialties â for example, oncology, paediatrics, and foetal and womenâs health. Content will be reviewed on a regular basis through an established governance process and will be updated as required. Further details about this process and membership of the working groups can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.genomicseducation.hee.nhs.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr> Genomics Education Programme website</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to linking to the National Genomic Test Directory, it will signpost to extended learning opportunities for clinicians. The resource is being built so that the educational content in GeNotes can be integrated into other digital platforms or websites that healthcare professionals already use, placing easily accessible information on rare diseases at their fingertips.</p>

<p>GeNotes is currently in development, and the beta phase product is being tested with healthcare professionals to ensure the content is relevant and the design is intuitive for users to navigate.</p>

<h4>Action 7: determine how best to include rare diseases in <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> health professional education and training frameworks</h4>

<p>It is important that training for healthcare professionals across all relevant specialities, including general practice and those involved with emergency care, includes information on how to engage, inform, involve and support the diverse rare disease population.</p>

<p>To address this, <abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr> will determine how best to include rare diseases in <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> health professional education and training frameworks. <abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr> will collaborate with professional organisations, curriculum developers and other stakeholders (including people living with rare diseases, their families and carers, and charities active in this area such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.m4rd.org/" rel="external">Medics 4 Rare Diseases</a>) to work out what information on rare diseases needs to be included in healthcare professionalsâ education and training â from undergraduate education through to continuing professional development.</p>

<p>In the coming year, the first stage of this project will be undertaken, which will include the review of existing frameworks and curricula to identify where and when rare disease is mentioned. This will provide the baseline, and inform how best to include rare diseases in <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> health professional education and training frameworks.</p>

<p>Findings will be compiled into a report, which will include recommendations to address identified gaps for consideration by curriculum developers.</p>

<h4>Action 8: extend the remit of the Genomics Education Programme to include non-genetic rare diseases</h4>

<p><abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr> will extend the remit of their Genomics Education Programme (<abbr title="Genomics Education Programme">GEP</abbr>) to now include non-genetic rare diseases. Current mention of rare diseases within the <abbr title="Genomics Education Programme">GEP</abbr> focuses on those with a genetic cause.</p>

<p>This new programme of work will extend the development of targeted resources for healthcare professionals to include rare diseases with a non-genetic cause, including the establishment of a rare disease education network and digital hub. The network will, in the first instance, provide a mechanism to link stakeholders and organisations with an interest in healthcare professional education in rare disease, and an opportunity through virtual meetings and other communication networks to share projects (for example, Medics 4 Rare Diseases resources such as Rare Disease 101) and best practice (for example, involving the rare disease community in co-production of resources). The digital hub will provide an online portal (or a one-stop shop) with links to education and training resources developed by the members of the rare disease education network.</p>

<p>The work of establishing the network and digital hub will be influenced by input from people living with rare conditions, their families and carers.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind that 20% of rare diseases do not have an identified genetic origin, <abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr> is taking an important step forward in including non-genetic rare diseases within its programme.</p>

<h4>Action 9: publish high-quality epidemiological and research papers to increase the understanding of rare diseases</h4>

<p>It is important that information used by healthcare professionals is accurate, relevant and up to date. This can be challenging in rare diseases, where the best evidence available may be based on non-representative samples (like hospital-based studies) or draw conclusions based on small populations.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr> has been working in partnership with academics, clinicians and patient groups to collect high-quality data on rare diseases at a population level. This work has built some of the largest data sets on rare diseases globally.</p>

<p>As part of Englandâs Rare Diseases Action Plan, <abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr> has committed to work with existing and new partners to analyse these data sets, and publish high-quality epidemiological and research papers to increase the understanding of rare diseases and raise their profile. This will include papers looking at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>basic rare disease epidemiology</li>
  <li>the impact of COVID-19 on people with certain rare diseases</li>
  <li>cancer-related risk factors or outcomes for people with some rare diseases</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to raising awareness, improving the evidence base on rare disease has the potential for significant impact on quality of life, health economics and joined-up care.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr> aim to collaborate on and publish at least 6 papers describing novel findings or methods relevant to rare disease by the end of 2022, and will work with patient organisations and healthcare professionals to ensure visibility of these publications.</p>

<h3>Priority 3: better coordination of care</h3>

<p>Because of the chronic and complex nature of their conditions, many people living with rare diseases will require support from across the health and social care system. This may involve multiple healthcare professionals, covering a variety of different specialties.</p>

<p>In some cases, responsibility for co-ordinating appointments and services falls to individuals affected by the condition or a family member or carer, which can result in a significant care burden.</p>

<p>An additional challenge is navigating the transition between paediatric and adult services, particularly in cases where no equivalent adult service is available. Improving co-ordination of care is essential to ensure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>care is effectively managed</li>
  <li>the burden on patients and carers is minimised</li>
  <li>healthcare professionals are working together to provide the right care at the right time</li>
</ul>

<p>While most health services are commissioned locally by clinical commissioning groups (<abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr> â to be replaced by integrated care boards subject to the passage of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3022" rel="external">Health and Care Bill</a>), <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> commissions about 150 specialised services for the population of England, and sometimes the whole of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> where the number of patients is very small. Specialised services support people with a range of rare and complex conditions. In line with its statutory duties, <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> commissions prescribed specialised services through over 200 comprehensive service specifications, many of which include services that provide treatment and care for patients with rare diseases.</p>

<p>While planning of specialised services takes place at a national and regional level, <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> works closely with local areas and providers to improve care co-ordination for patients who need specialised treatment.</p>

<p>In some cases, <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> commissions specialised services for patients with rare diseases through generic service specifications â for example, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/commissioning/spec-services/npc-crg/group-e/e04/" rel="external">paediatric neurology services</a>.</p>

<p>In other cases, <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> commissions services for a group of rare diseases that need a similar approach to treatment and care, for example, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/commissioning/spec-services/npc-crg/group-e/e06/" rel="external">adult metabolic services</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> also commissions services directly for certain individual rare diseases, for example, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/a01Sb-spec-cystic-fibrosis-child.pdf" rel="external">paediatric cystic fibrosis services</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/commissioning/spec-services/highly-spec-services/" rel="external">Highly specialised services</a> are a subset of specialised services that care for people with very rare conditions â usually no more than 500 patients a year. For this reason, they are typically delivered nationally through centres of excellence. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/commissioning/rdag/" rel="external">Rare Diseases Advisory Group</a> (<abbr title="Rare Diseases Advisory Group">RDAG</abbr>) is responsible for making recommendations to <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> and the devolved administrations on the development of services for people with rare diseases and on highly specialised services. This includes how highly specialised services should be commissioned and which expert centres should be nominated to deliver them. <abbr title="Rare Diseases Advisory Group">RDAG</abbr> is updated regularly on progress to implement the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework.</p>

<p>Through the Health and Care Bill, integrated care boards (<abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr>) become statutory organisations that will take on the commissioning functions of <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr> as well as delegated responsibility for some of <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr>âs commissioning functions (see âIntegrated care systemsâ section). This will put more power and autonomy in the hands of local systems to plan and deliver seamless health and social care services.</p>

<p>For all specialised services, <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> will continue to have responsibility for developing and setting standards nationally, which local healthcare providers will be expected to follow. It is likely that highly specialised services will not be delegated to <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> for commissioning, as the small number of patients and providers, and the complexity of the service would make them unsuitable. However, <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> will work to involve <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> in the design of those services so that their delivery can be integrated with wider pathways of care.</p>

<p>Rare disease collaborative networks (<abbr title="rare disease collaborative networks">RDCNs</abbr>) are part of <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr>âs provision to support co-ordination of care for patients with rare diseases. There are currently 13 <abbr title="rare disease collaborative networks">RDCNs</abbr> (listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annexe">Annex E</a>, each made up of providers (rare disease collaborative centres) who have an interest in a particular rare disease and are committed to working together to progress research, increase knowledge, and improve patient experience and outcomes.</p>

<p>They are based on the principle that, when it is practical, âthe knowledge moves rather than the patientâ, and co-ordinate care by operating national virtual multidisciplinary team meetings and in-person clinics.</p>

<p><abbr title="rare disease collaborative networks">RDCNs</abbr> also support the transition between child and adult services by working closely with paediatric services and running transition clinics. <abbr title="rare disease collaborative networks">RDCNs</abbr> are supported by the <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> highly specialised commissioning team, and independently set their own priorities and objectives. Proposals for new <abbr title="rare disease collaborative networks">RDCNs</abbr> are considered annually at the autumn meeting of the <abbr title="Rare Diseases Advisory Group">RDAG</abbr>.</p>

<p>An example <abbr title="rare disease collaborative network">RDCN</abbr> can be found in Box 1.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Box 1: Familial Pneumothorax Rare Disease Collaborative Network</h4>

<p>A pneumothorax occurs when the lung deflates because of an air leak, causing pain and breathlessness. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in patients with no obvious underlying lung disease with an incidence of 20 cases per 100,000 per year. In 10% of these cases, another family member has also suffered a pneumothorax, making the diagnosis one of familial pneumothorax. A variety of rare inherited syndromes account for many cases of familial pneumothorax.</p>

<p>The Familial Pneumothorax Rare Disease Collaborative Network was approved by NHSE/Iâs highly specialised services in 2021 and has centres in Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow.</p>

<p>The network has formalised a route for genetic testing and counselling services, and offers a national online multi-disciplinary team that meets to discuss patient cases and provide local teams with guidance around diagnosis and treatment, which is delivered locally. If necessary, patients can also attend clinics at the centres in person or by video link.</p>

<p>By pooling resources and expertise, the network can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>diagnose patients faster</li>
  <li>deliver treatments more quickly</li>
  <li>conduct research</li>
  <li>work in partnership with other experts for the benefit of patients</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Care co-ordination should be flexible, keeping the patient at the heart of decision-makingand recognising that different patient groups may have different needs. People living with rare diseases and their carers should have the support they need to navigate the health and social care system, and should be empowered to co-ordinate their own care should they wish to do so.</p>

<p>To improve our understanding of care co-ordination, the <abbr title="National Institute for Health Research">NIHR</abbr> funded the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk/programmes/hsdr/1611682/#/" rel="external"><abbr title="CoOrdinated Care of Rare Diseases">CONCORD</abbr> study</a>. This University College London-led study, involving a consortium of partners including Genetic Alliance <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, gathered evidence on how care is currently co-ordinated, and sought to determine how care coordination might be centred around the needs and preferences of patients and families affected by rare diseases.</p>

<p>Over the coming year, we will partner with <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> to explore how the economic case for different care co-ordination models proposed in the study could best be evaluated, in order to provide the evidence needed to operationalise improved co-ordination of care within the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>. Further information about the <abbr title="CoOrdinated Care of Rare Diseases">CONCORD</abbr> study and its landmark definition of co-ordination of care can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annexd">Annex D</a>.</p>

<p>We are aware that unco-ordinated care is not just an issue for people with rare diseases â similar challenges and treatment burdens are experienced by people living with multiple long-term conditions (<abbr title="multiple long-term conditions">MLTC</abbr>) and their carers. Over the coming year, we will also work with colleagues leading the <abbr title="National Institute for Health Research">NIHR</abbr> Strategic Framework for <abbr title="multiple long-term conditions">MLTC</abbr> to consider where programmes of research on <abbr title="multiple long-term conditions">MLTC</abbr> can incorporate and benefit people living with rare diseases.</p>

<p>Better co-ordination of care for people with rare genetic conditions is also supported by ongoing work to further develop the underpinning <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <abbr title="Genomic Medicine Service">GMS</abbr> Alliances. This is helping to embed genomic medicine into mainstream patient care pathways in the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>. The <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <abbr title="Genomic Medicine Service">GMS</abbr> Alliances are developing networks across all other <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> providers and organisations (for example: primary care networks, integrated care systems, academic health science networks and academia) across the country to support standardisation and equal access to genomic medicine.</p>

<p>Below we set out the immediate, specific action we will take in the next year to address the co-ordination of care priority.</p>

<p>We appreciate that there is more to do, and this is a priority that will need our particular attention over the coming year so we can take further steps to address the challenges raised by the rare diseases community. This includes looking at how lessons learnt from specialised and highly specialised services may be applied to care for people living with rare diseases more broadly.</p>

<h4>Action 10: develop a toolkit for virtual consultations</h4>

<p>There are many potential benefits of using technology and new digital tools to support care co-ordination, enabling patients to access services remotely, and allowing specialists from across the health system to share information and discuss the creation of tailored care plans.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has catalysed the wider adoption of telemedicine with a dramatic shift from face-to-face appointments to virtual consultations. This can be a particular advantage for some rare disease patients who may live a long way from centres specialising in their condition, may not need a face-to-face appointment on every occasion or may find travel difficult. The adoption of digital approaches has the potential to improve co-ordination of care by allowing rare disease patients to access the care of multiple specialists without the need to travel long distances.</p>

<p>Building on learning from COVID-19 and findings from consultation with the rare diseases community, <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> will develop a toolkit for virtual consultations to increase the effectiveness of videoconference and telephone clinic calls in services for patients with complex, multi-system rare diseases. The toolkit will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>support shared learning about which approaches are most effective</li>
  <li>improve the outcomes of virtual clinics for patients and families or carers by ensuring consistency of approach and agreeing mutual expectations</li>
  <li>support clinical teams in discussing issues that need to be considered in the planning and delivery of virtual clinics</li>
  <li>ensure that both patients and their data are safe and follow agreed governance processes</li>
  <li>facilitate remote clinics across different providers</li>
</ul>

<p>This will be balanced against the possibility of digital exclusion, to make sure that any changes improve rather than exacerbate health inequalities. The choice of face-to-face versus digital consultation will usually be made based on the most clinically appropriate option, while taking into account individual patient or family circumstances. Services are developing expertise in appropriately stratifying patients, and constantly reviewing and evolving their practice.</p>

<p>The toolkit will be published in spring 2022, and its uptake monitored through annual clinical meetings and reported back to the England Rare Diseases Framework Delivery Group.</p>

<h4>A holistic approach to care and support</h4>

<p>Despite ongoing advances in medical science, the vast majority of rare diseases currently have no effective disease-modifying treatment. It is therefore also important that individuals and families living with rare conditions have access to timely advice, aids and equipment, and support in managing both symptoms and the wider impact of the disease.</p>

<p>Improving co-ordination of care for rare diseases goes beyond treatment, requiring holistic consideration of the support needs of individuals and families across a wide range of public services. Over the course of the coming year, we will look at ways in which the provision of advice for rare disease patients can be improved, including clearer signposting to existing sources of support, and how we can co-ordinate with other government departments to ensure an integrated package of care.</p>

<p>Recognising that many people living with rare diseases face additional physical challenges, we will also seek to align with other policy areas that address the complex needs of people living with rare diseases (such as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-disability-strategy">National Disability Strategy</a>), further details of which can be found in the âWider policy alignmentâ section.</p>

<h4>Mental healthcare and rare diseases</h4>

<p>From waiting for a diagnosis to undertaking multiple avenues of care, individuals and families living with the realities of a rare disease may find the burden affecting their mental health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>In some cases, the impact of this has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected the lives of those more vulnerable in society, as well as causing disruption to routine care services. Groups who had the highest risk of mental ill-health before the pandemic, including those living with pre-existing conditions, seem to have been worst affected.</p>

<p>To address mental health challenges more broadly, weâre investing an additional Â£2.3 billion a year by 2023 to 2024 to expand and transform mental health services. We are also reforming the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1983/20/contents" rel="external">Mental Health Act 1983</a> to give people greater control over their treatment, and help ensure they receive the dignity and respect they deserve.</p>

<p>We are tackling the impact of the pandemic on mental health through our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-recovery-action-plan">COVID-19 mental health and wellbeing recovery action plan</a> â detailing how we plan to prevent, mitigate and respond to the mental health impacts of the pandemic during 2021 to 2022. The plan is backed by an additional Â£500 million funding to expand mental health services, accelerate the key commitments in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.longtermplan.nhs.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Long Term Plan</a>, and provide support to those that need it most.</p>

<p>Additionally, in 2020, <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> published their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/advancing-mental-health-equalities-strategy/" rel="external">Advancing mental health equalities strategy</a>, which committed to supporting local health systems to better address inequalities in access, experience and outcomes of mental healthcare.</p>

<p>The governmentâs <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/" rel="external">Better Health â every mind matters campaign</a> also supports people to take action to look after their mental health and wellbeing, and help support others such as family and friends. The campaign includes expert advice and practical tips to help individuals look after their mental health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>There is always more to do, and so weâll be publishing a long-term Mental Health Strategy looking at what action can be taken to help everyone live healthier, happier lives. A discussion paper will be published soon, calling on the public, charities, businesses and the mental health sector to share their views and help shape the strategy.</p>

<p>We recognise that people living with rare diseases and their families often have very specific needs for mental health support, and that this needs to be well co-ordinated with their wider health and social care. We are committed to exploring this further in future action plans.</p>

<h4>Integrated care systems</h4>

<p>Health and care needs for individuals with rare diseases are complex, requiring collaboration across both the health and care systems. To support more integrated care across the system, the government introduced <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/integratedcare/what-is-integrated-care/" rel="external">integrated care systems</a> (<abbr title="integrated care systems">ICSs</abbr>) in 2018 â partnerships between the organisations that meet health and care needs across an area to coordinate services, and plan in a way that improves population health and reduces inequalities between different groups.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/integrating-care-next-steps-to-building-strong-and-effective-integrated-care-systems-across-england/" rel="external"><abbr title="integrated care systems">ICSs</abbr> provide an opportunity to further align the design, development and provision of services â including specialised services â with linked care pathways</a>, where it supports patient care, while maintaining consistent national standards and policies across the board.</p>

<p>Taking this further, the Health and Care Bill proposes to build on the work of existing non-statutory <abbr title="integrated care systems">ICSs</abbr> by putting <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> on a statutory footing to replace <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr> as local commissioners, and requiring the creation of integrated care partnerships in each local system area. This proposes to give <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> clear responsibilities, empowering them to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>better join up health and care</li>
  <li>improve population health</li>
  <li>reduce health inequalities</li>
</ul>

<p>Giving <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> responsibility for commissioning as many of the services that are accessed by their population as possible is a key enabler for integrating care and improving population health. It gives the flexibility to join up key pathways of care, leading to better outcomes and experiences for patients, and less bureaucracy and duplication for clinicians and other staff.</p>

<p>Currently <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> commissions all specialised services (the 149 âprescribedâ services as set out in regulations). The Health and Care Bill includes powers which, if passed, will enable <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> to delegate its functions to other <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> bodies, individually or jointly. <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> is considering how it can use new powers in respect of delegating commissioning responsibility for some specialised services to <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> individually and jointly. This would be with a view to realising the benefits of more integrated pathways, joined-up care and population health management approaches for specialised services and their patients, where appropriate.</p>

<p>For all specialised services, <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> will remain accountable for their commissioning, and so continue to set consistent national service standards and evidence-based access policies, which should be consistently applied across the country. For those services for which commissioning responsibility is delegated, <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> will carry out assurance of the commissioning activity.</p>

<p>Highly specialised services are characterised by small numbers of patients being treated by a small number of providers using complex treatments. Therefore, delegating commissioning responsibility to <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> is unlikely to be the appropriate route to realising the benefits of more integrated care. This will better be achieved through involving <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> in the design and development of pathways, and working with local systems to deliver care in a more joined-up way.</p>

<p>Primary and secondary healthcare providers will need to work with specialist centres to join up pathways and provide integrated interfaces for patients.</p>

<p>Development and implementation of sustainable, meaningful metrics to measure the impact of these changes on rare disease care will require collaboration across delivery partners, including <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Digital (<abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr>) with input from rare disease stakeholders. These metrics should be used as part of assuring commissioning activity.</p>

<h3>Priority 4: improved access to specialist care, treatment and drugs</h3>

<p>Many rare diseases do not have established treatments, but, where they do exist, they can be life-changing and life-saving, significantly improving prognoses and an individualâs quality of life. Providing access to safe, high-quality specialist care and treatments presents challenges, with some patients needing to travel significant distances to access specialist centres. The small numbers of patients affected by each rare condition mean that the scale of clinical trials typically used to assess the safety and efficacy of medicines may not be possible. Assessment of and access to rare disease medicines can also require additional consideration from health technology assessment bodies, due to limited and uncertain data.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> is a world leader in science and technology, with a world-class research infrastructure, and an increasing number of innovative drugs and treatments being developed for rare diseases. Ensuring rapid, safe and equitable access to these treatments as they become available will not only improve the lives of those living with rare diseases, but will foster an environment that will attract substantial investment in the high-value life sciences products of the future and promote continued innovation in the field.</p>

<p>There are clear challenges with promoting equitable access, with multiple treatments being developed for some rare conditions, while others do not receive the same levels of research, investment or attention.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of wider ongoing activity under this priority to improve access to specialist care, treatment and drugs. We begin by describing some of this activity and the implications for rare diseases, before moving on to describe the specific and measurable actions we will put in place and monitor as part of this action plan.</p>

<h4>Promoting access to specialist treatments</h4>

<p>Within the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, a number of schemes exist to promote research and facilitate early access to novel and high-cost treatments (see Box 2). Many of these have the potential to improve access for rare disease patients.</p>

<p>Although promoting the development of and access to new medicines is vitally important, treatments for rare diseases may also result from identifying new uses for existing medicines. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/medicines-2/medicines-repurposing-programme/" rel="external">Medicines Repurposing Programme</a>, hosted by <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr>, provides support and, where necessary, public funds to facilitate repurposing of priority medicines, including those that may be relevant to rare diseases (see Box 3).</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Box 2: schemes facilitating early access to rare disease treatments</h4>

<p>In July 2021, NHSE/I announced that [Â£340 million of funding a year will be allocated to the new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2021/07/nhs-england-announces-new-innovative-medicines-fund-to-fast-track-promising-new-drugs/" rel="external">Innovative Medicines Fund</a> (IMF) to provide early access to promising and innovative new drugs that have been granted marketing authorisation.</p>

<p>Building on the success of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/cancer/cdf/" rel="external">Cancer Drugs Fund</a>, the IMF will support patients, including those with rare genetic diseases, to get early access to the most innovative and effective new treatments, where further data is needed to support a NICE recommendation on routine funding. Detailed proposals for the fund were recently subject to a public consultation process, which closed on 11 February 2022.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-the-early-access-to-medicines-scheme-eams">Early Access to Medicines Scheme</a> (EAMS), operated by the MHRA, aims to give patients with life-threatening or seriously debilitating conditions access to medicines that do not yet have a marketing authorisation when there is a clear unmet medical need. This means that patients with rare diseases may gain access to certain medicines before they become available as a licensed treatment option.</p>

<p>Under the scheme, the MHRA will give a scientific opinion on the benefit to risk balance of the medicine, based on the data available when the EAMS submission is made. The scientific opinion lasts for a year and can be renewed. The scheme is voluntary and the scientific opinion from the MHRA does not replace the normal licensing procedures for medicines.</p>

<p>Medicines supplied to patients with rare diseases under the scheme are still subject to robust safety and monitoring procedures, including a pharmacovigilance system and risk management plan. A drug registry collects relevant data to ensure that any safety concerns can be identified and addressed, and that treatment is taking place in line with the EAMS treatment protocols.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/innovative-licensing-and-access-pathway">Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway</a> (ILAP) provides a unique framework for enhanced collaboration between the 4 ILAP permanent partners:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the MHRA</li>
  <li>NICE</li>
  <li>the Scottish Medicines Consortium</li>
  <li>the All Wales Therapeutic and Toxicology Centre</li>
</ul>

<p>By supporting expedited, efficient and innovative approaches to product development and patient access, ILAP allows the MHRA and its partner agencies to support the path to market of innovative and novel treatments, while ensuring there are no compromises in assessing the safety and efficacy of the treatments.</p>

<p>ILAPâs âinnovation passportâ designation is the gateway to the pathway and includes a rare disease component among the criteria. The decision on whether to issue an innovation passport is made between the partners and includes input from the ILAP Patient and Public Reference Group, which includes rare disease representation.</p>

<p>Access to advice and support for innovators, including those preparing treatments for rare diseases, is available through the MHRA Innovation Office, which provides free and confidential expert regulatory information, advice and guidance to organisations including academia, not for profits and industry.</p>

<p>The office is open to all innovative queries â particularly those that challenge the current regulatory framework â offering developers of rare disease medicines an additional level of visible support. Where new products may create regulatory challenges, this service can provide the opportunity for the MHRA to work with the innovator, offering advice and guidance that clarifies regulatory requirements before formal scientific advice meetings.</p>

<p>Of particular relevance to rare diseases, this support is available to manufacturers developing innovative medicines, where technologies or materials are being used for the first time, or where products like gene, cell therapy or nanomedicines are being developed.</p>

<p>The effective use and development of all these programmes will help enable patients with rare diseases to access treatments more quickly with the same degree of confidence. This will require co-ordination, transparency and partnerships to ensure patients, patient organisations, healthcare professionals and innovators are empowered to navigate the regulatory landscape.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Box 3: repurposing medicines</h4>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/medicines-2/medicines-repurposing-programme/" rel="external">Medicines Repurposing Programme</a> aims to identify and develop opportunities to repurpose out-of-patent medicines â meaning medicines used in ways not included in the original licence. Medicines are prioritised and then provided with tailored support, potentially including building further clinical evidence, facilitating licensing and enabling more equitable access.</p>

<p>The programme, which began formally in March 2021, is a multi-agency initiative jointly sponsored by NHSE/I, the NIHR, the MHRA, the DHSC and NICE. A small programme team is hosted by NHSE/I. The first pilot medicine has been adopted into the programme and work on licensing is underway. Key documents, including how to propose a medicine to the programme, will be published during 2022.</p>

<p>Embedding genomics into clinical care through the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <abbr title="Genomic Medicine Service">GMS</abbr> will contribute towards improved access to specialist treatments, with more accurate and insightful diagnostics laying the foundations for personalised medicine, and facilitating access to clinical trials of new treatments.</p>

<p>Under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/about-nhs-digital/corporate-information-and-documents/directions-and-data-provision-notices/secretary-of-state-directions/national-disease-register-service-directions" rel="external">National Disease Registration Service Directions</a>, <abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr> has been directed by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care to collect genomic data to support rare disease registration, and already collects, curates and quality assures data from the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <abbr title="Genomic Medicine Service">GMS</abbr> for a range of rare diseases into its standardised registry.</p>

<p>Genomics England is also engaging with industry partners on how the National Genomic Research Library â the database allowing access to approved researchers to de-identified data â can best meet requirements for development of therapeutics and support for rare disease clinical trials via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/research/partnerships/discovery-forum" rel="external">Discovery Forum</a>.</p>

<p>The Discovery Forum provides a platform for collaboration and engagement between Genomics England, industry partners, academia, the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> and the wider <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> genomics landscape to join up the continuum of research. Companies have come together within the Discovery Forum to work in a pre-competitive environment with access to a selection of whole genome sequences.</p>

<h4>Improving clinical research delivery</h4>

<p>The safety and efficacy of new medicines are tested in clinical trials. For rare disease medicines, there are special considerations and innovative approaches will be needed to address challenges, including low patient numbers and difficulties patients may face in accessing specialist centres.</p>

<p>By working in partnership across the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>, regulators, research funders, industry, medical research charities, academia and government, we can create a clinical research ecosystem that is more efficient, resilient and effective than ever before. This will empower patients, families and carers to explore research opportunities, and make informed decisions about participating in the research that is of relevance to them.</p>

<p>As referenced in the âProgress to dateâ section above, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-future-of-uk-clinical-research-delivery">Vision for the Future of <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Clinical Research Delivery</a>, published in March 2021, sets out the governmentâs ambition for delivering innovative, patient-centred clinical research. A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-future-of-uk-clinical-research-delivery-2021-to-2022-implementation-plan">phase 1 implementation plan</a> was published in June 2021, outlining goals for 2021 to 2022.</p>

<p>From expediting ethical approval and study set-up through to fresh investment to digitise clinical research delivery, this plan aimed to increase the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>âs capacity and capability to deliver cutting-edge clinical research, with the goal of bringing more research and greater investment to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>We are continuing work on the phase 2 implementation plan, which we will publish later this year, and will include actions to support clinical research delivery for rare diseases. During the course of this year, we will also convene a workshop to explore the particular challenges facing rare disease clinical research delivery, including barriers to entry and innovative approaches to trial design</p>

<h4>Action 11: support rapid access to drugs for patients with rare diseases in the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>
</h4>

<p>To ensure that the benefits of the access schemes described in Box 2 can be realised and delivered to patients, <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> has committed to a number of actions to support rapid access to drugs for patients with rare diseases. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mapping these schemes to promote understanding of their place in the evaluation pathway</li>
  <li>using horizon-scanning and engaging with partners such as <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> and industry (for example, through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nice.org.uk/about/what-we-do/life-sciences/office-for-market-access" rel="external">Office for Market Access</a> meetings) to anticipate which drugs will be available when</li>
  <li>identifying at an early stage any challenges in delivering them to patients</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow commissioning processes to be adapted to ensure that <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> services are prepared to deliver drugs as soon as they become available. Mapping will be finalised in summer 2022.</p>

<h4>Action 12: develop a strategic approach for gene therapies and other advanced therapy medicinal products</h4>

<p>With the expected number of advanced therapy medicinal products (<abbr title="advanced therapy medicinal products">ATMPs</abbr>) coming to market increasing significantly, there is a need to consider how such therapies are delivered, adopted and evaluated.</p>

<p><abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> will develop a strategic approach for gene therapies and other <abbr title="advanced therapy medicinal products">ATMPs</abbr> by summer 2022, which will be used to set out the <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> commissioning position to ensure clarity for the pharmaceutical industry, providers and patients.</p>

<p><abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr>âs initial focus will be on understanding its internal strategic approach, following which there will be engagement with key stakeholders as necessary, including with all companies developing <abbr title="advanced therapy medicinal products">ATMPs</abbr>. This will include understanding the service impact on the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> of their treatment, feeding into action 11.</p>

<p>This work aligns with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.engage.england.nhs.uk/consultation/imf-engagement-on-proposals/" rel="external"><abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> and <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr>âs consultation on the Innovative Medicines Fund</a>. <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> continues to work closely with colleagues in the devolved administrations on aligning capacity and capability for delivering <abbr title="advanced therapy medicinal products">ATMPs</abbr> across the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Nucleic acid therapies</h4>

<p>Nucleic acid therapies are a class of <abbr title="advanced therapy medicinal products">ATMPs</abbr> that involve the delivery of synthetic <abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> and <abbr title="ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr> (nucleic acids) into cells. Harnessing the cellâs natural processes, nucleic acid therapies work to upregulate or downregulate protein production or replace faulty genes completely.</p>

<p>As such, they have the potential to effectively prevent and treat a wide range of complex diseases, including rare genetic conditions. Examples include <abbr title="ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr> drugs (such as patisiran, used in treating hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis) and gene therapies (such as onasemnogene abeparvovec for spinal muscular atrophy).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> is a world leader in nucleic acid technology research and government continues to invest significantly in infrastructure to support the development of these pioneering new therapies through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukri.org/" rel="external"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Research and Innovation</a> (<abbr title="UK Research and Innovation">UKRI</abbr>).</p>

<p>This includes a total of Â£18 million, in partnership with LifeArc, to develop a national network of cutting-edge <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukri.org/news/gene-therapy-innovation-hubs-launched/" rel="external">âgene therapy innovation hubsâ</a>, and the creation of a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.natahub.org/" rel="external">Nucleic Acid Therapy Accelerator</a> to support interdisciplinary research to solve technical barriers to nucleic acid drug development and delivery (with a total investment of Â£30 million over 4 years).</p>

<p>Through Innovate <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, government also funds the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ct.catapult.org.uk/about-us" rel="external">Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult</a>, a not-for-profit organisation that supports innovation by providing access to expert technical capabilities, equipment and other resources required to take innovation ideas from concept to reality. The Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult:</p>

<ul>
  <li>works collaboratively with academia, industry and healthcare providers to develop new technology and innovation to advance cell and gene therapies</li>
  <li>co-ordinates the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.theattcnetwork.co.uk/" rel="external">Advanced Therapy Treatment Centre Network</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The network has been funded by Innovate <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> in a 4-year Â£30 million programme to make cell and gene therapies more accessible to patients in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. The network does this through training, introduction of new tools and techniques, and preparing clinical centres to process and administer these sensitive treatments.</p>

<p>A new <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>-funded Clinical Biotechnology Centre at <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Blood and Transplantâs base in Filton, North Bristol, was opened in October 2021. The centre will specialise in the production of plasmid <abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> and viral vectors â advanced products required for early-phase clinical trials of experimental gene therapy medicines for rare and other genetic diseases.</p>

<p>Collectively, these initiatives have the potential to transform care for millions of patients, including those with rare and life-threatening genetic diseases.</p>

<p>Building on advances in therapeutics during the COVID-19 pandemic, government is committed to supporting the continuing development of nucleic acid technology, such as the development of new <abbr title="Messenger ribonucleic acid">mRNA</abbr> (Messenger <abbr title="ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr>) platforms that could allow rapid development of new therapies for multiple diseases, including many rare conditions.</p>

<h4>Action 13: capitalise on the changes made to <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr>âs methods and processes to ensure that <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> continues to support the rapid adoption of effective new treatments for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> patients with rare diseases</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> aspires to be a world leader for development, testing, access and uptake of new and innovative treatments and technologies. <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> is the independent body responsible for providing evidence-based guidance for the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> on whether medicines represent a clinically effective and cost-effective use of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> resources, ensuring that <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> funds are spent in a way that provides the most health benefit for society.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> assesses the majority of medicines through its standard technology appraisal programme and also operates a separate highly specialised technologies (<abbr title="highly specialised technologies">HST</abbr>) programme for a small number of medicines for very rare diseases.</p>

<p>This programme is a deliberate departure from the standard approach, recognising these very rare, severe diseases often have limited treatment options, as the uniqueness of the condition creates challenges for research, and difficulties in generating a robust evidence base to bring the product to market and secure access for patients.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> ensures patients are an active part of the appraisal process from the start of any topic evaluation. The patient contribution plays a part in supporting the committee to understand the condition, as well as the impact it has on patients and families. <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> now appraises all new medicines and, as a result of new commercial flexibilities, is able to recommend the vast majority of new medicines.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> has implemented its updated methods and processes for all topics starting after 1 February 2022. <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> gave particular consideration to the suitability of its methods and processes for treatments for rare diseases as part of a review that took into account a wide range of stakeholder views through a series of consultations.</p>

<p>A number of the changes adopted by <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> will support timely patient access to innovative medicines for patients with rare diseases, through the introduction of additional flexibilities in the appraisal process.</p>

<p>For example, <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> has introduced a new severity modifier for committees to consider the severity of the disease or condition under consideration when making recommendations. This reflects evidence that society values more highly health benefits for people with very severe conditions. Many rare conditions are also severe, and committees will be able to give additional weight to the treatment benefits for these conditions.</p>

<p>Where there is uncertain evidence in relation to a medicine â a particular issue for those for rare diseases where the population is small â <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> will now adopt a more flexible and proportional attitude towards evidence uncertainty within its decision-making.</p>

<p>In addition, <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> are adopting process changes to help improve participation of patients and clinical experts, introducing a summary of information for patients, as well as more flexibility to adapt consultation timelines for each appraisa to support more efficient timely access.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> has also refined the criteria used for routing a topic to the <abbr title="highly specialised technologies">HST</abbr> programme. This will achieve greater clarity and predictability for stakeholders around when a topic meets the <abbr title="highly specialised technologies">HST</abbr> criteria.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> will now implement these changes to make its methods and processes fairer, faster and more consistent â supporting timely patient access to new cost-effective treatments on the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>, including those for rare diseases. <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> will also be monitoring the effects of the new methods to assess their impact and has committed to undertaking modular updates to the methods as and when new evidence becomes available, and this will be reported to the England Rare Diseases Framework Delivery Group. <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> will continue to provide support to the life sciences industry, including companies developing therapies for rare diseases, further details of which are provided in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annexf">Annex F</a>.</p>

<h4>Action 14: monitor overall uptake of drugs for patients with rare diseases and map geographical access to those drugs</h4>

<p>The actions described above all aim to improve access to specialist care, treatment and drugs. However, there can be considerable variability in whether â and how easily â rare disease patients are actually able to get access to them.</p>

<p><abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Digital (<abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr>) are developing analytical approaches to monitor overall uptake of drugs for patients with rare diseases and map geographical access to those drugs. This will improve understanding of the uptake and impact of <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr>âs high-cost drug commissioning policies and relevant <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> technology appraisals at the population level. It will also provide insight into whether our ambitions of equity of access to treatment for rare diseases â regardless of geography (or whether care is at a specialised centre or not) â have been met.</p>

<p>The action involves measuring the overall number of people who are accessing a drug that has been recommended by <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> or commissioned directly by <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> and comparing this with the number of people who would have been expected to access the drug.</p>

<p>In addition, <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> will identify if there is a difference between the number of patients accessing the treatment and the number that would be expected for each region. The number of people expected to receive the drug will be measured against the figures set out in <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> guidance, which will have been informed by stakeholder engagement (clinical and non-clinical) in the preparation of the guidance, or from other data sources such as <abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr>.</p>

<p>For most services, this exercise will be run annually with results published in the highly specialised services annual report, and should lead to improvements in uptake and geographical access. Any services identified as outliers will be followed up and a plan developed outlining mitigation measures to improve access.</p>

<p>In parallel, <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Digital (<abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr>) will develop plans to share data and resources to support exemplar projects to put access to high-cost drug data into context of the wider rare disease population.</p>

<p>By utilising <abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr>â unique position to collect patient-level population-based data on everyone with a rare disease, <abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr> can compare data on patients who are receiving high-cost treatments with those who are not. This will generate enhanced, actionable data on geographical variation and potential access inequality in the use of high-cost drug treatments for rare diseases.</p>

<h2>Underpinning themes</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework sets out 5 underpinning themes where we need to drive progress to create a strong foundation for delivery across all 4 priorities of the framework. These themes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>patient voice</li>
  <li>national and international collaboration</li>
  <li>pioneering research</li>
  <li>digital, data and technology</li>
  <li>wider policy alignment</li>
</ul>

<p>In the framework, we also commit to considering health inequalities in developing national action plans. Here, in Englandâs Rare Diseases Action Plan, we include health equity as a sixth underpinning theme.</p>

<p>Maintaining momentum across these 6 themes is vital to our work to improve the lives of those living with rare diseases.</p>

<h3>Patient voice</h3>

<p>People living with rare conditions, their families, carers and the organisations that support them have a wealth of knowledge and lived experiences to share â it is crucial that their voices are heard. We are committed to putting the voice of the rare disease community at the heart of policy-making and to collaborating closely with those affected by rare disease.</p>

<p>With this in mind, we have consulted with the patient community at every level of the development of Englandâs Rare Diseases Action Plan.</p>

<p>With the support of Genetic Alliance <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, we recruited representatives of patient and public voice to both the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework Board and the England Rare Diseases Framework Delivery Group. Delivery partners have also been asked to provide evidence of consultation with the community in both developing and implementing the actions that form the basis of this plan. Examples of this include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr>âs engagement sessions with more than 80 individuals representing over 50 different organisations â including patient charities, patient advocacy groups, medical royal colleges, industry and academics â to inform the development of their actions</li>
  <li>Genomics Englandâs highly engaged participant panel who meet regularly to provide advice on research participant priorities and also sit on key committees, including the Ethics Advisory Committee and the Access Review Committee, the latter of which oversees data access processes for the National Genomic Research Library</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr>âs commitment to establishing a patient and public involvement group as part of its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.genomicseducation.hee.nhs.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="Genomics Education Programme">GEP</abbr> strategy</a> â this group will advise on different aspects of the programme including the <abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr>-specific rare disease actions, as well as providing a vehicle for individuals with lived experience of genomics and rare disease to input into the resources they develop</li>
</ul>

<p>The findings from reports published by others in this space have also been considered in the development of the action plan, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the recent Public Policy Projects report <a class="govuk-link" href="https://publicpolicyprojects.com/eventbrite-event/rare-diseases-action-plan-report-launch" rel="external">Implementing the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework</a>
</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Action for Rare Disease Empowerment">ARDEnt</abbr>âs report <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.camraredisease.org/ardent/" rel="external">Making the Unseen Seen: Rare disease and the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic</a>
</li>
  <li>Alexionâs report <a class="govuk-link" href="https://rareexperience2020.geneticalliance.org.uk" rel="external">Reforming Rare Diseases</a>
</li>
  <li>Genetic Allianceâs <a class="govuk-link" href="https://rareexperience2020.geneticalliance.org.uk" rel="external">Rare Experience 2020</a> patient survey</li>
</ul>

<p>These reports and others emphasise concerns within the rare diseases community that are echoed within the priorities of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework.</p>

<p>During development of this action plan, 2 community roundtables and an online questionnaire were used to capture feedback on the draft action plan from a range of stakeholders, including those living with rare diseases. We additionally partnered with Breaking Down Barriers (a network of over 50 organisations working together to improve the lives of families from diverse and marginalised communities) to host a workshop specifically aimed at understanding health inequalities in the context of the framework. <a class="govuk-link" href="#annexc">Annex C</a> contains further detail of these roundtables and workshops.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Forum online platform has been used as a key route for continual engagement with the rare disease community, promoting transparency through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>public posting of minutes and papers from board meetings</li>
  <li>a quarterly newsletter with updates from the 4 nations</li>
  <li>discussion boards around each framework priority</li>
  <li>a repository for policy and community papers</li>
</ul>

<p>A summary of issues and suggestions raised by users on the platform has been fed back directly to the delivery group and framework board, who in turn can ask the online platform to consider and provide feedback on specific topics. Now that the action plan has been published, we will continue to seek feedback via the online platform and the stakeholder forum as the actions are implemented.</p>

<p>We will also seek community input regarding the best measures of success when evaluating the outcomes of the action plan in order to ensure the lives of those living with rare diseases continue to improve under the framework.</p>

<h3>National and international collaboration</h3>

<p>The small numbers of patients with individual rare diseases make collaboration essential, both for the support of patient care and the delivery of robust research. We are committed to continuing collaboration with the rare diseases community across the world â including patients, healthcare professionals, researchers and industry â to share knowledge and ideas to improve outcomes.</p>

<p>We continue to work closely with our counterparts in the devolved administrations to ensure close alignment of the rare diseases action plans each of the 4 nations is developing.</p>

<p>One important area of collaboration is on national registries for congenital anomalies and rare diseases. Registries already exist in England and Wales, with a registry under development in Scotland. Work is also underway in Northern Ireland towards developing a rare disease registry.</p>

<p>All 4 nations of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> have committed to working together to make sure that registry activities align so that we can begin to achieve truly national disease registration. This will mean that we will have some of the largest population-based rare disease cohorts in the world, and allow us to compare activity and outcomes across nations.</p>

<p>Over the next year, the national registries will establish a formal work schedule to produce a plan for how to achieve standardisation of the minimum core data set and inclusion criteria, coding and routine analysis, as well as prioritising efforts regarding development of new methods to support rare disease registration and output. This will also involve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>taking into account stakeholder input on priorities and acceptable practice</li>
  <li>meeting fair processing obligations</li>
  <li>including opt-out systems for individuals</li>
</ul>

<p>We will also continue to build upon and explore new opportunities for international collaboration, including through the current <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ejprarediseases.org/" rel="external">European Joint Programme on Rare Diseases</a> (<abbr title="European Joint Programme on Rare Diseases">EJP RD</abbr>) and the proposed European Partnership on Rare Disease (which is expected to succeed the <abbr title="European Joint Programme on Rare Diseases">EJP RD</abbr>). It will be important to assess what assets and programmes of relevance to rare disease research the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> might use to contribute to the goals of this new partnership, while also investigating the possibility of leading new research actions.</p>

<p>We will engage in policy developments emerging from the recent UN Resolution addressing the challenges of persons living with a rare disease and their families.</p>

<p>As set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/about-nhs-digital/corporate-information-and-documents/directions-and-data-provision-notices/secretary-of-state-directions/national-disease-register-service-directions" rel="external">National Disease Registration Service Directions</a>, we will ensure the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> can continue to contribute to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/index.php" rel="external">Orphanet</a> (so that <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> data is included in the database) while also making use of this unique global information portal and its nomenclature for coding rare disease.</p>

<p>Although the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> is no longer able to participate as a member of the European Reference Networks (<abbr title="European Reference Networks">ERNs</abbr>), many <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> clinicians and patient advocacy groups continue to collaborate effectively with <abbr title="European Reference Networks">ERNs</abbr> across Europe.</p>

<p>We will also look to further align with international stakeholder engagement exercises such as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rare2030.eu/" rel="external">Rare 2030 foresight study</a>, which gathered the input of a large group of patients, practitioners and key opinion leaders to propose policy recommendations, under the leadership of EURORDIS-Rare Disease Europe.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization (<abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>) is currently designing the establishment of a Global Network for Rare Diseases (<abbr title="Global Network for Rare Diseases">GNRD</abbr>). This network will pool resources and connect centres of excellence around the world to improve diagnosis and care for people living with a rare disease. Over the next year, we will engage with <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> to support their work on setting up <abbr title="Global Network for Rare Diseases">GNRD</abbr>, and determine how centres of excellence in England could best engage with and support this network.</p>

<p>At a national level, <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> has developed and implemented a process for <abbr title="rare disease collaborative networks">RDCNs</abbr>. <abbr title="rare disease collaborative networks">RDCNs</abbr> are made up of providers (rare disease collaborative centres) who have an interest in a particular rare disease and are committed to working together to progress research, increase knowledge, and improve patient experience and outcomes. There are currently 13 <abbr title="rare disease collaborative networks">RDCNs</abbr> in place (listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annexe">Annex E</a>).</p>

<p>While the networks are coordinated by <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr>, providers can be from across the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, and <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> welcomes both national and international collaboration with <abbr title="rare disease collaborative networks">RDCNs</abbr>, including with <abbr title="European Reference Networks">ERNs</abbr> to ensure the best standards of care for patients. <abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr> is currently working with the <abbr title="rare disease collaborative network">RDCN</abbr> for Congenital Thoracic Malformations to explore how disease registration can be utilised to support the delivery of national <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-wide clinical care for rare conditions by these emerging networks.</p>

<p>International collaboration is also vital for screening policy. The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="National Screening Committee">NSC</abbr> has links with policy-making bodies in many countries. Further to this, the <abbr title="National Screening Committee">NSC</abbr>âs discussion about newborn screening for the rare condition severe combined immunodeficiency (<abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr>) was informed by contact with New Zealand, the US and the Netherlands, the learning of which is being transferred and used to inform the evaluation of <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> screening programmes are linked to European networks to further facilitate improved international engagement. The programmeâs laboratory adviser is currently President of the International Society of Neonatal Screening. This has facilitated links with German contacts in the discussion about <abbr title="whole genome sequencing">WGS</abbr> in the newborn screening programme. The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="National Screening Committee">NSC</abbr> will also continue to work with Genomics England on <abbr title="whole genome sequencing">WGS</abbr> and this will bring opportunities to broaden international relationships with initiatives such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.screen4care.eu/" rel="external">Screen4Care</a>.</p>

<h3>Pioneering research</h3>

<p>Scientific advances have underpinned many breakthroughs in the field of rare diseases, including the development of innovative treatments. As a global leader in science with a world-class research infrastructure and health system, we must continue to utilise these resources to benefit those affected by rare conditions.</p>

<p>The government is committed to supporting ground-breaking, innovative research. In the October 2021 Budget, we announced over Â£5 billion of funding over the next 3 years for health-related research and development (<abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr>), which included the largest ever uplift in health <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr>.</p>

<p>Many of the actions outlined under the 4 priorities of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework either support or are supported by research. Example actions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the development of Genomics Englandâs clinical research interface</li>
  <li>the newborns <abbr title="whole genome sequencing">WGS</abbr> research pilot</li>
  <li>raising awareness of rare diseases through the publication of epidemiological and research papers</li>
  <li>monitoring the uptake of high-cost drugs</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the small numbers of patients living with individual rare diseases, the ongoing work described in the âNational and international collaborationâ section will also be key - connecting researchers with relevant expertise and increasing the pool of potential participants to enable high-quality research with maximum patient benefit.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> has particular strengths in rare disease research. Alongside charities, industry and other organisations, the government primarily funds research into rare diseases via the <abbr title="National Institute for Health Research">NIHR</abbr> and <abbr title="UK Research and Innovation">UKRI</abbr>.</p>

<p>One prominent initiative is the rare diseases component of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://bioresource.nihr.ac.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="National Institute for Health Research">NIHR</abbr> BioResource</a>, which works in over 50 disease areas to link genetic information to clinical characteristics in order to provide greater understanding of disease mechanisms for the development of new treatments and diagnostics. As of December 2021, <abbr title="National Institute for Health Research">NIHR</abbr> BioResource has recruited over 21,230 patients with rare diseases from 50 <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> trusts in England. All participants are genetically characterised and have given consent to be recalled for clinical studies, including trials for new treatments. Over the next 5 years, we will provide Â£40 million of new funding to the <abbr title="National Institute for Health Research">NIHR</abbr> BioResource.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Institute for Health Research">NIHR</abbr> has also invested Â£816 million to support the infrastructure of 20 Biomedical Research Centres (<abbr title="Biomedical Research Centres">BRCs</abbr>) around the country. <abbr title="Biomedical Research Centres">BRCs</abbr> enable effective collaboration between world-leading universities and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> organisations, bringing together academics and clinicians to translate laboratory-based scientific breakthroughs into potential new treatments, diagnostics and medical technologies. The centres undertake themed research across a range of disease and therapeutic areas, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rare diseases</li>
  <li>genomics</li>
  <li>stem cell therapy</li>
  <li>regenerative medicine</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="National Institute for Health Research">NIHR</abbr> also supports the delivery of research funded by medical research charities and the life sciences industry through <abbr title="National Institute for Health Research">NIHR</abbr> Clinical Research Facilities â purpose-built facilities in <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> hospitals where researchers can deliver early-phase and complex studies â and the <abbr title="National Institute for Health Research">NIHR</abbr> Clinical Research Network, which supports the set-up and delivery of clinical research in the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>, and in other health and care settings.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Research and Innovation">UKRI</abbr>âs Medical Research Council (<abbr title="Medical Research Council">MRC</abbr>) also has a strong focus on rare diseases. The <abbr title="Medical Research Council">MRC</abbr>âs Population and Systems Medicine Board supports the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework, encouraging the scientific community to come forward with their best ideas aimed at addressing research questions related to rare conditions. <abbr title="UK Research and Innovation">UKRI</abbr> funds world-leading institutes such as the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Medical Research Council">MRC</abbr> Laboratory of Medical Biology</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Medical Research Council">MRC</abbr> London Institute of Medical Sciences</li>
  <li>Francis Crick Institute</li>
  <li>Health Data Research <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>National leadership and capacity is provided by assets such as world-leading cohort studies (for example, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Biobank</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://borninbradford.nhs.uk/" rel="external">Born in Bradford</a>), and <abbr title="Medical Research Council">MRC</abbr> units and centres at the cutting-edge of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>human genetics</li>
  <li>mitochondrial biology</li>
  <li>metabolic diseases</li>
  <li>biostatistics</li>
</ul>

<p>For businesses, the Innovate <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-supported Catapult network provides a gateway to supercharge innovation in the discovery and development of medicines, including cell and gene therapies.</p>

<h4>Action 15: map the rare disease research landscape to identify gaps and priorities for future funding</h4>

<p>While some rare diseases attract considerable research interest, others are less well studied and understood. With an estimated 7,000 rare diseases, it is important to better understand unmet need, engage with the rare disease community and elicit expert opinion to support prioritisation in addressing gaps.</p>

<p>To support pioneering research and translate outcomes into frontline clinical care, during the next year, we will work with the major funders of rare disease research, including research charities, to map the rare disease research landscape to identify gaps and priorities for future funding. This will involve mapping research against all of the frameworkâs priorities and across all disciplines, including social and economic research. We plan to publish the findings of this work in early 2023 and to feed the outcomes into next yearâs action plan.</p>

<p>We will also seek input on the particular challenges facing rare diseases clinical research delivery, which will feed into ongoing development of policy and strategies in this area. This will be embedded within the Vision for the Future of <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Clinical Research Delivery phase 2 implementation plan, which will be published later this year.</p>

<h3>Digital, data and technology</h3>

<p>Across the health and care system, we are using data more efficiently and effectively than ever before, empowering patients to take better control of their health and care journey. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased our reliance on digital developments and accessible data, and we intend to harness these advances to create a more seamless digital experience in healthcare moving forwards.</p>

<p>In September 2021, we published our draft strategy <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-saves-lives-reshaping-health-and-social-care-with-data-draft">Data saves lives: reshaping health and social care with data</a>. The strategy highlighted our vision to deliver truly patient-centred care by giving people better access to their personal health and care data, and a better understanding of how it is used. This is vital for giving patients the peace of mind that health and care staff have all the relevant information about them at their fingertips.</p>

<p>This vision will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>support patients to have digital access to their information (such as test results, medications, procedures and care plans) from across all parts of the system</li>
  <li>embed systems to easily manage appointments and refill medications</li>
  <li>give patients confidence that staff have the most up-to-date information, regardless of the care setting</li>
  <li>provide increased transparency about how data is protected and used</li>
  <li>better support co-ordination of care throughout the patient journey, including for the rare disease community</li>
</ul>

<p>To effectively support patient care and development of new treatments, it is crucial that data systems are interoperable, and that data can be easily and securely shared. Understanding how data standards, tools and systems can best work together will allow us to use data science more effectively to advance rare disease diagnostics, treatment, care, research and social support.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-digitrials" rel="external"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> DigiTrials</a>, the health data research hub for clinical trials, was established in 2019 to reduce the cost and complexity of developing new treatments, and create more opportunities for patient participation in research. Developed in close collaboration with patient and public representatives, the service enables clinical trials to use <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Digital data efficiently, improving the assessment of trial feasibility, and supporting improved planning and delivery of clinical trials in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> DigiTrials will help <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> patients across England participate in clinical trials of new treatments, generating results that will influence care for a wide range of conditions, including rare diseases, as well as supporting research.</p>

<p>Data is a cross-cutting theme of the governmentâs strategy for genomic healthcare, Genome <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, with a commitment in its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/genome-uk-2021-to-2022-implementation-plan/genome-uk-2021-to-2022-implementation-plan#cross-cutting-theme-data">first implementation plan</a> for NHSX to develop the case for investing in infrastructure to support the safe and efficient sharing of genomic data to improve healthcare and research.</p>

<p>This work aims to ensure that the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>âs existing genomic data sets â including those holding consented data from rare disease patients â are interoperable with each other. We will ensure that the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>âs rare disease registries are considered as part of this work. This federated approach would be supported by implementing standards set by the international Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (<abbr title="Global Alliance for Genomics and Health">GA4GH</abbr>), which the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> continues to fund through the <abbr title="National Institute for Health Research">NIHR</abbr>, <abbr title="Medical Research Council">MRC</abbr> and Wellcome. Commitments on this will also be included in forthcoming second-phase Genome <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> implementation plans, due to be published later this year.</p>

<p>Rare disease registries, such as Englandâs <abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr>, play an important role in helping researchers, clinicians, patients and service commissioners increase their understanding of rare diseases. The data collected and held by <abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr> describes the distribution of rare diseases at a population level, enabling rare disease epidemiology, and the assessment of geographical variation in medicine uptake and specialist care access. It can be used to identify potential health inequalities and support clinical research at a national level, while upholding the principles of data autonomy and fair processing obligations by communicating patientsâ rights to exercise the national data and <abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr> opt-outs.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr> also has a system for patient self-registration, and can carry out collection and analysis of patient self-reported data, and support other stakeholders in doing so. This has been recently demonstrated by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.melodystudy.org/" rel="external">MELODY study</a>, which collects extensive self-reported data from people with rare autoimmune rheumatic disease (for further detail, see<a class="govuk-link" href="#annexd">Annex D</a>). This allows people and families living with rare diseases to contribute their own data and observations, enriching the phenotypic data that are available for research.</p>

<p>In the coming year, we will partner with <abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr> to host a workshop to gather stakeholder feedback on the existing rare disease registration service. We will explore what more can be done to ensure that, as the lead delivery partner on population-level rare disease data, the service <abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr> offers meets the need of the rare disease community in delivering the ambitions of the action plan.</p>

<p>Drawing on lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, which included an increased adoption of telemedicine, <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> plans to create a digital toolkit to support virtual consultations, as set out under action 10 above. This has the potential to significantly reduce the burden on people living with complex, multi-system rare diseases by enabling patients to see more than one specialist simultaneously and alleviating the need to travel to different appointments across the country. As with all digital tools, use of the toolkit will need to be balanced with the need in some specialties for ongoing in-person consultations, and with patientsâ preferences and ability to access the required technology.</p>

<p>Digital and online resources â such as those being developed by <abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr>, described above under priority 2 â provide a valuable tool for healthcare professionals in understanding how best to care for a patient with a rare disease. The resources under development are being linked to existing digital platforms used across the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>, and include training materials and point-of-care resources providing relevant, concise and widely accessible information to support patient management.</p>

<p>In terms of using technology for diagnostic applications, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="National Screening Committee">NSC</abbr> is overseeing an in-service evaluation of polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>)-based screening for <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr>. The introduction of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> technology in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> labs screening for <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> may make it logistically less complicated to screen for other conditions, such as <abbr title="spinal muscular atrophy">SMA</abbr>, provided they meet the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="National Screening Committee">NSC</abbr> criteria. The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="National Screening Committee">NSC</abbr> secretariat and <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> are in contact to understand how the large study of <abbr title="spinal muscular atrophy">SMA</abbr> screening test accuracy might, depending on its outcome, inform <abbr title="spinal muscular atrophy">SMA</abbr> screening.</p>

<p>The use of artificial intelligence in bloodspot screening is also a potential topic of interest for the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="National Screening Committee">NSC</abbr> and will be factored into the committeeâs horizon scanning work.</p>

<h3>Wider policy alignment</h3>

<p>In implementing the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework, we will continue to work to ensure that the needs of rare disease patients are recognised in wider policy development. This will include close alignment with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.longtermplan.nhs.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Long Term Plan</a>
</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/genome-uk-the-future-of-healthcare">Genome <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a>, the governmentâs <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-wide strategy for genomic healthcare</li>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/life-sciences-vision">Life Sciences Vision</a>
</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="National Institute for Health Research">NIHR</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nihr.ac.uk/documents/best-research-for-best-health-the-next-chapter/27778" rel="external">Best Research for Best Health: The Next Chapter</a>
</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-future-of-uk-clinical-research-delivery">Saving and Improving Lives: The Future of <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Clinical Research Delivery</a></li>
  <li>other relevant strategies and policies</li>
</ul>

<p>Officials with wider responsibility for each of these strategies are members of our governance structures.</p>

<p>Improving the lives of those living with rare diseases goes beyond healthcare, encompassing a wide range of potential interventions including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>housing adjustments</li>
  <li>social care</li>
  <li>financial aid</li>
  <li>mental health support</li>
  <li>special educational needs support</li>
</ul>

<p>As described under priority 3 above, there are policy initiatives with particular importance for co-ordination of care with that we continue to align. These include initiatives on mental health and integrated care systems. Some people living with rare diseases have additional physical or learning needs, and we will continue to explore ways in which these can be supported through policy, such as the 2021 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-disability-strategy">National Disability Strategy</a> and recent <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nice.org.uk/about/what-we-do/into-practice/measuring-the-use-of-nice-guidance/impact-of-our-guidance/nice-impact-people-with-a-learning-disability" rel="external"><abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> recommendations regarding people with learning disabilities</a>.</p>

<p>With the increasing use of genomics in healthcare, workforce planning is critical. In alignment with the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Long Term Plan and delivery of the <abbr title="Genomic Medicine Service">GMS</abbr>, <abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr> is committed to educating and training the current and future workforce, reflected in this action plan through the training of future healthcare professionals on rare disease (see action 7).</p>

<p><abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr>, working with <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr>, will undertake periodical workforce data collection to aid understanding of workforce numbers and required configuration in the key speciality areas that focus on the health of and social care for people with both genetic and non-genetic rare diseases.</p>

<h3>Health equity</h3>

<p>Some people living with rare diseases may face additional barriers to accessing services and support, beyond the immediate challenges of their condition. The principles of the framework commit the 4 nations to</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">ensure any impacts on health inequalities are considered when developing action plans</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This includes involving a diverse range of voices at every level of policy development.</p>

<p>As part of the development of Englandâs Rare Diseases Action Plan, we have sought to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>better understand the health inequalities experienced by people from diverse and marginalised communities who are affected by a rare condition</li>
  <li>explore how health inequalities could be addressed under each of the framework priorities</li>
</ul>

<p>The Breaking Down Barriers workshop and stakeholder publications such as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.m4rd.org/2021/10/26/whose-voice/" rel="external">Whose Voice is it Anyway? meeting report</a>, which summarised the findings of an <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> engagement session hosted by RareQoL and Medics 4 Rare Diseases, highlighted a number of common themes, including the need for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a holistic approach to care and support that considers the needs of the whole family, both at the point of diagnosis and over the longer term</li>
  <li>accessible resources, taking into account peopleâs lived experiences, and the challenges associated with communicating complex medical terms across cultural and language barriers</li>
  <li>developing and maintaining trust in healthcare professionals</li>
</ul>

<p>With this in mind, <abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr> is committed to ensuring that the resources and promotional materials it develops reflect the diversity of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> population, both in terms of design and in the use of inclusive language. <abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr>âs competency frameworks include information on cultural awareness, and healthcare professionals can access a suite of online resources to help them support patients and their families through the <abbr title="Genomics Education Programme">GEP</abbr>. <abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr> also plans to enhance the involvement of the rare diseases community in the <abbr title="Genomics Education Programme">GEP</abbr> by including individuals in the development of resources where appropriate.</p>

<p>To ensure that the benefits of genomic healthcare are relevant to all communities, Genomics England is working on a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/initiatives/diverse-data" rel="external">Diverse Data initiative to increase representation of minority groups in genomic research programmes</a>. The initiative aims to tackle health inequalities by recruiting at least 15% of people from ethnic minority backgrounds to take part in research programmes, thereby reducing the historical bias towards populations of European ancestry.</p>

<p>Certain rare conditions, such as sickle cell disease, <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> and tyrosinaemia, disproportionately affect minority ethnic groups or communities, and it is important that these are not overlooked. An in-service evaluation of newborn screening for <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> has begun and a consultation on newborn screening for tyrosinaemia by the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="National Screening Committee">NSC</abbr> is currently underway.</p>

<p>Barriers to entry for clinical trials, including the need for services to be delivered locally, will be considered as part of the workshop on clinical research delivery mentioned above.</p>

<h4>Action 16: reduce health inequalities in <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> highly specialised services</h4>

<p><abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> has committed to look at ways to build on existing best practice, such as the use of equality and health inequalities impact assessments to further reduce health inequalities in their highly specialised services (HSS), through improved data collection, data-sharing (for example, with <abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr>), training and sharing best practice. This includes considering health inequalities at HSS annual clinical meetings, in service development and commissioning decisions, and in provider selection processes.</p>

<p>In addition, action 14 above will monitor overall uptake of drugs for patients with rare diseases and assess geographical variation in the use of high-cost drug treatments for rare diseases using population-based data in collaboration with <abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr>. This will be important in identifying and quantifying potential health inequalities in terms of access to treatments.</p>

<h3>Monitoring and evaluation</h3>

<p>The 2021 <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework commits to working closely with the rare diseases community to ensure the commitments developed are actionable, measurable and regularly reviewed.</p>

<p>All of the individual actions within this action plan are underpinned by a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/evaluation-in-health-and-wellbeing-creating-a-logic-model">logic model</a> setting out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the problem the action addresses</li>
  <li>a clear organisational owner for the action</li>
  <li>the outputs and outcomes that will be delivered</li>
  <li>the metrics that will be used to measure progress and effect of each outcome</li>
</ul>

<p>Following publication of this action plan, the delivery partners that make up the England Rare Diseases Framework Delivery Group will continue to meet regularly to report on progress on these actions and identify any barriers to implementation that need to be resolved. We will also continue to work together across the 4 nations of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to align policy and share â and learn from â best practice.</p>

<p>A central objective of this action plan is to improve transparency and to make sure that progress is visible to the rare disease community. The second England Rare Diseases Action Plan will be published at the start of 2023, and will report on progress against the actions set out here as well as proposing updated and new actions.</p>

<p>As well as being able to measure progress against individual actions, it is also important to be able to see whether the measures we are introducing are bringing about real change for people living with rare diseases. It can be challenging to capture the impact of individual actions on the overall patient experience, which â despite progress â may also be influenced by wider external factors, as we have recently seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies such as the recently proposed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://openresearch.nihr.ac.uk/articles/1-23" rel="external">mixed-methods evaluation of the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <abbr title="Genomic Medicine Service">GMS</abbr> for paediatric rare diseases</a> provide a valuable template, gathering views from those designing, implementing and using the service to better understand its outcomes and impact.</p>

<p>One way of measuring change is through <abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr>, which has been directed by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care to collect data:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">to help the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> in England, researchers, charities, people with congenital anomalies and rare diseases, and the public understand the prevalence of congenital anomaly and rare disease in England and to support wider understanding and treatment of these conditions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We will utilise the expertise and infrastructure within <abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr> (<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Digital) to understand the impact of relevant actions using patient level data.</p>

<p>Our aim is to improve the lives of people living with rare diseases and, in consultation with the rare disease community, following the publication of this action plan, we will also develop high-level metrics to support assessment of progress against each of the frameworkâs priorities. This is likely to include specifically designed surveys to create baseline data against which to measure change. In doing so, we aim to find robust approaches to address the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do rare disease patients experience more rapid diagnosis?</li>
  <li>has awareness increased among healthcare professionals?</li>
  <li>is care better coordinated?</li>
  <li>is there improved access to care, treatment and drugs?</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as being able to report on the progress of each action, we aim to be able to measure progress in what matters to people living with rare diseases â improvements to the quality of care that they receive.</p>

<h3>Future directions</h3>

<p>This is the first Rare Diseases Action Plan for England, setting out specific, measurable commitments to improve the lives of those living with rare diseases, which will be delivered over the course of 2022 to 2023. Although ambitious in their scope, these commitments are set against the backdrop of a health system that is continuing to manage the impact of new SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>

<p>While we remain committed to improving the lives of those living with rare diseases, it will not be possible to address every issue within this first year. The actions we have put forward do, however, create strong foundations on which we can build in future years.</p>

<p>During the coming year, the England Rare Diseases Framework Delivery Group will monitor and report on progress against the current actions. Progress will be reported in meeting minutes with a more detailed report in the second England Rare Diseases Action Plan at the start of 2023.</p>

<p>At the same time, we will continue to engage with stakeholders through the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Forum and online platform to gather feedback on implementation of actions. As described previously, we will work with the rare disease community to develop an approach for monitoring and evaluation.</p>

<p>We are aware that the rare diseases community has raised concerns that have not been addressed â or only partially addressed â in this action plan, to which we will need to turn our attention over the coming year.</p>

<p>The England Rare Diseases Framework Delivery Group will continue to meet every 8 weeks and, as well as reporting on progress, will develop new actions to address outstanding community concerns. These will be informed by delivery partnersâ own engagement activities, feedback from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Forum and online platform, and workshops (such as those described above on <abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr> and clinical research delivery).</p>

<p>Areas where we will focus include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>making sure future actions provide additional proportionate support for those with non-genetic conditions</li>
  <li>exploring ways of providing wider support and co-ordinated care for people living with rare diseases, including those who remain undiagnosed â for example, through social care provision, mental health support and special education support</li>
  <li>taking steps to improve access to advice and supportive resources for rare disease patients</li>
  <li>supporting people living with rare conditions and their families during the transition from paediatric to adult health and care services</li>
  <li>improving equitable access to specialists and post-diagnosis care</li>
  <li>strengthening rare disease networks and multidisciplinary teams</li>
  <li>ensuring care is given according to best practice guidelines</li>
  <li>continuing to improve data collection on rare diseases by <abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr>, including the ongoing expansion of existing data feeds from Genomic Laboratory Hubs to include the entire repertoire of rare disease National Genomic Test Directory results</li>
  <li>working across all delivery partners to improve access to rare disease data and reduce data silos, harnessing the power of data to assist diagnosis, research and decision-making</li>
  <li>ensuring as many people with rare diseases as possible have the opportunity to be entered into good-quality research studies</li>
  <li>continue to work with regulators to ensure rapid, safe and equitable access to innovative therapies, including new technologies such as <abbr title="advanced therapy medicinal products">ATMPs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>continuing to collaborate across the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and abroad, learning from examples of best practice and pooling resources to secure the best outcomes for small patient populations</li>
</ul>

<p>Recognising that there are many organisations with crucial roles in supporting people living with rare diseases beyond the publicly funded delivery partners listed in this action plan, we will look to partner with patient organisations and charities already performing valuable work under the 4 priorities of the framework. Most importantly, we will ensure, through ongoing dialogue, that people with rare diseases remain at the heart of the decision-making process.</p>

The roundtable provided an opportunity for delivery partners and members of the rare diseases community to discuss the draft actions intended to form the basis of the England Rare Diseases Action Plan. Delivery partners presented their draft actions, fielded questions and gathered feedback. Participants also discussed the overall coverage of framework priorities and suggestions for further work.</p>

<p>The second roundtable was held on 16 December 2021, and brought together those with lived experience of rare disease as well as a range of healthcare professionals (including clinicians, nurses and genetic counsellors). Participants provided feedback on the first draft of the England Rare Diseases Action Plan with discussion on each of the framework priorities and underpinning themes.</p>

<h3>England Rare Diseases Action Plan questionnaire</h3>

<p>In November 2021, a targeted online questionnaire was launched to gather detailed feedback on draft actions from people and organisations across the rare disease community.</p>

<p>The questionnaire was open for 3 weeks and received 92 responses from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>people living with a rare disease</li>
  <li>carers</li>
  <li>family members</li>
  <li>charities for patients with rare diseases</li>
  <li>healthcare professionals</li>
  <li>industry partners</li>
  <li>researchers</li>
</ul>

<p>The questionnaire asked respondents questions on each of the draft actions, gauging whether the community felt it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>would contribute towards implementing the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Rare Diseases Framework</li>
  <li>was sufficiently ambitious</li>
</ul>

<p>The questionnaire also asked whether the collection of actions listed under each priority addressed that priority as a whole.</p>

<p>Respondents were able to provide free text comments on each of the actions and priorities.</p>

<h3>Health inequalities workshop</h3>

<p>A community workshop was held to focus specifically on health inequalities experienced by people from diverse and marginalised communities who are also affected by a rare condition. This was hosted in partnership with Breaking Down Barriers, a network of over 50 organisations working together to improve the lives of families from diverse and marginalised communities.</p>

<p>Participants shared their lived experiences on issues relating to each of the framework priorities, with discussion questions including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what are your experiences of receiving or waiting for a diagnosis?</li>
  <li>how much do you feel healthcare professionals understand about you and your condition?</li>
  <li>what is your experience of care coordination?</li>
  <li>is access to specialist care, treatments and drugs equitable?</li>
</ul>

<p>Participants further discussed the larger question of how to create a fairer system which meets the needs of a diverse community.</p>

<h2>Annex D: progress to date</h2>

<h3>Priority 1: helping patients get a final diagnosis faster</h3>

<h4>Clinical diagnosis of rare diseases</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <abbr title="Genomic Medicine Service">GMS</abbr> was launched in England in October 2018 to ensure that the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> has the infrastructure required to provide access to a high-quality, equitable genomic medicine service. The <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <abbr title="Genomic Medicine Service">GMS</abbr> carries out over 600,000 genomic tests in England every year for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>common and rare diseases</li>
  <li>inherited diseases</li>
  <li>pharmacogenomics</li>
  <li>cancer</li>
</ul>

<p>The testing that is available is set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/national-genomic-test-directories/" rel="external">National Genomic Test Directory</a>, from single gene tests through to whole genome sequencing, and currently includes 357 rare disease clinical indications.</p>

<p>In December 2020, 7 <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <abbr title="Genomic Medicine Service">GMS</abbr> Alliances were established to support the mainstreaming and embedding of genomic medicine. In addition to their core work, each <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <abbr title="Genomic Medicine Service">GMS</abbr> Alliance has also led a national transformation project in 2021 to 2022, several of which impact on rare disease research and care. Over the course of 2021, each <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <abbr title="Genomic Medicine Service">GMS</abbr> Alliance has also undertaken several local transformation projects focused on patient needs in their particular geography. For example, the North West <abbr title="Genomic Medicine Service">GMS</abbr> Alliance are undertaking a project evaluating a new genomic testing technology to better diagnose and profile rare diseases. This focus on transformation activity will continue in 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p>In November 2020, the first <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <abbr title="Genomic Laboratory Hub">GLH</abbr> started clinical testing of <abbr title="whole genome sequencing">WGS</abbr>. All 7 <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <abbr title="Genomic Laboratory Hubs">GLHs</abbr> are now involved in live clinical testing of <abbr title="whole genome sequencing">WGS</abbr>, and significant progress has been made with overall samples increasing month on month. The capacity of the service is being continually expanded, with new rare disease conditions becoming eligible for <abbr title="whole genome sequencing">WGS</abbr> and new clinical indications beginning to be implemented across all 7 <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <abbr title="Genomic Laboratory Hubs">GLHs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Rare disease research</h4>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2035790" rel="external">significant new scientific study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in November 2021</a> showed that <abbr title="whole genome sequencing">WGS</abbr> can uncover new diagnoses for people across the broadest range of rare diseases investigated to date and could deliver enormous benefits across the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>.</p>

<p>The pilot study of rare undiagnosed diseases involved analysing the genes of 4,660 people from 2,183 families â all of whom were early participants in the 100,000 Genomes Project. The study, led by Genomics England and Queen Mary University of London, and supported by the <abbr title="National Institute for Health Research">NIHR</abbr> BioResource, found that using <abbr title="whole genome sequencing">WGS</abbr> led to a new diagnosis for 25% of the participants. Of these new diagnoses, 14% were found in regions of the genome that would be missed by other conventional methods, including other types of non-whole genomic tests.</p>

<p>Many of the participants had gone through years of appointments without getting any answers. By having their whole genome sequenced, diagnoses were uncovered that would not have previously been detectable, allowing patients to receive more focused clinical care.</p>

<p>Another <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj-2021-066288" rel="external">scientific study published in November 2021</a> similarly demonstrated the power of WHS to provide a diagnosis to people living with a rare disease, looking specifically at those with a suspected mitochondrial disease. Published in the British Medical Journal, researchers investigated the genomes of 345 patients with an unexplained multisystem progressive disorder who were participants in the 100,000 Genomes Project and had already undergone extensive investigations for mitochondrial disease.</p>

<p>A definite or probable genetic diagnosis was identified in 31% of families involved in the study, of which some allowed for improved clinical decision-making or specific treatment pathways. Importantly, most of the new diagnoses (63%) were non-mitochondrial, meaning they would likely have been missed if a targeted approach, rather than <abbr title="whole genome sequencing">WGS</abbr>, was taken.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr>, in partnership with the patient charity Histio <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, academics and clinicians, published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjh.17768" rel="external">paper describing a robust method for identifying people diagnosed with the rare diseases haemophagocytic lymphohistiocystosis</a> (<abbr title="haemophagocytic lymphohistiocystosis">HLH</abbr>) from routinely collected data. This means that England now has the largest population-based cohort of people with <abbr title="haemophagocytic lymphohistiocystosis">HLH</abbr> globally, and further work can be done to achieve a greater understanding of this rare and often fatal disease, including risk factors that lead to its onset. It also means that this method may be suitable for modification to support work on other rare diseases.</p>

<h4>Newborn screening for rare disease</h4>

<p>The diagnosis of rare disease through the 100,000 Genomes Project and the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <abbr title="Genomic Medicine Service">GMS</abbr> uses <abbr title="whole genome sequencing">WGS</abbr> to improve the diagnostics of patients who are already ill or symptomatic. One of the priorities outlined in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> strategy for genomics <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/genome-uk-the-future-of-healthcare/genome-uk-the-future-of-healthcare#executive-summary">Genome <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a> is to explore the potential of preventing disease through the expansion of genomic screening in early life.</p>

<p>It has been estimated that over 3,000 babies a year could benefit from life-saving or life-changing interventions if <abbr title="whole genome sequencing">WGS</abbr> is used to support diagnosis. By identifying such diseases at the earliest possible stage, clinicians have the greatest chance to treat before the disease can cause significant harm, improving the likelihood that the child will survive with a higher quality of life over the long term.</p>

<p>A national dialogue was performed to explore public views on the implications of <abbr title="whole genome sequencing">WGS</abbr> for newborn screening in 2021. The dialogue, commissioned by the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="National Screening Committee">NSC</abbr>, <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> and Genomics England, involved over 130 members of the public from across the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> with a range of backgrounds, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>individuals with genetic conditions</li>
  <li>new and expectant parents</li>
  <li>ethnic minorities</li>
  <li>young adults</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/implications-of-whole-genome-sequencing-for-newborn-screening">Implications of <abbr title="whole genome sequencing">WGS</abbr> for newborn screening report</a> was published in July 2021 and found that the public was broadly supportive, providing appropriate safeguards and resources are in place.</p>

<h3>Priority 2: increasing awareness of rare diseases among healthcare professionals</h3>

<h4>Upskilling the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> workforce</h4>

<p>Over the course of 2021, <abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr>âs <abbr title="Genomics Education Programme">GEP</abbr> has continued to develop bespoke educational resources to underpin the implementation of the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <abbr title="Genomic Medicine Service">GMS</abbr>. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 competency frameworks outlining the expected knowledge, skills and behaviours <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> staff need to facilitate genomic testing and the return of genomic test results</li>
  <li>a suite of 5 online courses to underpin these competencies</li>
  <li>a genomics advisors competency framework to support the development of genomic expertise at local, regional and national level</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr> has also continued to raise awareness of rare diseases through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/news-blogs-events/blogs" rel="external"><abbr title="Genomics Education Programme">GEP</abbr>âs weekly blog</a>, with more than 50% of the weekly blogs published in 2021 directly related to rare conditions.</p>

<h4>Understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with rare diseases</h4>

<p>In collaboration with academic partners, <abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr> published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/rheumatology/keab794/6410658" rel="external">whole-population studies</a> into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with a range of rare, late onset non-genetic conditions (autoimmune rheumatic diseases), highlighting their increased risks of COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation and death compared with the general population.</p>

<p>These results have informed policy and research initiatives to address the ongoing risks of severe outcome from COVID-19 in people who might remain vulnerable despite vaccination. It has also led to pioneering rare disease research with the launch of the <abbr title="Medical Research Council">MRC</abbr>-funded <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.melodystudy.org/" rel="external">MELODY study</a> (mass evaluation of lateral flow immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in immunosuppressed people), which is investigating vulnerability to COVID-19 infection following vaccination in a large cohort of people with rare diseases.</p>

<h3>Priority 3: better co-ordination of care</h3>

<h4>Research to support coordination of care</h4>

<p>In the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, co-ordinated care for patients with rare conditions is provided in different ways. Some people are cared for through specialist centres, care co-ordinators, multi-disciplinary teams, care plans or residential clinics where patients can access a range of services during one hospital visit. For others, care is not well co-ordinated and the burden of co-ordinating care can fall on the individual or their families.</p>

<p>To improve co-ordination of care it is vital to understand patient experiences and what current and best practice look like.</p>

<p>To this end, <abbr title="National Institute for Health Research">NIHR</abbr> funded the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://fundingawards.nihr.ac.uk/award/16/116/82" rel="external">CoOrdiNated Care Of Rare Diseases</a> (<abbr title="CoOrdinated Care of Rare Diseases">CONCORD</abbr>) study to investigate how services for people with rare diseases are co-ordinated in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, and how people living with rare diseases and healthcare professionals who treat rare diseases would like them to be co-ordinated.</p>

<p>Following an extensive literature review and consultation with the rare diseases community, the study published a landmark <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7319081/" rel="external">definition of co-ordination of care in rare diseases</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>co-ordination of care involves working together across multiple components and processes of care to enable everyone involved in a patientâs care [â¦] to avoid duplication and achieve shared outcomes, throughout a personâs whole life, across all parts of the health and care systemâ¦</p>

  <p class="last-child">co-ordination needs to be â¦ family-centred, holistic (including a patientâs medical, psychosocial, educational and vocational needs), evidence-based, with equal access to coordinated care irrespective of diagnosis, patient circumstances and geographical location.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><abbr title="CoOrdinated Care of Rare Diseases">CONCORD</abbr> also explored the extent and impact of care co-ordination â or lack thereof â through extensive interviews with individuals affected by rare conditions (including undiagnosed conditions) and family members who had a caring role.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13023-020-01664-6" rel="external">overall findings</a>, published in 2021, emphasised the importance of flexible care, which is capable of meeting patientsâ or carersâ individual needs throughout their rare disease journey. The study listed a number of recommendations from participants, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>being able to access professional support in co-ordinating care</li>
  <li>adapting the location, scheduling and services available at clinics and appointments</li>
  <li>improving communication using technology, care plans, accessible contact points and multidisciplinary team working</li>
</ul>

<p>The findings showed that care co-ordination for people with rare conditions could be improved, while recognising that there are additional challenges that can limit coordination, including difficulties diagnosing rare disease and the small numbers of people diagnosed with each individual condition.</p>

<p>Building on these findings, <abbr title="CoOrdinated Care of Rare Diseases">CONCORD</abbr> has produced a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.16.21266387v1" rel="external">taxonomy of care co-ordination</a> outlining different ways in which care can be coordinated for people living with rare conditions, as well as developing <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.16.21266395v1" rel="external">hypothetical models of care co-ordination</a>, exploring which types of co-ordination may be appropriate in different situations (including those with a specialist centre and those without).</p>

<h3>Priority 4: improving access to specialist care, treatment and drugs</h3>

<h4>Rare disease registration</h4>

<p><abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr> records those people with congenital abnormalities and rare diseases across the whole of England. As a result, <abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr> can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide data to support high-quality clinical practice</li>
  <li>empower patients and carers</li>
  <li>monitor the frequency and distribution of conditions</li>
  <li>support research</li>
  <li>inform planning and evaluation of health and social care services, including screening</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr> continues to make improvements to its service and published its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ncardrs-congenital-anomaly-annual-data">congenital anomaly statistics 2019 report</a> in September 2021.</p>

<p>Also in 2021, <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> put in place an arrangement to share high-cost medicines data with <abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr>. This will help determine if there is equitable access to drugs for patients with rare diseases and can support future <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> commissioning decisions. This agreement is already in place for cancer indications to support the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service, and has proved to be exceptionally efficient and valuable.</p>

<h4>Patient-centred research</h4>

<p>In March 2021, we published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-future-of-uk-clinical-research-delivery">Saving and Improving Lives: The Future of <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Clinical Research Delivery</a> setting out our ambition to create a patient-centred, pro-innovation and digitally enabled clinical research environment. Implementing this vision will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>unleash the potential of our clinical research environment to improve health</li>
  <li>capitalise on our renowned research expertise</li>
  <li>make the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> one of the best places in the world to design and deliver research</li>
</ul>

<p>The vision will be delivered through the cross-sector Recovery, Resilience and Growth Programme, and with the full involvement of stakeholders, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>patients and the public</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>industry</li>
  <li>medical research charities</li>
  <li>academia</li>
  <li>research regulators</li>
  <li>research funders including the <abbr title="National Institute for Health Research">NIHR</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the devolved administrations</li>
</ul>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-future-of-uk-clinical-research-delivery-2021-to-2022-implementation-plan">phase 1 implementation plan</a> was published in June 2021 setting out what we will deliver during financial year 2021 to 2022, and work is ongoing to inform the development of the phase 2 implementation plan, including the particular needs for rare disease clinical research delivery.</p>

<h4>Access to the most effective treatments available</h4>

<p><abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> is now among the fastest health technology assessment bodies in the world. Despite the pressures of COVID-19, the average time from marketing authorisation to first <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> output in 2020 to 2021 was 4 months for non-cancer topics and less than 1 month for cancer topics.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> recently concluded a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nice.org.uk/about/what-we-do/our-programmes/nice-guidance/nice-technology-appraisal-guidance/changes-to-health-technology-evaluation" rel="external">review of its methods and processes for health technology evaluation</a>. The changes made through the review will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr>âs methods remain world leading</li>
  <li>ensure they are suited to new and emerging types of technology</li>
  <li>make its processes fairer, faster and more consistent</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> is now implementing a number of changes that will benefit rare disease patients (see action 13).</p>

<h2>Annex E: rare disease collaborative networks</h2>

<p><abbr title="rare disease collaborative networks">RDCNs</abbr> are an important part of <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> provision to support patients with rare diseases. <abbr title="rare disease collaborative networks">RDCNs</abbr> are made up of providers (rare disease collaborative centres) who have an interest in a particular rare disease and are committed to working together to progress research, increase knowledge, and improve patient experience and outcomes.</p>

<p>Examples of priority areas of existing <abbr title="rare disease collaborative networks">RDCNs</abbr> include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>raising awareness of the rare disease</li>
  <li>improving co-ordination of care</li>
  <li>sharing of expertise and best practice</li>
  <li>establishing a disease registry to improve the understanding of the epidemiology of the rare disease</li>
  <li>research on treatment options and diagnostics</li>
  <li>establishing a support network for patients and families, including co-ordinated transition from paediatric to adult services</li>
</ul>

<p>Thirteen <abbr title="rare disease collaborative networks">RDCNs</abbr> have been established to date across a range of specialties and disease groups:</p>
