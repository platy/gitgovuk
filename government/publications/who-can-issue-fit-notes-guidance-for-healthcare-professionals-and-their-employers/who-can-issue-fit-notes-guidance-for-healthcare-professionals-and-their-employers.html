<h2>Chapter 1 - Introduction and context</h2>

<h3>Overview and summary</h3>

<p>1.1	This guidance has been developed to provide advice to doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists, physiotherapists and their employers about certifying fit notes.  The guidance is designed to provide a summary of the knowledge, skills, experience and training these healthcare professionals (<abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.  These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr>) are expected to have before certifying fit notes.</p>

<p>1.2	This non-statutory guidance has been developed with expert input from the four UK Governments, relevant professional bodies, patient representatives, regulators and statutory education bodies. It includes broad principles applicable across all those involved in certifying fit notes, with chapters covering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eligible <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.  These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr> - the experience and competence required for individuals to certify fit notes;</li>
  <li>Employer - the responsibilities and duties of those employing <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.  These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr> enabled to certify fit notes; and</li>
  <li>Governance - the relevant governance considerations including professional regulation and codes of practice.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.3	There are several cross-cutting issues relevant to both individual <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.  These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr> and employers, as such it is recommended that this guidance is read in full prior to certifying fit notes or making any decisions about how this task is undertaken in the workplace.</p>

<p>1.4	This guidance sits alongside two other key resources:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fit-note-guidance-for-healthcare-professionals">Getting the most out of the fit note</a>’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>  – which covers the practical task of undertaking a health and work conversation and completing the fit note form; and,</li>
  <li>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/" rel="external">e-learning for healthcare (<abbr title="E-learning for Healthcare">elfh</abbr>) fit note training module</a> which supports <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.  These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr> in preparing to certify fit notes as part of their practice, covered in more detail below (1.20 to 1.2)</li>
</ul>

<p>1.5	It is important that individuals and employers consider the above resources, alongside this guidance, to understand: who should undertake fit note certification; how to practically certify a fit note; what fit note certification entails.</p>

<h3>Context and Reasons for Change</h3>

<p>1.6	It is generally accepted and there is evidence <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup> that good quality work is good for physical health, mental health and wellbeing. Evidence also indicates that the longer someone is off work due to ill health, the less likely they are to return to employment<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup>. Even if people are not fully fit, engaging with work can deliver health benefits.</p>

<p>1.7	Modern healthcare reflects that <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.  These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr> from a range of disciplines now play a central role in leading the delivery of healthcare and support for patients to enable them to manage their health and wellbeing. Increasingly this applies to enabling people to safely remain in or return to work wherever possible, and to manage their own health and wellbeing<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup>.  Whilst multi-professional working has seen some <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.  These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr> with the relevant skills and experience support work and health conversations, until July 2022 only doctors (registered medical practitioners) were legally permitted to certify fit notes.</p>

<p>1.8	The Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) amended legislation, with effect from 1 July 2022 to enable nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists to certify fit notes in addition to doctors (these five professions are referred to in this guidance as healthcare professionals - <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.  These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr>).  The legislation is permissive, meaning that all these <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.  These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr> can legally certify a fit note, but they are not required to do so. Individuals should consider their scope of practice and ensure they have the relevant skills, knowledge and experience before undertaking health and work conversations and making decisions around certifying fit notes.</p>

<p>1.9	This change came following public engagement and research on the policy by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) through “Improving lives” (green paper 2016, response published 2017)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup>, “Health is Everyone’s Business” (consultation 2019, response published 2021)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup> and a published research report (2020).<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup></p>

<p>1.10	There has been broad public support for extending certification of the fit note which is also reflected in the views of the stakeholders (para 1.11), who have helped shape this policy. Changes have also been supported by wider stakeholders who have indicated that the fit note should not be exclusively completed by a doctor and the system should be allowed to embrace new ways of working by involving other <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.  These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr>.</p>

<p>1.11	The decision as to which professions to extend certification to has been agreed following engagement with, and advice from: <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>, Chief Allied Health Profession Officers, Chief Nursing Officers, Chief Pharmaceutical Officers, professional bodies, regulators, and policy officials across all four nations of the UK.</p>

<p>1.12	Enabling a wider range of <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.  These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr> to certify fit notes offers benefits for patients and the healthcare system and better recognises innovations in using a multi-disciplinary workforce to support patients. These <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.  These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr> can engage more directly with patients on matters of work and health without having to re-route requests to certify fit notes through doctors.</p>

<p>1.13	The changes aim to provide a seamless, faster system for patients; improve continuity of care; reduce bureaucracy in the healthcare system; and fully utilise skills by enabling relevant <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.  These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr> to conduct health and work conversations and certify fit notes. As a result of the changes, it is also expected that patients and employers will see benefits.</p>

<h3>Legislation</h3>

<p>1.14	A statement of fitness for work, commonly known as a fit note or ‘med 3’, is a form of medical evidence that can enable an individual to access health-related benefits or evidence eligibility for statutory sick pay (SSP). Its purpose, format and requirements are set out in regulations which cover England, Wales and Scotland. The fit note contains options to assess a person as ‘not fit for work’ or ‘may be fit for work taking account of the following advice’.</p>

<p>1.15	The legislation requires the HCP to undertake an assessment to complete a fit note. An assessment is defined as a consultation between the patient and HCP or consideration of a written report by another health professional. The fit note provides advice about the functional effects of a patient’s condition on their fitness for work but it does not require the HCP to have specialist knowledge of workplaces or occupational health or to suggest possible changes to a patient’s workplace or job.</p>

<p>1.16	Where patients are required to evidence eligibility for SSP, provided their employer is content, they can provide alternate forms of evidence<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup>. One example of this is the ‘<abbr title="Allied Health Professional">AHP</abbr> Health and Work Report’ <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup> which can be completed by all Allied Health Professions, including those that are not legally able to certify fit notes.</p>

<h3>Legislative change</h3>

<p>1.17	In 2017 the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> confirmed publicly their intention to reform fit notes, which at the time could only be certified by doctors and required a signature in ink to certify them.</p>

<p>1.18	Two legislative amendments were then made to improve the fit note and its use.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Removal of the requirement for signatures in ink (April 2022). This amendment removed the barriers to fit notes being completed and certified digitally so that relevant systems could be updated to simplify the processes for completing fit notes. (Wet signature fit notes continue to be accepted.)</li>
  <li>Extension of certification of fit notes to a wider group of <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.  These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr> – nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists. This change legally enabled any statutorily registered member of these professions, to certify a legally valid fit note.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.19	The legislation <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup> is permissive, meaning that it does not mandate these <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.  These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr> to certify fit notes. As with any clinical task, and in line with professional regulation, individual <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.  These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr> should consider their scope of practice before undertaking health and work conversations and making decisions around certifying fit notes.</p>

<h3>E-learning for Healthcare training (<abbr title="E-learning for Healthcare">elfh</abbr>) - ‘The fit note’</h3>

<p>1.20	An <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/" rel="external">online training module hosted on <abbr title="E-learning for Healthcare">elfh</abbr></a>  has been developed to support <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals.

<p>4.2	Any eligible registrant starting to take on the task of certifying fit notes should complete the <abbr title="E-learning for Healthcare">elfh</abbr> training (see chapter 1 and 3), in line with regulatory principles relating to maintaining up to date knowledge and skills.</p>

<p>4.3	All the regulatory bodies <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">[footnote 22]</a></sup> that oversee the professions enabled by law to certify fit notes include in their standards of practice a form of words stipulating that:</p>

  <li>Registrants must keep their knowledge and skills up to date and relevant to their scope of practice</li>
  <li>Registrants must undertake continuing professional development</li>
</ul>

<h3>Applying regulatory standards when certifying fit notes</h3>

<p>4.4	Beyond the need to complete appropriate training ahead of undertaking new tasks, all relevant regulatory bodies include principles that are particularly applicable to taking on certifying fit notes. Employers and individual professionals should pay particular attention to the following principles:</p>

<p>4.5	Competence and scope of practice - The importance of recognising and working within the limits of the <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.  These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr> individual level of competence, knowledge and skills, and of seeking input from appropriately qualified colleagues when needed. This principle is applicable if for example a patient requests a fit note due to a health condition that is not within the scope of a registrant’s clinical practice.</p>

<p>4.6	Person-centred care - The importance of treating people as individuals, upholding their dignity and listening to their concerns and preferences, as well as responding honestly to their questions. This principle is particularly applicable when having a work and health conversation with a patient which benefits from shared understanding and joint decisions about care.</p>

<p>4.7	Teamwork - The importance of working co-operatively with multidisciplinary team colleagues, respecting their skills and contributions and sharing relevant knowledge with other colleagues involved in a patient’s care. This principle is relevant because patients may have health and work conversations with multiple members of the clinical team and can benefit from clear and consistent information.</p>

<p>4.8	Communication - The importance of communicating clearly and professionally with patients and the public, providing the information they need in a way that is easy to understand and is appropriately recorded. This is particularly relevant given that written fit notes will need to be used and understood by not only the patient involved in the fitness to work discussion but also their employer and others involved in implementing any advice in the note.</p>

<p>4.9	Confidentiality - The importance of treating all patient information as confidential and ensuring patients’ dignity and privacy. This is particularly relevant due to the wide number of settings in which health and work conversations may happen and means that such a conversation should not take place unless a private place for discussion is available.</p>

<p>4.10	Raising concerns - The importance of raising concerns or challenging poor behaviours when patient safety is at risk, even when difficult to do so, and of contributing to a culture that allows <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.  These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr> to raise concerns safely. This is particularly relevant as registrants may be asked to certify fit notes in situations that would mean practicing beyond their role, experience and competence or under pressure from a patient. They should be able to confidently refuse to do this and be supported to deal with potential pressure to act outside of professional ethical boundaries.</p>

<h3>Considerations of employer policies and procedures</h3>

<p>4.11	It is important for <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.  These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr> and employers (where relevant) to consider practical issues that may affect registrants’ abilities to certify fit notes in a way that complies with the above regulatory principles.</p>

<p>4.12	For example, in some settings a HCP may not have access to a patient’s relevant medical history and would need to consider whether a fit note could be appropriately certified in this circumstance. In other settings a HCP may be limited in their ability to connect with other members of the clinical team involved in a patient’s care, to the possible detriment of their ability to make a judgment about fitness to work.</p>

<p>4.13	As such it is vital that <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.  These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr> and those involved in managing and planning services consider these regulatory principles and the specific context they are operating in when making decisions about which professionals can appropriately certify fit notes to patients and service users.</p>

<h2>Questions for healthcare professionals</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span>	What is a fit note?</h3>

<p>A statement of fitness for work, commonly known as a fit note or Med3, is an official statement from a doctor, nurse, occupational therapist, pharmacist or physiotherapist. It is issued to provide evidence of the advice a healthcare professional (HCP) has given about their patient’s fitness for work. <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.  These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr> should record details of the functional effects of their patient’s condition and this does not need to be job-specific.</p>

<p>Fit notes can be used by both individuals in work and those out of work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For individuals in work, where the advice is they ‘maybe fit for work’, it can enable them to return to work with adjustments. Where adjustments are not possible, or where the advice is they are ‘not fit for work’, it enables individuals to gain access to statutory sick pay.</li>
  <li>For individuals out of work it can be used to support a claim for incapacity-related benefits or to show that they have been unable to fulfil certain benefit requirements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fit notes are a useful tool to enable better conversations about work and health. This can help patients: return to work where appropriate; aid their recovery; enable them to communicate effectively with their employers about their health.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Who might need a fit note?</h3>

<p>If a person is assessed as having a health condition that impacts on their ability to work they can be issued with a fit note after the seventh day of illness. The fit note is a healthcare professional’s assessment of a patient’s fitness for work. If, following assessment the patient is considered fit for work they do not need a fit note, even if it is asked for.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Who can certify fit notes?</h3>

<p>Until July 2022 only doctors were legally permitted to certify fit notes. The Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) amended legislation, with effect from the 1 July 2022 to enable nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists to certify fit notes. These five professions are referred to in the guidance as healthcare professionals (<abbr title="Healthcare Professionals.

<p>The HCP certifying the fit note can do so based on consideration of a written report by another health professional involved with the diagnosis or care planning of the patient. It is not necessary for this written report to be undertaken by a member of one of the five professions listed in regulations as having the ability to certify fit notes. To note, the HCP who certifies the fit note is accountable, even when based on the written report of another health professional.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Do the changes apply across the whole UK?</h3>

<p>Legislative changes apply to all registered nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists, and physiotherapists and doctors at point of registration in Wales, Scotland, and England.</p>

<p>Northern Ireland are also laying their own legislation which will mirror this.</p>

<p>Where private providers are commissioned to deliver NHS services that cover situations in which it would be suitable to certify a fit note, such as following surgery, they are able to request clerical fit note pads directly from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Provided it follows the rules set out in regulations healthcare professionals operating privately could issue a report that can be deemed valid as a fit note. However, this should only be done if it is within their scope of practice as set out in the drafted non-statutory guidance and in line with all clinical tasks.
Private providers should take into consideration the implications of issuing medical evidence for fitness for work that is offered free to NHS patients as there may be subsequent requests for additional information, particularly for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefits, that claimants are not expected to have to pay for.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11. </span> As a ‘community pharmacist’ can I provide a fit note?</h3>

<p>As whole professions are named in legislation, any registered practicing doctor, nurse, occupational therapist, pharmacist or physiotherapist can legally certify a fit note.</p>

<p>Fit notes are not part of the NHS services which community pharmacies provide and community pharmacists will not/do not have access to the ‘Med3’ - which is the technical name for the fit note provided for free under NHS provision.</p>

<p>Fit notes should only be certified following a full assessment of a patient’s fitness for work, and therefore should be provided by a clinician with a holistic oversight of the individual’s condition.</p>

<p>Pharmacists working in multidisciplinary teams within general practices or hospital settings who are able to assess patient’s fitness for work, will have access to the official Med3 form.</p>

<p>Pharmacists intending to issue fit notes should make sure that they complete the appropriate training and meet the standards for pharmacy professionals set out by the regulator.</p>

<p>The intention is that ‘where’ the fit note is certified will remain the same but there will be a wider range of healthcare professionals ‘who’ are able to certify the notes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12. </span>	Do I need access to a patient’s medical history to certify a fit note?</h3>

<p>Individual <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.

<h3>
<span class="number">14. </span> What do these changes this mean for the Allied Health Professionals Health and Work Report? </h3>

<p>It does not change anything about this tool which can still be used as before, whereby provided a patient’s employer agrees it can evidence eligibility for statutory sick pay (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employers-sick-pay">see SSP guidance</a>). The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.ahpf.org.uk/AHP_Health_and_Work_Report.htm" rel="external"><abbr title="Allied Health Professional">AHP</abbr> Health and Work Report</a>  and the fit note are similar in content. <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals.

<span class="number">15. </span> How do <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.  These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr> work with their employers to start using the fit note?</h3>

<p>The new guidance  is for <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.  These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr> and their employers to work out how to make this change in practice. It covers job roles, scope of practice and how employers can provide in house development opportunities for <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals. In this guidance, the term healthcare professionals is used to relate only to members of the five professions who can certify fit notes.  These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr> new to the task of certifying fit notes.</p>

<p>As four new professions are involved, employers may find it easier to make the changes across impacted staff together. For example, in primary care, it will be important to involve Practice Managers, GP’s, Nursing Leads, Nurses, <abbr title="Allied Health Professional">AHP</abbr>’s and Receptionists in the change.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16. </span>	If the changes are about reducing the burden on GPs, should doctors delegate requests to certify fit notes to nurses, physios, occupational therapists, or pharmacists?</h3>

<p>A patient should be assessed by the best person to address their health condition or concern - effective triage of this will take place at a localised level in line with other clinical tasks. The guidance is clear that the HCP certifying fit notes should only do so as part of their agreed scope of practice. It is also worth noting that patients may not present as specifically requesting a fit note and that, in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-nhs-choice-framework/the-nhs-choice-framework-what-choices-are-available-to-me-in-the-nhs">NHS choice framework</a>, patients can request to see specific <abbr title="Healthcare Professionals.

These are doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists.">HCPs</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17. </span>	What is the process for patient complaints about fit notes?</h3>

<p>In common with all patient complaints, the patient is able to raise a complaint with the organisation providing or commissioning these services who will have their own complaints arrangements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18. </span>	What further information can the Department of Work and Pensions request following provision of a fit note?</h3>

<p>When deciding benefit entitlement <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may seek further information from professionals involved in the patient’s care. This could be via a telephone call or a formal request for a written report. These services are contracted to healthcare professionals working on behalf of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> (eg from Centre for Health and Disability Assessment).</p>

<p>Patients give consent for this information to be provided as part of their claim and you do not need to seek additional consent.  The healthcare regulators provide guidance on patient confidentiality, including consent and implied consent, which provides useful advice on how to make a decision on the disclosure of information, for example, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/ethical_guidance/confidentiality.asp" rel="external">General Medical Council</a> confidentiality guidance (paragraph 115) states ‘you may accept an assurance from an officer of a government department or agency, or a registered health professional acting on their behalf, that the patient or a person properly authorised to act on their behalf has consented’.</p>

<p>Wherever possible, information collection is kept to a minimum but at times professional reports to substantiate claims are needed. This information is invaluable to ensure your patients get their correct entitlement with the minimum of disruption.</p>

<p>The form of the information requested will depend on which benefit the claimant is entitled to, for example most information requests regarding Universal Credit (UC) and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) claims will be on the UC/ESA113. A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dwp-factual-medical-reports-guidance-for-healthcare-professionals/dwp-medical-factual-reports-a-guide-to-completion#essential-details">full guide to medical evidence reports can be found here</a>. You can complete these reports from your medical records and knowledge of the patient without carrying out a separate examination of your patient.</p>

<p>As outlined in the guidance, the healthcare professional who certified the fit note should be regarded as responsible for that episode of care, including responding to any requests for further information or evidence from the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> or the patient’s employer for the duration of the fit note. To note, the claimant is responsible for providing the relevant contact details that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> use to request further information.</p>
