<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Who is this guide for?</h2>

<p>This guide is particularly aimed at those working within academy trusts who may be involved in procurement and tendering but who might not have specialist procurement training. For example, those staff based in finance and administration teams who are asked to support a tendering process, or heads of academies who are seeking to tender for goods, services or works for the first time. It may also serve as an aide-memoire for experienced practitioners.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>For academy trusts to function well and to ensure a high quality of education is achieved for pupils, the effective and proper procurement of goods, services or works is essential. This can be as simple as procuring new sports equipment for the PE department, or it can extend to awarding a multi-million-pound contract for a new building.</p>

<p>The way in which goods, services and works are procured is equally as important as what is procured. Indeed the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academy-trust-handbook">Academy Trust Handbook</a> (which academy trusts must comply with) sets out several requirements for procurement. Paragraphs 2.27 to 2.29 state academy trusts must ensure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>spending has been for the purpose intended and there is probity in the use of public funds</li>
  <li>spending decisions represent value for money</li>
  <li>internal delegation levels exist and are applied</li>
  <li>a competitive tendering policy is in place and applied, and the procurement rules and thresholds in the Public Contract Regulations 2015 and Find a Tender Service are observed</li>
  <li>professional advice is obtained where appropriate</li>
</ul>

<p>To ensure all the above are in place, every academy trust will have its own procurement policy which will be implemented by procurement procedures. This procurement policy may be a stand-alone document or may be contained within wider trust financial regulations. The policy will set out the rules for obtaining written quotes and when a tender process must be used, in accordance with public procurement regulations. It is important to consider the total value of the proposed contract before starting a procurement, to ensure the rules are applied correctly.</p>

<p>Procurement involves the entire process from identifying the need to make a purchase through to payment of the invoice, whereas tendering itself is the process of going out to the external market to obtain bids and how a supplier is appointed for the goods, services or works needed.</p>

<p>Under contract regulations there are five procedures used to award contracts in the tendering process and the two most common types (open tenders and restricted tenders) are explained in this guide. The three other procedures (competitive dialogue, competitive with negotiation and innovation partnership) can only be used in specific circumstances, and it is not expected that they will be commonly used by academy trusts, so they are omitted from this guide.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>What is the aim of this guide?</h2>

<p>Tendering can be a complex subject and as you navigate through the various stages you may come across phrases or acronyms which are new to you.</p>

<p>This guide uses plain English to explain the more common words and phrases you may see and then includes examples of how they might apply in an academy trust setting. This guide will help you to navigate more easily some of the processes involved, but its aim is not to tell you how to procure goods, services or works.</p>

<p>There are links at the end of the document to more detailed guidance to support you further.</p>

<p>Please note this guide is not intended to be a comprehensive glossary of terms nor is its aim to provide a legal definition of each term.</p>

      <td>Approved supplier list (sometimes referred to as preferred supplier status)</td>
      <td>A list of pre-approved suppliers with which an organisation can contract. To be 'pre-approved' suppliers will need to have already gone through a formal procurement process, for example an <a class="govuk-link" href="#Open_tender">open tender</a> exercise in line with procurement regulations. The supplier may or may not have to be used exclusively depending on the terms of the original contract.</td>
      <td>A trust may choose to tender for a Mechanical and Electrical (M&amp;E) maintenance contract that gives all academies that are part of the trust the option to contract with the winning supplier for M&amp;E work. This supplier would then become a preferred supplier for M&amp;E work.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Call off contract/mini competition</td>
      <td>Pre-qualified suppliers are included in a <a class="govuk-link" href="#Framework_agreement">framework agreement</a> with terms and conditions. Buyers can call off and award individual contracts to those suppliers during the duration of the framework agreement.<br><br>The pricing of the contract can either be pre-agreed in the framework agreement or can be determined by a 'mini-competition' between some or all the suppliers that have been listed in the framework agreement to secure the best price and quality available.</td>
      <td>If a trust wanted to find out which of the suppliers on a cleaning services framework were most competitive for their specification, it would invite them to submit bids and the winning bid would be subject to the pre-agreed terms and conditions.<br><br> After choosing the winning bid the trust would then "call off" the agreed contract with an order form which would reflect the specification and price.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Collude / collusion</td>
      <td>Suppliers or other parties, such as agents, acting in a manner that is not consistent with open market competition to agree prices or quality. The terms have the potential to be indicative of fraudulent or illegal acts if they relate to breaking procurement law.</td>
      <td>Two grounds maintenance contractors may agree that they will charge a certain price for their work to prevent them undercutting each other and eroding profit margins.</td>

      <td>Compliance</td>
      <td>Refers to conforming with regulations, typically procurement law but also with other relevant legislation, regulation, policies, and guidance.</td>
      <td>Within public sector procurement this means following the <a class="govuk-link" href="#PCR">Public Contract Regulations 2015</a> when carrying out any procurement activities.<br><br>It also applies to the additional requirements for academy trusts contained in the Academy Trust Handbook, the trust's own procurement policies, procedures, and its internal delegation levels.</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Financial levels of authority</td>
      <td>These are the levels at which individuals within an organisation can approve expenditure.</td>
      <td>For an academy trust these limits will be set out within its list of internal delegation and are likely to be based on seniority of role. The limits will specify a maximum amount of expenditure which can be authorised. For high value spend it is likely that trust board approval will be required.</td>

More information can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-a-dfe-approved-framework-for-your-school">here</a>.<br><br> By using a DfE framework, trusts can be assured of compliance with procurement regulations, quality standards and value for money.</td>
