<h2>Controlling your personal information</h2>

<p>It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. If you believe that any information, we are holding about you is incorrect or incomplete, please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dataprivacy@gemserv.com">dataprivacy@gemserv.com</a>.</p>

  <li>request access to your personal data: this enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it</li>
  <li>request correction of your personal data: this enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us</li>
  <li>request erasure of your personal data: this enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it</li>
