<h2>Legal basis for processing</h2>

<p>We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use it for a new purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal grounds which allows us to do so.</p>

<p>We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. We need all the categories on information in the list above (see section 2) primarily to allow us:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to perform a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of the official authority given to us, in particular, when we process your applications and follow up on them</li>
  <li>to comply with a legal obligation, when for example, we need to retain your data for a certain time</li>
  <li>to carry out processing that is necessary for a contract e.g. to take the specific steps necessary to offer you a grant</li>
  <li>for research purposes and/or for statistical archiving in the public interest</li>
</ul>

<h2>Automated decision making</h2>

<p>We will not use your personal data in any automated decision making (making a decision solely by automated means without any human involvement) or profiling (automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain conditions about an individual).</p>

<h2>When we will share your data</h2>

<p>We will share your personal data information with third-party service providers, where they are contracted by us to provide specific services in order to facilitate delivery of our services for the purposes set out in Section 3.</p>

<p>We will allow the following third parties to process your personal data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>back-office service providers for data storage services</li>

  <li>research organisations for research, evaluation and statistical archiving purposes – including for the construction of sample frames</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Green Heat Network Fund">GHNF</abbr> scheme delivery partner</li>
</ul>

<p>We require our third-party service providers to take appropriate security measures to protect your personal information in line with our policies. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes. We only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>

<p>We will not transfer the personal information we collect about you to the service providers located outside the UK, EU and <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>, unless they ensure that your personal information receives an adequate level of protection. We will take steps to ensure your privacy rights are protected and your personal information is treated in a way that is consistent with and which respects Data Protection Legislation, by putting in place appropriate measures, including requiring appropriate security measures.</p>

<p>We may also need to share your personal data with Public Authorities (e.g. the police) or to otherwise comply with the law, for example, when we need to publish or disclose data under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.</p>

<p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent your personal data being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect.</p>

<h2>How long do we retain your personal information?</h2>

<p>We will only retain your personal information as for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purpose of satisfying any legal or reporting requirements. These retention periods are set in line with the <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> data retention schedule. In the case of the <abbr title="Green Heat Network Fund">GHNF</abbr> this would be seven years following the end of a projects reporting obligations as an applicant or successful project.</p>

<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you.</p>

<h2>International transfers</h2>

<p>As your personal data is stored on our IT infrastructure and shared with our data processors Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, it may be transferred and stored securely in the UK and European Economic Area. Where it is the case that your personal data is stored outside the UK and <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> it will be subject to equivalent legal protection through the use of Model Contract Clauses.</p>

<h2>Controlling your personal information</h2>

<p>It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. If you believe that any information, we are holding about you is incorrect or incomplete, please email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ghnfcorrespondence@beis.gov.uk">ghnfcorrespondence@beis.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>In accordance with the Data Protection Legislation, under certain circumstances, you have the right to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>request correction or completion of the personal information that we hold about you</li>
  <li>request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below)</li>
  <li>object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object if you wish to opt-out from our mailing list</li>
  <li>request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it</li>
  <li>request the transfer of your personal information to another party</li>
  <li>object to the processing of your personal data</li>
  <li>request a copy of any personal data you have provided, and for this to be provided in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format</li>
</ul>

<p>You will not have to pay a fee to exercise any of your rights. However, we may charge a ’reasonable fee’ for the administrative costs of complying with a request if it is manifestly unfounded or excessive, or if an individual requests further copies of their data. If we refuse your access to personal data, we will explain the reasons in our response to you. If you wish to exercise any of your rights, please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ghnfcorrespondence@beis.gov.uk">ghnfcorrespondence@beis.gov.uk</a>.</p>
