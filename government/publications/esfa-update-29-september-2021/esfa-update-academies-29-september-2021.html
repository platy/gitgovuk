<span class="number">4. </span>Reminder: Fair funding for all – completing our reforms of the National Funding Formula</h2>

<p>The Department for Education’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/fair-school-funding-for-all-completing-our-reforms-to-the-national-funding-formula">Fair school funding for all: completing our reforms of the National Funding Formula consultation</a> closes tomorrow, Thursday 30 September.</p>

<p>This consultation seeks views on how to simplify the current funding process and ensure all schools are funded on a single, fair, and consistent basis.</p>

<p>The introduction of the schools National Funding Formula (NFF) in 2018 to 2019 was a major step forward from the postcode lottery of the previous funding system. Our ambition is now to complete those reforms, so that every school’s final funding allocation is determined by the same, national formula, and is no longer subject to further adjustment by local authorities.</p>

<p>The consultation presents our proposals for how such an NFF, that is directly applied to schools’ budgets, should operate. It also sets out the next steps to ensure a smooth transition towards this goal.</p>

<span class="number">9. </span>Information: consultation on prioritising schools for the School Rebuilding Programme</h2>

<p>The Prime Minister announced the School Rebuilding Programme (SRP) in June 2020 to carry out major rebuilding and refurbishment projects at schools and sixth form colleges in England over the next decade. We have previously announced the first 100 schools in the programme. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-rebuilding-programme/school-rebuilding-programme" class="govuk-link">Details of these and the programme</a> are available on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>We are now consulting on the approach to prioritising schools for future places in the programme, to identify schools most in need of major rebuilding or refurbishment. Further information on the consultation process and how you can contribute your views can be found on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/prioritising-schools-for-the-school-rebuilding-programme">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>The consultation is due to close shortly, so please provide your views by 11:59pm on 8 October.</p>
