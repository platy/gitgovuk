<p>The page explains the steps in the staff transfer process. Including actions for exporting line managers.</p>

<p>As the employee’s current manager you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>help the employee with their transfer</li>
  <li>support a smooth transfer between departments</li>
  <li>make sure the steps in the process are completed</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need to help the employee you should use this guidance and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-civil-servants-how-to-move-jobs-between-departments-and-agencies/how-to-move-roles-across-the-civil-service-guidance-for-employees?preview=6895208" rel="external">guidance for employees</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-civil-servants-how-to-move-jobs-between-departments-and-agencies/how-to-move-roles-across-the-civil-service-guidance-for-importing-managers?preview=6895401" rel="external">importing managers</a>.</p>

<h2>Step 1: The employee accepts a provisional job offer in a new department</h2>

<p>They should follow the instructions in the emailed job offer.</p>

<h2>Step 2: The employee completes Part A-1 of the staff transfer form</h2>

<p>The employee’s new department needs the information from Part A-1 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-civil-servants-how-to-move-jobs-between-departments-and-agencies">staff transfer form</a> to help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify current and valid <a class="govuk-link" href="https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-civil-servants-how-to-move-jobs-between-departments-and-agencies/staff-transfers-further-details-for-exporting-managers?preview=6895331#BPSS" rel="external">baseline personnel security standard</a> (BPSS)</li>
  <li>identify current and valid <a class="govuk-link" href="https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-civil-servants-how-to-move-jobs-between-departments-and-agencies/staff-transfers-further-details-for-exporting-managers?preview=6895331#NSV" rel="external">national security vetting</a> (NSV)</li>
  <li>transfer any existing security clearance</li>
  <li>start any new BPSS and security clearance needed</li>
</ul>

<p>The employee’s security clearance will be transferable unless there is a risk flag or an issue with the transfer.</p>

<p>Not all departments need the employee to complete every section. The employee’s new department will tell them if there are any sections they do not need.</p>

<p>The employee should follow the instructions contained in their job offer. To avoid delays, they should contact the vacancy holder if they have any questions.</p>

<h2>Step 3: The employee shares salary information with their new department and submits Part A-1</h2>

<p>The employee sends Part A-1 to the vacancy holder unless their new department has instructed otherwise. They will also be asked to send their 2 most recent payslips to agree their new salary.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;Step 4: The employee’s new department does BPSS checks</h2>

<p>The type of BPSS checks and who is responsible will vary by department. For example, some departments will always do a criminal records check. Other departments may not.</p>

<p>The employee’s new department will contact them to progress BPSS checks, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identity</li>
  <li>right to work in the UK</li>
  <li>right to work in the Civil Service</li>
  <li>criminal record (unspent convictions only)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some departments do this at interview, but they will not repeat the checks at this stage.</p>

<h2>Step 5: You agree a start date</h2>

<p>You agree a start date with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the employee</li>
  <li>the employee’s new manager/vacancy holder</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>It is strongly advised to agree a start date on the first of the month. Otherwise, this will have an effect on the employee’s pay.</p>
</div>

<p>If the employee’s last working day with your department is a Friday, treat their last day as the Sunday.</p>

<p>Employees should always move before their new department’s payroll cut-off. Even if their start date cannot be the first of the month. There is a payroll cut-off dates tab in the staff transfer form to help you find them. Discuss payroll cut-off dates with the employee’s new department before agreeing a start date.</p>

<p>Do not agree a start date until:</p>

<ul>
  <li>BPSS checks are complete</li>
  <li>any NSV clearance the employee needs is complete or transferred</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>The employee should not resign, but should still give you their notice. They do not need to resign for staff transfers. This may affect their pension.</p>
</div>

<p>When agreeing a start date, consider your business needs. Also consider the time it may take to fill critical roles. For example, does the employee need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>upskill colleagues or hand over work</li>
  <li>return equipment, such as a laptop or mobile phone</li>
  <li>balance any annual leave and/or flexible hours</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also consider the employee’s performance report. Including who will be responsible for end of year marking and any performance pay award.</p>

<h3>Workplace adjustments</h3>

<p>You should discuss and agree the transfer of existing <a class="govuk-link" href="https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-civil-servants-how-to-move-jobs-between-departments-and-agencies/staff-transfers-further-details-for-exporting-managers?preview=6895331#WPA" rel="external">workplace adjustments</a> with the employee’s new manager. If the employee’s new department needs to order items to meet their needs, this may take time. This should be considered when agreeing a start date.</p>

<h2>Step 6: The employee gets confirmation of their salary and start date</h2>

<p>Following completion of pre-employment checks, the employee receives confirmation of their salary and start date. They will then be asked to complete Part A-2 of the staff transfer form.</p>

<h2>Step 7: The employee now completes Part A-2 of the staff transfer form</h2>

<p>The employee completes Part A-2. They send it to you, as their current manager, along with Part A-1.</p>

<h2>Step 8: You complete Part B of the staff transfer form</h2>

<p>You will be asked to review the employee’s answers to Parts A1 and A2.</p>

<p>To complete Part B you also need some information about the employee:</p>

<ul>
  <li>agreed annual leave arrangements</li>
  <li>recruited through fair and open competition</li>
  <li>probationary period (if they are on a probationary period)</li>
  <li>disciplinary record (if any)</li>
  <li>loan end date (if they are on loan to another department)</li>
</ul>

<p>Submit the updated form to your HR/Shared Services within 2 working days. This could be by email or service request. Copy in the employee or share the Service Request reference as necessary.</p>

<p>The form should be sent to your HR/Shared Services at least 1 month before the employee’s transfer date. If the form is submitted with less than 1 month’s notice, this can have an effect on the employee’s pay. You should still agree a start date on the first of the month where possible.</p>

<p>Calculate the employee’s remaining leave on a pro-rata basis, based on their leaving date. You should encourage your employee to take any remaining annual leave before leaving.</p>

<p>Transferring annual leave varies by department. Some departments do not allow this in any circumstances. But, some departments will allow annual leave to transfer in exceptional circumstances.</p>

<h2>Step 9: The employee’s current HR/Shared Services team complete Part C</h2>

<p>They then send the complete form to the employee’s new department’s HR/Shared Services team.</p>

<p>The employee should follow up with their current HR/Shared Services if they have not done this within 5 days. You may need to escalate this on behalf of the employee if it does not happen after 5 days. Processing times can vary between departments.</p>

<h2>Step 10: The employee’s new line manager starts the appropriate new joiner process</h2>

<p>This may vary by department. This could include the New Entrant Notification (NEN) form or other departmental process.</p>

<h2>Step 11: The employee’s new HR/payroll record is set up</h2>

<p>The employee’s new department receives the completed form. The employee will be set up with a new employee number and HR record to make sure they are paid.</p>

<p>If the employee’s pay is wrong when they start their new role, they should raise the issue with their new manager or Shared Services/HR team. If they need to, escalate it to their HR Business Partner. If their pay is wrong due to an incorrect tax code, the employee should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/income-tax-enquiries-for-individuals-pensioners-and-employees">contact HMRC</a>.</p>

<h2>Step 12: The employee leaves your department to start their new role in the Civil Service</h2>

<p>When leaving their current department, the employee should follow the department’s asset and information policy. As their exporting line manager you should make sure that any offboarding steps are followed. For example, returning their work laptop, mobile phone and security pass. For specific guidance on employees leaving your department, check your intranet.</p>

<h3>HR/Shared Services</h3>

<p>The employee’s current HR/Shared Services will remove the employee from payroll. This should be one calendar day before the start date in their new department. If the employee starts in their new department on a Monday their last day on payroll would be a Sunday.</p>

<p>Do not keep the employee on your payroll after their start date in a new department, the employee could be overpaid. Departments should not recharge or invoice.</p>
