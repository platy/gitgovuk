<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Before you start</h2>

<p>Your firm or chambers must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hmcts-common-platform-registration-for-defence-professionals">register with Common Platform</a> before you can use it.</p>

<p>Once registered, you will receive an email from noreply@cjscp.org.uk. Check junk and spam filters for this notification.</p>

<p>Follow the link in the email to complete your one-time <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-use-hmcts-common-platform/activate-your-common-platform-account">account activation and security set up</a>.</p>

<p>You must activate your account before you can find and manage cases in Common Platform.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Once your organisation has registered and you have activated your account, you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hmcts-common-platform-view-or-manage-a-case">start accessing cases in Common Platform</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Register on a case</h2>

<p>1. On the home screen, you’ll see the following links:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Register as defence on a case – this is where you register and associate to a case</li>
  <li>Find your case – this is where you find your case once you have registered</li>
</ul>

<p>Defence advocates will also see ‘Check-in to hearings’.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/160074/32._Home_screen_start_update.png"></div></figure>

<p>2. Select ‘Register as defence on a case’.</p>

<p>3. Select whether the case is against an individual or a company. Then select ‘Continue’.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/144530/15._Individual_or_company.png"></div></figure>

<p>4. For an individual, enter the case reference, the defendant’s first and last name and their date of birth. For a company, enter the case reference and the company name.</p>

<p>Then select ‘Find case’.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/144531/16._Individuals_details.png"></div></figure>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/144532/17._Companies_details.png"></div></figure>

<p>The case reference must have 11 characters when entered.</p>

<p>If the reference has fewer than 11 characters, enter 0s after the first 4 characters until it has 11 characters. For example, if the case reference is 01XX12321, you should enter 01XX0012321.</p>

<p>If you do not know the case reference, you can get it from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the public court list on the day of the hearing</li>
  <li>the charge sheet, if you are in contact with the police</li>
  <li>the Courts and Tribunals Service Centre (<abbr title="Courts and Tribunals Service Centre">CTSC</abbr>) by calling 0330 808 4407</li>
</ul>

<p>If you still cannot get the case reference, contact the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cps.gov.uk/" rel="external">Crown Prosecution Service (<abbr title="Crown Prosecution Service">CPS</abbr>)</a> office.</p>

<p>5. On the ‘Case found’ screen, confirm you have been instructed or appointed by reading the declaration and checking the box. Then enter the date you were instructed or appointed and select ‘I confirm – continue to case summary’.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/144533/18._Case_found.png"></div></figure>

<p>If any other defence organisation has viewed the initial details of the prosecution case (<abbr title="Initial details of the prosecution case">IDPC</abbr>), there will be a note to say so above the confirm button.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Self-serve the initial details of the prosecution case (<abbr title="Initial details of the prosecution case">IDPC</abbr>)</h2>

<p>1. Once you have completed the declaration, you will see the ‘Case at a glance screen’. If the <abbr title="Initial details of the prosecution case">IDPC</abbr> is available, it will be listed as a document. To self-serve, select the <abbr title="Initial details of the prosecution case">IDPC</abbr> link. It will download to your device as a PDF.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/160075/33._Case_at_a_glance_update__IDPC_.png"></div></figure>

<p>Until an organisation is associated with the case, other firms will also have access to the <abbr title="Initial details of the prosecution case">IDPC</abbr>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you are a duty solicitor, the IDPC may be enough to manage the case. However, if you need to upload case material (such as a PET form), you will need to follow the next steps to access the full case by ‘associating’.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Associate to the case</h2>

<p>Associating to a case is when you, as a representative of your organisation, mark your organisation as being ‘on record’, to the exclusion of other firms.</p>

<p>If the defendant is awaiting a decision on legal aid, the Legal Aid Agency will be told you are on record when you associate to the case. If the defendant already has legal aid granted, you will not need to associate to the case – the Legal Aid Agency will have done this for you.</p>

<p>When you associate in a magistrates’ court case, you will receive automatic notifications when the Crown Prosecution Service (<abbr title="Crown Prosecution Service">CPS</abbr>) upload a document and will be able to view it in Common Platform.</p>

<p>If you are a public access barrister, you can be registered as a ‘single person defence organisation’. You will be able declare you have been instructed and associate to the case on Common Platform, and will have the same access as a defence firm solicitor.</p>

<p>1. Open the ‘Access’ tab and then select the appropriate representation option.</p>

<p>If you are a duty solicitor, select:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Court appointed’ if you will not be representing the defendant after the hearing</li>
  <li>‘Representation order - applied for’ if you may be representing the defendant beyond the hearing</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have chosen the appropriate option, select ‘I understand - access the case’.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/160076/34._Access_full_case_update.png"></div></figure>

<p>Once associated, any registered Common Platform user at your organisation will be able to access the case. In a case that involves more than one defendant, you will need to associate with each defendant your firm is representing.</p>

<p>2. If required, you can grant access to the case to any other registered Common Platform users outside of your firm, such as barristers. To do this, add their email address to the ‘Grant case access’ email address field and select ‘Grant access’.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/144536/21._Grant_access.png"></div></figure>

<p>In the Crown court, case materials will be copied from Common Platform to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/crown-court-digital-case-system-guidance">Digital Case System (<abbr title="Digital Case System">DCS</abbr>)</a> – so granting access other users outside your firm may not be needed.</p>

<p>If you are an ‘agent’ prosecutor for the <abbr title="Crown Prosecution Service">CPS</abbr>, contact the <abbr title="Crown Prosecution Service">CPS</abbr> for case access.</p>

<h3>Remove access (‘disassociation’)</h3>

<p>If your firm is no longer representing the defendant, you should remove access and take your firm off the record. This is known as disassociating yourself from a case defendant. This will allow then next firm to associate and will automatically send a notification to
the <abbr title="Crown Prosecution Service">CPS</abbr> so that they are aware of the change in representation.</p>

<p>1. While in the ‘Access’ tab, select ‘Remove’ in the case listing.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/144537/22._Remove_access_1.png"></div></figure>

<p>2. Then on the ‘Remove access’ screen, select ‘Remove access’.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/144538/23._Remove_access_2.png"></div></figure>

<p>You’ll return to the ‘Find a case’ screen.</p>

<p>If you have granted case access to any individuals, removing your firm will also remove their ability to access the case.</p>

<p>If a new firm cannot associate because you (as the firm on record) have not disassociated, they will contact you to remove your access – HMCTS cannot do this.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you are a duty solicitor not representing the defendant after the hearing, remove your access once the hearing is complete. This will allow the next firm to associate and access the case.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Find your case and view the case material</h2>

<p>Once associated to a case, you will have access to all the case level documents and any specific defendant level documents of a defendant you are representing. If you are representing more than one defendant in a case, you will be able to see all their documents. If there are defendants in the case you are not representing, you will not be able to see their documents.</p>

<p>1. From the home screen, select ‘Find your case’ then enter your case reference number (URN). This is case sensitive – use upper case.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/160077/35._Find_your_case.png"></div></figure>

<p>2. The case will open on the ‘Case at a glance’ screen. You will see the full list of offences, results and any applications if they have been made. You will also see a timeline where you can see hearing information and contribute to the trial effectiveness information, if appropriate.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/160078/36._Case_at_a_glance.png"></div></figure>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Some of the links on this screen will not work for you as a defence lawyer or advocate. If you select them, you will see an error message explaining that you are not authorised to view the information.</p>
</div>

<p>3. Select the ‘Case material’ tab. This will list all the case material you have access to in categories. Select one of the material categories to expand the category and see the individual materials.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/160079/37._Case_material_1_update.png"></div></figure>

<p>4. Select the linked title of the case material you want to view. The document will open in the viewing pane. Select ‘Download’ to download a copy of the document.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/160080/38._Case_material_2_update.png"></div></figure>
