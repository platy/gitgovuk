<span class="number">2. </span>Action: register now to deliver T Levels and the T Level Transition Programme from the 2024 to 2025 academic year</h2>

Providers can register up to midnight on the 24 March 2023, which is slightly earlier than originally communicated, but it will now close before we open registration for 2025 T Level delivery at end March 2023.</p>

<span class="number">7. </span>Information: 2021 to 2022 year-end forecast funding claim – indicative reconciliation statements</h2>

<p>We will upload your indicative year-end reconciliation statement(s) through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Manage your education and skills funding</a> (MYESF) for the following funding streams. We aim to complete this by Friday 1 July.</p>

<ul>
  <li>grant funded - ESFA funded adult education budget (AEB) (adult skills, community learning, 19 to 24 traineeships and national skills fund Level 3 adult offer)</li>
  <li>grant funded - advanced learner loans bursary (ALLB)</li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need to take any action at this stage. These statements are indicative and based on your recent year-end forecast claim return, so that you are aware of any potential impact before we publish your final reconciliation statements in November 2022.</p>

<p>Where appropriate, we will show any funding monitoring return errors within your indicative reconciliation statement. This is so you are aware of the potential impact before final claim reconciliation statements.</p>

<span class="number">11. </span>Information: New online toolkit for European Social Fund performance review points</h2>

<p>We are introducing a new online toolkit for European Social Fund (ESF) providers to use as part of future performance review points until the end of the contracts for services in March 2023. The toolkit will replace the spreadsheet currently used at performance review points and is accessed through Submit Learner Data.
