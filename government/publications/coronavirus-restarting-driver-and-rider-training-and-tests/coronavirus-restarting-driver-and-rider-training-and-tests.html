<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> qualification and registration</h2>

<h3>If you’re qualifying to become an <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr>
</h3>

<h4>If your trainee licence was issued in January 2021</h4>

<p>You can ask for your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/trainee-driving-instructor-licence-the-rules" class="govuk-link">trainee licence</a> to be reissued when coronavirus restrictions have been lifted.</p>

<p>Contact the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>) for advice about the options available in your personal circumstances.</p>

<a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:padi@dvsa.gov.uk">padi@dvsa.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>You need to include your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>personal reference number or driving licence number</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>postcode</li>
</ul>

<h4>If your trainee licence expires soon</h4>

<a href="mailto:padi@dvsa.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">padi@dvsa.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>You need to include your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>personal reference number or driving licence number</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>postcode</li>
</ul>

<h4>Taking the <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> part 3 test</h4>

<p>The law says you must book the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/adi-part-3-test"><abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> part 3 (instructional ability) test</a> within 2 years of passing the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/adi-part-1-test"><abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> part 1 (theory) test</a>.</p>

<p>You can take the <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> part 3 test more than 2 years after you passed your <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> part 1 test, as long as you book it within the 2-year limit.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/book-driving-test">Book your <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> part 3 test</a>.</p>

<p>If no appointments are available when you book, you can book an ‘on hold’ test. This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have to pay for the test</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> arrange the test date when appointments become available</li>
</ul>

<p>This meets the legal requirement for you to book your test within 2 years.</p>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> does not have any legal powers to extend your <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> part 1 theory test pass certificate.</p>

<h3>If you’re already an <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr>
</h3>

<h4>If your <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> registration expires soon</h4>

<p>You can choose to not renew your <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> registration if it expires soon.</p>

<p>You then have up to 12 months from the date it expires to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-approved-driving-instructor-adi-registration" class="govuk-link">re-register as an <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr></a> without having to take the qualifying tests again. It costs the same to re-register (£300) as it does to renew your <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> registration.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>You cannot charge money (or monies worth) for instruction while your registration is lapsed.</p>
</div>

<h4>Extending <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> registrations</h4>

<p>The law sets out how long <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> registrations last and what they cost. <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> does not have any legal powers to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>extend your <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> registration</li>
  <li>waive or reduce the <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> registration fee</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h4>Wear a face covering in Scotland</h4>

<p>You and your pupil must wear face coverings during driving lessons and practice sessions.</p>

<p>If you do not wear a face covering, you must have a good reason, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have a physical or mental illness, impairment or disability</li>
  <li>wearing it would cause you severe distress</li>
  <li>you and the person you’re teaching live in the same household</li>
</ul>

<p>Wearing glasses does not count as a good reason.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>You can be fined £60 if you do not wear a face covering during a driving lesson in Scotland. This will be reduced to £30 if you pay within 28 days.</p>
