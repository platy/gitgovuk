<h3>Teaching mobile emergency workers with an emergency driving test booked</h3>

<p>You can teach mobile emergency workers who have a confirmed emergency driving test booking in England and Wales.</p>

<p>This service is only available to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NHS health and social care workers</li>
  <li>the emergency services</li>
  <li>local councils</li>
</ul>

<p>To be eligible, your pupil must both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>need to drive as part of their job</li>
  <li>respond to ‘threats to life’ as part of their job</li>
</ul>

<p>Your pupil should talk to their employer to find out if they’re eligible and how to apply.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>This service is not available in Scotland.</p>
</div>

<div role="note" aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You must not teach anyone who only has a routine driving test booked - even if they are an NHS health and social care worker, emergency services worker or local council worker.</p>
</div>

<h4>What you need during lessons</h4>

<p>During any driving lessons with your pupil, you must have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a copy of your pupil’s emergency test booking confirmation email</li>
  <li>a copy of the application request from their employer</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use these to prove you’re allowed to teach during lockdown if you’re stopped by the police.</p>

<p>You must follow the guidance about <a href="#working-safely-during-coronavirus" class="govuk-link">working safely during COVID-19</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Theory tests and driving tests</h2>

<p>There’s separate guidance about how theory tests and driving tests are affected by COVID-19. It explains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how restrictions are affecting tests</li>
  <li>what changes your pupils can expect when they take their test</li>
</ul>

<h3>Booking tests</h3>

<p>You can still <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/topic/driving-motorcyle-instructors/booking-tests">book and manage tests for your pupils</a>.</p>

<h3>Driving test centre waiting rooms</h3>

<p>Not all driving test centre waiting rooms are open because of COVID-19.</p>

<p>There are temporary rules for using waiting rooms which are open.</p>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> will share your details and your pupil’s details with the relevant NHS service if a <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> member of staff you had close contact with both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>develops COVID-19 symptoms within 48 hours of your driving test</li>
  <li>tests positive for COVID-19 after their symptoms developed</li>

<h3>If you’re qualifying to become an <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr>

<h4>If your trainee licence was issued in January 2021</h4>

<p>You can ask for your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/trainee-driving-instructor-licence-the-rules" class="govuk-link">trainee licence</a> to be reissued when COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted.</p>

<p>Contact the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>) for advice about the options available in your personal circumstances.</p>

  <li>date of birth</li>

<h4>Taking the <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> part 3 test</h4>

<p>The law says you must book the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/adi-part-3-test" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> part 3 (instructional ability) test</a> within 2 years of passing the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/adi-part-1-test" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> part 1 (theory) test</a>.</p>

<p>You can take the <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> part 3 test more than 2 years after you passed your <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> part 1 test, as long as you book it within the 2-year limit.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/book-driving-test" class="govuk-link">Book your <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> part 3 test</a>.</p>

<p>If no appointments are available when you book, you can book an ‘on hold’ test. This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have to pay for the test</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> arrange the test date when appointments become available</li>
</ul>

<p>This meets the legal requirement for you to book your test within 2 years.</p>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> does not have any legal powers to extend your <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> part 1 theory test pass certificate.</p>

<h3>If you’re already an <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr>
</h3>

<h4>If your <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> registration expires soon</h4>

<p>You can choose to not renew your <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> registration if it expires soon.</p>

<p>You then have up to 12 months from the date it expires to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-approved-driving-instructor-adi-registration" class="govuk-link">re-register as an <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr></a> without having to take the qualifying tests again. It costs the same to re-register (£300) as it does to renew your <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> registration.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You cannot charge money (or monies worth) for instruction while your registration is lapsed.</p>
</div>

<h4>Extending <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> registrations</h4>

<p>The law sets out how long <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> registrations last and what they cost. <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> does not have any legal powers to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>extend your <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> registration</li>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/vehicles" class="govuk-link">guidance for people who work in vehicles</a></li>

</ul>

<h4>Wear a face covering in Scotland</h4>

<p>You and your pupil must wear face coverings during driving lessons and practice sessions in Scotland.</p>

<p>If you do not wear a face covering, you must have a good reason, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have a physical or mental illness, impairment or disability</li>
  <li>wearing it would cause you severe distress</li>
  <li>you and the person you’re teaching live in the same household</li>
</ul>

<p>Wearing glasses does not count as a good reason.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice" aria-label="Warning" role="note">
<p>You can be fined £60 if you do not wear a face covering during a driving lesson in Scotland. This will be reduced to £30 if you pay within 28 days.</p>
</div>
