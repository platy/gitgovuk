<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Anti-Dumping Duty</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> What anti-dumping duty is</h3>

<p>This is a duty on imports. It gives protection against the dumping of goods in the UK at prices much lower than the normal value, and damage to UK industry.</p>

<p>The reference price for ‘normal’ value is usually determined by the price the foreign producer charges for comparable sales in their own country. Each anti-dumping duty measure covers specified goods, originating in or exported from, named countries or exporters.</p>

<p>With the exception of when safeguard duties also apply, it’s charged in addition to, and independent of, most other duties to which the imported goods are liable. For example, third country import duty, or rebalancing duties.</p>

<p>Where a safeguard duty is also applied to an import, the anti-dumping duty will be amended so that only the highest of either the safeguard or anti-dumping duties apply.</p>

<p>The following examples show how the duties will be applied:</p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>An import is liable to 25% safeguard duty and 35% anti-dumping duty rate.</p>

<p>The highest rate of import duty for the goods is anti-dumping duty at 35%, so the highest rate of duty applies. However, because the law says safeguard duty (at 25%) must be taken first, the anti-dumping duty will be lower:</p>

<p>35% – 25% = 10%</p>

<p>Only 10% of the anti-dumping duty and 25% safeguard duty will be taken which will make a total of 35%.</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>An import is liable to 25% safeguard duty.</p>

<p>It also has 9% anti-dumping duty and 11% countervailing duty, so the combined rate is 20%.</p>

<p>The highest rate of import duty for the goods is safeguard duty at 25%, so the anti-dumping and countervailing duties are reduced to zero and only the 25% safeguard duty rate applies.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Provisional anti-dumping duty</h3>

<p>Provisional anti-dumping duty may be imposed during the investigation of an alleged case of dumping. It may be imposed where there is evidence dumped goods have been imported, or are being imported into the UK and are causing, or have caused injury to UK industry.</p>

<p>When provisional anti-dumping duty is imposed, as an importer you must provide a security to cover the provisional anti-dumping duty amount you will incur if the measures are made definitive at the end of the investigation.</p>

<p>At the end of the investigation, the provisional anti-dumping duty may be made definitive, may lapse, or be cancelled.</p>

<p>You must secure provisional anti-dumping duty by one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cash deposit</li>
  <li>bond</li>
  <li>bank guarantee</li>
</ul>

<p>The security is not charged until the final duty is imposed.</p>

<p>If the definitive anti-dumping duty rate is less than the provisional duty rate and you’re entitled to repayment of provisional anti-dumping duty, you need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-apply-for-a-repayment-of-import-duty-and-vat-if-youve-overpaid-c285">submit repayment claim on form C285</a>.</p>

<p>Send your completed form to the National Import Duty Adjustment Centre by email to: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:customsaccountingrepayments@hmrc.gov.uk">customsaccountingrepayments@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Claims must include a copy of the original import declaration and commercial documents such as invoices and transport documents. If you’re a trader and you’ve claimed a company specific rate of duty, you must provide documentation to support your claim.</p>

<p>Include your bank details with the claim so that a direct credit can be made to your account. This will also make sure you get a quicker and more secure repayment.</p>

<p>Security will be held for 4 months from the final ruling date. After this time, you should send claims by email to the National Duty Repayment Centre: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ndrc.nch@hmrc.gov.uk">ndrc.nch@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Countervailing duty</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> What countervailing duty is</h3>

<p>This is a duty imposed on imported goods which have received countervailable subsidies in the originating or exporting country. It’s treated in the same way as anti-dumping duty for customs purposes — see section 2.1 in this notice. It’s possible to have both anti-dumping duty and countervailing duty on the same product.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Provisional countervailing duty</h3>

<p>A provisional countervailing duty can be imposed during a trade remedies investigation, where there is evidence that subsidised goods have been, or are being imported into the UK and are causing or have caused injury to UK industry.</p>

<p>When a provisional duty is imposed, as an importer you must provide a security for payment to cover the provisional countervailing duty amount, you will incur if the measures are made definitive.</p>

<p>At the end of the investigation, the provisional countervailing duty may be made definitive or cancelled.</p>

<p>You must secure provisional countervailing duty by one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cash deposit</li>
  <li>bond</li>
  <li>bank guarantee</li>
</ul>

<p>The security is not brought to account until the definitive duty is imposed.</p>

<p>If the definitive countervailing duty rate is less than the provisional duty rate and you’re entitled to repayment of provisional anti-dumping duty, you need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-apply-for-a-repayment-of-import-duty-and-vat-if-youve-overpaid-c285">submit repayment claim on form C285</a>.</p>

<p>Send your completed form to the National Import Duty Adjustment Centre by email to: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:customsaccountingrepayments@hmrc.gov.uk">customsaccountingrepayments@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Claims must include a copy of the original import declaration and commercial documents such as invoices and transport documents. If you’re a trader and you’ve claimed a company specific rate of duty, you must provide documentation to support your claim.</p>

<p>Include your bank details with the claim so that a direct credit can be made to your account. This will also make sure you get a quicker and more secure repayment.</p>

<p>Security will be held for 4 months from the final ruling date. After this time, you should send claims by email to the National Duty Repayment Centre: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ndrc.nch@hmrc.gov.uk">ndrc.nch@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Registration</h2>

<p>There are different types of registration, each has its own conditions in place to make sure that duty is protected during a Trade Remedies Authority investigation.</p>

<p>Registration makes sure imported goods, subject to an anti-dumping or countervailing duty investigation, are recorded and the appropriate charges are collected, following clearance.</p>

<p>Importers of goods subject to registration are told by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and by public notice on gov.uk. The UK Global tariff also shows the commodity codes subject to registration.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Circumvention</h2>

<p>Circumvention is when anti-dumping and countervailing duties are imposed on products either manufactured in, or exported from (or both), the country of non-preferential origin. Some traders try avoiding these duties by sending their goods to a different country to undergo processes that are not economically justified. For example, goods may be sent to another country to be re-packaged, then exported to the UK, to make it seem like the goods came from the re-packaging country.</p>

<p>Where this type of circumvention is identified, either anti-dumping or countervailing measures (or both) may be extended to imports of affected goods from the ‘transit’ country. This is regardless of their country of origin.</p>

<p>Another example of circumvention activity is the unnecessary alteration of product specifications to exclude them from the anti-dumping commodity codes.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> How the system works</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> How is an investigation of alleged dumping started</h3>

<p>Find out about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-trade-remedies-investigations-process">UK trade remedies investigations process</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span> Country of export</h3>

<p>Anti-dumping and countervailing duty measures are imposed on the country of non-preferential origin. Where circumvention has been determined the duty may be extended to goods consigned from named countries whether they originated there or not.</p>

<p>The term ‘consigned from’ is broader than ‘the country from where the goods were shipped’. Exporters not involved in circumvention can apply to the Trade Remedies Authority for exemption from the extended duties.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span> Country of origin</h3>

<p>Origin for trade remedy measures is determined by non-preferential rules of origin. In general, goods may be considered to have originated in a named country if either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they were wholly produced within that country</li>
  <li>two or more countries are involved in the manufacture of a product — where the last substantial operation in the processing or the manufacture of the goods has resulted in the manufacture of a new product, or has represented an important stage of manufacture and is economically justified</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span> How to check a product has been made subject to any anti-dumping or countervailing duty measures</h3>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/trade-remedies-notices">trade remedies notices</a>.</p>

<p>Use the online <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">Trade Tariff: look up commodity codes, duty and VAT rates</a>.</p>

<p>You will need to:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Enter the commodity code for your product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change the ‘trade between UK and’ to the country of origin of the product</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the ‘import’ tab</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scroll down to ‘trade remedies, safeguards and retaliatory duties’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check if your exporting producer is listed and if an additional code and specific conditions apply to their product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Producers that are not listed will get either the highest anti-dumping or countervailing duty rate, or both.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You may need to enter a 4-digit additional code to your customs declaration, to get a lower rate of anti-dumping or countervailing duty. You may also need to hold, and if asked, produce a specifically worded and signed statement on the invoice from the producer or supplier. You will need to declare this using the appropriate document code on your declaration.</p>

<p>If the same rate applies to all imports from a particular country, there will be no need for an additional code.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span> Accuracy of the online Tariff</h3>

<p>It’s not always possible to the Department for International Trade to update the online Tariff on time for when an anti-dumping measure takes effect. Before you clear your goods through customs, we recommend that you check:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-trade"><abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s website for new anti-dumping measures</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/trade-remedies-notices">Trade remedies notices</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">Trade Tariff: look up commodity codes, duty and VAT rates</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.6 </span> The effect of an undertaking</h3>

<p>If an investigation for the products you import is in progress, it may be stopped before a provisional or final duty is imposed. For this to happen, your supplier will need to give a satisfactory ‘undertaking’ to stop any damage to UK producers caused by the dumping or subsidy.</p>

<p>If your supplier has given an acceptable undertaking, they must also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>show that they’re fulfilling all the conditions of their undertaking on a continuous basis</li>
  <li>allow verification of the information they have provided to demonstrate this</li>
</ul>

<p>If this does not happen, the Trade Remedies Authority may end the undertaking arrangement and declare the invoices concerned to be invalid, anti-dumping or countervailing duty will then be incurred on those imports.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> General provisions</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span> How to apply for a refund of anti-dumping or countervailing duty</h3>

<p>To claim a repayment for all or part of the anti-dumping duty paid, you must be able to show either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the products imported were not dumped</li>
  <li>the margin of dumping was less than what the anti-dumping measures were based on</li>
</ul>

<p>More information is set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-trade-remedies-investigations-process/our-repayment-investigation-process">Trade Remedies Authority guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span> Time limits for claiming a repayment</h3>

<p>You must submit your claim within 6 months of the date the goods were entered for home use.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span> Evidence needed to support a claim</h3>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-trade-remedies-investigations-process/our-repayment-investigation-process">Trade Remedies Authority guidance</a> to find out what information and evidence or documents (or both) you need to include in your application.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span> Goods under inward processing arrangements</h3>

<p>If you hold an inward processing authorisation, you can suspend anti-dumping and countervailing duty until your goods enter free circulation.</p>

<p>To qualify for duty suspension under inward processing the goods must be:</p>
