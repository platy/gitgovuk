<p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) completed a review of the newly established Office for Environmental Protection (<abbr title="Office for Environmental Protection">OEP</abbr>). The review was part of the government’s Public Bodies Review Programme. It was started in May 2022 and concluded in July 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Background of the <abbr title="Office for Environmental Protection">OEP</abbr>
</h2>
<p>The <abbr title="Office for Environmental Protection">OEP</abbr> was established under the Environment Act 2021 to help protect and improve the environment by holding government and other public authorities to account.</p>

<p>It became fully operational in January 2022, after 6 months in shadow form. It has begun to advise government on and investigate potential breaches to environmental law.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Purpose of the review</h2>
<p>The review aimed to ensure that the <abbr title="Office for Environmental Protection">OEP</abbr> – as a new public body – is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on track to be effective, efficient and aligned to the government’s priorities</li>
  <li>well governed and properly accountable for what it does</li>
</ul>

<p>The review team was also asked to look at the long-term resource requirements of the <abbr title="Office for Environmental Protection">OEP</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Recommendations and conclusions</h2>
<p>A stage 1 review concluded that the <abbr title="Office for Environmental Protection">OEP</abbr> is in good health. It has plans and processes in place to meet minimum requirements for an arm’s length body (<abbr title="arm’s length body">ALB</abbr>).</p>

<p>A total of 12 recommendations were identified, to improve administration and governance processes. The recommendations aim to ensure that the <abbr title="Office for Environmental Protection">OEP</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> continue to meet minimum requirements as the <abbr title="Office for Environmental Protection">OEP</abbr> develops and the relationship with <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> matures.</p>

<p>This stage 1 review did not indicate the need for a full, independent review of the <abbr title="Office for Environmental Protection">OEP</abbr> at this early stage.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Efficacy</h3>
<p>1. The <abbr title="Office for Environmental Protection">OEP</abbr> should develop and agree a memorandum of understanding (<abbr title="memorandum of understanding">MoU</abbr>) with its equivalent bodies in Scotland and Wales by March 2023. This should cover how they will work together to meet their objectives.</p>

<p>2. The <abbr title="Office for Environmental Protection">OEP</abbr> should agree its performance metrics with <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>. These should be in place by April 2023.</p>

<p>3. The <abbr title="Office for Environmental Protection">OEP</abbr> should develop internal guidance to ensure that projects and programmes are developed in line with HM Treasury’s Green Book and associated business case guidance. This guidance should be created by January 2023.</p>

<p>4. <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> will review the <abbr title="Office for Environmental Protection">OEP</abbr>’s budget and permitted headcount ahead of the next financial year, as further evidence becomes available. It will review these again in 2023 to 2024. This will ensure the <abbr title="Office for Environmental Protection">OEP</abbr> can deliver its statutory objectives as intended under the Environment Act.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Efficiency</h3>

<p>5. The <abbr title="Office for Environmental Protection">OEP</abbr> should develop its approach to benchmarking to compare its costs by April 2023. It should then use this data to improve efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

<p>6. The <abbr title="Office for Environmental Protection">OEP</abbr> should develop a digital, data and technology strategy that improves its efficiency by December 2022.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Governance</h3>
<p>7. The <abbr title="Office for Environmental Protection">OEP</abbr> chair should work with its departmental senior sponsor to consider the current and future skills and diversity needs of the board. This will ensure there is a clear strategy and pipeline around appointments. This work should commence no later than January 2023.</p>

<p>8. The <abbr title="Office for Environmental Protection">OEP</abbr> should ensure that all board members have appropriate training on financial management and reporting requirements. Board members should also have access to wider development opportunities.</p>

<p>9. The <abbr title="Office for Environmental Protection">OEP</abbr> should publish its board’s declarations of interests register no later than September 2022.</p>

<p>10. The <abbr title="Office for Environmental Protection">OEP</abbr> should work with <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> to develop its post-employment rules and procedures for board members by September 2022. These rules should cover the acceptance of appointments or employments after resignation (business appointment rules) or retirement. These should then be monitored and considered by <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> and the chair of the <abbr title="Office for Environmental Protection">OEP</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>Accountability</h3>
<p>11. <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> and the <abbr title="Office for Environmental Protection">OEP</abbr> should agree the Common Framework document by August 2022.</p>

<p>12. <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> and the <abbr title="Office for Environmental Protection">OEP</abbr> should complete further work to agree its approach to risk appetite, in line with the government’s Orange Book guidance on risk management, by April 2023.</p>
