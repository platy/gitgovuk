<h4>ANSWERS</h4>

<h4>Background</h4>

<h4>What is the <abbr title="Government Economic Service Degree Apprenticeship Programme">GESDAP</abbr>?</h4>

<p>The Government Economic Service Degree Apprenticeship Programme (<abbr title="Government Economic Service Degree Apprenticeship Programme">GESDAP</abbr>) is the first degree-level economics apprenticeship programme in the UK.  The programme offers you a unique opportunity to work in a central government department or agency on some of the most important social, environmental and economic issues our country faces – whilst studying a degree in economics. You will complete your studies with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/3740/professional-economist-higher-apprenticeship" rel="external">University of Kent</a> – selected to deliver the programme because of the strength of their economics courses and the support they offer to apprentices throughout your time on programme. Once successfully completed, you will have an apprenticeship, an economics degree, and the experience of four years’ working in the Civil Service – putting you in a brilliant position to progress in your career from there.</p>

<h4>Why does the Civil Service have an economic apprenticeship?</h4>

<p>Economists play a really important role in the way government makes policy. We need more economists and we want the economists we employ to reflect the communities we serve – meaning we want to recruit people from all sorts of different background and in different parts of the country.</p>

<h4>What’s the Civil Service?</h4>
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nY4sBt0owN4" rel="external">Working in the Civil Service</a></p>

<p>The Civil Service helps to keep the UK prosperous and secure, supporting the governments we serve in implementing their commitments and delivering high quality services for the public.
We employ over 420,000 people from across the UK. There are a wide range of roles and opportunities within services such as Finance, Diplomacy, Health, Science and Technology.
The Civil Service is united by a strong sense of public service, and its enduring values – integrity, honesty, impartiality and objectivity – run through all that we do.
The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/success-profiles">Civil Service Success Profiles</a> have more details about what is expected of civil servants.</p>

<h4>What sort of people work in the Civil Service?</h4>

<p>All sorts! We are committed to recruiting people from a range of different backgrounds, and our recruitment programmes have won lots of awards for their focus on diversity and inclusion.
We are changing along with British society to reflect the communities we serve. Our record of diversity and inclusion puts us head and shoulders above most organisations. We actively support those with additional requirements both during selection and in the workforce.</p>

<h4>What is the Government Economic Service?</h4>

<p>The Government Economic Service (<abbr title="Government Economic Service">GES</abbr>) is the professional body for economists in the UK civil service. Since its foundation in 1964, <abbr title="Government Economic Service">GES</abbr> economists have been involved in decision making across government. Our ability to explain, predict and propose solutions has seen economists and economics firmly embedded as an essential part of government. <abbr title="Government Economic Service">GES</abbr> economists have proved themselves to be relevant, rigorous and respected.</p>

<p><abbr title="Government Economic Service">GES</abbr> members are employed, paid and managed entirely by their departments, agencies or devolved administrations. Reflecting this set-up, each organisation’s Chief Economist or Head of Profession for Economics is the leader for the <abbr title="Government Economic Service">GES</abbr> within their organisation. This structure serves economists well, as it balances the benefits of having a link to a wider professional community with ensuring that economists are fully integrated into their organisations. As such, successful applicants will receive an offer of employment from a government department or organisation, not the <abbr title="Government Economic Service">GES</abbr>.</p>

<p>More information on the <abbr title="Government Economic Service">GES</abbr> can be found online: <abbr title="Government Economic Service">GES</abbr> website: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/civil-service-government-economic-service">www.ges.gov.uk</a></p>

<h4>What will I learn?</h4>

<p>You will get first-hand experience of how government works and how policies are made.</p>

<p>Working as a member of the <abbr title="Government Economic Service">GES</abbr> involves the development and use of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Quantitative skills: manipulating and presenting data</li>
  <li>Writing and presentation techniques: communicating economics clearly and succinctly to senior officials and ministers</li>
  <li>Applied economics skills: using economic insights and techniques to inform decisions on anything from the environment to transport</li>
</ul>

<p>The degree in Economics will be comprised of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Microeconomics: how individuals and firms make decisions, interaction of supply and demand</li>
  <li>Macroeconomics: how the economy works at a national and international level</li>
  <li>Econometrics: the use of data to test theories and evaluate changes in government policies</li>
  <li>Option for further study of areas such as environmental economics</li>
</ul>

<h4>What benefits will I enjoy?</h4>

<p>Whatever your role, we take your career and development seriously, and want to enable you to build a really successful career with the department and wider Civil Service. It is crucial that our employees have the right skills to develop their careers and meet the challenges ahead, and you’ll benefit from regular performance and development reviews to ensure this development is ongoing.</p>

<p>As a Civil Service employee, you’ll be entitled to a large range of benefits. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>25 days’ annual leave on entry, increasing on a sliding scale to 30 days after 5 years’ service. This is in addition to 8 public holidays. This will be complimented by one further day paid privilege entitlement to mark the Queen’s Birthday</li>
  <li>a competitive contributory pension scheme that you can enter as soon as you join where we will make a significant contribution to the cost of your pension; where your contributions come out of your salary before any tax is taken; and where your pension will continue to provide valuable benefits for you and your family if you are too ill to continue to work or die before you retire</li>
  <li>flexible working patterns including part- time or time-term working and access to Flexible Working Schemes allowing you to vary your working day as long as you work your total hours</li>
  <li>generous paid maternity and paternity leave which is notably more than the statutory minimum offered by many other employers and</li>
  <li>
    <p>childcare benefits (policy for new employees as of 5 April 2018): The government has introduced the Tax-Free Childcare (<abbr title="Tax-Free Childcare">TFC</abbr>) scheme. Working parents can open an online childcare account and for every £8 they pay in, the government adds £2, up to a maximum of £2000 a year for each child or £4000 for a disabled child. Parents then use the funds to pay for registered childcare. Existing employees may be able to continue to claim childcare vouchers, so please check how the policy would work for you here</p>
  </li>
  <li>interest-free loans allowing you to spread the cost of an annual travel season ticket or a new bicycle</li>
</ul>

<h4>Who would be suited to this degree apprenticeship?</h4>

<p>This programme would suit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>people studying technical or vocational courses, e.g. students with <abbr title="Business and Technology Education Council">BTEC</abbr> qualifications in relevant areas including business, science, <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr>
</li>
  <li>a level students studying a wide combination of subjects, e.g. economics, <abbr title="Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math">STEM</abbr> subjects and those who studying other subjects with interest in economics</li>
  <li>apprentices and other young people already in work</li>
  <li>adults in / out of work who meet entry requirements</li>
  <li>existing civil servants - people who have joined the Civil Service without first getting a degree or who have a degree in something other than economics</li>
</ul>

<h4>Work</h4>

<h4>What will I be doing?</h4>

<p>The range of opportunities open to you through the <abbr title="Government Economic Service Degree Apprenticeship Programme">GESDAP</abbr> programme is huge – working in the Treasury and government departments responsible for things like business, energy, justice, education and the environment.</p>

<p>That means you will have the opportunity to make change better in the areas that really matter to the world you live in – working on issues like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how government can support small businesses to grow</li>
  <li>how government can support UK businesses to compete in a changing world</li>
  <li>how government can support people to kickstart their lives after time in prison</li>
  <li>how government can act to protect the environment</li>
</ul>

<p>…that is to say, in government, great economics and great economists are contributing to the very biggest decisions that the country faces.</p>

<p>The same is true in private sector businesses.  Great economics, and great economists, help senior leaders make the biggest decisions better – providing them with the analysis and advice they need to get the big calls right.</p>

<h4>Which departments are involved?</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="Government Economic Service Degree Apprenticeship Programme">GESDAP</abbr> is relevant to all central government departments and agencies; many already have economic apprentices through the programme, including <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, HM Treasury, Department for Work and Pensions, Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Home Office, Department for Education, Department for Transport and all departments who have Economic Advisors.</p>

<h4>How much will I get paid?</h4>

<p>National at least - £18,108</p>

<p>London around - £20,826</p>

<h4>How much will I get paid when I graduate?</h4>

<p>If you successfully complete your apprenticeship with at least a 2:1, you will be offered an Assistant Economist position within the <abbr title="Government Economic Service">GES</abbr> and a minimum salary of £27,000.</p>

<h4>Where will I be based?</h4>

<p>Vacancies are available in London and Nationwide.</p>

<h4>Will I have to travel?</h4>

<p>Some travel may be required for this role.</p>

<h4>Study</h4>

<h4>Will I have to pay for my degree?</h4>

<p>No. One of the great benefits of studying via a <abbr title="Government Economic Service">GES</abbr> apprenticeship is no university fees.</p>

<h4>How often will I be studying?</h4>

<p>You will typically dedicate one day a week to your studies, but you will also be learning lots on the job.</p>
