<p>This guidance applies to Thames until 31 December 2021 and Anglian Waterways and the Medway Navigation to 31 March 2022.</p>
</div>

<p>This document explains our terms for refunding or transferring your boat registration for our waterways. You can find out if you qualify and, if so, what you need to do.</p>

<h2>Refunds</h2>

<p>We are able to offer you a refund in the circumstances below. Most refunds will be a percentage of the total registration charge you have paid (Table 1). We make refunds for whole months only, and calculate the number of unexpired months from the day we receive any documents we need you to send us.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You sell your boat and it does not stay on the waterway</li>
  <li>You remove your boat from the waterway permanently</li>
</ul>

<h3>Table 1</h3>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Months registration held</td>
      <td>Refund given</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0 - 3 months</td>
      <td>50%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3 - 6 months</td>
      <td>25%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Over 6 months</td>
      <td>0%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<ul>
  <li>Boats stolen or destroyed by fire: we will offer a full refund for every complete month of your remaining registration period.</li>
  <li>Administrative errors: we will offer a full refund as appropriate.</li>
  <li>Upgrade to Gold Licence: in most cases we can refund your waterway registration fee in full.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Documents you need to send us</h3>

<p>If you qualify for a refund, you will need to email or write to us with your request. The table below sets out what you need to send us so we can process your request:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Boat sold off waterway: Registration certificate/plate, completed change of ownership section*</li>
  <li>Boat removed from waterway: Registration certificate/plate and written details of boat’s new location</li>
  <li>Boat stolen: Police incident report URN or insurance claim reference number</li>
  <li>Boat destroyed by fire: Police/Fire &amp; Rescue Service URN or insurance claim reference number</li>
</ul>

<p>*If you put your boat on brokerage, we will only be able to make a refund once the sale is complete and you have confirmed the boat is leaving the waterway. We will then need your boat brokerage agent to confirm the date your boat went on sale with them.</p>

<p>We do not offer refunds in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You sell your boat but it remains on the waterway*</li>
  <li>You do not use your boat</li>
  <li>You are unable to use a short period registration**</li>
  <li>Your boat is off the waterway for a period of time (e.g. lifted out for winter storage)</li>
  <li>Waterway closures or restrictions</li>
  <li>Adverse river conditions (e.g. strong stream or flood)</li>
  <li>Late or end of season registrations</li>
</ul>

<p>*If you sell your boat and it remains on the waterway, you should include the value of your registration in the sale cost.</p>

<p>**We may be able to offer you an alternative short period registration for no charge.</p>

<h3>Covid-19 (coronavirus)</h3>

<p>We recognise that some businesses which make their living from the waterways and which register commercial vessels, will have been severely impacted by limitations upon their ability to carry out their business in 2020 due to the Coronavirus pandemic and will be likely to be impacted during the rest of 2021. Therefore in recognition of the impact upon those businesses which have commercial vessels registered, refunds will be available for the 2021 Thames registration charges and the 2021/22 Anglian and Medway registration charges in the following terms:</p>

<p>Commercial vessels which have paid their registration charge will be entitled to a refund equivalent to the difference in amount for that vessel should its category or tariff class have been non-commercial in nature (but not treated as a houseboat). This refund will be available only for the year indicated and will not apply retrospectively to previous registration years.</p>

<p>Commercial vessels are those described as “Commercial Vessels” in the Anglian Boat Registration Charges, described as “Passenger Boats and Tugs” and “Hire Boats” in the Upper Medway Boat Registration Charges, and described as “Launches” coming within the “Hire” category in the River Thames Boat Registration Charges described as classes H, P, D, C, S and T.</p>

<h4>Practical Example:</h4>
<p>Anglian Waterways Commercial Vessels Annual Long term Class 38 2021/22 Charge £1684.68 – refunded to equivalent Private Powered Vessels Annual Class 38 2021/22 Charge (£1091.91). Refund being £592.77.</p>

<h2>Transferring your registration</h2>
<p>If you buy a new boat on the same waterway or move your boat to one of our other waterways (see below), we can transfer your existing registration for you.</p>

<p>If you are buying a larger boat, you will need to pay any difference in charge.  For us to make a transfer, you must return your registration certificate and plate to us at the same time as you submit your application for your new boat.</p>

<p>If you prefer, you can still choose to sell on the cost of your existing registration to your boat’s new owner, and then buy a brand new registration for your new boat.  Don’t forget to complete the ‘change of ownership’ section on your registration certificate and send it back to us.</p>

<p>Our waterways are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>non-tidal River Thames</li>
  <li>non-tidal River Medway (below Tonbridge)</li>
  <li>Great Ouse system</li>
  <li>River Nene (below Northampton)</li>
  <li>Suffolk Stour (below Brundon, Sudbury)</li>
  <li>River Ancholme</li>
  <li>River Welland and Glen</li>
  <li>Black Sluice</li>
</ul>
