<h2>The importance of the National Child Measurement Programme</h2>

<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) considers that childhood obesity is reaching alarming proportions in many countries and poses an urgent and serious challenge.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> Children living with obesity are more likely to be ill, be absent from school due to illness, experience health-related limitations and require more medical care than healthy weight children. They are more likely to suffer from type 2 diabetes, asthma and musculoskeletal pain and experience mental health problems such as depression.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> Additionally, children living with obesity are 5 times more likely to be adults living with obesity. In England, the health problems associated with being overweight or obese cost the NHS more than £6.1 billion every year.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup></p>

<p>The National Child Measurement Programme (<abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>) data shows that the prevalence of overweight and obesity in children aged 4 to 5 and 10 to 11 is unacceptably high. The overall change in prevalence levels has also been relatively small each year, with the exception of the unprecedented rise seen in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/national-child-measurement-programme" rel="external">2020 to 2021 <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> annual report</a> which showed an increase of around 4.5%. These increases in child obesity and severe obesity prevalence in 2020 to 2021 follow the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in school closures and other public health measures. More data is needed to know whether this is a long-term increase<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>. The data consistently shows that the number of children living with obesity doubles between reception year and year 6 (from around 10% to around 20%). Additionally, year-on-year the data has shown that children living with obesity in the most deprived 10% of areas in England are more than twice that in the least deprived 10%. This gap in obesity prevalence by deprivation continues to widen for both reception and year 6, and for those children measured as severely obese this gap rises to more than 4 times for both year groups.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data is also used to analyse and further understand childhood obesity – data from a small sample of 4 local authorities was analysed longitudinally to examine how weight status tracks between reception and year 6. A model was developed by Public Health England (now Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (<abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>)) as part of this report, to be used by local authorities to predict weight status in year 6 children. The findings suggest that excess weight is likely to persist or worsen during primary school and that children from the most deprived backgrounds and certain ethnic communities may be at higher risk of retaining or gaining an unhealthy weight.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup></p>

<p>Chapter 2 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/childhood-obesity-a-plan-for-action-chapter-2">Childhood Obesity Plan: a plan for action</a><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup> published in June 2018 shows that tackling child obesity is a priority for the government. The plan aims to halve childhood obesity rates by 2030 and to significantly reduce health inequalities. Tackling child and adult obesity is a renewed and strengthened priority for the government, as is shown in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tackling-obesity-government-strategy/tackling-obesity-empowering-adults-and-children-to-live-healthier-lives">Obesity Strategy</a>. Local authorities also rate childhood obesity as one of their most important health issues.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup></p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> collection is a mandated service, funded via the public health grant for local authorities and key to monitoring the progress of the government’s Childhood Obesity Plan. It provides the data for the Public Health Outcomes Framework indicators on ‘excess weight in children aged 4 to 5 years and 10 to 11 years’.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup> Because the data is robust at local level, it can also be used to inform the development and monitoring of local childhood obesity strategies.</p>

<p>In addition to its surveillance role, the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> can be used to support locally led interventions. The notification and feedback letters offer a direct engagement with parents and families that can also be used to give advice and information about local services and programmes.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> is widely recognised as a world-class source of public health intelligence and the report of the findings, published annually by NHS Digital, has UK National Statistics status. The high participation rates of eligible schools and children reflect the continued effort of those implementing the programme at the local level.</p>

<p>This guidance document advises local commissioners and providers of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> on how the programme should be implemented. This helps to maintain the high quality of the programme, supports a cost-effective approach, and helps local partners to ensure that it is embedded in local strategies and actions to reduce childhood obesity.</p>

<h3>Infection control: considerations for delivery of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>
</h3>

<p>National and local infection control guidance should be referred to in order to inform the planning and delivery of <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> measurements. The following links advise on the necessary adjustments required to help enable the safe delivery of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> from an emergency planning and health protection perspective.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>This chapter provides background information on the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>, links to <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data, details of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system, and highlights the importance of evaluating the programme locally.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Background</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> was established in 2006 and involves measuring the height and weight of reception and year 6 children at state-funded schools, including academies, in England. Every year, more than 1 million children are measured, and annual participation rates are consistently high (around 95%), with over 99% of eligible schools (approximately 17,000 schools) taking part.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> participation rate for 2019 to 2020 and 2020 to 2021 were affected by COVID-19. The impacts of school closures, workforce pressures and school attendance, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/national-child-measurement-programme" rel="external"><abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> publications</a> are included throughout the reports.</p>

<p>Delivery of the surveillance elements of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> – completing the height and weight measurements and returning relevant data to NHS Digital – is a statutory function of local authorities set out in legislation.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup> <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> has responsibility for national oversight of the programme.</p>

<p>The purpose of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> is to provide robust public health surveillance data on child weight status in order to understand and monitor obesity prevalence and trends at national and local levels, inform obesity planning and commissioning and underpin the Public Health Outcomes Framework indicators on ‘excess weight in 4 to 5 and 10 to 11 year olds’.</p>

<p>Each year, NHS Digital produces a report<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup> showing key findings from the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>. <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> also publishes presentations, reports, local profiles and data visualisation tools,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup> including small area data at middle super output areas (<abbr title="middle super output areas">MSOAs</abbr>), Electoral Ward and Clinical Commissioning Group (<abbr title="Clinical Commissioning Group">CCG</abbr>) levels,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup> as well as a range of other resources to facilitate the wide use of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data to inform action at all levels to tackle child obesity (see appendix 1).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Maintaining the mental well-being of pupils in the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The wellbeing of children and families is very important. Measurements are conducted in a sensitive way, in private and away from other children. The weight and height information is shared with the parent or carer in a feedback letter (see ‘Deciding whether to provide parents with children’s results’ for further details on feedback letters). Where letters are provided, no individual information is shared with the children themselves, the teachers or the school. It is a parent’s choice if they share the information with their child. If a parent is concerned about their child’s growth, weight, body image or eating patterns, <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> feedback letters provide national and local information to support parents and advise on when to seek further support from a school nurse or general practitioner.</p>

<p>Parents do react in different ways to receiving their child’s <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> feedback, so guidance is available to help school nursing teams and <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> delivery staff have supportive conversations with parents about the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> and their child’s health and growth. Please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-child-measurement-programme-conversation-framework"><abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> conversation framework for talking to parents</a>.</p>

<p>The psychological and emotional impact of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> has been researched. Studies show that body image, self-esteem, weight-related teasing and restrictive eating behaviours do not change as a result of being measured or receiving feedback. It was also found that most children (96%, 351 children) are indifferent or unconcerned about being weighed or measured. The small number of children (4%, 13 children) that disliked the process were mainly from year 6, children aged 10 to 11 years. This reinforces the need for sensitivity when weighing and measuring older children.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> Deciding whether to provide parents with children’s results</h3>

<p>Local authorities are encouraged to provide parents with their child’s results. This is not a mandated component of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>, but local authorities should take account of the following considerations when making this decision.</p>

<p>In line with the commitment in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/advancing-our-health-prevention-in-the-2020s/advancing-our-health-prevention-in-the-2020s-consultation-document">Advancing our health: prevention in the 2020s</a>, work commenced to explore how <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data can be shared directly with digital child health records and presented appropriately so that it’s consistently accessible for both parents, carers and health professionals.</p>

<p>Evidence shows that, as being overweight is becoming the norm, parents and even health professionals struggle to identify overweight in children by sight alone, with half (50.7%) of parents underestimating their children’s overweight or obesity status.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup> <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> feedback letters give parents an objective, professional assessment of their child’s weight status based on measurement. Research in relation to the programme has consistently shown that parents want to receive their child’s <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> results and 87% find the feedback helpful.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup> There is a duty of care to share information with parents that could promote and improve their child’s health.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup></p>

<p>Letters are addressed and sent to parents so it is a parent’s choice if they decide to share this information with their child or take any action based on the feedback given.</p>

<p>Research has also shown that after receiving <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> feedback most parents (72%) reported an intention to change health-related family behaviours and just over half of parents (55%) reported positive behaviour change for their children, including improved diet, less screen-time, health service use and increased physical activity.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup> The letters provide parents with the opportunity to seek further advice and support if they want.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span> Specimen parent result letters</h3>

<p>To support sharing of results with parents, <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> has developed editable <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-child-measurement-programme-operational-guidance">specimen parent result letters</a> in which each child’s height, weight and <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> (body mass index) centile classification (underweight, healthy weight, overweight, very overweight) can be incorporated automatically using the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system. In 2018, changes to the letter were made following user feedback and consultation with academic and behavioural experts. Some local authorities produce their own letters to suit local needs, and some also phone parents to discuss the results before or after the letters are sent (see chapter 5).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span> The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system is managed by NHS Digital. It consists of an online browser-based system, plus an offline Excel spreadsheet-based tool for data entry. The system incorporates validation at the point of data entry and provides a secure environment according to NHS standards in which pupil identifiable records can be processed and stored.</p>

<p>The system allows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>multiple users to be assigned locally with access to schools and pupil data based on their role in the programme</li>
  <li>direct entry and upload of locally collected data for reception and year 6 children measured each year</li>
  <li>automated calculation of information, including <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centile and weight category</li>
  <li>data export for the production of the result letters to parents</li>
  <li>progress reporting to assist in monitoring the measurement exercise, for example, schools visited, number of pupils measured, children who have been sent feedback letters</li>
  <li>data quality reporting to allow monitoring throughout the collection year to ensure complete and accurate data is submitted</li>

<p>The local authority is responsible for allowing users to access the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system and this is controlled at local authority level. Each area assigns an <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> lead who is responsible for assigning all the other <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> roles within the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Planning the measurements</h2>

<p>This chapter provides an overview of the planning that needs to take place before measuring children. It identifies the key local stakeholders whose assistance can help to improve the delivery of the programme. It outlines the lawful basis for the processing of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data under the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> Regulations, <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup>,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup> the General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>), and the Data Protection Act 2018 (<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup>. It also outlines the data that needs to be collected, the staff training and equipment required, and information on which schools and children should be included in the programme.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> and General Data Protection Regulation</h3>

<p>All local authorities in England are required to collect information on the height and weight of reception and year 6 school children. The statutory authority for the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> means that the lawful basis for processing this data is considered to be provided by the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> Articles covering ‘compliance with a legal obligation’ and ‘the provision of health care or treatment’. Refer to ‘Information needed before the measurements’ section in this chapter and appendix 3 for further information.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Parental consent</h3>

<p>Parental consent is not the lawful basis for the processing of <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data under the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Securing local engagement</h3>

<p>Successful local delivery of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> is dependent on multi-disciplinary teamwork and support from key partners. Engaging with local authority staff, primary care professionals, providers, schools, parents and children themselves can help with delivery and ensure all involved understand the purpose, benefits and outcomes of the programme.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> Local authority colleagues</h3>

<p>Local authority public health teams should ensure council members are familiar with the programme. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-child-measurement-programme-briefing-for-elected-members"><abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> briefing for elected members</a> answers frequently asked questions about the programme, including a set of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.local.gov.uk/national-child-measurement-programme-briefing-elected-members-0" rel="external">case studies</a> that show how local authorities have utilised the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> to engage further with stakeholders in tackling health inequalities.</p>

<p>It can be helpful to engage with other local authority colleagues. Education officers may be able to assist with obtaining contacts for schools or class-list information. They or others may also be able to facilitate the opportunity for engagement and raise awareness of the programme with head teachers and school staff.</p>

<p>Liaising with communications teams and children’s services may be useful to identify existing processes used to provide information to schools. Making such contact may also offer an opportunity to raise awareness of the programme and share good news stories via direct communication channels, such as local authority and school social media accounts, school websites or through local press to residents. An <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> media pack is available to help with preparing reactive and proactive coverage of the programme. Please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ncmp@dhsc.gov.uk">ncmp@dhsc.gov.uk</a> for further information.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span> Primary care professionals</h3>

<p>While not a mandated component of the programme, informing key staff groups in primary care about the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> and their role within it is important, and is allowed for under the legislation relating to the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>. This can be achieved by engaging with GPs, school and practice nurses, health visitors and health trainers to ensure that they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are aware of the programme’s details and benefits</li>
  <li>are informed of local prevalence and trends in child obesity</li>
  <li>know how to assess child <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centiles</li>
  <li>are made aware of plans for sharing the results with parents</li>
</ul>

<p>Alerting these professionals in advance of sharing <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> results with parents is valuable so that they can be aware of children within their practice who have been measured and may be underweight, overweight or very overweight (including those with severe obesity), and provide appropriate assessment, advice and signposting should a parent contact them.</p>

<p>An editable <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-child-measurement-programme-operational-guidance">specimen pre-measurement letter to primary care practitioners</a> is provided for local areas to use to inform these professionals about the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span> Providers</h3>

<p>In most areas of the country, delivery of the programme is commissioned as part of the school nursing service or to other provider organisations. Making sure school nursing teams and other providers have a good understanding of the programme and their responsibilities will help with effective delivery.</p>

<p>School nursing teams and provider organisations play an important role in leading, co-ordinating and advocating for the programme. They may also help to influence the development of appropriate services that respond to identified need and support the implementation of effective follow-up and referral pathways.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.7 </span> Schools: engaging schools</h3>

<p>There is some evidence<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup> to suggest that whole school approaches can contribute to improvements in helping children to move towards a healthier weight. A whole school approach goes beyond the learning and teaching in the classroom to incorporate actions throughout the school day, including integrating healthy food and physical activity into the life of a school by improving school food, opportunities to be active and health education. It involves partnerships with families, outside agencies and the wider community to promote consistent support for children’s health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>Current research<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">[footnote 22]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">[footnote 23]</a></sup> suggests that there may be a relationship between obesity and poor educational attainment. However, this is likely to be due to a broader picture of inequalities in health and education, with disadvantaged socio-economic groups tending to have poorer health and achieve lower levels of educational attainment.</p>

<p>Maintained schools have a statutory duty to promote the wellbeing of pupils in carrying out their functions.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">[footnote 24]</a></sup>  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/education-inspection-framework">Ofsted’s Education Inspection Framework 2019</a><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:25" rel="footnote">[footnote 25]</a></sup> states that:</p>

<p>‘Inspectors will make a judgement on the personal development of learners by evaluating the extent to which… the curriculum and the provider’s wider work support learners to develop their character – including their resilience, confidence and independence – and help them know how to keep physically and mentally healthy’.</p>

<p>The statutory guidance for <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/relationships-education-relationships-and-sex-education-rse-and-health-education">Relationships Education, Relationships and Sex Education (RSE) and Health Education</a> includes content on the importance of daily exercise, good nutrition and the risks associated with an inactive lifestyle, including obesity.</p>

<p>Although school involvement in the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> is voluntary, the benefits of participating may be maximised through schools advocating a whole school approach to promoting health and wellbeing.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:26" rel="footnote">[footnote 26]</a></sup></p>

<p>Helping boards of governors and head teachers understand the benefits of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> can be a positive first step in getting schools on board, for example by providing an update slot as part of <abbr title="in-service training">INSET</abbr> training or a local education conference, or through a local authority newsletter to head teachers.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/childhood-obesity-a-plan-for-action">2016 Childhood Obesity Plan</a><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:27" rel="footnote">[footnote 27]</a></sup> set out to ensure that schools adopt evidence-based initiatives that would lead to improving pupil’s health and wellbeing. In <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/childhood-obesity-a-plan-for-action-chapter-2">chapter 2</a> of the plan, further commitment in supporting schools to create environments which encourage pupils to eat healthily and be physically active are included. Details of resources to support schools are given in appendices 4 and 5.</p>

<p>A suite of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://campaignresources.phe.gov.uk/schools/topics/our-healthy-year/overview" rel="external">Our Healthy Year resources</a> is available for head teachers, reception and year 6 teachers, and school nursing teams to help them teach pupils about leading healthier lifestyles in the years in which they are weighed and measured as part of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>. The resources include ideas for whole school activities and suggestions for engaging parents. The resources are available to download from the school zone where users can subscribe to a newsletter, in order to receive updates on new materials and campaigns. Better Health Families is the government’s flagship childhood obesity brand which supports families with children aged 3 to 11 to eat well and move more.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> has published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-child-measurement-programme-operational-guidance">information for schools</a> that explains the purpose of the programme, what schools can do to support delivery and how they can encourage physical activity, healthy eating and promote positive emotional health and wellbeing. A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-child-measurement-programme-operational-guidance">specimen pre-measurement letter to head teachers</a> has also been developed to inform boards of governors and head teachers of the programme and can be sent in advance of the measurement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.8 </span> <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> school feedback letter</h3>

<p>The legislation relating to the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> does not make provision for an individual child’s result to be given directly to schools. <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> issues a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-child-measurement-programme-school-feedback-letter">school feedback letter</a> for each school, which can be distributed by the local authority to head teachers. This non-identifiable school level information is intended to inform action at a whole school rather than individual level and provides reception and year 6 participation rates as well as average overweight and obesity results from the previous 3 years. For further information refer to chapter 7.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.9 </span> Eligible schools</h3>

<p>Every state-funded primary and middle school within the local authority boundary should be included in the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>. Changes to the education system mean that various types of state schools exist which are all eligible for inclusion in the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>. The most common ones are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>community schools, controlled by the local council</li>
  <li>foundation schools and voluntary schools</li>
  <li>academies, run by a governing body independent from the local council</li>
  <li>grammar schools run by the council, foundation body or trust (usually secondary schools so not relevant to the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>For further information on eligible school types see appendix 6.</p>

<p>At the start of each collection year the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system is pre-loaded with a list of eligible schools for each local authority. This list is updated annually based on the Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) school-level January census.</p>

<p>Schools are assigned to local authorities if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they submitted data for it in the previous collection year</li>
  <li>the school is new, and no data was submitted (based on postcode boundaries)</li>
</ul>

<p>Local authorities and/or the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> provider should check at the start of the academic year that all schools are correctly allocated.</p>

<p>During the collection year, schools can be added or removed from this list to take account of local changes, for example, where schools have closed, or new schools have opened. From the 2019 to 2020 collection year, it is no longer possible for local authorities to add duplicate schools (for example, when a school becomes an academy). The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system only allows the addition of a new school if the old school has been deleted by requesting the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> number in addition to the unique reference number (<abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr>). Since <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> numbers remain the same when a school changes status, the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system will identify and prevent duplicate schools being uploaded.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Get information about schools</a> provides a current register of schools, including their <abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> numbers. Further details are available from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-child-measurement-programme/it-system/setting-up-schools-list" rel="external">NHS Digital IT System User Guide part 2: Setting up schools list</a>.</p>

<p>Measurement in special and privately-funded schools is encouraged where possible. Data from these schools will be included in the national database and returned to local authorities as part of their enhanced dataset. However, since established relations with these schools vary between areas they will not be included when calculating participation rates, nor will they be included in the national report. This is because the low participation rates from privately-funded and special schools mean that the data is unlikely to be representative. For all schools that do participate, communicating results to parents is encouraged.</p>

<p>Home-schooled children are excluded from being captured on the national IT system, as <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> covers children in state-funded schools only. Height and weight measurement and sharing of results with parents of home-schooled children is encouraged outside the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> where local resources allow.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.10 </span> Parents and children</h3>

<p>To facilitate the delivery of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>, it is important that parents and the wider public are aware of the importance of children having a healthy weight and understand the purpose of the programme. The media, such as local newspapers and radio, can be used to help achieve this.</p>

<p>By engaging with parents and children in advance of delivering the programme, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure parents are aware that the privacy and dignity of the child will be safeguarded at all times throughout the process</li>
  <li>reassure parents that their child’s measurements will not be revealed to anyone else in the school</li>
  <li>provide an opportunity to contextualise healthy weight as an integral aspect of valuing and promoting child health and wellbeing</li>
  <li>raise the profile of other actions at a local level to reduce childhood obesity</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.11 </span> Maximising delivery through links with school health and nursing services</h3>

<p>In planning the delivery of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>, it is helpful to consider how impact can be maximised through positioning the programme as an integral part of the school health and nursing services provided to children in schools. Some local authorities align the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> with priorities recommended in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/healthy-child-programme-0-to-19-health-visitor-and-school-nurse-commissioning">Healthy child programme 0 to 19: health visitor and school nurse commissioning</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/commissioning-of-public-health-services-for-children/school-aged-years-high-impact-area-3-supporting-healthy-lifestyles">School-aged years high impact area 3: Supporting healthy lifestyles</a>.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:28" rel="footnote">[footnote 28]</a></sup> such as health assessment at school entry, preventative and screening or other activities with year 6 children.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.12 </span> Information needed before the measurements</h3>

<h4>Class-list and delivery arrangements</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> Regulations require local authorities to arrange with schools to measure children’s height and weight in their area. Before the measurements take place, class list details of all children in reception and year 6 eligible to participate should be obtained. The children’s class lists can be shared by schools with the local authority or those working on behalf of the local authority to carry out the height and weight measurements. This sharing continues to be lawful under the <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018.</p>

<p>As consent is not the lawful basis for processing <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data under the <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018, there is no requirement for schools to obtain the consent of parents in order to provide class lists to school nursing teams and <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> providers.</p>

<p>This information is required for each child for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>age, sex, and date of birth are required to calculate weight category</li>
  <li>ethnicity and address are required to monitor differences in child weight between ethnic groups, different parts of the country and different social and economic groups</li>
  <li>name, date of birth and NHS number are required to link the child’s measurements from reception and year 6 and to other information held by NHS Digital, Department of Health and Social Care and the Department of Education this enables linking information from health and education records, where lawful to do so, to understand how and why the weight of children is changing, and how this affects children’s health and education. This includes a child’s health data relating to hospital in-patient care, hospital out-patient care, hospital emergency care, maternity, mental health, social care, primary care, public health, diagnostic care, mortality, cancer, diabetes, health, lifestyle and wellbeing surveys that a child has participated in and education data, such as educational achievement, absence, exclusions and special educational needs</li>
  <li>parent address is required to send parent feedback letters</li>
  <li>parent contact details including email address and telephone number are required if digital communication methods are being used and proactive feedback calls are planned</li>
</ul>

<p>It is also useful to include the weight, height and <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> data on a child’s local health record, so it could be viewed by other health care professionals.</p>

<p>Class-list information is available from the school census every January, which is a statutory undertaking for all state-funded schools listed in appendix 6. Contact the local education officer to gain access to this information. If the information is required earlier in the academic year it can be requested directly from schools. If an external organisation is commissioned to deliver the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> they will require access to personal child data, and this should be stated in the contract to comply with data protection law.</p>

<p>Children who move schools may be measured more than once. The IT system allows for the child’s measurements to be included in the dataset more than once and therefore the parent could receive more than 1 results letter. Where a child is known to have moved school, local areas may want to check if the child has previously been measured as part of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>, and whether a result letter has already been sent to the child’s parents before sending a further letter.</p>

<p>When engaging with a school, it may be helpful to establish a single named contact to liaise with to agree arrangements for the delivery of the programme in the school, including a date, time and use of a room or screened-off area in which to conduct the measurements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.13 </span> Providing the opportunity to parents to withdraw their child from the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Parental consent is not the lawful basis for the processing of <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data under the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018. However, local authorities must take steps to ensure parents are informed that information about their child will be processed as part of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> and provide parents with an opportunity to withdraw their child from participating in the programme.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> has developed an editable <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-child-measurement-programme-operational-guidance">specimen pre-measurement letter to parents</a> which ensures that the information provided to parents on the processing of their children’s height and weight data helps parents know what to expect when their child participates. This letter explains to parents how their child’s data is collected and what it will be used for. It is therefore essential that this letter explains to parents whether their child’s data will be shared with a GP or health professional who can promote and assist the improvement of their child’s health. This should also include text that explains that a referral to a weight management service or proactive follow up, if these are planned for locally, may take place.</p>

<p>The wording shown in bold in the specimen letter should be followed closely because this sets out the legal requirements for the programme and the intended use of the data. Not all the information regarding data processing needs to be included in the specimen letter, for example a weblink directing parents to further information on the local authority or <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> provider’s webpage could be included in the letter. If planning to produce further information to explain data processing and the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> to parents, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://understandingpatientdata.org.uk/sites/default/files/2019-05/Resource%20quick%20guide_For%20Web_2.pdf" rel="external">Wellcome Trust Understanding Patient Data Resource quick guide</a> may provide additional useful support.</p>

<p>The pre-measurement letter to parents must be sent to all children eligible to take part in the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>. Parents must be sent this letter at least 2 weeks before the measurements are scheduled to take place. The local <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> provider should liaise with individual schools to agree the approach for ensuring the letters are circulated within this time-frame.</p>

<p>The names of children who have been withdrawn by their parents in each age group should be collected. The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> provider should also check with the school if any other requests to withdraw children from the measurements have been received following the distribution of the pre-measurement letter.</p>

<p>For many schools, the routine method of communication with parents is via email, and as such, it is recommended that the pre-measurement letter is sent to parents via email. This will enable parents to directly use the hyperlinks to obtain further information online about what happens to their child’s data, and to access Better Health Families information.</p>

<p>When sending out pre-measurement letters, it is recommended that the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-child-measurement-programme-operational-guidance">pre-measurement leaflet for parents: school height and weight measurements</a> is attached, as it includes information about the programme and why it is important for children to take part.</p>

<p>Where local areas choose to send hard copy pre-measurement letters, copies of the leaflet can be downloaded from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://campaignresources.phe.gov.uk/resources/campaigns/17-change4life" rel="external"><abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> campaign resource centre: Better Health Families</a> for local printing. For requests for a high-resolution version of the leaflet please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ncmp@dhsc.gov.uk">ncmp@dhsc.gov.uk</a> (appendix 1).</p>

<p>The School Nursing Service or other <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> provider may also choose to communicate directly with parents and year 6 pupils about the programme, to ensure that they have received sufficient information. This can be done via a school’s newsletter, website, assembly or parents evening. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://campaignresources.phe.gov.uk/schools/topics/our-healthy-year/overview" rel="external">Our Healthy Year</a> School Nursing resources are designed to help with this before, during and after measurement day. They include presentation materials for parent and pupil audiences.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.14 </span> Staffing</h3>

<p>It is important to deploy an appropriate level of staffing resource for the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>. A registered medical practitioner, registered nurse, for example a school nurse, or registered dietitian must manage the arrangements of the programme, such as co-ordinating and training staff, engaging with schools and ensuring the data is submitted to NHS Digital on time.</p>

<p>Although a registered medical practitioner, registered nurse, or registered dietitian must oversee the programme, the measuring may be undertaken by a healthcare assistant, children’s nursery nurse or similar grade member of staff with appropriate competencies and support. A description of the roles and responsibilities of those involved in the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> are listed within the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> cost model tool. This tool has been developed to support cost-efficient delivery of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>, by providing a consistent and automated format to enter costs associated with <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> delivery. To request a copy of the tool, please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ncmp@dhsc.gov.uk">ncmp@dhsc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>The successful delivery of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> depends not only on the completion of accurate measurement but also engaging with stakeholders and entering and validating data. As such, staff should have a mixture of expertise and skills, including clinical knowledge, communication, administration, IT skills, and data management and analysis.</p>

<p>In keeping with current safeguarding legislation, all staff who measure children as part of the programme must have an Enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service check (DBS).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.15 </span> Staff training: measuring and recording data</h3>

<p>Before starting the measurements, staff should be trained on how to accurately complete the measurements and record and upload the data.</p>

<p>Staff using the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system should be competent and confident in doing so. Educational resources and guidance to support use of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system are available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-child-measurement-programme/it-system/" rel="external">NHS Digital website</a>. Staff using the offline Excel spreadsheet should be familiar with entering and saving data in an Excel spreadsheet.</p>

<h3>Staff training: taking calls from parents and delivering proactive follow-up</h3>

<p>Staff responsible for taking calls from parents following the sending of results letters, or for proactively following up children after the measurements, should be competent in their awareness and understanding of child obesity, its impact on children’s health and its management. They should also be skilled in talking to parents about a child’s weight, lifestyle and behaviour change.</p>

<p>Staff should be aware of all local child weight management and physical activity services available to children in their area, and pathways for referral into them. Ideally, they will be trained in motivational interviewing to maximise the opportunity to engage in an effective discussion with a parent about their child’s weight status.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-child-measurement-programme"><abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>: A conversation framework for talking to parents</a> is available to support school nurses, their teams and other professionals to hold supportive conversations with a parent about their child’s <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> feedback.</p>

<p>Training staff is the responsibility of the local area. It is recommended the training topics in this section should be covered. See also appendix 1 for additional training and development.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.16 </span> Equipment</h3>

<p>Accurate measurements depend on the correct use of good quality equipment. Class III scales must be used for measuring weight and should be properly calibrated. Scales must be CE marked with the last 2 digits of the year of manufacture (for example, CE09 for a product manufactured in 2009), and be marked with a letter ‘M’ to show it is legal for this use. This will be followed by a 4-digit number identifying the body which approved the scale.</p>

<p>All scales should be checked annually either by recognised Weighing Federation members or by electro-biomedical engineering (EBME) technicians using traceable weights. If the scales display weights within in-service tolerances, they should then be usable throughout the year. If not, they must be taken out of service and returned to an approved body for calibration and verification. If at any time there is reason to believe the weighing equipment may be inaccurate, it should be recalibrated and re-verified.</p>

<p>If equipment with switchable readings (metric and imperial) is in use, the switching facility should be disabled to ensure that only the metric reading is available. If the equipment cannot be converted to metric reading only, it should be replaced as a priority.</p>

<p>Height should be measured with a correctly assembled stand-on height measure that shows height in centimetres and millimetres. Old and new model components of height measurement devices should not be used together as they are often not compatible. If a component breaks, the whole device should be replaced. Wall-mounted, sonic, or digital height measures should not be used. Before each measuring session, height measures should be calibrated using a measure of known length, such as a metre ruler to ensure correct assembly.</p>

<p>Trading Standards is a local authority regulatory and consumer protection service which, as part of its statutory weights and measures functions, will provide support to check the accuracy, calibration and suitability of weighing and measuring equipment. You can find the nearest trading standards service from the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.tradingstandards.uk/consumers" rel="external">Chartered Trading Standards Institute</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system should be used to record children’s results at the time of measurement. The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system allows data to be recorded in 3 ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Entered directly through the online browser-based system (this is the preferred option): this requires internet access at the point of measurement. The system will allow multiple users per local authority area, so it can be used by people measuring in different schools at the same time. It allows for validation of the data at the point of measurement and if an extreme measurement is identified, it is easy to quickly re-measure the child to confirm whether the original measurement is correct.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Entered into the Excel spreadsheet-based tool: before the school visit, the spreadsheet must be pre-populated with children’s details through the online browser-based system and stored on a secure laptop. After the visit, the laptop can be taken to a location with internet access and submitted through the online browser-based system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a last resort entered onto pre-prepared, paper-based records: prior to the school visit, the paper-based records must be printed with pupil details through the online browser-based tool. After the visit, they can then be inputted through the online browser-based system. This approach is not recommended as it does not allow for validation of the data at the point of measurement and errors may occur in transcribing data from the paper records to the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system. This approach has been provided for use only in circumstances where the first 2 options are not achievable. When using paper records, errors such as an extreme measurement may only become evident when entering data onto the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system and at this point it will be quite difficult to investigate and correct the data.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.17 </span> Children who should be measured</h3>

<p>Local authorities should plan to measure all eligible children in reception and year 6 from state-funded schools. Privately-funded and special schools should be included where local resources allow.</p>

<h4>Special considerations for some children who are measured</h4>

<h4>Children with Down’s syndrome</h4>

<p>Children with Down’s syndrome should be included in the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> activity on measurement day as appropriate. However, data recorded for children with Down’s syndrome should not be submitted in the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system. This is because specialist <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.dsmig.org.uk/information-resources/growth-charts/" rel="external">Down’s syndrome growth charts</a> should be used to assess weight category. To request electronic growth charts, the completion of the online licence allocation questionnaire and a one-off fee (licence charges for categories 1 or 2) sent to the Down’s Syndrome Medical Interest Group is required.</p>

<p>The specialist charts should be used locally and appropriate information shared with parents. Concerns about a child’s measurements should be followed up in line with local care pathways. The local school nursing team, special educational needs team or other specialist teams may also offer additional support to the family.</p>

<h4>Children who may have a growth disorder</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system flags heights and weights that are outside the expected range. While this is done mainly for data quality purposes rather than identifying a child who may have a growth disorder, it can provide an opportunity for health practitioners to refer or follow up a child if the weight or height is outside the expected range. Concerns about a child’s measurements should be followed up in line with local care pathways.</p>

<p>The Royal College Paediatrics and Child Health (<abbr title="Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health">RCPCH</abbr>) provides <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/resources/uk-who-growth-charts-childhood-puberty-close-monitoring-cpcm-chart" rel="external">childhood and</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/resources/uk-who-growth-charts-childhood-puberty-close-monitoring-cpcm-chart" rel="external">puberty close monitoring charts</a> for boys and girls. These charts based on the UK90 growth reference are used to monitor children with growth or nutritional problems, such as unusually short, thin or overweight children, and are mostly used in specialist clinics and special schools. For more information about these charts please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:growth.charts@rcpch.ac.uk">growth.charts@rcpch.ac.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Any additional health needs should be taken into account when considering whether a child should participate, even if their parent or carer has not withdrawn them. It is important to ensure that the child is content with being measured and is given the chance not to take part if they do not want to. They should be reassured about confidentiality.</p>

<p>Where possible it may be helpful to liaise with schools before the measurements take place, to identify children who might be particularly sensitive about being measured, or where measurement might not be appropriate, for example, those with diagnosed eating or growth disorders.</p>

<h4>Children absent from school on measurement day</h4>

<p>If feasible and if resources allow, local authorities and providers are encouraged to return to measure children who were absent from school on measurement days due to sickness, or any other reason. This may however not be possible if there are workforce pressures and difficulties with balancing priorities and challenges at the local level.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.18 </span> Children who should not be measured</h3>

<h4>Children withdrawn from being measured</h4>

<p>Children who have been withdrawn from the programme by their parents and children who refuse to participate on the day should not be measured. Eligible children who have been withdrawn or refuse to participate on the day must be included in the eligible population count in the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system.</p>

<p>The legislation relating to <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> states that only children able to stand on weighing scales and height measures unaided should be measured. Children who are unable to do so should not be included. They should also be excluded from the total eligible for measurement in that school and recorded as unsuitable for measurement due to physical impairment as a reason for non-measurement.</p>

<h4>Children outside the usual age range</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system will not accept information for children outside the usual age range for reception or year 6, because their date of birth will be outside the accepted range for the programme. Local authorities may wish to still measure these children, so they do not feel excluded or singled out. Their <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> category can be obtained via the online <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/bmi-calculator/" rel="external">NHS <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> healthy weight calculator</a> and fed back to parents in the same way as other children receiving their results. The <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centiles and weight categories in the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system align with those in the NHS <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> healthy weight calculator.</p>

<p>In cases where a child is greater than the 99.6th or below the 1st centile, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.incubate.growthcharts&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US" rel="external">growth charts UK-WHO app</a> can be used to give an indication of whether a child falls on or above the 99.6th centile and on or below the 0.4th centile. This should give the information required to identify whether to follow up a child or not.</p>

<p>Care should be taken to avoid stigmatising any children who are unable to participate in the programme and to deal sensitively with any children who have particular needs. For matters relating to gender identity, please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/preventing-suicide-lesbian-gay-and-bisexual-young-people">toolkits for school nurses</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gids.nhs.uk/professionals/guidance-for-schools/" rel="external">guidance for trans equality in schools</a>. Local authorities should make reasonable adjustments in the way they commission and deliver public health services to children with physical disabilities and special educational needs and should work closely with schools to plan alternative provision.</p>

<p>The small number of children who are unable to take part in the programme due to a disability should be offered alternative arrangements, since their parents or carers can still benefit from receiving information and lifestyle advice, including specialist advice appropriate to the child’s circumstances. The <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-child-measurement-programme-operational-guidance">specimen letter to parents of children unable to be measured unaided</a> can assist with this.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.19 </span> Participation rates</h3>

<p>To ensure the information collected provides an accurate picture of the population, local authorities should aim to achieve participation rates by eligible children of at least 90% and where possible to build on participation rates previously achieved in years not affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.20 </span> Data to be collected</h3>

<p>Detailed guidance about the mandatory and supplementary data that should be collected as part of the programme, how to access and use the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT System and submit the data to NHS Digital is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-child-measurement-programme/it-system/" rel="external">NHS Digital website</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.21 </span> <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system user set up</h3>

<p>The responsibility for finalising the data submission lies with the local authority. This includes signing off data quality, extracting all data for the local authority area, and giving NHS Digital permission to purge all data. Therefore, it is expected that the role as <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> lead works within the local authority and not for the provider organisation. Further details are available from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-child-measurement-programme/it-system" rel="external">NHS Digital IT System User Guide part 1: Setting-up user accounts</a>.</p>

<h4>Children’s personal information</h4>

<p>It is advisable to populate some of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system data fields before the measurements. These include every child’s name, sex, date of birth, home address and postcode, ethnicity and NHS number.</p>

<h5>Sourcing a child’s NHS number</h5>

<p>There are several ways local authorities report obtaining a child’s NHS number for the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>, these include from a Child Health Information System (<abbr title="Child Health Information System">CHIS</abbr>) via an NHS delivery provider, National Spine, and local IT clinical systems such as EMIS, PARIS and System 1. An <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nhs-prod.global.ssl.fastly.net/binaries/content/assets/legacy/pdf/0/2/ncmp_nhs_number_survey_2017.pdf" rel="external">NHS number survey report</a> carried out in 2017 summarises the learnings from local authorities.</p>

<p>NHS Digital’s Personal Demographics Service (<abbr title="personal demographics service">PDS</abbr>) can be utilised to help local authorities obtain a child’s NHS number. Further information about the <abbr title="personal demographics service">PDS</abbr>: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics" rel="external">Access data on the Personal Demographics Service</a>. Email the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ncmp@dhsc.gov.uk">ncmp@dhsc.gov.uk</a> for the <abbr title="personal demographics service">PDS</abbr> access form and further support.</p>

<p>School names and unique reference numbers are already provided within the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system, although any amendments can be made if required, for example, if schools have opened, closed or changed name. The information required to pre-populate records can be requested from local authorities, schools, or obtained from the child health information system in advance of the measurements. It should not be obtained by asking pupils, or assigned during the measurement process.</p>

<p>Once the names of all children who have been withdrawn have been collected, details of the children should be added to records prior to measurement day to ensure these children are not measured. If the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system data fields have already been populated, it is not necessary to remove this data (including a child’s NHS number) from the system if an eligible child has been withdrawn from the programme. This remains compliant with the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> Regulations. Eligible children who have been withdrawn should still be included in the eligible population count. Further details are available from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-child-measurement-programme/it-system/pupil-data-management" rel="external">NHS Digital IT System User Guide part 3: Pupil data management</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.22 </span> Planning the measurements: checklist of critical planning tasks</h3>

<p>The checklist below can be used to ensure that you complete all critical planning tasks before starting to deliver the programme:</p>

<ul>
  <li>plan to raise awareness and understanding of the programme with elected members, other local authority colleagues, primary care professionals, head teachers/school governors, parents and children</li>
  <li>engage with local authority education officers, or directly with schools to arrange for class lists to be provided</li>
  <li>liaise and engage with schools to gain their support in delivering the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> to agree dates for measurement and book an appropriate room</li>
  <li>send the pre-measurement letter to parents at least 2 weeks before measurements take place ensuring that any necessary local amendments have been made</li>
  <li>liaise with schools to collate any children that have been withdrawn and identify other children for whom it may not be appropriate to participate</li>
  <li>identify staff with the necessary mix of clinical, administrative and data skills to deliver the programme</li>
  <li>provide staff with the necessary training and support to ensure they are competent to complete the measurements, record and upload the data</li>
  <li>ensure all staff involved in the weighing and measuring have an Enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service check</li>
  <li>have appropriate and calibrated scales</li>
  <li>consider making alternative arrangements for children who cannot take part in the programme due to physical disabilities or for medical reasons</li>
  <li>send electronic copies of the pre-measurement leaflet for parents, or alternatively download the leaflet for local printing when sending the pre-measurement letters</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Doing the measurements</h2>

<p>This chapter sets out how to correctly undertake the weight and height measurements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Setting up</h3>

<p>The measurements should take place in a private room where the results are secure and cannot be seen or heard by anyone who is not directly involved in taking the measurements. In the exceptional case that a separate room is not available, a screened-off area of a classroom can be used.</p>

<p>Practitioners should ensure that the calibrated weighing scale is placed on a firm, level surface with the read-out display concealed from the participating child and others. Practitioners should also ensure the height measure is correctly assembled and is placed on a firm, level surface with its stabilisers resting against a vertical surface (such as a wall or door) to ensure maximum rigidity. It is good practice to confirm that the height measure is correctly assembled by checking with an item of known length, such as a metre ruler.</p>

<p>Practitioners should record measurements on an encrypted, password-protected laptop using the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system in its online or offline (Microsoft Excel-based) form.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Measuring height and weight</h3>

<p>Research has shown that children respond pragmatically and positively to being measured if the measurements are done sensitively. Privacy while being measured is important to children and parents.</p>

<p>Practitioners should be aware that children can be sensitive about their height, weight, or both, and should recognise that measuring children could accentuate these sensitivities, particularly for older children.</p>

<p>All anxieties should be appropriately addressed during the measurements and children’s privacy, dignity and cultural needs should be respected at all times. Under no circumstances should a child be coerced into taking part or be measured if their parents have withdrawn their child from the programme.</p>

<p>It is important to consider the personal circumstances of a child, such as additional health needs that might make weight a particularly sensitive issue and, in some circumstances, make measuring inappropriate. See information on considerations to be taken into account when planning the measurements (see chapter 3: Children who should be measured).</p>

<p>Some children may be able to stand unaided on scales and the height measure but have medical conditions that mean accurate results cannot be taken, for example, cerebral palsy, a prosthetic leg, a leg in plaster, or a growth disorder such as dwarfism. Practitioners should use their professional judgement in deciding whether to measure such children so that they do not feel excluded from the activity and so that the child’s views on being included are considered. Any measurements for these children should not be uploaded to the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system. This is because the use of <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centile is unlikely to be appropriate.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the results should not be fed back to parents using the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system or the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> parent result letter template. Instead, it may be appropriate to provide a letter with the individual weight and height information (without the weight classification) and appropriate healthy eating and physical activity information. A specimen letter to parents of children unable to be measured unaided is available and can be adapted to local needs.</p>

<p>Individual results should not be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>disclosed to children during or after the measuring</li>
  <li>fed back directly to the school or teachers (see chapter 7)</li>
  <li>given to individual children in the form of the results letter or placed in school bags as there is a risk that the child could open the letter in an unsupported environment and the letter may not reach parents</li>
  <li>revealed to other children</li>
</ul>

<p>If a child wishes to discuss the measurements and has any questions, the practitioner will use their expertise in answering these and allay these concerns with the child and family.</p>

<p>Any concerns about a child’s weight status or height status should be followed up with parents in line with local care pathways.</p>

<h4>Measuring weight</h4>

<p>The following actions should be taken when measuring a child’s weight:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ask the child to remove their shoes and coat – they should be weighed in normal light, indoor clothing</li>
  <li>ask the child to stand still with both feet in the centre of the scales, record the weight in kilograms to the first decimal place, that is the nearest 0.1kg (for example 20.6kg) using the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system. Measurements to 2 decimal places are also acceptable</li>
  <li>measurements should not be rounded to the nearest whole or half kilogram</li>
</ul>

<h3>Measuring height</h3>

<p>The following actions should be taken when measuring a child’s height:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ask the child to remove their shoes and any heavy outdoor clothing that might interfere with taking an accurate height measurement</li>
  <li>ask the child to stand on the height measure with their feet flat on the floor, heels together and touching the base of the vertical measuring column – the child’s arms should be relaxed, and their bottom and shoulders should touch the vertical measuring column</li>
  <li>to obtain the most reproducible measurement, the child’s head should be positioned so that the Frankfurt Plane is horizontal (see figure 1), and the measuring arm of the height measure should be lowered gently but firmly onto the head, flattening the hair before the measurer positions the child’s head in the Frankfurt Plane</li>
  <li>where a hairstyle does not allow for an accurate measurement, a respectful request to change the hairstyle is recommended – if this is not possible, an attempt to record the most accurate measurement within the circumstances, and to make a note of this is advised</li>
  <li>ideally, one practitioner will ensure that the child maintains the correct position while the other reads the measurement</li>
  <li>record the height in centimetres to the first decimal place, that is the nearest 0.1cm (for example 120.4cm) using the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system</li>
  <li>measurements should not be rounded to the nearest whole or half centimetre</li>
  <li>whenever possible, measurements should be repeated to ensure accuracy</li>
</ul>

<h4>Figure 1: The Frankfurt Plane</h4>

<p>The figure shows a child standing on the height measure with their feet flat on the floor, heels together and touching the base of the vertical measuring column. The child’s arms are relaxed by their side, and their bottom and shoulders are touching the vertical measuring column.</p>

<p>A broken line drawn on the figure shows where the Frankfurt Plane is. The Frankfurt plane is an imaginary horizontal line that passes through the inferior margin of the left orbit and the upper margin of the ear canal. This means that the ear hole should be aligned with the bottom of the eye socket. This position will allow the crown of the head to raise the measuring arm of the height measure to the child’s true height.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Figure 1 showing the Frankfurt Plane." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/156155/figure-1-frankfurt-plane-960x640.jpg"></div></figure>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> Doing the measurements: checklist</h3>

<p>You can use this checklist as a prompt to ensure you have completed all critical tasks before you start the measurements.</p>

<ul>
  <li>decide on your preferred method for recording results (either the online browser-based system or the offline Excel spreadsheet)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are using the online browser-based system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure you will have internet access at the point of measurement</li>
  <li>if you plan to use a school’s wireless network connection or operate over a 3G or 4G network then you should check that the room in which you will carry out the exercise has adequate network coverage</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are using the Excel spreadsheet, before you visit the school:</p>

<ul>
  <li>download the pupil details for your visit to the spreadsheet</li>
  <li>ensure that the laptop used to hold the spreadsheet is encrypted and password protected</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are using paper-based records (not recommended and only as a last resort):</p>

<ul>
  <li>pre-print the records for the pupils for your visit</li>
  <li>ensure these records are stored securely at all times</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure that a private room or screened-off area is available within the school for the measurements</li>
  <li>arrange equipment in the measurement area so that the results cannot be seen by anyone apart from the person recording the measurements</li>
  <li>follow the protocol set out in this chapter when measuring children and recording the results</li>
  <li>use professional judgement to decide whether to measure children with growth disorders or medical conditions, such as cerebral palsy, a leg in plaster or a prosthetic leg</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> After the measurements: result letters and proactive follow-up</h2>

<p>This chapter sets out how children’s results should be shared with parents and what proactive follow-up should be offered following the measurements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Feedback of results to parents</h3>

<p>While it is not a mandated component of the programme, local authorities will want to consider if and how they share information with parents that could promote and improve a child’s health. Research shows that 87% of parents find the feedback helpful, and nearly 75% reported an intention to make positive lifestyle changes following <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> feedback.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup> Experience from parents, local <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> teams and behavioural insights work strongly suggests that any information given to parents should be done positively and sensitively, avoiding stigmatising terms such as obese, fat and morbidly obese. Under no circumstances should the results information be given directly to a child as it is a matter for the parent to decide if and how such information will be shared.</p>

<p>Children who fall on extreme <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centiles, that is on or below the 0.4th centile, or on or above the 99.6th centile (table 1) are likely to require specialist healthcare support. For this reason, we recommend that as a minimum duty of care, children who fall on extreme <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centiles are proactively followed up to ensure they are offered appropriate support and care. Refer to ‘Proactive follow-up’ section later in this chapter.</p>

<p>It is recommended that the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system is used which starts with an editable <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-child-measurement-programme-operational-guidance">result letter to parents</a>, and generates a bespoke letter for each child measured.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system uses the British 1990 child growth reference (UK90) to assign each child a <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centile taking into account their height, weight, sex and age. Clinical <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centile thresholds are used for the purposes of individual assessment to place each child in 1 of 4 weight categories (table 1). This is automatically generated in the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> parent result letter template.</p>

<p>This is the approach recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (<abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr>)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:29" rel="footnote">[footnote 29]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:30" rel="footnote">[footnote 30]</a></sup> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/resources/growth-charts" rel="external">Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (<abbr title="Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health">RCPCH</abbr>) clinical guidelines</a> both include information on follow up of children above the 91st and 98th centiles that should be considered by local areas.</p>

<p>Despite factors such as fitness, ethnic origin and puberty which can alter the relation between <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> and body fatness, <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> and <abbr title="Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health">RCPCH</abbr> recommend that <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> (adjusted for age and sex) be used as a practical estimate of adiposity (measure of fatty tissue) in children and young people. There is currently no other practical and non-invasive method for determining a more accurate measure of body fat in children. Comparison of a child’s height and weight centile to assess whether they are overweight or very overweight is not reliable, and this method should not be used. Children should be assessed using age-specific and sex- specific <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centiles as described above. The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system automatically classifies children using the recommended approach. Copies of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/resources/body-mass-index-bmi-chart" rel="external">growth charts</a> along with education and training resources are available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/resources/growth-charts" rel="external"><abbr title="Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health">RCPCH</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>A child’s height centile can be useful in addition to the <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centile, as it can provide an indication of the cause of a child’s obesity. If an obese child is tall, the obesity is likely to be nutritional in origin, whereas if the child is short, an endocrine or genetic cause should be considered.</p>

<span class="number">5.2 </span> Children falling on <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centile thresholds</h3>

<p><abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centile has defined thresholds for determining the results. For a small number of children, falling right on the thresholds of the <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> categories, rounding of <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centiles to whole numbers may result in children with the same <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> clinical classification (z- score) being assigned to different <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centile (p-score) classifications. For this reason, we do not recommend that <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centile numbers (p-score) are included in the result letters for parents, and instead, only their weight category (see table 2) should be used (as is done automatically for the national parent result letter template).</p>

<p>Further information about this is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/assets/website-assets/services/national-childhood-measurement-programme/frequently-asked-questions.pdf" rel="external">NHS Digital <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> FAQs</a></p>

<p>When talking to parents whose children fall close to the thresholds of weight categories, practitioners should consider explaining this to the parent, and highlighting that a subsequent measurement in a few months’ time may be helpful in checking whether the child is moving towards a healthy weight category. Parents may be signposted to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/bmi-calculator/" rel="external">NHS <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> Healthy Weight Calculator</a> to monitor their child’s weight status.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span> Children identified at extreme <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centiles</h3>

<p>Children identified on or above the 99.6th centile are classified as severely obese. The immediate and long term cardiovascular, metabolic and other health consequences of severe paediatric obesity are likely to require specialist treatment.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:32" rel="footnote">[footnote 32]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:33" rel="footnote">[footnote 33]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:34" rel="footnote">[footnote 34]</a></sup> Children on or below the 0.4th centile may indicate under-nutrition. They are likely to have additional problems and should be referred for further assessment and support.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:35" rel="footnote">[footnote 35]</a></sup> We recommend that local authorities have a duty of care to provide proactive follow up to those children identified at extreme <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centiles (‘Proactive follow up’ section in this chapter).</p>

<p>The national parent result letter template will continue to automatically classify all children:</p>

<ul>
  <li>who fall on or above the 99.6th centile as very overweight</li>
  <li>who fall on or below the 0.4th centile as underweight</li>
</ul>

<p>See table 1 and section below ‘Producing the result letters’ for further guidance.</p>

<p>Children with extreme <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centiles (on or above the 99.6th centile and on or below the 0.4th centile) will have a flag automatically added to their record on the pupil grid under ‘Clinical Category (Centile)’ in the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system. This will allow immediate identification of children measuring at extreme <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centiles when their data is added to the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system. It is also possible to identify children with extreme <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centiles by looking at the ‘<abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> Centile (p-score)’ column in the ‘Combined’ data extract. For further information and guidance on extreme <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centiles in the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system, refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-child-measurement-programme/it-system" rel="external"><abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT System user guide 3: Pupil Data Management</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span> Producing result letters</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system should be used to generate result letters for parents using the editable parent result letter template. Further details available from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-child-measurement-programme/it-system" rel="external">NHS Digital IT System User Guide part 4: Generating Feedback Letters</a></p>

<p>The letters have been developed taking into account feedback from child health and behavioural insights experts, <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> practitioners and parents. They are editable so the content can be amended to meet the needs of local areas.</p>

<p>When editing the national template letters, or developing local letters, it is important to consider that parents receiving the letters may be sensitive to the information and feel their parenting skills are being criticised. As such, and as far as possible, the letters should be non-judgemental and positively phrased. Experience from parents, local <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> teams and behavioural insights work strongly suggests that any information given to parents should be done positively and sensitively, avoiding stigmatising terms such as obese, fat and morbidly obese.</p>

<p>While there are 6 clinical <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centile categories outlined in table 2, only 4 weight status categories are automatically generated in the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> parent result letter template: healthy weight, underweight, overweight and very overweight. We strongly advise these same 4 categories are used if developing local letters.</p>

<p>When producing the letters, a child’s NHS number should be included.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of local areas to check at least 1 out of every 10 letters printed against the information entered into the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system to ensure the information has come through as expected, for example, checking that the child’s weight, height and assigned weight status category are correct, and the correct date of birth and address are shown.</p>

<p>It is best practice to post result letters to parents and carers, particularly for year 6 pupils, rather than using pupil post. This is to mitigate the risk of the letters getting into the hands of children’s peers, leading to comparisons of results and potential bullying. Sending results by electronic means should also be considered where this meets local electronic communication and information governance guidelines as a means of achieving a paperless approach to the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>.</p>

<p>To ensure the result letters are meaningful, they should be sent to parents and carers as soon as possible and within 6 weeks after the measurements.</p>

<p>As with other health information being sent to a child’s parents, the national <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> parent result letter template are addressed to ‘the parent or carer of [child name]’. This is because it is unlikely that the name of the parent or carer will be known, and it is at parents’ discretion as to whether they share the results with their child.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span> Resources and contacts for parents</h3>

<p>A weblink directing parents to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/healthier-families/childrens-weight/" rel="external">Better Health Families – Children’s weight</a> page is included in the parent result letter template, providing additional support and information relevant to a child’s weight status.</p>

<p>It is recommended that the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://campaignresources.phe.gov.uk/resources/campaigns/17/resources/63" rel="external">Post-measurement leaflet for parents: top tips to keep your family healthy and happy</a> is enclosed with result letters to parents. This provides relevant Better Health Families messaging and signposts to the NHS.UK Better Health Families website for further information. This leaflet can be ordered or downloaded from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://campaignresources.phe.gov.uk/resources/campaigns/17-change4life" rel="external"><abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> campaign resource centre</a>.</p>

<p>For underweight children, some areas choose to enclose locally developed information more specific to underweight children. It is advisable to check local care-pathways and referral routes with providers and/or clinical teams for advice and onward assessment if required. Further information and tips for parents of underweight children are available on the NHS.UK Children’s weight webpages.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:36" rel="footnote">[footnote 36]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:37" rel="footnote">[footnote 37]</a></sup> These weblinks are also available in the link to the Better Health Families – Children’s weight page included in the national specimen result letter to parents of underweight children.</p>

<p>Local authorities may also want to consider including the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/physical-activity-guidelines-infographics">Chief Medical Officers’ physical activity infographics</a><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:38" rel="footnote">[footnote 38]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:39" rel="footnote">[footnote 39]</a></sup> in the information sent to parents.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span> Proactive follow-up</h3>

<p>In addition to sending result letters to parents, many areas proactively follow up children identified as underweight, overweight, or very overweight. We recommend, as a minimum, that local authorities have a duty of care to provide proactive follow up to children who fall on extreme <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centiles: on or below the 0.4th centile, and on or above the 99.6th centile. Proactive follow-up involves contacting the parents of those children to offer them personalised advice, an opportunity for a follow-up measurement (particularly for children identified on or below the 0.4th centile) and services to support them to help their child achieve a healthier weight.</p>

<p>Evaluation of <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> feedback has shown that proactive follow-up can help to increase parental recognition of their child’s weight status in parents of overweight and very overweight children. Improving parental acceptance of the result may assist in minimising resistance to feedback, support understanding of the impact of an unhealthy weight, and encourage access to and uptake of services.</p>

<p>Prior to making feedback calls it is recommended that the local authority and <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> provider consider the following points and recommendations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify the range of tier 1 and tier 2 child weight management services available and determine if it is adequate to provide support to children, parents and families who will be contacted – it is not helpful to contact parents to discuss their child’s weight status if no further support or services can be offered</li>
  <li>decide which groups of parents are going to be contacted, for example:
    <ul>
      <li>parents of all children falling outside the healthy <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centile range</li>
      <li>parents of children on or over the 98th centile, or on or under the 2nd centile</li>
      <li>only those parents whose children are at the extreme ends of the <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> range</li>
      <li>a specific year group – reception or year 6</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If staff resource is limited targeting high risk (often the most deprived) areas with the highest overweight and obesity prevalence rates is advisable. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/child-obesity-and-excess-weight-small-area-level-data-june-2021-update">Small area level data</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/national-child-measurement-programme" rel="external"><abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> and Child Obesity Profile</a> can be used to help identify areas and determine the actual number of children falling into the different categories to ensure the best use of staff time.</p>

<p>It is recommended that all children on or below the 0.4th centile are followed up as this may be an indication of undernutrition. Following a discussion with the parent, a repeat measurement should be offered and carried out by a school nurse or other appropriate health care professional. It is advisable to check local care-pathways and referral routes as onward referral to a GP, paediatrician or dietitian may be required. Ensure the emotional wellbeing of the child is considered if carrying out additional measurements or referring onwards.</p>

<p>Refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/resources/uk-who-growth-charts-childhood-puberty-close-monitoring-cpcm-chart" rel="external"><abbr title="Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health">RCPCH</abbr> childhood and puberty close monitoring charts</a> for further information.</p>

<p>It is also recommended that all children on or above the 99.6th centile are followed up. These children are more likely to be suffering from health and wellbeing problems as a result of their weight and may require specialist support.</p>

<p>Following a discussion with the parent, and ensuring that both the emotional and physical wellbeing of the child is considered, an onward referral to a child’s GP, paediatrician, dietitian or specialist tier 3 paediatric weight management service may be required. It is advisable to check local care pathways and referral routes.</p>

<p>Check that a parental telephone number (and email) was collected as part of the class list information, or whether it is available on the local child health information system. If not available through these methods, the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> provider will need to contact the relevant schools once the target cohort is identified to gather this information.</p>

<p>The local authority and <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> provider need to establish how many contact attempts will be made by phone or follow up with a letter via post or email, for example, up to 3. The method of recording the outcomes of the call and contact attempts also needs to be established to enable effectiveness of the intervention to be assessed. For example, using a log to capture the outcome of a discussion with a parent such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>agreed to be referred to local child weight management services depending on availability</li>
  <li>agreed to receiving further information about healthy lifestyles</li>
  <li>no information or referral required</li>
  <li>not an appropriate time for the child or parent to take action</li>
  <li>contact not able to be made after agreed number of attempts</li>
</ul>

<p>A useful overall performance indicator for childhood obesity is to monitor if there is an increase in the uptake of local child weight management services. For more information please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/child-weight-management-commission-and-provide-services">Guidance on delivering and commissioning tier 2 weight management services for children and their families</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/kpis-tier-2-weight-management-services-for-children">Key Performance Indicators: tier 2 weight management services for children and their families</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.7 </span> Supportive conversations with parents</h3>

<p>When local practitioners are speaking to parents about the results, a supportive, motivational approach should be used with an awareness of the sensitivities surrounding the subject. Otherwise, parents may feel judged, stigmatised and that their parenting skills are being criticised.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> provider organisations are in a unique position to deliver brief interventions with children and families through Make every contact count (<abbr title="make every contact count">MECC</abbr>).<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:40" rel="footnote">[footnote 40]</a></sup> Research shows that brief interventions can help individuals decide to change their health behaviours. <abbr title="make every contact count">MECC</abbr> training as part of continual professional development, such as motivational interviewing techniques, can equip staff to both recognise the opportunities as well as facilitate healthy conversations with parents. Additionally, <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> have developed a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/child-weight-management-short-conversations-with-patients">step-by-step guide to conversations about weight management</a> with children and families for health and care professionals.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:41" rel="footnote">[footnote 41]</a></sup></p>

<span class="number">5.8 </span> After the measurements: checklist</h3>

<p>This checklist can be used as a prompt to ensure that all the critical tasks are complete before the result letters have been sent:</p>

<ul>
  <li>access the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system and download the editable national parent result letter template, making amendments as required</li>
  <li>make arrangements to send result letters to parents within 6 weeks of the measurements</li>
  <li>make provision to deliver proactive follow-up to locally agreed cohort (this can be done before result letters are sent to the parent).</li>
  <li>provide individual feedback and advice to parents based on the British 1990 <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> growth reference (UK90) clinical thresholds as automated through the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system</li>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Data upload and validation</h2>

<p>This chapter sets out how the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data should be submitted to NHS Digital.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> Submitting your data to NHS Digital</h3>

<p>Once the mandatory and supplementary data has been collected and validated using the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system, data must be finalised by the local authorities <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> leads by the August deadline. NHS Digital will advise a specific date for final data submission each year. Further details available from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-child-measurement-programme/it-system" rel="external"><abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT System User Guide part 6: Data submission</a></p>

<p>It is recommended to regularly upload data at a minimum of at least once a term when data is being collected. This will identify potential data quality issues and reduce the risk of data submission being delayed.</p>

<p>Before finalising the data all records with validation warnings must be checked and either amended (if data is incorrect) or confirmed. It is not possible to finalise the dataset if there are unconfirmed warnings. The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system data quality indicators should also be checked.</p>

<p>Further details available from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-child-measurement-programme/it-system" rel="external"><abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT System User Guide part 5: Progress and Data Quality Monitoring</a></p>

<p>After the deadline date, NHS Digital undertakes additional data validation. If deemed necessary, NHS Digital may contact the local authority to address any validation anomalies. These are likely to be minimal due to the enhanced validation incorporated prior to this.</p>

<p>Information about the validation process is available from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/assets/website-assets/services/national-childhood-measurement-programme/ncmp-validation-principle-and-rules.pdf" rel="external">Validation of <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data</a> on the ‘related information’ links section on the NHS Digital website.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span> Data quality thresholds</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data holds UK National Statistics status. This means that it is an official statistic that meets the highest standards of trustworthiness, quality and public value. <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> and NHS Digital are always striving to improve the quality of the data. The quality and completeness of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data set has improved considerably since the onset of the programme in 2006 to 2007. To continually improve the robustness of the data, 2 of the data quality thresholds were changed in 2019 to 2020 – whole and half measurements for weight and height and ethnicity.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span> Weight and height measurements</h3>

<p>Measurements should not be rounded to the nearest whole or half kilogram or whole or half a centimetre. There is a data quality measure built into the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system to look at the number of whole and half measurements. Statistically, it is expected that about 10% of records will be whole numbers and 10% of records will be half numbers.</p>

<p>The proportion of records where the recorded height is exactly a centimetre or half a centimetre should not exceed 20%. The same check is carried out for weight in terms of a kilogram. Local authorities who do not meet the thresholds are shown in the data quality table published as part of the annual report by NHS Digital. It is advisable to monitor the data quality indicators for smaller groups of schools in real time in the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system. This will help identify data quality issues on a smaller scale closer to the time of measurement. For more information, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-child-measurement-programme/it-system" rel="external">NHS Digital IT System User Guidance: DQ Monitoring by groups of schools</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span> Ethnicity</h3>

<p>Ethnicity is not a mandatory field in the data collection, however the number of local authorities that do collect it has improved over the years. Local authorities are strongly encouraged to provide this data item because it is an important variable allowing analysis of health inequalities in child obesity. The proportion of records with a missing ethnicity code is shown in the data quality table published as part of the annual report by NHS Digital.</p>

<p>The data quality threshold of records without an ethnicity code should not exceed 15%. NHS Digital and <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> will support local authorities to improve this data item.</p>

<p>Further details about data quality thresholds are available from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-child-measurement-programme/it-system" rel="external">NHS Digital IT System User Guide part 5: Progress and data quality monitoring</a>.</p>

<p>As part of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>, NHS Digital publishes an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/national-child-measurement-programme" rel="external">annual report</a> summarising key findings, including participation rates and prevalence trends. This report provides aggregated results, which are presented in accordance with the NHS anonymisation standard so that no individual child can be identified from the findings.</p>

<p>NHS Digital securely provides <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> with a copy of the national data set, which has been anonymised in accordance with the Information Commissioner’s Office Anonymisation Code of Practice. This enables <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> to undertake additional analysis of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data and produce information tools and resources to support the wider use of the data locally. The data shared with <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> does not contain any information such as names or dates of birth and is provided under a data sharing agreement to protect the confidentiality of the children.</p>

<p>Organisations such as academic institutions may submit a request to NHS Digital for access to extracts of <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data that have not been made completely non-disclosive for research purposes. These could be provided under a data sharing contract and agreement to control the small risk of children being re-identified. Any requests for data extracts such as this are considered on a case-by-case basis by the Independent Group <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/about-nhs-digital/corporate-information-and-documents/independent-group-advising-on-the-release-of-data" rel="external">Advising on the Release of Data (IGARD)</a><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:42" rel="footnote">[footnote 42]</a></sup> and applications can be made through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/data-access-request-service-dars" rel="external">Data Access Request Service (DARS)</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span> Use of data at a local level</h3>

<h4>Managing and protecting data locally</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> Regulations allows for local authorities and those acting on their behalf to process <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data for the purposes of research, monitoring, audit, the planning of services, or for other public health purposes. Local authorities may also provide the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data to others, such as researchers, provided it is disclosed in a form in which no child can be identified. Local authorities are responsible for ensuring that appropriate processes are in place to manage any such data sharing but it is recommended that they refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-%20organisations/documents/1061/anonymisation-code.pdf" rel="external">Information Commissioner’s Office anonymisation code of practice</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions" rel="external">NHS anonymisation standard</a>.</p>

<p>The legislation relating to the programme also allows for <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> records to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provided to children’s parents, together with advisory material relating to the weight of children, and for the advice and support available to parents to help promote and assist improvements to their child’s health</li>
  <li>disclosed by the local authority to a health professional that is able to provide the advice and support to parents with the aim of promoting and assisting improvement of the child’s health and to offer any related treatment to the child</li>
</ul>

<p>This could be, for example, the child’s GP or a family weight management service. Where this is done, it is essential that information about the data sharing is included in the pre-measurement letter to parents and a weblink included providing information about how a local authority or <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> provider collect, use and share information.</p>

<p>A local data sharing agreement should be in place between the local authority and the parties with whom the data is being shared to ensure it is shared securely.</p>

<p>As personal information such as children’s names, dates of birth and school numbers are collected as part of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>, local authorities must ensure that processes are in place to protect confidentiality and comply with data protection legislation and the requirements of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/looking-after-information/data-security-and-information-governance/data-security-and-protection-toolkit" rel="external">Data Security and Protection Toolkit</a>.</p>

<p>Local authorities must ensure that appropriate controls are in place to securely store the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data, as well as manage who can access it and for what purposes.</p>

<p>Shared mail boxes for the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system should be avoided. Accounts should be for the sole use of an individual and passwords not shared to comply with information governance requirements and to show an effective audit trail.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/information-governance/guidance/records-management-code/records-management-code-of-practice-2021/" rel="external">NHSX Information Governance guidance on records management</a><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:43" rel="footnote">[footnote 43]</a></sup> provides guidance for the minimum retention period for the Child Health Record. Local authorities are advised to ensure their records retention schedule and disposal schedule is updated to include policy for the management of child health records.</p>

<p>Where local authorities employ a third party to manage or analyse the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data on their behalf, a contract must be in place to ensure that this data processor complies with the requirements of data protection legislation. Local authorities are advised to ensure that any provider has achieved satisfactory compliance with the IG Toolkit or another appropriate standard.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span> Local data analysis</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-child-measurement-programme-data-sharing-and-analysis"><abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>: Guidance for data sharing and analysis</a> is useful for local authorities and other organisations who want to analyse the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data.</p>

<p>Each year, following the completion of validation, local authorities can obtain their final validated <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data by extracting it from the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system. Note that the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system is not a data storage facility so the data must be extracted before it is deleted early in the following calendar year. NHS Digital will give notice to local authorities before deleting the data.</p>

<p>Local authorities can use this local analysis to support their joint strategic needs assessment, health and wellbeing strategies and the director of public health’s annual report. Care must be taken to ensure that no data is published as part of this which could identify any individual children.</p>

<p>Local authorities may wish to use the data to evaluate the delivery of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> locally. This is permissible under the Local Authority Regulations and data protection legislation as long as such data use is set out in the pre-measurement letter to parents. For data security and auditing purposes, only <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> leads are able to extract their local authority’s dataset.</p>

<p>Local authorities are advised to familiarise themselves with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/phe-data-and-analysis-tools#obesity-diet-and-physical-activity"><abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data published by <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr></a> before undertaking any local analysis. Local authority level data on underweight, healthy weight, overweight, obesity and severe obesity can be found and compared with other similar local authorities using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/national-child-measurement-programme" rel="external"><abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> and Child Obesity Profile tool</a>. Trend data from the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> shows child obesity, overweight, excess weight, severe obesity and underweight prevalence over time. Electoral Ward, Clinical Commissioning Group (<abbr title="Clinical Commissioning Group">CCG</abbr>) and <abbr title="middle super output area">MSOA</abbr> level data is available, and this may prevent duplication of analysis. See appendix 1 – Data analysis and sharing <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data, for more details.</p>

<p>Changes in the weight status of children between the first and final years of primary school were examined, using data from a small sample of 4 local authorities. A model has been developed by <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> as part of this report, to be used by local authorities to predict weight status in year 6 children (see appendix 1).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span> Population analysis</h3>

<p>When measuring a population of children (for example reporting <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> findings at national or local authority levels) weight status is defined using UK90 <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> population cut-offs, which differ from the UK90 <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> clinical cut-offs shown in table 1 (see chapter 5). Population cut-offs are slightly lower than the clinical cut-offs to capture those children already underweight, overweight or obese and those at risk of becoming underweight, overweight or obesity (such as, those children who may be on the borderline of the clinical definition). This helps ensure that adequate services are planned and delivered. For additional information on the <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> centile classifications used for population monitoring, and how to use these for analysis or research purposes, refer to <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-child-measurement-programme-data-sharing-and-analysis"><abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>: Guidance for data sharing and analysis</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.5 </span> Providing results to schools</h3>

<p>The legislation relating to the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> does not make provision for an individual child’s result to be given directly to schools.</p>

<p>Non-identifiable information should be shared with schools to help engage them in promoting healthy weight in the school setting.</p>

<p>Each year, <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> makes available individual <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-child-measurement-programme-school-feedback-letter"><abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> school feedback letters</a> to local authorities for onward forwarding to schools. The letters include non-identifiable aggregated <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data relating to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>school and England participation rates</li>
  <li>school, local authority and England obesity and excess weight prevalence rates</li>
</ul>

<p>An editable template <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-child-measurement-programme-school-feedback-letter">cover letter</a>, which should be sent with the school feedback letters, is also made available. It is recommended that local authorities add their logo to the cover letter and signpost to local sources of healthy weight information and support.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> contacts local authorities annually with instructions on how to access and download the letters. <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> will request a named contact from each local authority who will be given access to the letters via SharePoint.</p>

<p>Local authorities can request the production of school cluster letters that present combined data for 2 or more schools. This is useful for schools who receive no data due to suppression, or for local authorities that wish to receive data for groups of schools. For example, for those that will feed into their secondary schools or for federations which may have joint whole school approaches to the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> and child health and wellbeing. Email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ncmp@dhsc.gov.uk">ncmp@dhsc.gov.uk</a> for further information.</p>

<h4>Research</h4>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/differences-in-child-obesity-by-ethnic-group">Differences in child obesity by ethnic group</a>: published in January 2019, the results of this research showed that ethnicity has an independent effect on obesity prevalence in both year 6 and reception boys and girls.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/21/what-does-our-first-national-childhood-measurement-programme-tracking-report-tell-us/" rel="external">Changes in the weight status of children between the first and final years of primary school</a>: this report published by Public Health England in 2017 examines how weight status tracks in individual children during primary school using the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data from 4 local authorities. Local authorities can use the model developed as part of this report to predict weight status in year 6 children.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk/pgfar/pgfar08030#/scientific-summary" rel="external">Improving the assessment and management of obesity in UK children and adolescents: the PROMISE research programme</a>: this research by the National Institute of Health Research included ‘Study A: impact of the National Child Measurement Programme.’ Published in 2020. Research explored the impact of <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> feedback on parental perceptions of their child’s weight and health, and health-related behaviours:</p>

<ul>
  <li>most parents (87%) found <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> feedback to be helpful – more than one-fifth of parents of overweight children reported feeling upset, but only 1.8% of parents stated that they would withdraw their child from the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> in the future</li>
  <li>feedback has a positive effect on parental perceptions and intentions to make lifestyle changes and is acceptable to most parents – however, intentions do not necessarily translate into behaviour change</li>

<h4>Planning the measurements: checklist</h4>

<ul>
  <li>plan to raise awareness and understanding of the programme with elected members, other local authority colleagues, primary care professionals, head teachers and school governors, parents and children</li>
  <li>engage with local authority education officers, or directly with schools to arrange for class lists to be provided.</li>
  <li>liaise and engage with schools to gain their support in delivering the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> and to agree dates for measurement and book an appropriate room</li>
  <li>send the pre-measurement letter to parents at least 2 weeks before measurements take place ensuring that any necessary local amendments have been made</li>
  <li>liaise with schools to collate any children that have been withdrawn and identify other children for whom it may not be appropriate to participate</li>
  <li>identify staff with the necessary mix of clinical, administrative and data skills to deliver the programme</li>
  <li>provide staff with the necessary training and support to ensure they are competent to complete the measurements, and record and upload the data</li>
  <li>ensure all staff involved in the weighing and measuring have an Enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service check</li>
  <li>have appropriate and calibrated scales</li>
  <li>consider making alternative arrangements for children who cannot take part in the programme due to physical disabilities or for medical reasons</li>
  <li>send electronic copies of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://campaignresources.phe.gov.uk/resources/campaigns/17/resources/2286" rel="external">pre-measurement leaflet for parents: School height and weight measurements</a>, or alternatively download the leaflet for local printing when sending the pre-measurement letters</li>
</ul>

<h4>Doing the measurements: checklist</h4>

<ul>
  <li>decide on your preferred method for recording results (either the online browser-based system or the offline Excel spreadsheet)</li>
  <li>if you are using the online browser-based system:
    <ul>
      <li>ensure you will have internet access at the point of measurement</li>
      <li>if you plan to use a school’s wireless network connection or operate over a 3G or 4G network then you should check that the room in which you will carry out the exercise has adequate network coverage</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>if you are using the Excel spreadsheet, before you visit the school:
    <ul>
      <li>download the pupil details for your visit to the spreadsheet</li>
      <li>ensure that the laptop used to hold the spreadsheet is encrypted and password protected</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ensure that a private room or screened-off area is available within the school for the measurements</li>
  <li>arrange equipment in the measurement area so that the results cannot be seen by anyone apart from the person recording the measurements</li>
  <li>follow the protocol set out in chapter 4 when measuring children and recording the results</li>
  <li>use professional judgement to decide whether to measure children with growth disorders or medical conditions, such as cerebral palsy, a leg in plaster or a prosthetic leg</li>
</ul>

<h4>After the measurements: checklist</h4>

<ul>
  <li>access the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system and download the editable national template result letters, making amendments as required</li>
  <li>send result letters to parents within 6 weeks of the measurements</li>
  <li>make provision to deliver proactive follow-up to locally agreed cohort (this can be done before result letters are sent to the parent)</li>
  <li>provide individual feedback and advice to parents based on the British 1990 <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> growth reference (UK90) clinical thresholds as automatically done through the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system</li>
</ul>

<h4>Data use at a local level: checklist</h4>

<ul>
  <li>extract the data from the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> IT system before it is deleted</li>
  <li>make provision for the data to be held and released in a way that complies with the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> Regulations and for information to be given to parents about how the data will be used</li>
  <li>send the school feedback letter, along with the editable cover letter to schools</li>
  <li>draw on aggregated local <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> analysis to inform joint strategic needs assessments</li>
</ul>

<h3>Appendix 3: the lawful basis for processing <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data under the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018</h3>

<h4>
<abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> Regulations</h4>

<p>All local authorities in England are required to collect information on the height and weight of reception and year 6 school children.</p>

<p>The statutory authority for processing <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data is provided by the Local Authorities (Public Health Functions and Entry to Premises by Local Healthwatch Representatives) Regulations 2013<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup> and the Local Authority (Public Health, Health and Wellbeing Boards and Health Scrutiny) Regulations 2013<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup>.</p>

<h4>The General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) and Data Protection Act 201820 (<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018)</h4>

<p>The statutory authority for the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> means that the lawful basis for processing this data is considered to be provided by the following Articles of the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Article 6(1)(c): processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject</li>
  <li>Article 6(1)(e): processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller</li>
  <li>Article 9(2)(h): processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or treatment or the management of health or social care systems and services</li>
  <li>Article 9(2)(i): processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, such as protecting against serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high standards of quality and safety of health care and of medicinal products or medical devices, on the basis of Union or Member State law which provides for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject, in particular professional secrecy</li>
</ul>

<p>Although there are 4 possible legal bases under articles 6 and 9, articles 6(1)(c) and 9(2)(h) are considered to be the most appropriate bases for the processing of <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data.</p>

<p>No change is needed to the ways in which children’s personal information is used and shared for the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data collection to be lawful under the <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018.</p>
