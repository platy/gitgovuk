<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Executive summary</h2>

<p>The National Child Measurement Programme (<abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>), also known as the School Height and Weight Checks, is a mandated annual programme delivered by local authorities, which involves measuring the height and weight of all school children in reception and year 6. Over 99% (17,000) of eligible state-maintained schools across England, including academies, usually participate in the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Support from schools is crucial to delivering the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>. This guidance provides information for school leaders, staff and governing bodies on key tasks that schools can help with to ensure the programme runs smoothly.</p>

<p>Delivering the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> provides vital information that enables local authorities and their partners to plan for and invest in key services to tackle obesity and its wider determinants. It also provides the opportunity to raise parents’ awareness of overweight and obesity, its consequences and healthy lifestyle choices.</p>

<p>Although most children in reception and year 6 are a healthy weight, the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> consistently shows that prevalence of obesity doubles between reception year and year 6 (from around 10% to around 20%). More than 1 in 4 children aged 4 to 5 years and 4 in 10 aged 10 to 11 years are overweight or obese (27.7% and 40.9% respectively). The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/national-child-measurement-programme" rel="external">2020 to 2021 <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> annual report</a> showed large increases in the proportions of children living with overweight (including obesity), obesity, and severe obesity compared to previous years of around 4.5 percentage points. These increases in child obesity and severe obesity prevalence in 2020 to 2021 follow the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in school closures and other public health measures. More data is needed to know whether this is a long-term increase.</p>

<p>There are significant inequalities in terms of very overweight prevalence in children from the most deprived compared with least deprived areas, and between different children from different ethnic groups.</p>

<p>The term ‘very overweight’ refers to the clinical weight status ‘obese’. While the use of the word obese is a clinical classification, the sensitivity and stigma around using this term is acknowledged. The Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (<abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>) encourages all conversations and correspondence with parents in relation to their child’s weight status to use the more acceptable term ‘very overweight’ instead. Children identified as very overweight are more likely to be ill, be absent from school due to illness, experience health-related limitations and require more medical care than children identified as a healthy weight. Very overweight children are also more likely to suffer from dental caries, type 2 diabetes, breathing difficulties and bone and joint problems and experience mental health problems such as depression, poor mental well-being, bullying and weight stigma. Additionally, children living with obesity are five times more likely to become adults living with obesity.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup></p>

<p>A child’s weight category affects their health and wellbeing. Growing healthily and maintaining a healthy weight is important not only for a child’s physical, social and mental wellbeing but also for their capacity to do well at school.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> From September 2020, health education is a statutory requirement for schools. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/relationships-education-relationships-and-sex-education-rse-and-health-education">Relationships and sex education (RSE) and health education</a> does not apply to independent schools, who must meet the Independent School Standards as set out in the Education (Independent School Standards) Regulations 2014. It does however, apply to academies and free schools. The new health education curriculum<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> can support schools with teaching pupils how to make good decisions about their own health and wellbeing – a statutory duty that Ofsted inspectors evaluate.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup></p>

<p>The wellbeing of children and families is very important. Measurements are conducted in a sensitive way, in private and away from other children. The weight and height information is shared with the parent or carer in a feedback letter, where letters are provided. No individual information is shared with the children themselves, teachers or the school. It is a parent’s choice if they share the information with their child. If a parent is concerned about their child’s growth, weight, body image or eating patterns, <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> feedback letters provide national and local information to support parents and advise on when to seek further support from a school nurse or General Practitioner.</p>

<p>Parents do react in different ways to receiving their child’s <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> feedback, so guidance is available to help school nursing teams and <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> delivery staff have supportive conversations with parents about the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> and their child’s health and growth. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-child-measurement-programme-conversation-framework"><abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> conversation framework for talking to parents</a>.</p>

<p>The emotional impact of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> has been researched. Studies show that body image, self-esteem, weight-related teasing and restrictive eating behaviours do not change as a result of being measured or receiving feedback. It was also found that most children (96%, 351 children) are indifferent or unconcerned about being weighed or measured. The small number of children (4%, 13 children) that disliked the process were mainly from year 6, children aged 10 to 11 years. This reinforces the need for sensitivity when weighing and measuring older children.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup></p>

<span class="number">2. </span> Overview of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>
</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Background</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>, also known as school height and weight checks, was established in 2006. Over 99% (approximately 17,000) of eligible state-maintained schools, including academies, participate in the programme. Over 1 million children in reception and year 6 usually have their height and weight measured in schools as part of the programme.</p>

<p>The Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (<abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>) has responsibility for the national oversight of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>. The surveillance components of the programme are a mandated public health function of local authorities. Local commissioners and providers have been advised to follow the government COVID-19 guidance required to help enable the safe delivery of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Data collected through the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> is returned to NHS Digital, where it is analysed. A report summarising local and national data is then published. Local areas use this high-quality data to inform the development and delivery of services to tackle child obesity. Nationally it is used to track trends in child obesity levels over time, to inform policy and is key to monitoring progress of the government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/childhood-obesity-a-plan-for-action-chapter-2">Childhood Obesity Plan chapter 2</a>.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/advancing-our-health-prevention-in-the-2020s/advancing-our-health-prevention-in-the-2020s-consultation-document">Advancing our health: prevention in the 2020s</a>,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup> (chapter 3 of the Childhood Obesity Plan) sets out how the programme can align with digital approaches to support families and health professionals. Tackling child and adult obesity is a renewed and strengthened priority for the government, as is shown in its recently published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tackling-obesity-government-strategy/tackling-obesity-empowering-adults-and-children-to-live-healthier-lives">tackling obesity strategy</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Weight status in primary school</h3>

<p>National data from the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> shows that the prevalence of children living with obesity doubles from around 10% of children at the start of primary school to around 20% at the end of primary school. Additionally, year-on-year, the data has shown that obesity prevalence in the most deprived 10% of areas in England is more than twice that in the least deprived 10%.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup> This gap in obesity prevalence by deprivation continues to widen for both reception and year 6, and for those children with severe obesity, this gap rises to more than 4 times for both year groups.</p>

<p>A small sample of 4 local authorities was analysed longitudinally to examine how weight status tracks between reception and year 6. The findings<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup> suggest that excess weight is likely to persist or worsen during primary school. Those children living in the most deprived areas and certain black and minority ethnic communities may be at higher risk of retaining or gaining an unhealthy weight. An infographic of the findings to show changes in the weight status category of children between the first and final years of primary school is shown in figure 1 below.</p>

<p>Figure 1: Key findings from the 2017 tracking study</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Figure 1 showing changes in the weight category of children between reception and year 6 from a small sample of 4 local authorities that were analysed longitudinally. " src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/156178/ncmp-teachers-guide-ficture1.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>This infographic shows changes in the weight category of children between reception and year 6 from a small sample of 4 local authorities that were analysed longitudinally:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>for children who were a healthy weight in reception (this is the vast majority: 83% of all children, n=28,092), most remained a healthy weight in year 6. Less than 10% of healthy weight reception children became obese (including severe obesity), and less than 2% became underweight by year 6</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for the 9% (n=3,128) of all children who were overweight in reception, approximately 30% remained overweight, while almost 30% became obese and a further 13% became severely obese. Around 27% of these children returned to a healthy weight</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for those children who were obese, but not severely obese (representing 3%, n=1,143 of all reception children), just over a third remained obese and around a third developed severe obesity by the time they reached year 6 – the percentage of obese reception children who become overweight or healthy weight were around 20% and 10%, respectively</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for the 3% (n=963) of children in this sample who were severely obese in reception, most remained severely obese with a further 29% of boys and 27% of girls becoming obese, and the remaining small proportion transitioned to overweight (under 10%) or healthy weight (under 5%)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Achieving a healthy weight is important</h3>

<p>When children are a healthy weight, they feel better about themselves. They find it easier to play and learn and they are more likely to grow up healthy too. Helping them to be a healthier weight when they are a child can set up their health and wellbeing for life.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Facts about childhood obesity</h3>

<p>Children who are overweight or very overweight are more likely to develop a variety of illnesses in childhood and later life, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, increased risk of type 2 diabetes (pre-diabetes), breathing difficulties, dental caries and bone and joint problems.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup>,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup> Health is not the only issue. Children living with obesity are also impacted by emotional and social issues such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>poorer emotional well-being</li>
  <li>being at a higher risk of depression</li>
  <li>developing an eating disorder in older children</li>
  <li>lower body image and self-esteem</li>
  <li>teasing or bullying</li>
  <li>behavioural problems</li>
  <li>avoidance of active play or learning opportunities in school sport and PE <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup>,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup>,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup>,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Children living with severe and persistent obesity are more compromised. It’s important to note that many children living with obesity are psychologically well, have high self-esteem and do not suffer major depression.</p>

<p>This can have an impact on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a child’s attendance, as they may need to miss school for medical appointments or treatment</li>
  <li>a child’s learning and academic achievement</li>
  <li>a child’s sleep – sleep deprived children are less likely to perform well academically</li>
  <li>staff training and expertise, because staff may need to provide extra support to children with health problems arising from overweight and obesity to ensure they manage their condition effectively during the school day</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> The importance of school participation</h3>

<p>Supporting the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> and embedding it in a whole school approach to health and wellbeing will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>support pupils to gain the knowledge and skills required for good health and wellbeing</li>
  <li>support the delivery of the new health education curriculum which became a statutory requirement in September 2020</li>
  <li>help schools to demonstrate to Ofsted that they are considering the health and wellbeing of their pupils and helping them know how to keep physically healthy</li>
</ul>

<p>Supporting the delivery of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> in your school ensures that vital information is available to help local authorities and their partners plan, target and deliver services to promote children’s healthy weight and growth – manage both underweight and excess weight (overweight and obesity) and in turn address the issues set out above.</p>

<p>Local authorities may also share individual height and weight measurements and calculated weight category with each child’s parent by sending a letter, typically via post from the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> provider directly to the parent. <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> have produced a template letter (also known as a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-child-measurement-programme-operational-guidance">specimen result letter to parents</a>) for local authorities which can be used and adapted locally. This letter contains links to the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nhs.uk/bmi" rel="external">NHS <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> healthy weight calculator</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/healthier-families/" rel="external">Better Health Families</a> website – both of which can support and encourage parents to monitor their child’s growth and to adopt healthier lifestyle behaviours. This is particularly important for parents and families who may need additional support to achieve and maintain a healthier weight due to the impact lockdown has had on healthy lifestyle behaviours.</p>

<p>Because many children in England are now carrying excess weight, parents and health professionals often cannot tell, just by looking at a child, whether he or she falls within a healthy weight range. This is why taking an objective measurement by trained health professionals through the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> and sharing that information with parents is important.</p>

<p>Information on the prevalence of school overweight and obesity, over a 3 year average, compared with local and national averages, can be shared with schools via a bespoke <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-child-measurement-programme-school-feedback-letter"><abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> School Feedback Letter</a>. Local authorities send these letters. The letter also includes details of resources to encourage whole school action to increase health and wellbeing, including healthy eating and increasing physical activity (see resources section). In conjunction with action taken by local authorities, this can make a real difference in preventing the continued increase of excess weight in children from reception to year 6, benefiting not only the health and wellbeing of pupils but also their learning and achievement in school.</p>

<h3>Healthy eating and food in schools</h3>

<p>Research on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/2020/12/02/final-report-published-on-the-impact-of-universal-infant-free-school-meals-policy" rel="external">impact of Universal Infant free school meals (UIFSM) policy in England</a> found evidence that by the end of the school year, those exposed to UIFSM have significantly better bodyweight outcomes than they otherwise would, and are more likely to be of a healthy weight, less likely to be obese, and have a lower <abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr>.</p>

<p>Government guidance on school food is designed to create a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-food-standards-resources-for-schools/creating-a-culture-and-ethos-of-healthy-eating">culture and ethos of healthy eating</a>. Ofsted’s Common Inspection Framework includes a judgment on personal development, behaviour and welfare. As part of reaching this judgment, inspectors will look at the extent to which schools are successfully supporting pupils to gain knowledge of how to keep themselves healthy and make informed choices about healthy eating and fitness. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-food-standards-resources-for-schools">school food standards</a> webpages offer practical guidance to help school leaders and governing bodies adopt a whole school approach to food.</p>

<h3>Physical activity in schools</h3>

<p>Public Health England (now <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>) previously published a resource for headteachers which brings together key guidance and policy documents on increasing physical activity in children and young people alongside local examples, called <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/what-works-in-schools-to-increase-physical-activity-briefing">‘What works in schools and colleges to increase levels of physical activity in children and young people’</a>. It has been produced to support schools and colleges in order to develop and implement practical, effective evidence-based approaches utilising 8 key principles as shown in figure 2.</p>

<p>Figure 2: Promising principles for practice from – ‘What works in schools and colleges to increase levels of physical activity in children and young people’.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Figure 2: Promising principles for practice from 'What works in schools and colleges to increase levels of physical activity in children and young people?'" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/156179/ncmp-teachers-guide-figure2.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>Figure 2 shows the 8 promising principles for practice from ‘What works in schools and colleges to increase levels of physical activity in children and young people’, presented in a circle diagram with ‘develop and deliver multi-component interventions’ at the centre. Radially around this core principle are the following 6 principles, arranged in a clockwise manner:</p>

<ol>
  <li>ensure skilled workforce</li>
  <li>engage student voice</li>
  <li>create active environments</li>
  <li>offer choice and variety</li>
  <li>embed in teaching and learning</li>
  <li>promote active travel</li>
</ol>

<p>The eighth principle ‘embed monitoring and evaluation’ is considered to be a cross-cutting principle that encompasses all the above principles.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> The role and responsibilities of local authorities</h2>

<p>Delivery of the programme, including the height and weight measurements and returning relevant data to NHS Digital, is a statutory function of local authorities set out in legislation. Local authorities, or the provider organisations they commission, will follow the process shown in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-child-measurement-programme-operational-guidance">Deliverable elements of <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> document</a> when implementing the programme and in doing so will be responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensuring that, either, a registered medical practitioner, registered nurse, for example school nurse, or registered dietitian oversees the implementation of the programme</li>
  <li>securing the class-list information on children in reception and year 6, including school name and unique reference number, pupil name, gender, date of birth, ethnicity code, home address and postcode, by liaising either directly with schools or with their local authority education officer – a parent’s email address and telephone number may also be required if digital communication methods are being used and proactive feedback calls are planned by the local authority or <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> provider</li>
</ul>

<p>It is lawful under the General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) and Data Protection Act (<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr>) 2018 for schools to continue to provide class lists to the local authority or those working on behalf of the local authority to carry out the height and weight measurements. For more information, see section 5,  ‘Supporting <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> and the General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) and Data Protection Act (<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr>) 2018: advice for schools’.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Developing and disseminating a pre-measurement letter to parents</h3>

<p>As consent is not the lawful basis for processing <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data under the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018, there is no requirement for schools to obtain the consent of parents in order to provide class lists to school nursing teams and <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> providers. However, local authorities are required to take steps to ensure parents understand the value of having their child measured and are provided with a reasonable opportunity to withdraw their child from participating in the programme.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> has developed a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-child-measurement-programme-operational-guidance">specimen pre-measurement letter for parents</a>, which ensures that the information provided to parents on the processing of their children’s height and weight data meets the requirements of the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018. The letter also acts as the privacy notice and must be sent to all children eligible to take part in the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>. Parents must be sent this letter at least 2 weeks before the measurements are scheduled to take place.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Raising awareness of the programme among parents, school leaders and staff, children and governors</h3>

<p>Many <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> leads will seek to include short articles in school newsletters, provide governors with information and deliver assemblies to ensure parents, children and teachers understand what the programme involves and why it is done. The local <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> lead is your first point of contact and could be your local authority public health team or an <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> provider such as a school nursing service or commissioned service that delivers the height and weight measures.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Planning for and carrying out the height and weight checks</h3>

<p>Planning the logistics of measuring children’s height and weight and liaising with schools to arrange appropriate days and times to take measurements. Current national and local infection control guidance should be referred to in order to inform the planning and delivery of <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> measurements. The following links advise on the necessary adjustments required to help enable the safe delivery of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>:</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emergency-planning-and-response-for-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care-settings">Emergency planning and response for education, childcare, and children’s social care settings</a></p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-protection-in-schools-and-other-childcare-facilities">Health protection in education and childcare settings</a></p>

<p>Taking the height and weight measurements of children in reception and year 6 and returning the data collected to NHS Digital. This contributes to the annual national statistics report publication.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> Optional feedback</h3>

<p>Check with your local <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> lead whether feedback to parents and/or feedback to schools is provided.</p>

<h3>Feedback to parents</h3>

<p>Providing parents with feedback, within 6 weeks of measurement, either in the form of a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-child-measurement-programme-operational-guidance">result letter</a> or through a telephone call. The feedback provides parents with individually tailored information on their child’s height, weight and weight category (either underweight, healthy weight, overweight, or very overweight), together with signposting to sources of local support and advice as well as national support such as a link to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/change4life/your-childs-weight/home" rel="external">Children’s weight</a> page on the Better Health Families website.</p>

<h3>Feedback to schools</h3>

<p>Providing schools with feedback on how overweight and obesity prevalence at their school compares with the local or national average by sending the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-child-measurement-programme-school-feedback-letter"><abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> school feedback letter</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Supporting delivery of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> in your school</h2>

<p>Your local authority is responsible for delivering the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>. However, the programme has been most successful in areas where schools have provided support. Therefore, local <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> leads may contact your school to ask for your help in the following ways.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Providing them with a class list for all children in reception and year 6</h3>

<p>The class list should contain the school name and unique reference number, and the name, gender, date of birth, ethnicity code, home postcode, home address and home telephone number of each pupil. It is lawful under the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018 for schools to continue to provide class lists to <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> providers for the purposes of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>. For more information, see section 5: ‘Supporting <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> and the General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) and Data Protection Act (<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr>) 2018: advice for schools’.</p>

<h4>Check there are no new starters missing from the class list</h4>

<p>Some local authorities request the class list electronically to move towards a paperless way of working.</p>

<h4>Letting them know if there are any children on the class list who are not eligible to participate in the height and weight checks because they are unable to stand unaided</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> lead can make alternative arrangements for these children (a specimen letter to parents of children unable to be measured unaided can be sent to parents).</p>

<h4>Letting them know that there are children with Down’s syndrome</h4>

<p>Children with Down’s syndrome should be included in the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> activity on measurement day as appropriate. However, the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> provider will need to use a specialist growth chart and provide parents with an adapted result letter.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Facilitating the dissemination of the pre-measurement letter to parents</h3>

<p>The local authority is responsible for ensuring that parents are informed about the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>, including how their child’s data will be stored and processed. The pre-measurement letter also gives parents the opportunity to withdraw their child from the programme. Your local <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> lead may seek your support to send pre-measurement letters electronically or through the pupil post. Local authorities may also ask for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://campaignresources.phe.gov.uk/resources/campaigns/17/resources/2286" rel="external">pre-measurement leaflet for parents: school height and weight measurements</a> to be disseminated along with the pre-measurement letter for parents. This leaflet helps parents understand the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> process and why healthy weight is important for a child’s health and wellbeing.</p>

<h4>Letting the local authority know if any parents have withdrawn their child</h4>

<p>Although parents will be asked via the pre-measurement letter to let the local authority or service provider know if they have chosen to withdraw their child, some parents may respond directly to the school. Relaying this information to the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> delivery team will ensure that parents’ wishes are respected.</p>

<h4>Confirming a convenient day and time for <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> staff to come into the school to measure the height and weight of children in reception and year 6</h4>

<h4>Providing a room where children’s height and weight can be measured and a member of staff to help with supervising children’s movement to and from the room</h4>

<p>Ideally it is important that each child’s height and weight is measured in privacy, without being seen or heard by other pupils. Schools will need to identify a private area, with adequate space and appropriate flooring (such as a level, non-carpeted flooring to ensure that scales give an accurate reading). If a separate room is not available, a screened-off area can be used.</p>

<h4>Promoting robust hand and respiratory hygiene</h4>

<p>The availability of facilities for handwashing is of increased importance for <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> staff, students and school staff to help with infection control.</p>

<h4>Raising awareness of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>
</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> has been successful in areas where governors, parents and children have a good understanding and awareness of the programme and its importance. The local <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> lead may liaise with you to arrange engagement sessions such as plan an assembly where the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> lead can talk to children about the programme, include an article on the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> in the school newsletter, or share information on the programme with governors.</p>

<h4>Embedding <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> as part of a whole school approach to health and wellbeing</h4>

<p>A whole school approach<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup> is one that goes beyond the learning and teaching in the classroom to pervade all aspects of the life of a school including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>culture, ethos and environment – the health and wellbeing of students and staff is promoted through the hidden or informal curriculum, including leadership practice, the school’s values and attitudes, together with the social and physical environment</li>
  <li>learning and teaching – using the curriculum to develop pupils’ knowledge, attitudes and skills about health and wellbeing</li>
  <li>partnerships with families and the community – proactive engagement with families, outside agencies, and the wider community to promote consistent support for children and young people’s health and wellbeing</li>
</ul>

<p>Embedding the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> as part of a whole school approach to health and wellbeing can complement teaching about physical health, fitness and healthy eating which are an integral part of statutory health education.</p>

<h4>Make full use of the ‘Our Healthy Year’ resources</h4>

<p>A pack of resources called <a class="govuk-link" href="https://campaignresources.phe.gov.uk/schools/topics/our-healthy-year/overview" rel="external">Our Healthy Year</a> is available for head teachers, reception and year 6 teachers, to help them teach pupils about leading healthy lifestyles in the years in which they are weighed and measured as part of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>. There are ideas for whole school activities and suggestions for engaging parents.</p>

<h4>Providing parents with contact details if they have any questions</h4>

<p>Some parents wish to discuss their child’s result with someone. So giving the parent the correct details that the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> lead has provided to you will help parents receive support quickly.</p>

<p>Under the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> all processing of personal data must have a lawful basis. The legal foundation for the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> is provided in local authority regulations<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup>,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">[footnote 22]</a></sup>. This statutory authority means that the lawful basis for the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> is provided by the Articles of the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> covering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>compliance with a legal obligation</li>
  <li>exercise of official authority</li>
  <li>provision of health or social care</li>
  <li>public interest in the area of public health</li>
</ul>

<p>Consent is not the lawful basis for the processing of <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data.</p>

<p>Schools have a legal obligation to release pupil’s personal information. Schools do not require parental consent to share a pupils’ personal information for the purposes of participating in the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>.</p>

<p>As consent is not needed to lawfully process <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data under the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018, there is no requirement for schools to obtain the consent of parents to provide class lists to school nursing teams and <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> providers. This sharing continues to be lawful under the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018. All parties involved should be following information governance guidance regarding the secure transfer of personal data.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> Regulations state that parents must be given an opportunity to withdraw their child from the programme. This requirement is covered by sending them a pre-measurement letter at least 2 weeks prior to being measured. <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> has developed a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-child-measurement-programme-operational-guidance">specimen pre-measurement letter (to parents)</a> for local authorities, which complies with the requirements of the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018 including detailed information on what happens to the child’s data and information on how to withdraw. Schools may be asked to support dissemination of this letter to parents (see section ‘Supporting Delivery of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> in your School’).</p>

<p>Further guidance on schools sharing information with the school nursing team or providers for the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> is provided in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-child-measurement-programme-operational-guidance"><abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> Operational Guidance</a>.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">[footnote 23]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Key point</h3>

<p>No change is required to the way in which the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data is collected and processed for this to continue to be lawful under the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018.</p>
