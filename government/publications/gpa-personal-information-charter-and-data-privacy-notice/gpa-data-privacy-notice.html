<span class="number">1. </span>GPA Data Privacy Notice</h2>

<p>Published 5th October 2021</p>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>The GPA is an executive agency of HM Government, sponsored by the Cabinet Office.</p>

<p>We’re responsible for providing Government Departments and arms-length bodies with great places to work for their civil servants, which in turn enables them to provide excellent public services.</p>

<p>More details of our services can be found here: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-property-agency">https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-property-agency</a></p>

<p>This document explains what we mean when we talk about personal data, why we ask for this information about you and what we do with it. It also explains how we store your data, how you can get a copy of the information we have collected about you and how you can complain if you think we have done something wrong.</p>

<h4>What is personal data?</h4>

<p>Personal data is information relating to a living individual who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>can be identified directly from the information being processed</li>
  <li>can be indirectly identified from that information in combination with other information</li>
</ul>

<p>There are ‘Special Categories’ of personal data which require additional protection, that refer to;</p>

<ul>
  <li>racial or ethnic origin</li>
  <li>political opinions</li>
  <li>religious beliefs</li>
  <li>trade union membership</li>
  <li>genetic and biometric data</li>
  <li>sexual orientation</li>
  <li>sex life</li>
  <li>criminal conviction and offences data</li>
</ul>

<p>Special category data is not processed by the GPA in normal circumstances. Where it is necessary, we will inform you in advance and ask your consent, plus explain the reason(s) and lawful basis for doing so.</p>

<h4>Why we collect personal data</h4>

<p>The Government Property Agency (GPA) is the data controller for the personal information we collect and store. We process personal data about individuals so we can carry out the following functions as an executive agency of the Cabinet Office.</p>

<h4>When we ask you for personal data</h4>

<p>Whenever we ask for information about you, we promise to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a lawful basis for doing so;</li>
  <li>ask for relevant personal information only;</li>
  <li>make sure we don’t keep it longer than needed;</li>
  <li>keep your information safe and make sure nobody can access it unless authorised;</li>
  <li>only share your data with other organisations for legitimate purposes; and</li>
  <li>consider any request you make to correct, stop storing or delete your personal data.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The personal data we collect</h4>

<p>We only process the personal data we need to provide specific services to you.</p>

<p>We strive to minimise the amount of data we process, limited to the purpose required; and only hold personal data for as long as necessary to provide the service(s) [unless we are required by law to retain personal data for a specified time period (e.g. employee remuneration data for tax purposes)].</p>

<p>The GPA does not process personal data for any other reasons than our services allow and require and does not sell or share personal data with other organisations for financial gain or other purposes.</p>

  <li>processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation on us as a data controller; or</li>
  <li>processing is necessary to meet the terms of a contract.</li>
</ul>

<h4>How we protect your data and keep it secure</h4>

<p>We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. We have set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of your data - for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption.</p>

<p>We also make sure that any third parties that we deal with keep all personal data they process on our behalf secure and in line with data protection legislation.</p>

<h4>Your rights</h4>

<p>Under the UK Data Protection Act (2018), incorporating UK GDPR, you have the right:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to request information about how your personal data is processed, and to request a copy of that personal data;</li>
  <li>to request that any inaccuracies in your personal data are rectified without delay;</li>
  <li>to request that any incomplete instances of personal data are completed, including by means of a supplementary statement;</li>
  <li>to request that your personal data is erased if there is no longer a justification for it to be processed;</li>
  <li>in certain circumstances (for example, where accuracy is contested), to request that the processing of your personal data is restricted;</li>
  <li>to object to the processing of your personal data where it is processed for direct marketing purposes, or any other reason and that we will then consider; and</li>
  <li>to request a copy of any personal data you have provided, and for this to be provided in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.</li>
</ul>
