<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide is part of ‘All Our Health’, a resource which helps health and care professionals prevent ill health and promote wellbeing as part of their everyday practice. The information below will help front-line health and care staff use their trusted relationships with patients, families and communities to promote the benefits of good oral health for children.</p>

<p>We also recommend important actions for managers and staff holding strategic roles.</p>

<p>Further information is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/all-our-health-personalised-care-and-population-health">All Our Health collection</a>.</p>

<p>Improving the oral health of children is an Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (<abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>) priority, <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> has an ambition that every child will grow up free of tooth decay, to help give them the best start in life.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> has established a Child Oral Health Improvement Programme Board (<abbr title="Child Oral Health Improvement Programme Board">COHIPB</abbr>) working with a range of partners and stakeholders, to improve the health of all children, and reduce the oral health gap for disadvantaged children.</p>

<p>The Board launched in September 2016, and introduced the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/launch-of-the-childrens-oral-health-improvement-programme-board"><abbr title="Child Oral Health Improvement Programme Board">COHIPB</abbr> Action plan</a>, which details 5 high-level objectives of the board, how they will be delivered, and what success looks like.</p>

<p>Oral health is part of general health and wellbeing, and contributes to the development of a healthy child as well as school readiness.</p>

<h2>Access the child oral health e-learning session</h2>

<p>An interactive <a class="govuk-link" href="https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/Component/Details/587510" rel="external">e-learning version of this topic</a> is now available to use. <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> and Health Education England’s ‘e-Learning for Healthcare’ have developed this content to increase the confidence and skills of health and care professionals, to embed prevention in their day-to-day practice.</p>

<h2>Promoting child oral health in your professional practice</h2>

<p>Tooth decay is the most common oral disease affecting children and young people in England, yet it is largely preventable.</p>

<p>Although oral health is improving in England, the oral health survey of 5 year olds in 2019 showed that just under a quarter have tooth decay (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/oral-health-survey-of-5-year-old-children-2019">National Dental Epidemiology Programme for England, 2019</a>). Each child with tooth decay will have on average 3 to 4 teeth affected. For those children at risk, it can happen early in life. The oral health survey of 3 year olds in 2020 found that 11% had visible tooth decay, with on average 3 teeth affected.</p>

<p>While 77% of 5 year old children in England are now free of obvious tooth decay, significant regional inequalities remain – with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/oral-health-survey-of-5-year-old-children-2017">children from the most deprived areas having more than twice the level of decay</a>, than those from the least deprived.</p>

<p>Almost 9 out of 10 hospital tooth extractions among children aged 0 to 5 years are due to preventable tooth decay and tooth extraction is still the most common hospital procedure in 6 to 10 year olds, according to data up to 2019. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6831-15-3" rel="external">Issues arising following a referral and subsequent wait for extraction under general anaesthetic: impact on children</a>.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Poor dental health harms school readiness" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/72060/School_readiness.png"></div></figure>

<p>Tooth decay can cause problems with eating, sleeping, communication and socialising, and results in at least 60,000 days being missed from school during the year for hospital extractions alone.</p>

<p>Tooth decay could be prevented by cutting down on sugar, as well as brushing teeth with fluoride toothpaste. The cost to the NHS of treating oral conditions is about £3.4 billion per year.</p>

<p>Regularly consuming food and drinks containing sugar increases the risk of tooth decay, and can lead to an increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Children are still consuming more than the recommended daily limit.</p>

<h2>Core principles for health and care professionals</h2>

<p>This ‘All Our Health’ child oral health information has been created to help all health and care professionals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand specific activities and interventions that can prevent tooth decay and gum disease, and improve oral health</li>
  <li>know about the resources and services available that can help children, families and communities to improve their oral health</li>
</ul>

<h2>Taking action</h2>

<p>The most effective way to improve child dental health is to embed it in all children’s services, at strategic and operational levels.</p>

<h3>Front-line health and care professionals</h3>

<p>Familiarise yourself with the evidence-based advice and treatment that should be given.</p>

<p>This can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention">Delivering better oral health</a>, which provides dental teams and other health and care professionals with the information they need. The quick guide to a healthy mouth in children provides a summarised factsheet with clear and consistent messages.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.makingeverycontactcount.co.uk/" rel="external">Making Every Contact Count</a> (<abbr title="Making Every Contact Count">MECC</abbr>) focuses on staff working with the public giving appropriate and timely advice on health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>You should also work to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand how to help people change their behaviour. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng30" rel="external">Oral health promotion: general dental practice (NG30)</a> provides useful resources</li>
  <li>encourage early intervention and evidence-based advice, for example, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bspd.co.uk/Patients/Dental-Check-by-One" rel="external">Dental Check by One</a>
</li>
  <li>find out about, and refer patients or the public to community oral health improvement programmes in your area</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of community oral health improvement programmes include supervised tooth brushing, or fluoride varnish application programmes in targeted, early years settings such as children’s centres, nurseries or schools.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Preventing tooth decay" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/72056/Preventing.png"></div></figure>

<h3>Team leaders or managers</h3>

<p>There are practical actions that managers (health and social care) can take to enable them to ensure all staff promote good oral health and access relevant training that is regularly updated including e-learning resources to support early years and health and care professionals.</p>

<p>Embed oral health in all children’s services at a strategic and operational level.</p>

<p>Consider the training needs of the workforce, to enable them to deliver high-quality oral health advice and interventions. Several e-learning resources for the early years workforce are available on Health Education England’s e-learning for Healthcare (<abbr title="e-learning for Healthcare">e-lfH</abbr>), including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/healthy-child-programme" rel="external">oral health module of the <abbr title="Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health">RCPCH</abbr> Healthy Child Programme (<abbr title="healthy child programme">HCP</abbr>)</a>
</li>
  <li>the NHS <abbr title="e-learning for Healthcare">e-lfH</abbr>, easy access module, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/childrens-oral-health/" rel="external">children’s oral health care advice</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The Centre for Pharmacy Post Graduate Education has a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cppe.ac.uk/gateway/oralhealth" rel="external">children’s oral health programme</a>.</p>

<p>Ensure your teams are aware of oral health services and interventions in your local area to improve child oral health and engage with commissioners to support them - for example supervised toothbrushing, fluoride varnish and Starting Well programmes.</p>

<p>Support local commissioners, identifying where programmes work well and if there are areas for improvement.</p>

<p>Promote the use of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rsph.org.uk/our-work/policy/wider-public-health-workforce/measuring-public-health-impact/child-oral-health.html" rel="external">child oral health impact pathway</a> for front-line health and care professionals, to support them to provide oral health improvement as part of routine practice. The pathway also provides an easy way to record and measure their public health impact.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Supervised brushing" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/72057/Supervised_brushing.png"></div></figure>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cppe.ac.uk" rel="external">The Centre for Pharmacy Post Graduate Education</a> (CPPE) has a children’s oral health programme.</p>

<h3>Senior strategic leaders</h3>

<p>If you’re a senior or strategic leader:</p>

<ul>
  <li>work to ensure that oral health is included and promoted within commissioned healthcare services</li>
  <li>advocate for oral health, ensuring it is included in health and wellbeing board’s joint strategic needs assessments</li>
  <li>make sure that oral health is also included in other policies such as food policies</li>
  <li>support policies to reduce sugar consumption and access to fluoride</li>
</ul>

<p>Water fluoridation resources are available to local authorities where community water fluoridation schemes are being considered.</p>

<h2>Understanding local needs</h2>

<p>Consultants in dental public health provide advice locally. They provide information and intelligence to inform and support health or care professionals, local authorities and other partners to help improve oral health and provision of services.</p>

<p>Oral health needs assessments and joint strategic needs assessments may be available locally.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/oral-health">oral health collection</a> contains a comprehensive list of information and resources for health practitioners, to improve oral health and reduce inequalities in England.</p>

<p>The following are included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<ul>
  <li>local authority area variations in the oral health of 5 year olds</li>
  <li>oral health improvement programmes commissioned by local authorities</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/areas-of-interest/public-health/children-s-dental-health-survey" rel="external">National Children’s Dental Health Survey</a> has been carried out every 10 years since 1973. It includes data on children aged 5, 8, 12 and 15 years, and reports on a dental examination and questionnaires for parents and 12 and 15 year olds. The last survey took place in 2013.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/public-health-outcomes-framework" rel="external">The Public Health Outcomes Framework</a> (<abbr title="Public Health Outcomes Framework">PHOF</abbr>) has one oral health indicator:</p>

<ul>
  <li>decayed teeth (3.7.i)</li>
  <li>tooth extractions due to decay in children admitted as inpatients to hospital, aged 10 years and under (3.7.ii)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Measuring impact</h2>

<p>As a health and care professional, there are a range of reasons why it makes sense to measure your impact and demonstrate the value of your contribution.</p>

<p>This could be about sharing what has worked well in order to benefit your colleagues and local people or help you with your professional development.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rsph.org.uk/our-work/policy/wider-public-health-workforce/measuring-public-health-impact.html" rel="external">Everyday Interactions Measuring Impact Toolkit</a> provides a quick, straightforward and easy way for health and care professionals (HCPs) to record and measure their public health impact in a uniform and comparable way. The toolkit includes a child oral health impact pathway.</p>
