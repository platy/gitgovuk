We have published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/view-latest-funding/" rel="external">2022 to 2023 <abbr title="dedicated schools grant">DSG</abbr> allocations</a> for each local authority. This shows the <abbr title="dedicated schools grant">DSG</abbr> prior to academiesâ recoupment from the schools block.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Calculating the 2022 to 2023 dedicated schools grant</h2>

<p>Information on the pupil numbers used for the schools block, <abbr title="central school services block">CSSB</abbr>, high needs block <abbr title="national funding formula">NFF</abbr> basic entitlement factor, and early years block can be found in section 11. A pupil number tool will be published in January 2021.</p>

<p>Each unit of funding is rounded to the nearest penny.</p>

<p>Final <abbr title="dedicated schools grant">DSG</abbr> allocations are rounded up to the nearest Â£1.</p>

<p>Pupil numbers are rounded to two decimal points.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Payment arrangements</h2>

<p>We will pay the grant to local authorities in 25 instalments on the dates set out in section 12. Payments are based on the total <abbr title="dedicated schools grant">DSG</abbr> allocation notified in December 2021 minus recoupment for academies and deductions for high needs places.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Schools block</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Schools block allocations</h3>

<p>The PUFs for each local authority are multiplied by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of pupils in reception to year group 6 from the October 2021 school census plus</li>
  <li>pupils aged 4 to 10 not assigned to a year group from the October 2021 school census</li>
</ul>

<p>The SUFs for each local authority are multiplied by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of pupils in year groups 7 to 11 from the October 2021 school census plus</li>
  <li>pupils aged 11 to 15 not assigned to a year group from the October 2021 school census</li>
</ul>

<p>Pupils in special units and resourced provision are included in the pupil counts above. We count reception pupils as one full time equivalent (FTE) irrespective of the hours they attend.</p>

<p>We then add:</p>

<p>1:	The actual 2022 to 2023 funding for the premises factor (as this is based on historic spend), as published in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-funding-formula-tables-for-schools-and-high-needs-2022-to-2023"><abbr title="national funding formula">NFF</abbr> summary table</a> in July 2021.</p>

<p>2:	Growth funding using the differences between the primary and secondary numbers on roll in the local authority in the October 2020 and October 2021 school censuses as described in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-funding-formula-tables-for-schools-and-high-needs-2022-to-2023">annex D of the schools block national funding formula (<abbr title="national funding formula">NFF</abbr>) technical note</a> published in July 2021.</p>

<p>We then deduct:</p>

<p>3:    The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/view-latest-funding/" rel="external">National Non Domestic Rates (<abbr title="national nondomestic rates">NNDR</abbr>) figure as set out in the 2022 to 2023 <abbr title="dedicated schools grant">DSG</abbr> allocations</a> for each local authority.  <abbr title="national nondomestic rates">NNDR</abbr> will be paid by the ESFA directly to billing authorities on behalf of all maintained schools and academies from 2022 to 2023 onwards.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Arrangements for academies recoupment 2022 to 2023</h3>
<p>We will calculate amounts for recoupment based on the individual schools budget (ISB) share, excluding business rates, shown in the authority proforma tool (APT) submitted in January 2022. We will provide local authorities with details of the proposed recoupment amount, and relevant calculations, by the end of April 2022. We will publish detailed recoupment guidance in early 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Central school services block</h2>

<p>For each local authority, we multiply the <abbr title="central school services block">CSSB</abbr> units of funding by the number of pupils recorded in the October 2021 school census in</p>

<ul>
  <li>reception to year group 11, and</li>
  <li>aged 4 to 15 not assigned to a year group</li>
</ul>

<p>We have added the resulting allocation to the actual funding for historic commitments published in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-funding-formula-tables-for-schools-and-high-needs-2022-to-2023"><abbr title="national funding formula">NFF</abbr> summary table.</a></p>

<p>We have made a small number of manual adjustments to the actual funding for historic commitments, based on specific evidence submitted by local authorities of ongoing costs which they would not have been able to unwind since 2013 to 2014. This protects allocations from a reduction below the value of these costs.
The School and Early Years Finance (England) Regulations 2022 will set out how this funding may be used.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> High needs block</h2>

<p>The high needs funding block is a single block for local authorities to spend on provision for pupils and students aged 0 to 24, with high needs. Before any deductions are made, the block includes funding for pre-16 and post-16 places in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maintained mainstream schools (pre-16 places in special units and resourced provision and post-16 high needs places)</li>
  <li>maintained special schools (pre-16 and post-16 places)</li>
  <li>pupil referral units (PRUs)</li>
  <li>mainstream academies and free schools (pre-16 places in special units and resourced provision and post-16 high needs places)</li>
  <li>special academies (pre-16 and post-16 places)</li>
  <li>special free schools (pre-16 and post-16 places): information on how this is calculated is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023">special free schools adjustments a guide for local authorities</a>
</li>
  <li>non-maintained special schools (<abbr title="non-maintained special schools">NMSS</abbr>) (pre-16 and post-16 places â Â£6,000 of the Â£10,000 per place only)</li>
  <li>alternative provision (<abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr>) academies</li>
  <li>further education (<abbr title="further education">FE</abbr>) colleges (including sixth form colleges and 16-19 academies), independent learning providers (<abbr title="independent learning providers">ILPs</abbr>) and special post-16 institutions (<abbr title="special post-16 institutions">SPIs</abbr>) (post-16 places only)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> free schools (pre-16 places, excluding those at schools opened during the 2021 to 2022, or 2022 to 2023 academic years)</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the funding for places described above, the high needs block also includes top-up funding for pupils and students occupying the places in the provider  types listed above.</p>

<p>It also includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all funding for children and young people placed in independent schools, independent <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> (unless the places are commissioned directly by schools) and hospital education (including hospital education for individual young people being educated in independent providers)</li>
  <li>funding for central high needs services and budgets</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> High needs block allocations</h3>

<p>We have updated the allocations for the basic entitlement element of the high needs national funding formula to use pupil number data from the October 2021 school census.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span> Import and export adjustments</h3>

<p>The allocations announced in July 2021 included import and export adjustments to reflect where high needs pupils and students are educated, as explained in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1003170/2022-23_NFF_high_needs_technical_note.pdf" rel="external">high needs technical note.</a></p>

<p>As part of the import and export adjustment, we treat pupils attending non-maintained special schools (NMSSs) and <abbr title="special post-16 institutions">SPIs</abbr> as exports to ESFA, to reflect that funding for these schools and colleges is allocated directly by ESFA. ESFA will continue to directly fund <abbr title="non-maintained special schools">NMSS</abbr> and <abbr title="special post-16 institution">SPI</abbr> places in line with the principles outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023/high-needs-funding-2022-to-2023-operational-guidance">2022 to 2023 high needs operational guide.</a></p>

<p>In the summer term 2022, we will update the import and export adjustments to reflect the latest data from the January 2022 school census and the R06 of the 2021 to 2022 Individual Learner Record (ILR), which will include the exports to ESFA for NMSSs and <abbr title="special post-16 institutions">SPIs</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span> High needs place funding deductions</h3>

<p>The high needs deductions section of the <abbr title="dedicated schools grant">DSG</abbr> allocations table shows the place funding deductions for the final 5 months of academic year 2021 to 2022 for pre-16 places directly paid for by ESFA to schools and colleges and the final 4 months for post-16 places.</p>

<p>These numbers have also been used to give provisional deductions for the first 7 months of academic year 2022 to 2023 (the first 8 months for post-16 places). In April 2022, we will update both sets of deductions to reflect further academy conversions. We will also update the deductions for academic year 2022 to 2023 to reflect the outcome of the 2022 to 2023 place change notifications process.</p>

<p>Special units and resourced provision are funded on the places reported and determined through the place change notification process, not on the number of pupils reported on the 2022 to 2023 APT. The pupil data from the APT is only used to identify whether places are occupied by pupils on the school roll funded at Â£6,000, or funded at Â£10,000 otherwise.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span> Alternative provision free schools with high needs places</h3>

<p>ESFA directly funds places in <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> free schools opened during the 2021 to 2022 or 2022 to 2023 academic years, with no deduction from <abbr title="dedicated schools grant">DSG</abbr>. We will make deductions from <abbr title="dedicated schools grant">DSG</abbr> for pre-16 places in <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> free schools opened before or during the 2020 to 2021 academic year. Deductions are from the pupilâs home local authority, based on school census data. We will notify local authorities of these deductions in April 2022. No deductions will be made from local authoritiesâ 2022 to 2023 <abbr title="dedicated schools grant">DSG</abbr> for post-16 high needs places in <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> free schools; these will be funded directly by ESFA.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span> Hospital education</h3>

<p>We may make some minor adjustments to the hospital education funding amounts included in the national funding formula allocations based on information submitted by local authorities in the place change notification process in November 2021.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Early years block</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span> Funding for the free early years childcare entitlements</h3>

<p>The hourly rates for the early years free entitlements for 2-year-olds and 3 and 4-year-olds were announced in November 2021 as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-funding-2022-to-2023/early-years-2022-to-2023-hourly-funding-rates-for-2-3-and-4-year-olds-technical-note">2022 to 2023 early years technical note.</a></p>

<p>Funding for the early years free entitlements includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>universal 15-hour entitlement for 3 and 4-year-olds</li>
  <li>additional 15-hour entitlement for 3 and 4-year-old children of eligible working parents</li>
  <li>15 hours entitlement for disadvantaged 2-year-olds</li>
</ul>

<p>The indicative allocations for each local authority for the above funding streams is calculated as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of part-time equivalents (PTEs) taking up the entitlements as recorded on the January 2021 schools, early years and <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> censuses</li>
  <li>multiplied by 15 hours Ã 38 weeks Ã local authorityâs hourly funding rate ESFA will update these initial allocations in:</li>
  <li>July 2022 based on January 2022 <abbr title="part-time equivalents">PTE</abbr> census numbers</li>
  <li>July 2023, based on five-twelfths of the January 2022 <abbr title="part-time equivalents">PTE</abbr> census numbers (to cover the April 2022 to August 2023 period), and seven-twelfths of the January 2023 <abbr title="part-time equivalents">PTE</abbr> census numbers (to cover the September 2022 to March 2023 period)</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that the final allocations for each of these funding streams will be based on (five-twelfths January 2022 <abbr title="part-time equivalents">PTE</abbr> census numbers) + (seven-twelfths January 2023 <abbr title="part-time equivalents">PTE</abbr> census numbers).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span> Early years pupil premium (<abbr title="early years pupil premium">EYPP</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The national rate for <abbr title="early years pupil premium">EYPP</abbr> is 60 pence per hour per eligible child, up to a maximum 570 hours per year, as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-funding-2022-to-2023/early-years-2022-to-2023-hourly-funding-rates-for-2-3-and-4-year-olds-technical-note"> 2022 to 2023 early years technical note.</a></p>

<p>The indicative allocation for each local authority is calculated as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of PTEs taking up the <abbr title="early years pupil premium">EYPP</abbr> as recorded on the January 2021 schools, early years and <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> censuses.</li>
  <li>multiplied by 15 hours Ã 38 weeks Ã Â£0.60</li>
</ul>

<p>ESFA will update these initial allocations in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>July 2022 based on January 2022 <abbr title="part-time equivalents">PTE</abbr> census numbers</li>
  <li>July 2023, based on five-twelfths of the January 2022 <abbr title="part-time equivalents">PTE</abbr> census numbers (to cover the April 2022 to August 2023 period), and seven-twelfths of the January 2023 <abbr title="part-time equivalents">PTE</abbr> census numbers (to cover the September 2022 to March 2023 period)</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that the final allocations will be based on (five-twelfths January 2022 <abbr title="part-time equivalents">PTE</abbr> census numbers) + (seven-twelfths January 2023 <abbr title="part-time equivalents">PTE</abbr> census numbers).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span> Early years disability access fund</h3>

<p>The national rate for <abbr title="disability access fund">DAF</abbr> is Â£800 per eligible child per year, as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-funding-2022-to-2023/early-years-2022-to-2023-hourly-funding-rates-for-2-3-and-4-year-olds-technical-note">2022 to 2023 early years technical note.</a></p>

<p>Allocations have been calculated based on Disability Living Allowance (DLA) data from February 2021. These allocations will not change and should be considered as final for 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p>For each local authority, the total February 2021 DLA claimant count of 3 and 4-year-old children, using data from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), is adjusted to remove an estimated number of children in reception. This gives an estimate of the number of 3 and 4-year-olds eligible to take up <abbr title="disability access fund">DAF</abbr> in the local authority. This is then multiplied by Â£800 to arrive at the final allocation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span> Early years supplementary funding for maintained nursery schools</h3>

<p>The 2021 to 2022 hourly supplementary funding rates are the starting point for calculating the 2022 to 2023 supplementary funding rates. These are uplifted by 3.47% and then rounded to 2 decimal places, which is equivalent to the increase in the 3 and 4-year-old hourly funding rates. The local authority rates for supplementary funding in 2022 to 2023 are shown in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/view-latest-funding/" rel="external">2022 to 2023 <abbr title="dedicated schools grant">DSG</abbr> allocations tables</a> .</p>

<p>The allocation for each local authority qualifying for the supplementary funding is calculated as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of part-time equivalents (PTEs) taking up the universal 15 hours in <abbr title="maintained nursery schools">MNS</abbr> as recorded on the January 2021 schools, early years and <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> censuses</li>
  <li>multiplied by 15 hours Ã 38 weeks Ã local authorityâs hourly supplementary funding rate ESFA will update these initial allocations in:</li>
  <li>July 2022 based on January 2022 <abbr title="part-time equivalents">PTE</abbr> census numbers</li>
  <li>July 2023, based on five-twelfths of the January 2022 <abbr title="part-time equivalents">PTE</abbr> census numbers (to cover the April 2022 to August 2023 period), and seven-twelfths of the January 2023 <abbr title="part-time equivalents">PTE</abbr> census numbers (to cover the September 2022 to March 2023 period)</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that the final allocations will be based on (five-twelfths January 2022 <abbr title="part-time equivalents">PTE</abbr> census numbers) + (seven-twelfths January 2023 <abbr title="part-time equivalents">PTE</abbr> census numbers).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Deductions for national copyright licences</h2>

<p>DfE has agreements with the following agencies to purchase a single national licence managed by DfE for all state funded schools in England:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Christian Copyright Licensing International (CCLI)</li>
  <li>Copyright Licensing Agency (CLA)</li>
  <li>Education Recording Agency (ERA)</li>
  <li>Filmbank Distributors Ltd. (for the PVSL)</li>
  <li>Mechanical Copyright Protection Society (MCPS)</li>
  <li>Motion Picture Licensing Company (MPLC)</li>
  <li>Newspaper Licensing Authority (NLA)</li>
  <li>Performing Rights Society (PRS)</li>
  <li>Phonographic Performance Limited (PPL)</li>
  <li>Schools Printed Music Licence (SPML)</li>
</ul>

<p>Local authorities and schools do not need to negotiate individual licences. DfE pays the cost, including VAT, to the agencies and provides this as a service to local authorities at a charge. Local authorities can reclaim VAT on the licences. These arrangements cover academies as well as maintained schools. Local authorities can hold this money centrally rather than include it in school budgets.</p>

<p>We have sent local authorities details of the charges for 2022 to 2023 separately (because the figures are commercial in confidence). In April 2022, ESFA will deduct the charge from the <abbr title="dedicated schools grant">DSG</abbr> and issue each local authority with a VAT invoice.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Independent school transfers</h2>

<p>Where independent schools transfer into the maintained sector, in or after April 2022, we will adjust the actual pupil count used in the schools block allocations to add the relevant pupil numbers, depending on when the school transfers and the portion of the year for which it is a maintained school. For example, if a school transfers in September 2022, we will increase the schools block by the number of pupils attending the school as recorded on the October 2022 school census multiplied by seven-twelfths multiplied by the local authorityâs <abbr title="primary units of funding">PUF</abbr> or <abbr title="secondary units of funding">SUF</abbr> depending on the year groups of the pupils transferred.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10. </span> Funding for the Isles of Scilly and City of London</h3>

<p>We will continue to fund the Isles of Scilly and the City of London each through a single grant, since their low pupil populations and other unique characteristics make it impracticable to fund through national funding formulae. In addition, they will receive the pupil premium grant.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Pupil number information</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.1 </span> Introduction</h3>

<p>This note provides detail of the pupil number counts which have been used in the calculation of the financial year 2022 to 2023 <abbr title="dedicated schools grant">DSG</abbr> allocations.</p>

<p>The schools block and <abbr title="central school services block">CSSB</abbr> pupil counts are derived primarily from the October 2021 school census. This underpinning dataset is collected in a similar way to the January school census (from which detailed analysis is published as official statistics each summer).</p>

<p>Early years block pupil counts are derived primarily from the January 2021 school census and early years census.</p>

<p>High needs block basic entitlement allocations are derived from pupil counts data from the October 2021 school census and the alternative provision census from January 2021.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.2 </span> Schools block and central school services block</h3>

<p>The pupil numbers used in the <abbr title="dedicated schools grant">DSG</abbr> calculation are those recorded as present in maintained schools and academies in the schools census, from reception (R) to year 11. This also includes pupils in special educational needs (SEN) units or resourced provision as these pupils now receive their core element funding through the schools block. Any pupils recorded as year R but who are less than 4 years old are not counted, because funding for these pupils is provided under the early years block.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.3 </span> Pupil counts</h3>

<p>The pupil numbers used to determine the 2022 to 2023 schools block allocations are from the October 2021 school census, and comprise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all pupils in maintained primary and secondary schools, and academies, which are going through recoupment at census date, in national curriculum year groups R to 11, aged 4 or above at 31 August 2021</li>
  <li>all pupils in maintained primary and secondary schools, and academies, which are going through recoupment at census date, whose national curriculum year group is missing or âXâ, aged 4 to 15 at 31 August 2021.</li>
</ul>

<p>The number of pupils in SEN units or resourced provision in maintained primary schools, secondary schools, and academies, is now included in the pupil numbers as they receive their core element funding through the schools block.</p>

<p>All pupils in the schools block are counted as 1.0 FTE regardless of their part-time or full-time status. Every relevant pupil with a sole or dual (main) registration is counted.</p>

<p>If a duplicate remains unresolved, the 1.0 FTE of that pupil is apportioned for the schools block. We do not fund duplicate unique pupil numbers (UPNs) in the school census. We identify potential duplicate UPN cases and ask authorities to resolve them. If a duplicate remains unresolved, the 1.0 FTE of that pupil is equally divided between the local authorities involved. For example, one pupil between 2 local authorities will result in both authorities receiving a headcount of 0.5.</p>

<p>For the growth element of the school block, pupil numbers form the October 2020 census are compared to the October 2021 figures at middle super output area (MSOA) on the same basis. Any positive growth at MSOA level is used to determine the 2022 to 2023 growth allocations as outlined in the methodology.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.4 </span> Early years block</h3>

<p>The early years block covers the pupils eligible under the early years national funding formula (EYNFF), covering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>universal 3 and 4-year-old entitlement</li>
  <li>additional 3 and 4-year-old entitlement for working parents</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="early years pupil premium">EYPP</abbr> for eligible 3 and 4-year-olds</li>
  <li>any pupils recorded as year R, but who are less than 4 years old</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.5 </span> Pupil counts for 3 and 4-year-old universal entitlement</h3>

<p>The EYNFF allocations are calculated using <abbr title="part-time equivalents">PTE</abbr> pupil numbers. 1.0 <abbr title="part-time equivalents">PTE</abbr> is defined as a child taking up 15 hours per week over 38 weeks. Therefore, a child taking up 30 hours per week is counted as 2.0 <abbr title="part-time equivalents">PTE</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="part-time equivalents">PTE</abbr> pupil counts from the January 2021 schools, early years and <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> censuses are used to calculate universal entitlement funding allocations as follows:</p>

<p>from the January 2021 schools census</p>

<ul>
  <li>all <abbr title="part-time equivalents">PTE</abbr> pupils in maintained nurseries, maintained schools, and all academies, in national curriculum year groups N1 and N2 aged 3 or 4 at 31 August 2020, including any 3 years olds recorded as national curriculum year group R</li>
  <li>all <abbr title="part-time equivalents">PTE</abbr> pupils in maintained nurseries, maintained schools, and all academies, whose national curriculum year group is missing or âXâ aged 3 at 31 August 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>from the January 2021 early years census</p>

<ul>
  <li>all 3 and 4-year-old PTEs as at 31 December 2020
 from the January 2021 <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> census:</li>
  <li>all pupils in independent schools without a statement of SEN or an Education Health and Care (EHC) plan aged 3 at 31 December 2020</li>
  <li>all pupils in independent schools without a statement of SEN or EHC plan aged 3 at 31 August 2020 but 4 by 31st December 2020</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.6 </span> Pupil counts for 3 and 4-year-old additional hours funding</h3>

<p>Data on how many 3 and 4-year-old children are taking up their additional hours entitlement is taken from the schools and early years censuses using the eligibility code and the same pupil counts as used for the universal entitlement, and ensuring that no pupilâs hours across both the universal and additional hours exceeds 30.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.7 </span> Disability access fund allocations</h3>

<p>The funding allocation for 2022 to 2023 will be an illustrative allocation based on an estimate of the number of 3 and 4-year-olds, who are not in reception that are claiming the disability living allowance (DLA).</p>

<p>For each local authority, their total February 2021 DLA claimant count of 3 and 4-year-old children, using data from the DWP, will be adjusted to remove an estimated number of children in reception. This will give an estimate of the number of 3 and 4-year-olds eligible to take up <abbr title="disability access fund">DAF</abbr> in the local authority.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.8 </span> Early years pupil premium funding allocations</h3>

<p>The funding methodology for <abbr title="early years pupil premium">EYPP</abbr> remains the same as in 2021 to 2022. The funding allocations for 2022 to 2023 have been calculated based on January 2021 census data on <abbr title="early years pupil premium">EYPP</abbr> take-up by eligible 3 and 4-year-olds.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.9 </span> Maintained nursery school supplementary funding allocations</h3>

<p>The 2022 to 2023 allocations use the <abbr title="part-time equivalents">PTE</abbr> pupil counts from the January 2021 school census for maintained nursery schools.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.10 </span> Two-year-old funding allocations</h3>

<p>The pupil numbers that are used to determine the allocations for 2-year-old funding are as follows:</p>

<p>from the January 2021 school census</p>

<ul>
  <li>all <abbr title="part-time equivalents">PTE</abbr> pupils in maintained nurseries, maintained schools, and all academies, in national curriculum year groups N1 and N2, aged 2 at 31 August 2020</li>
  <li>all <abbr title="part-time equivalents">PTE</abbr> pupils in maintained nurseries, maintained schools, and all academies, whose national curriculum year group is missing or âXâ, aged 2 at 31 August 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>from the January 2021 early years census</p>

<ul>
  <li>all eligible 2-year-old PTEs at 31 December 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>from the January 2020 <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> census:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all eligible pupils in independent schools without a statement of SEN or EHC plan, aged 2 at 31 December 2020</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.11 </span> High needs block</h3>

<p>The pupil numbers used to determine the basic entitlement of the 2022 to 2023 high needs block allocations are as follows.</p>

<p>from the October 2021 school census</p>

<ul>
  <li>all pupils in maintained special schools, special academies, and special free schools, in national curriculum year groups N1 to 14, aged 2 to 18 at 31 August 2021</li>
  <li>all pupils in maintained special schools, and special academies, and special free schools, whose national curriculum year group is missing or âXâ, aged 2 to 18 at 31 August 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>from the January 2021 <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> census</p>

<ul>
  <li>all pupils in independent schools with an EHC plan or SEN support (provision codes E and K), aged 2 to 18 at 31 August 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>All pupils in the high needs block are counted as 1.0 FTE regardless of their part-time or full-time status. Every relevant pupil with a sole or dual (main) registration is counted.</p>

<p>We do not fund duplicate UPNs in the high needs block. We identify potential duplicate UPN cases and ask authorities to resolve them. If a duplicate remains unresolved, the 1.0 FTE of that pupil is equally divided between the local authorities involved; that is, one pupil between 2 local authorities will result in both authorities receiving a headcount of 0.5.</p>
