<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>You cannot claim capital allowances if you use cash basis, except for cars (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-calculate-your-taxable-profits-hs222-self-assessment-helpsheet"> Helpsheet 222 How to calculate your taxable profits</a>).</p>

<p>From 29 October 2018, a new capital allowance for the qualifying costs of constructing new, non-residential structures or buildings is available (Structures and Buildings Allowance).  To check if you can claim, go to <a class="govuk-link" href="www.gov.uk">GOV.UK</a> and search for ‘capital allowances for structures and buildings’.</p>

<p>If you’re running a business you may need to buy certain items such as tools and equipment to help you to carry out your work. If the items are small in value, for example items of stationery, and used in the day-to-day running of the business, you can claim the cost of these items as trading expenses. You cannot claim capital allowances for any cost that you can claim as a trading expense. There’s more information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/expenses-if-youre-self-employed">expenses if you’re self-employed</a>.</p>

<p>If you buy items that you keep to use in your business, such as plant, machinery, cars tools, equipment, desks or computers, you cannot claim the cost as a trading expense. Instead, you can claim capital allowances.</p>

<p>Capital allowances are available from the date your business starts trading. You can also claim capital allowances for items bought before you started trading, if they were necessary for the business to run.</p>

<p>Capital allowances for items, such as plant, machinery, tools, equipment or computers, are called plant and machinery allowances. Plant and machinery allowances do not cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>items that your business buys and sells as part of its trade (stock)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>furniture, fixtures and equipment in a let residential property, unless it’s a qualifying furnished holiday letting</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>land, buildings and parts of buildings, apart from certain parts of buildings such as electrical, lighting, heating and ventilation systems</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Who can claim plant and machinery allowances</h2>

<p>You can claim plant and machinery allowances if you have a business and you buy assets for that business which you keep to use in that business. You can claim if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>self-employed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a member of a partnership</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a company or organisation that pays Corporation Tax</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a landlord (but not for residential properties that are not holiday lets)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an employee who buys equipment (not cars, vans, motorbikes or bicycles) that you need to do your job, because your employer doesn’t provide the item</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Claiming capital allowances</h2>

<p>You pool (add together) the cost of your item with the cost of any other items bought for business use during the year. Your allowance is worked out on the total amount in the pool, not on the cost of each item.</p>

<h3>What you can put in the pool</h3>

<p>You can include the cost of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the item, less VAT (unless you are unregistered)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>improving large items</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>installing a large item</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the original cost (not interest or charges) of large items bought on hire purchase or other finance methods, such as a loan</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If your item was a gift or you bought it for another purpose (before using it in your business), you do not add its original cost to the pool. Instead you add the market value of the item on the day your business started to use it.</p>

<h2>Types of plant and machinery allowance pools</h2>

<p>There are 3 types of pools where you put the cost of your bought or gifted items.</p>

<h3>Main pool</h3>

<p>Use the main pool for the majority of equipment bought by your business. Do not include cars with high CO2 emissions.</p>

<h3>Special rate pool</h3>

<p>Use the special rate pool for items that cannot go into the main pool, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>certain building fixtures or integral features of buildings, such as electrical systems (wiring), lighting, heating or ventilation systems</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>long life assets – equipment with an expected business life of 25 years or more</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cars with high CO2 emissions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Single asset pools</h3>

<p>Items of equipment (including cars) you use for both business and private purposes do not go into your main or special rate pool. Instead, you put the cost of each into its own single asset pool. If you’re an employee and receive a payment from your employer to cover any fall in the value of an asset you own, you put the asset in a single asset pool and take off your employer’s payment from the pool’s value. (This will reduce your Annual Investment Allowance (<abbr title="Annual Investment Allowance">AIA</abbr>) and writing down allowance (<abbr title="writing down allowance">WDA</abbr>).)</p>

<h2>How much you can claim</h2>

<h3>First year allowances</h3>

<p>You can claim 100% of the cost of specific assets in the tax year that you buy them. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>certain new energy-saving and water efficient equipment - see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/reducing-demand-for-energy-from-industry-businesses-and-the-public-sector--2/supporting-pages/enhanced-capital-allowances-ecas">Energy Technology List</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>new cars with carbon dioxide emissions of 50 gms per km or less</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>certain (new) vehicle gas refueling equipment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>certain (new) vehicle electric charge point equipment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>new zero-emission goods vehicles</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>new plant and machinery for use in designated areas within certain <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enterprise-zones">enterprise zones</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You claim first year allowances before you add the cost of the item to the pool. So, if you claim a first year allowance the amount you add to the pool for that piece of equipment is nil. But if you later sell it, you deduct the price you receive from the pool. This can result in a balancing charge. You start each pool (for every year) with any amount left in it from the previous year.</p>

<h3>Annual Investment Allowance</h3>

<p>If you bought business equipment, you can claim an Annual Investment Allowance (<abbr title="Annual Investment Allowance">AIA</abbr>) to use against your taxable profits for the year you bought it. You cannot claim <abbr title="Annual Investment Allowance">AIA</abbr> for the cost of cars or for items you received as a gift, or for items you bought for another reason before you started to use them in your business.</p>

<p>Trustees or mixed partnerships (partnerships not made up entirely of individuals) cannot claim the <abbr title="Annual Investment Allowance">AIA</abbr>.</p>

<p>To claim <abbr title="Annual Investment Allowance">AIA</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>add the cost of the item to the appropriate pool</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>work out the amount of <abbr title="Annual Investment Allowance">AIA</abbr> you can claim-see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/capital-allowances/annual-investment-allowance">claim capital allowances</a> guidance for details of the maximum allowances</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>take away the <abbr title="Annual Investment Allowance">AIA</abbr> from the amount you added to the pool</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the <abbr title="Annual Investment Allowance">AIA</abbr> rate changed in the period you are claiming for, you need to adjust the amount you can claim. For guidance, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/annual-investment-allowance-limit-changes-during-accounting-periods">Annual investment allowance: limit changes during accounting periods</a></p>

<h3>Writing down allowances.</h3>

<p>Writing down allowances help you reduce (write down) the balance of your pooled costs. The 2 rates are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>main pool rate – 18%</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>special pool rate – 6%</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The rate for a single asset pool item is the same as it would be if the item was in the main or special pool. For example, a computer would be main rate and a car with high CO2 emissions would be special rate.</p>

<h3>Claiming the writing down allowance (<abbr title="writing down allowance">WDA</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Start with any balance left in the pool from the year before:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>add the costs of any items you bought where you have not claimed <abbr title="Annual Investment Allowance">AIA</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>take away the amount you got for any items you sold</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>take away the market value of any items your business stopped using and which you kept for yourself</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This will give you your new pool balance. You can now claim the <abbr title="writing down allowance">WDA</abbr>. This is 18% of the balance in your main pool or 6% of the balance in your special rate pool.</p>

<h3>Small pools allowance</h3>

<p>You can write off all the balance in your main pool or the special rate pool when your pool’s value is £1,000 or less before you work out the <abbr title="writing down allowance">WDA</abbr>. This is called a small pools allowance. You claim this instead of claiming a <abbr title="writing down allowance">WDA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Capital allowances and cars</h2>

<p>There are special rules for claiming capital allowances on the cost of cars. If you bought a car on or after 6 April 2009, the allowance you claim depends on your car’s CO2 emissions. See your V5 certificate or go to <a class="govuk-link" href="http://carfueldata.direct.gov.uk/" rel="external">carfueldata.direct.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>The following tables show the allowances you are due, based on your car’s CO2 emissions, and when you bought your car.</p>

<h2>Short and long life assets</h2>

<h3>Short life assets</h3>

<p>You can choose to put the cost of an item into a single short life asset pool rather than the main pool. If you buy lots of things together such as glasses or cutlery you can add all the expenditure you spent in one go together and put it in to a short life single asset pool. Short life assets do not include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>cars</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>assets used partly for private use</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>items in the special rate pool including integral features</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You work out allowances separately, each year, for items in single asset pools. If you have not disposed of an asset in a short life asset pool after 8 years, you close the short life asset pool and transfer the balance in it to the main pool. You do this by taking away an amount equal to the balance in the short life asset pool so reducing the balance to nil. You then add the same amount to your main pool.</p>

<p>If you sell or dispose of an asset that’s in a short life asset pool before 8 years you will have a balancing allowance or a balancing charge. If you want your asset treated as a short life asset, you need to tell HMRC in writing by one year after 31 January following the end of the tax year that you bought the item in. You cannot change your mind once you have told HMRC.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Example</h3>

<p>You buy a computer in your accounting period ended 31 July 2019 .You must let HMRC know by 31 January 2021 that you want this treated as a short life asset.</p>
</div>

<h3>Long life assets</h3>

<p>These assets are plant and certain machinery which have an expected business life (when new) of 25 years or more. You normally put long life assets into a special rate pool. If your business is your full- time occupation and you spend less than £100,000 on long life assets, you can put this cost into the main pool instead.</p>

<h3>Assets leased out</h3>

<p>You can claim capital allowances (but not first year allowances) if you lease out your assets to other users. This does not include assets leased out on a long-funding lease.</p>

<h3>Fixtures</h3>

<p>If you buy a property from another business, you can only claim allowances for fixtures such as kitchen fittings, electrical or heating systems, if the previous owner had put the costs for the fixtures in a pool. You both must agree how much of the total amount you paid for the property was the cost of the fixtures by making a joint election under section 198 of the Capital Allowances Act 2001.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking of buying, selling or leasing a business property that capital allowances may be available for, you should contact your tax adviser.</p>

<p>When you sell an item after you’ve claimed allowances on its cost, including items that you claimed <abbr title="Annual Investment Allowance">AIA</abbr> for, capital allowances cover the net cost of an item you use in your business. The net cost is the amount it cost you less any amount you get for it (or are treated as getting for it) when you sell it or stop using it in your business.</p>

<h3>Disposals</h3>

<p>When you sell something that you claimed plant and machinery allowances on (including <abbr title="Annual Investment Allowance">AIA</abbr> or first year allowance) you deduct the amount you get for selling it from the balance in your pool before you work out the allowances you can claim for that year.</p>

<p>You also make a deduction if you stop using the item in your business for whatever reason. The amount you deduct depends on why you stopped using it. If it was lost or destroyed you deduct the amount you get from any insurance. If you had no insurance you deduct its market value. If you kept it for yourself or gave it to a family member you deduct the market value.</p>

<h3>Balancing charge</h3>

<p>If you sell an item you claimed capital allowances for, and the sale or value of the item is more than the balance in the pool, you add the difference between the 2 amounts to your taxable profits. This is a balancing charge. You can have a pool even if you have claimed <abbr title="Annual Investment Allowance">AIA</abbr> on all your costs. The balance in the pool can be nil.</p>

<p>If you sell an asset for which you claimed <abbr title="Annual Investment Allowance">AIA</abbr> or first year allowances, and your pool has a zero balance, the amount you sell it for (or its market value if you give it away or use privately) is the balancing charge.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>If you buy a van for £10,000 and sell it 3 years later for £4,000 the net cost to you was £6,000. If you claimed £10,000 <abbr title="Annual Investment Allowance">AIA</abbr> when you bought the van you will have had more allowances than the net cost of it to you. So you have to adjust your allowances when you sell the van. You do this by taking £4,000 off the balance in your pool before you work out the writing down allowances.</p>

<p>If the balance in your pool is more than £4,000 this will reduce the amount before you work out your allowances for the year. If the balance is less than £4,000 you will have a balancing charge equal to the difference between the balance and £4,000. For example, if the balance is £500 the balancing charge will be £3,500 (the difference between £4,000 and £500).</p>

<p>If the balance in your pool is nil, for example because you have claimed <abbr title="Annual Investment Allowance">AIA</abbr> on everything that you have bought, you will have a £4,000 balancing charge that is added to your taxable profits.</p>

<h3>Balancing allowance</h3>

<p>If your business stops trading, you can claim any balance left in the pool after you take away the amounts you get for selling it (or the market value of things you don’t sell) as a balancing allowance.</p>

<p>You take balancing allowances off your taxable profits. You only get a balancing allowance in the main or special rate pool when you stop your business. You can get a balancing allowance in a single asset pool when you sell or dispose of the asset that is in it.</p>

<h2>Accounting periods and capital allowances</h2>

<h3>Accounting periods less than a year</h3>

<p>If your accounting period is less than a calendar year, you reduce the amount of <abbr title="Annual Investment Allowance">AIA</abbr>, small pools allowance and writing down allowance you claim.</p>

<p>For example, if your accounting period is 6 months the maximum <abbr title="Annual Investment Allowance">AIA</abbr> you can claim is £100,000 (6 ÷ 12 × £200,000).</p>

<p>This does not apply to first year allowances.</p>

<h3>Accounting periods longer than a year but less than 18 months</h3>

<p>If your accounting period is more than a calendar year but less than 18 months, the maximum <abbr title="Annual Investment Allowance">AIA</abbr>, small pools allowance and writing down allowance you can claim is increased.</p>

<p>For example, if your accounting period is 17 months your small pools allowance is £1,417 (17 ÷ 12 × £1,000).</p>

<p>This does not apply to first year allowances.</p>

<h3>Accounting periods longer than 18 months</h3>

<p>If your accounting period is longer than 18 months, you need to split this into 2 periods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a 12-month period</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any remaining balance (up to 12 months)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Gaps and overlapping accounting periods</h3>

<p>If there is a gap between your accounting periods, you need to add the gap period to the end of the year in your first accounting period.</p>

<p>If 2 accounting periods overlap each other, add the overlap part to your first accounting period.</p>
