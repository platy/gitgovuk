<p>The following guidance includes calculations.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>You cannot claim capital allowances if you use cash basis, except for on cars. Find out how to calculate your taxable profits in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-calculate-your-taxable-profits-hs222-self-assessment-helpsheet">HS222 How to calculate your taxable profits</a>.</p>

<p>From 29 October 2018, a new capital allowance for the qualifying costs of constructing new, non-residential structures or buildings is available called Structures and Buildings Allowance. Check if you can claim capital allowances for structures and buildings. An enhanced rate of Structures and Buildings Allowance is available for structures and buildings in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enhanced-structures-and-buildings-allowances-in-freeports">Enhanced Structures and Buildings allowances in Freeports</a>.</p>

<p>Until 30 September 2026, for new, non-residential structures or buildings in a designated Freeport tax site, the qualifying costs of construction may qualify for an enhanced rate of structures and buildings allowance. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enhanced-structures-and-buildings-allowances-in-freeports">Enhanced Structures and Buildings allowances in Freeports</a> to check if you can claim enhanced capital allowances for structures and buildings.</p>

<p>If you’re running a business, you may need to buy certain items such as tools and equipment to help you to carry out your work. If the items are small in value, for example items of stationery, and used in the day-to-day running of the business, you can claim the cost of these items as trading expenses. You cannot claim capital allowances for any cost that you can claim as a trading expense. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/expenses-if-youre-self-employed">Expenses if you’re self-employed</a> for more information.</p>

<p>If you buy other plant and machinery that you keep to use in your business, such as cars, tools, equipment, desks or computers, you cannot claim the cost as a trading expense. Instead, you can claim capital allowances.</p>

<p>Capital allowances are available from the date your business starts trading. You can also claim capital allowances for items bought before you started trading, if they were necessary for the business to run.</p>

<p>Capital allowances for plant and machinery, such as tools, equipment or computers, are called plant and machinery allowances. Plant and machinery allowances do not cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>stock — items that your business buys and sells as part of its trade</li>
  <li>furniture, fixtures and equipment in a let residential property, unless it is a qualifying furnished holiday letting</li>
  <li>land, buildings and parts of buildings, apart from certain parts of buildings such as electrical, lighting, heating and ventilation systems</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who can claim plant and machinery allowances</h2>

<p>You can claim plant and machinery allowances if you have a business and you buy assets for that business which you keep to use in that business.</p>

<p>You can claim if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>self-employed</li>
  <li>a partnership</li>
  <li>a company or organisation that pays Corporation Tax</li>
  <li>a landlord — but not for residential properties that are not holiday lets</li>
  <li>an employee who buys equipment that you need to do your job, because your employer does not provide the item — not cars, vans, motorbikes or bicycles</li>
</ul>

<h2>Claiming capital allowances</h2>

<p>You pool (add together) the cost of your item with the cost of any other items bought for business use during the year. Your allowance is worked out on the total amount in the pool, not on the cost of each item.</p>

<h3>What you can put in the pool</h3>

<p>You can include the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cost of the item, less VAT — unless you are unregistered for VAT</li>
  <li>cost of improving plant or machinery</li>
  <li>cost of installing plant or machinery</li>
  <li>original cost (not interest or charges) of plant or machinery bought on hire purchase or other finance methods, such as a loan</li>
</ul>

<p>If your item was a gift, you add to the pool the market value of the item on the day your business started to use it. If you bought the item for another purpose before using it in your business, you add to the pool the lower of the original cost and the market value on the day your business started to use it.</p>

<h2>Types of plant and machinery allowance pools</h2>

<p>There are 3 types of pools where you put the cost of your bought or gifted items.</p>

<h3>Main pool</h3>

<p>Use the main pool for the majority of equipment bought by your business. Do not include cars with high CO2 emissions.</p>

<h3>Special rate pool</h3>

<p>Use the special rate pool for items that cannot go into the main pool, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>certain building fixtures or integral features of buildings, such as electrical systems — wiring, lighting, heating or ventilation systems</li>
  <li>long life assets — equipment with an expected business life of 25 years or more</li>
  <li>cars with high CO2 emissions</li>
  <li>solar panels</li>
</ul>

<h3>Single asset pools</h3>

<p>Items of equipment, including cars, you use for both business and private purposes do not go into your main or special rate pool. Instead, you put the cost of each into its own single asset pool.</p>

<p>If you’re an employee and receive a payment from your employer to cover any fall in the value of an asset you own, you put the asset in a single asset pool and take off your employer’s payment from the pool’s value. (This will reduce your annual investment allowance (<abbr title="annual investment allowance">AIA</abbr>) and writing down allowance (<abbr title="writing down allowance">WDA</abbr>)).</p>

<h2>How much you can claim</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">100% </span> first year allowances</h3>

<p>You can claim 100% of the cost of specific assets in the tax year that you buy them. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>new electric cars and new cars with zero carbon dioxide emissions</li>
  <li>certain new vehicle gas refueling equipment</li>
  <li>certain new vehicle electric charge point equipment</li>
  <li>new zero-emission goods vehicles</li>
  <li>new plant and machinery bought by a company for use in designated areas within certain enterprise zones</li>
  <li>new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enhanced-capital-allowance-for-plant-and-machinery-in-freeports">plant and machinery bought by a company for use in a Freeport tax site</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You claim first year allowances before you add the cost of the item to the pool. So, if you claim a first year allowance the amount you add to the pool for that piece of equipment is nil. But if you later sell it, you deduct the price you receive from the pool. This can result in a balancing charge. You start each pool for every year with any amount left in it from the previous year.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">130% </span> super-deduction</h3>

<p>Companies within the charge to corporation tax can claim 130% of the cost of main rate plant and machinery, except for cars, in the tax year in which the assets are bought. To qualify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the expenditure must be incurred on or after 1 April 2021 and before 1 April 2023 and must not be as a result of a contract entered into before 3 March 2021</li>
  <li>the asset must be unused and not second hand</li>
  <li>it must not be provided for leasing (unless the lease is of background plant or machinery within a building)</li>
</ul>

<p>Companies cannot claim the 130% super-deduction for special rate assets, such as integral features of buildings or structures, solar panels and assets with an expected life of at least 25 years. These may qualify for the 50% special rate allowance instead.</p>

<p>Companies will be liable to a balancing charge if they sell an asset for which a 130% super-deduction has been claimed. The balancing charge may be up to 130% of the disposal value if the sale takes place in a tax year commencing before 1 April 2023.</p>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/capital-allowances-manual/ca23161">Capital Allowance Technical Manual CA23161</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">50% </span> special rate allowance</h3>

<p>Companies within the charge to corporation tax can claim 50% of the cost of special rate plant and machinery, except for cars, in the tax year in which the assets are bought. To qualify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the expenditure must be incurred on or after 1 April 2021 and before 1 April 2023 and must not be as a result of a contract entered into before 3 March 2021</li>
  <li>the asset must be unused and not second hand</li>
  <li>it must not be provided for leasing (unless the lease is of background plant or machinery within a building)</li>
</ul>

<p>Special rate assets include integral features of buildings and structures, solar panels and assets with an expected life of at least 25 years.</p>

<p>The balance of the expenditure after the special rate allowance has been claimed can be added to the special rate pool in the following accounting period.</p>

<p>Companies will be liable to a balancing charge if they sell an asset for which a 50% special rate allowance has been claimed. For example, if a company incurs £100,000 expenditure, claims a 50% special rate allowance of £50,000 in the first year, pools the balance of £50,000 in the second year in the special rate pool, then sells the item for £80,000 in the third year, the company will be liable in the third year to a balancing charge of £40,000, 50% of the £80,000 disposal value. The remaining £40,0000 of the disposal value should be applied to the special rate pool to reduce the balance in that pool. This will result in an additional balancing charge if the pool is reduced to less than zero.</p>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/capital-allowances-manual/ca23161">Capital Allowance Technical Manual CA23161</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Annual investment allowance (<abbr title="annual investment allowance">AIA</abbr>)</h3>

<p>If you bought business equipment, you can claim an <abbr title="annual investment allowance">AIA</abbr> to use against your taxable profits for the year you bought it. You cannot claim <abbr title="annual investment allowance">AIA</abbr> for the cost of cars or for items you received as a gift, or for items you bought for another reason before you started to use them in your business.</p>

<p>Trustees or mixed partnerships (partnerships not made up entirely of individuals) cannot claim the <abbr title="annual investment allowance">AIA</abbr>.</p>

<p>To claim <abbr title="annual investment allowance">AIA</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add the cost of the item to the appropriate pool</li>
  <li>work out the amount of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/capital-allowances/annual-investment-allowance"><abbr title="annual investment allowance">AIA</abbr></a> you can claim</li>
  <li>take away the <abbr title="annual investment allowance">AIA</abbr> from the amount you added to the pool</li>
</ul>

<h3>Writing down allowances</h3>

<p>Writing down allowances help you reduce (write down) the balance of your pooled costs. The 2 rates are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>main pool rate — 18%</li>
  <li>special pool rate — 6%</li>
</ul>

<p>The rate for a single asset pool item is the same as it would be if the item was in the main or special pool. For example, a computer would be main rate and a car with high CO2 emissions would be special rate.</p>

<h3>Claiming the writing down allowance (<abbr title="writing down allowance">WDA</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Start with any balance left in the pool from the year before:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add the costs of any items you bought</li>
  <li>take away the amount you got for any items you sold</li>
  <li>take away the market value of any items your business stopped using and which you kept for yourself</li>
</ul>

<p>This will give you your new pool balance. You can now claim the <abbr title="writing down allowance">WDA</abbr>. This is 18% of the balance in your main pool or 6% of the balance in your special rate pool.</p>

<h3>Small pools allowance</h3>

<p>You can write off all the balance in your main pool or the special rate pool when your pool’s value is £1,000 or less before you work out the <abbr title="writing down allowance">WDA</abbr>. This is called a small pools allowance. You claim this instead of claiming a <abbr title="writing down allowance">WDA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Capital allowances and cars</h2>

<p>There are special rules for claiming capital allowances on the cost of cars. If you bought a car on or after 6 April 2009, the allowance you claim depends on your car’s CO2 emissions. See your V5 certificate or go to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/co2-and-vehicle-tax-tools">Car fuel and CO2 emissions data</a>.</p>

<p>The allowances you can claim depend on your car’s CO2 emissions and when you bought the car. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/capital-allowances/business-cars">Business cars</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Short and long life assets</h2>

<h3>Short life assets</h3>

<p>You can choose to put the cost of an item into a single short life asset pool rather than the main pool. If you buy lots of things together such as glasses or cutlery you can add all the expenditure you spent in one go together and put it in to a short life single asset pool.</p>

<p>Short life assets do not include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cars</li>
  <li>assets used partly for private use</li>
  <li>items in the special rate pool, including integral features</li>
</ul>

<p>You work out allowances separately, each year, for items in single asset pools. If you have not disposed of an asset in a short life asset pool after 8 years, you close the short life asset pool and transfer the balance in it to the main pool. You do this by taking away an amount equal to the balance in the short life asset pool so reducing the balance to nil. You then add the same amount to your main pool.</p>

<p>If you sell or dispose of an asset that’s in a short life asset pool before the end of 8 years you will have a balancing allowance or a balancing charge. If you want your asset treated as a short life asset, you need to tell HMRC in writing by one year after 31 January following the end of the tax year that you bought the item in if you pay income tax or no later than 2 years after the end of the chargeable period if you pay corporation tax. You cannot change your mind once you have told us.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>You are self-employed and you buy a computer in your accounting period ended 5 April 2021. You must let HMRC know by 31 January 2023 that you want this treated as a short life asset.</p>

<h3>Long life assets</h3>

<p>These assets are plant and machinery which have an expected business life (when new) of 25 years or more. You normally put long life assets into a special rate pool. If your business is your full-time occupation and you spend less than £100,000 on long life assets, you can put this cost into the main pool instead.</p>

<h3>Assets leased out</h3>

<p>You can claim capital allowances if you lease out your assets to other users — but not first year allowances. This does not include assets leased out on a long-funding lease.</p>

<h3>Fixtures</h3>

<p>If you buy a property from another business, you can only claim allowances for fixtures such as kitchen fittings, electrical or heating systems, if the previous owner had put the costs for the fixtures in a pool and if you both agree how much of the total amount you paid for the property relates to the fixtures, usually by making a joint election under section 198 of the Capital Allowances Act 2001.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking of buying, selling or leasing a business property that capital allowances may be available for, you should contact your tax adviser.</p>

<h3>Disposals</h3>

<p>When you sell something that you claimed plant and machinery allowances on (including <abbr title="annual investment allowance">AIA</abbr> or first year allowance) you usually deduct the amount you get for selling it from the balance in your pool before you work out the allowances you can claim for that year.</p>

<p>You also make a deduction if you stop using the item in your business for whatever reason. The amount you deduct depends on why you stopped using it. If it was lost or destroyed, you deduct the amount you get from any insurance. If you had no insurance, you deduct its market value. If you kept it for yourself or gave it to a family member you deduct the market value.</p>

<p>There are special rules for disposals of assets by companies that have claimed the super-deduction or special rate allowances. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/capital-allowances-manual/ca23161">Capital Allowance Technical Manual CA23161</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Balancing charge</h3>

<p>If you sell an item you claimed capital allowances for, and the sale or value of the item is more than the balance in the pool, you add the difference between the 2 amounts to your taxable profits. This is a balancing charge. You can have a pool even if you have claimed <abbr title="annual investment allowance">AIA</abbr> on all your costs. The balance in the pool can be nil.</p>

<p>If you sell an asset for which you claimed <abbr title="annual investment allowance">AIA</abbr> or first year allowances, and your pool has a zero balance, the amount you sell it for or its market value if you give it away or use privately, is the balancing charge. If a company sells or disposes of an asset for which it has claimed the 130% super-deduction or 50% special rate allowance, a balancing charge will always arise. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/capital-allowances-manual/ca23161">Capital Allowance Technical Manual CA23161</a> for more information.</p>

<p>If a company sells or disposes of an asset for which it has claimed the 130% super-deduction or 50% special rate allowance, a balancing charge will always arise. Read Capital Allowance Technical Manual <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/capital-allowances-manual/ca23161">CA23161</a> for more information.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>If you buy a van for £10,000 and sell it 3 years later for £4,000 the net cost to you was £6,000. If you claimed £10,000 <abbr title="annual investment allowance">AIA</abbr> when you bought the van you will have had more allowances than the net cost of it to you, so you have to adjust your allowances when you sell the van. You do this by taking £4,000 off the balance in your pool before you work out the <abbr title="writing down allowance">WDA</abbr>.</p>

<p>If the balance in your pool is more than £4,000 this will reduce the amount before you work out your allowances for the year. If the balance is less than £4,000 you will have a balancing charge equal to the difference between the balance and £4,000. For example, if the balance is £500 the balancing charge will be £3,500, which is the difference between £4,000 and £500.</p>

<p>If the balance in your pool is nil, for example because you have claimed <abbr title="annual investment allowance">AIA</abbr> on everything that you have bought, you will have a £4,000 balancing charge that is added to your taxable profits.</p>

<h3>Balancing allowance</h3>

<p>If your business stops trading, you can claim any balance left in the pool after you take away the amounts you get for selling it, or the market value of things you do not sell, as a balancing allowance.</p>

<p>You take balancing allowances off your taxable profits. You only get a balancing allowance in the main or special rate pool when you stop your business. You can get a balancing allowance in a single asset pool when you sell or dispose of the asset that is in it.</p>

<h2>Accounting periods and capital allowances</h2>

<h3>Accounting periods less than a year</h3>

<p>If your accounting period is less than a calendar year, you reduce the amount of <abbr title="annual investment allowance">AIA</abbr>, small pools allowance and <abbr title="writing down allowance">WDA</abbr> you claim.</p>

<p>For example, if the <abbr title="annual investment allowance">AIA</abbr> limit is £200,000 and your accounting period is 6 months, the maximum <abbr title="annual investment allowance">AIA</abbr> you can claim is £100,000 (6 ÷ 12 × £200,000).</p>

<p>This does not apply to first year allowances.</p>

<h3>Accounting periods longer than a year but less than 18 months</h3>

<p>If your accounting period is more than a calendar year but less than 18 months, the maximum <abbr title="annual investment allowance">AIA</abbr>, small pools allowance and <abbr title="writing down allowance">WDA</abbr> you can claim is increased.</p>

<p>For example, if your accounting period is 17 months your small pools allowance is £1,417 (17 ÷ 12 × £1,000).</p>

<p>This does not apply to first year allowances.</p>

<h3>Accounting periods longer than 18 months</h3>

<p>If your accounting period is longer than 18 months, you need to split this into 2 periods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a 12-month period</li>
  <li>any remaining balance — up to 12 months</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gaps and overlapping accounting periods</h3>

<p>If there is a gap between your accounting periods, you need to add the gap period to the end of the year in your first accounting period.</p>

<p>If two accounting periods overlap each other, add the overlap part to your first accounting period.</p>
