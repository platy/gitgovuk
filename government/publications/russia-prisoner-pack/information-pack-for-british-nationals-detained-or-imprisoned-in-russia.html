<span class="number">1. </span>Chapter 1: Key Points</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Overview</h3>
<p>If you are a British national, and are arrested or detained in another country, consular staff will do what they can to help you. However, we cannot interfere with the local justice system, get you out of jail, or pay for services such as a lawyer. Information about who we can help, including the circumstances in which we can assist dual nationals, is available at: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-british-nationals-abroad-a-guide">Support for British nationals abroad</a></p>

<p>This information pack aims to give you, and your family and friends, information about the local system in Russia and who can help. Consular staff can provide a printed copy to those in prison or in custody. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.contact-embassy.service.gov.uk/?country=Russia&amp;post=British%20Embassy%20Moscow" rel="external">We welcome feedback to help us improve the information we can provide to others</a>.</p>

<h4>Contacting us</h4>

<p>If you are arrested or detained in another country:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the authorities should ask whether you want them to contact the British Embassy Moscow or British Consulate General Ekaterinburg (and must do so if you want them to)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if they do not ask, you can make the request yourself. You should do this if you are charged with a serious offence or need any kind of assistance</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>-*friends or family can also contact the British Embassy Moscow, British Consulate General Ekaterinburg or the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) in London on +44 (0)20 7008 5000</p>

<p>In some countries, the authorities might notify the British Embassy or Consulate  even if you do not want anyone to know that you have been arrested. This is because there may be an agreement in place with the British government which requires a mandatory notification to be made.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>First Steps</h3>

<h4>Informing family members</h4>

<p>If you want us to, we can tell your family or friends that you have been detained and provide them with information about how to contact you. With your consent, we can also keep them updated on your wellbeing.</p>

<p>If you are not sure about informing your family, we can help you consider what the impact of not doing so might be. For example, it may cause them distress if they do not know where you are, or cannot contact you. It can also be a disadvantage to you if you need someone to send you money or act on your behalf while you are detained.</p>

<h4>Informing the UK police</h4>

<p>If you are accused of certain serious offences, such as sexual assault or drugs trafficking, we are obliged to share information about your arrest with UK police. Information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer. There may be other circumstances when information about you may need to be shared with authorities in Russia.</p>

<h4>Legal assistance: lawyers</h4>

<p>We cannot give legal advice, start legal proceedings, or investigate a crime. However, we can provide information about the local legal system, including whether a legal aid scheme is available. We can also give you <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/russia-list-of-translators-and-interpreters/list-of-translators-interpreters-in-russia">a list of local interpreters</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/russia-list-of-lawyers/list-of-lawyers">a list of local English-speaking lawyers</a>. See also Chapter 4: Additional information for contact details of local NGOs which may be able to provide pro bono legal assistance. You should consider the benefits of local legal representation and discuss all the costs beforehand with the legal representative. We cannot pay your legal or interpretation costs in any circumstance. If you are unable to commission a defence lawyer, the Russian law entitles you to pro bono legal representation by a state-appointed local lawyer.</p>

<h4>Consular assistance: fair treatment</h4>
<p>We cannot get you out of prison or detention, or get you special treatment because you are British. If you are not treated in line with internationally accepted standards, we will consider whether to approach the local authorities. This may include if your trial does not follow internationally recognised standards or is unreasonably delayed compared to local cases.</p>

<h4>Other organisations that can provide assistance</h4>
<p>We can put you, or your family, in touch with <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a> a UK charity which supports British citizens detained overseas and their families.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Chapter 2: Detention conditions in Russia</h3>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>Visits: friends and family</h3>

<h4>Who can visit and how to arrange visits</h4>

<p>A prisoner on remand can have up to two visits by family members or other persons each month, with each visit lasting up to three hours. Prior written permission from the authority in charge of the criminal case is required for each visit. The details of the visitors need to be included in the permission. No more than two adults can visit at one time, and children may or may not be allowed to accompany them. A sentenced prisoner, whose sentence has not yet begun, needs to request permission for a visit from the court which held the trial of their case. A sentenced prisoner serving their term needs to request permission for a visit from the prison governor. Sentenced prisoners are entitled to short (four hours) and long (three days on prison premises or five days outside of prison) visits. The exact number of visits depends on the category of sentence and may vary from two to six short visits and from one to six long visits a year. The short visits are for both family and friends, but the long ones are for the immediate family only. Lawyers have unlimited visits with no limitations on how long they spend with their clients. A prison member of staff is normally present throughout a visit so they can observe but not hear the prisoner and the lawyer.</p>

<h4>What to expect when you visit</h4>

<p>Visitors need to present their photo IDs (passports) upon arrival. Visitors will be security checked. Electronic and potentially dangerous items, as well as cameras and video cameras, audio recorders and copiers are not allowed on prison premises. Visitors under the influence of alcohol or drugs and those not listed in the visit permission are not allowed in. A visit may start late or participants may be requested to keep it shorter than three hours. A visit may be terminated if the visitors attempt to pass any forbidden items, food or substances or share any information on the criminal case. Visits take place in a special meeting room. The visitors and the prisoner are normally separated by a glass partition, while they can clearly see and hear each other. The conditions and equipment in meeting rooms may vary depending on the facility. The visits by family members or friends can only take place with a prison member of staff present who are able to observe and hear the visitors and the prisoner. Further restrictions may be placed on visitation conditions in emergency situations like an infectious disease epidemic in Russia.</p>

<h4>What you can take on your visit</h4>

<p>At a remand prison, a detainee is allowed to receive food and other items of the total weight not exceeding 30 kg per month. Visitors need to take all items to a specially designated reception room either before or after the visit, as they are not allowed to pass them directly to the prisoner. The list of acceptable and prohibited items is normally displayed in the reception room or on the central prison authority website and may vary depending on a facility. A visitor will need to complete three copies of the inventory form and pass these together with their ID and the items for the prisoner to a prison staff member. All items will be checked by prison staff, those not accepted will be returned to the visitor. The following items may be accepted: food, toiletries, clothing and footwear (except military uniform), writing supplies, books/magazines/newspapers in the Russian language. All printed materials are checked, those in a foreign language are unlikely to be allowed. Only the medicine prescribed by a prison doctor can be accepted.</p>

<h4>Visits: consular staff</h4>

<p>British Embassy Moscow consular staff normally visit a prisoner once every six months. The frequency of consular visits is based on a prisoner’s vulnerability. If the consular team becomes aware of any substantial deterioration of a prisoner’s health or wellbeing, gross mistreatment or human rights violation, a scheduled consular visit may be brought forward. Consular staff normally agree the schedule of their visits with a prisoner at their first contact. Normally, a prisoner on remand is able to submit a request for the ad hoc consular visit to the authority in charge of their criminal case, and a sentenced prisoner – to the prison authority. The authorities should communicate the request for a visit to us in good time. There is no need for a prisoner to submit a request for a scheduled visit, as we will do that. Foreign prisoners on remand have a right to make phone calls to their consulate and family/friends. A call can only be made with prior written approval of the authority in charge of the case/ the prison authority and at the prisoner’s own expense. The call is also subject to technical capacity of the prison, and availability of an interpreter as the prison staff are required to monitor prisoners’ calls. You can write to us at any time on matters of concern at:</p>

<p>British Embassy Moscow/Consular Section</p>

<p>10, Smolenskaya Naberezhnaya, Moscow 121099</p>

<p>C/o Consular Section</p>

<p>For a prisoner on remand, all their incoming/outgoing mail is subject to censorship by the respective authority. Mail in a language other than Russian requires translation into Russian. Russian law sets no limit on the time taken by the authority to translate the mail. This may lead to a substantial delay in the delivery of mail to/from a prisoner on remand.</p>

<h4>Emergency trips outside of prison</h4>

<p>Emergency trips outside of prison in Russia may be possible for sentenced prisoners only. This depends on the category of a prisoner’s sentence, the prisoner’s personal circumstances and the type of emergency (illness or death of a close relative, natural disaster affecting the prisoner’s family). A prisoner needs to submit a written request for an emergency trip to the prison governor, who is responsible to consider it within one day. If the trip is allowed, the cost of the trip will be borne by the prisoner. An emergency trip outside Russia is not possible.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span>Police custody and initial arrival at prison</h3>

<h4>Arriving at the police station: your basic rights</h4>

<p>A person can be detained by Russian police for up to 48 hours at a police station. It is not likely a bed or a shower will be available during this time. A detainee should be immediately released following the end of the 48 hour period, unless there has been a subsequent court decision, which agreed ongoing custody as a restriction measure.</p>

<p>The basic rights of a detainee are set out in the Russian Criminal Procedure Code 174-FZ and Russian Federal law ‘On police’ FZ-3 of 07/02/2011. A detained foreign national has the right to pro bono legal representation and translation effective immediately.</p>

<p>A detainee has the right to make one phone call within three hours from the moment of detention. The call can only be made in the Russian language with a police officer present. The calls are limited to domestic numbers. Police are responsible for the completion of a detention report in Russian providing the details of detention. The report is to be co-signed by both the detaining police officer and the detainee. The detainee has the right not to sign the report if there are any concerns about its content. The detainee receives a copy of the report. Normally, the investigator in charge is responsible for notifying the nearest diplomatic mission of their nationals detention, within twelve hours from the time of detention. However, this requirement may be waived at the investigator’s request as agreed by the prosecution.</p>

<p>Following the initial detention, a court, at the investigator’s request, may decide to put a detainee on remand for up to three months at a time. If this happens, the detainee is transferred from the police station to a remand prison. The total detention on remand can’t normally exceed eighteen months. After that, a detainee on remand should appear before the judge or be released.</p>

<p>The initial period of remand may be extended by court at the investigator’s request for up to three months at a time. The total detention on remand can’t normally exceed eighteen months. After that, a detainee should appear before the judge or be released.</p>

<p>The basic rights of a detainee are set out in the Russian Federal law “On detention of suspected and accused of committing a crime” 103-FZ of 15/07/1995 and the subsequent Order of the Ministry of Justice N189 of 14/10/2005 ‘On internal regulations at pre-trial detention centres’.</p>

<p>Access to food, water, sanitation facilities, a bed and basic medical services will be provided at a remand prison, although these may not be in accordance with the UK standards. An inventory of a detainee’s belongings, including money and valuable items will be completed and put on file.</p>

<p>A detainee on remand is provided with a bed, bedding and a weekly change of bed linen, towel, utensils and cutlery, basic toiletries, and receives three hot meals a day. They can shower once a week. Detainees can receive an unlimited number of posted parcels and hand-delivered parcels up to 30 kg per month. Detainees can send and receive mail by post without any limit. Detainees can make phone calls. The detailed information on parcels, mail and phone calls is provided at Section: Prison: conditions and daily life of this document. A detainee can see a prison doctor upon request, but the medical services available at remand prisons are basic. A detainee can receive money on their prison account to cover the cost of their phone calls or purchase basic items at a prison shop. Cash can’t be taken to or otherwise made available to detainees.</p>

<p>Normally, a detainee on remand is entitled to one walk a day outdoors, on the prison premises, for no less than one hour.</p>

<p>A detainee can have visits from family/friends. The details on visitation procedure are provided at the section: Prison: conditions and daily life of this document.</p>

<p>A detainee on remand can lodge a verbal or written proposal, a statement or a complaint with the prison administration, including about any breach of their rights. Any verbal appeal is registered in the journal and signed off by the requesting detainee. Response to a verbal appeal is normally given within five days, and a written appeal – within ten days.</p>

<p>A detainee on remand has a right to appeal to external bodies, including state prosecution, court, human rights ombudsmen, European Court for Human Rights. Such appeals should be forwarded to the recipients by the prison authority uncensored. The appeals to non-government organisations, other state bodies and the detainee’s legal representative will be forwarded to the recipients within three days. A detainee will bear the respective postal charges, unless they have no credit on their account. In the last instance, the cost will be borne by prison.</p>

<h4>Appearing at court</h4>

<p>In Russia court is the only authority which has a legal right to find someone guilty of a crime and sentence them. Once the investigation into the alleged crime is complete, the investigating authority forwards the case to the state prosecutor who, in turn, forwards the case to court. The court will schedule a hearing/trial.</p>

<p>Russian court follows an adversarial process. The parties to court proceedings include prosecution (a state prosecutor, and an investigator, among other), defence (a suspect and their defence lawyer, among other) and third parties (witnesses, experts, etc.). The suspect has a right to refuse services of a pro-bono state-appointed defence lawyer and hire a paid one. The suspect also has a right to refuse any legal representation.</p>

<p>Russian court proceedings are conducted in the Russian language. The lawyers in Russia (provided by the state or privately hired) are not required to speak a foreign language, including English.</p>

<p>A person charged with a crime has a right to make a statement at the trial, file a complaint, testify, speak at the trial and familiarise themselves with their case file materials. If an indicted foreigner does not have a good command of the Russian language, they have a right to speak their own language and are entitled to use pro bono services of a state-appointed interpreter. Any court proceeding with participation of a non-Russian speaking party includes a court-appointed interpreter.</p>

<p>More information about the Russian judicial system can be found in Chapter 3.</p>

<h4>Initial arrival at the prison</h4>

<p>Once a prison sentence has come into force, the convicted person together with their personal file and belongings will be transferred from the remand prison to a penal colony/prison within a ten day period. The time spent on remand counts toward the sentence time.</p>

<p>If the convicted person is a foreign national, the prison authority is responsible to notify their diplomatic mission of their arrival to the premises.</p>

<p>Upon arrival at the prison, a prisoner is searched and then examined by a medical specialist. The inventory of all prisoner’s belongings is made and put on file. The items not allowed to be kept by the prisoner, including money and other valuables, and any belongings in excess of 50 kg, are confiscated by the prison authorities. The prisoner will not have any access to these until the time of their release.</p>

<p>The prisoner undergoes sanitation and is placed in a holding cell for fifteen days for infection control purposes. A prisoner, their belongings and the cell where they are accommodated may be searched at any point. Prisoners have a right to make phone calls up to 15 minutes long, but only at their own expense. For every call, a prisoner needs to submit a prior written request to the prison authority specifying the number/other details of the person he/she wants to call and the language of the call. Once the permission is granted, a call can be made. Depending on the specific prison’s technical capacity, the calls may or may not be limited to domestic numbers within the country. The calls may be monitored by the prison authority. Normally, a British national prisoner should be able to call the Embassy or Consulate in Russia.</p>

<p>The prison authority provides a prisoner with a uniform for inmates and basic toiletries. Inmates are not allowed to use their own clothing.</p>

<p>In Russian prisons, emergency medical services are available to prisoners 24/7. A prisoner with a chronic health condition requiring medication needs to inform the prison doctor about this, upon arrival in prison, as they will not be able to bring and use their own medicine with them. The medicine is normally provided by the prison, but it may be locally manufactured. The medicine may also be provided by family /friends but only with a prior approval of the prison doctor. The medicine provided by external parties can only be taken under the direct observation of a prison health specialist.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span>Prison: conditions and daily life</h3>

<p>The penal system in Russia is run by the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) which is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice. The prison conditions and prisoners’ rights and responsibilities are set out in the Russian Criminal Enforcement Code and Russian Ministry of Justice Order N295 of 16/12/16 ‘On internal regulations at penal institutions’.</p>

<p>As of June 2021 Russia had the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonstudies.org/highest-to-lowest/prison-population-total?field_region_taxonomy_tid=All" rel="external">fifth highest prison population in the world</a> after the United States, China, Brazil and India.  According to&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://fsin.gov.ru/structure/inspector/iao/statistika/Kratkaya%20har-ka%20UIS/" rel="external">FSIN official data</a> on 1 June 2022 there were 466,957 people held in remand prisons (pre-trial detention centres, or СИЗО) and penal colonies in Russia.</p>

<p>Prisoners serve their sentences in corrective colonies (исправительная колония), prisons (тюрьма), correctional colonies (воспитательная колония) or treating corrective facilities (лечебные исправительные учреждения). Corrective colonies include colony settlements (колония-поселение), general colonies (колония общего режима), high-security colonies (колония строгого режима) and special colonies (колония особого режима). Depending on one’s sentence and circumstances, three imprisonment regimes may apply in each type of a colony: standard, flexible and strict. There are also 132&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://fsin.gov.ru/structure/inspector/iao/statistika/Kratkaya%20har-ka%20UIS/" rel="external">hospitals for prisoners run by FSIN</a>.</p>

<p>The type of penal institution where a convicted person is to serve their sentence is provided in the judge’s verdict. The decision as to which penal institution a prisoner will be sent is taken by FSIN.</p>

<p>According to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/prison/home/-/asset_publisher/5AOIbVuWiNWj/content/council-of-europe-s-annual-penal-statistics-covid-19-pandemic-helped-reduce-europe-s-prison-population?inheritRedirect=false&amp;redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coe.int%2Fen%2Fweb%2Fprison%2Fhome%3Fp_p_id%3D101_INSTANCE_5AOIbVuWiNWj%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-1%26p_p_col_pos%3D1%26p_p_col_count%3D3" rel="external">the&nbsp;Council of Europe</a>, in 2021 the incarceration rate in Russia (the number of prisoners per 100,000 population) was 328 –the highest in Europe. The current number of inmates in Russia’s prisons is among the lowest in the country’s history and has been gradually declining over recent years. Over a decade ago, the number of prisoners in Russia was almost double the present figure (893,000 in 2008). The decrease in the number of inmates has mainly been linked to the fact that the courts pronounce prison sentences for minor crimes less frequently and tend to apply other penalties, such as&nbsp;[non-custodial sentences or community service](https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/osw-commentary/2019-02-07/russia-behind-bars-peculiarities-russian-prison-system#_ftn1](https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/osw-commentary/2019-02-07/russia-behind-bars-peculiarities-russian-prison-system#_ftn1). In 2020&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://wp.unil.ch/space/files/2021/04/210330_FinalReport_SPACE_I_2020.pdf" rel="external">the Russian government spent</a> €2.63 per inmate/per day – the minimum in Europe, while Russia’s penitentiary system budget was €3.7 billion – second highest in Europe after the UK.</p>

<p>The conditions in penitentiary institutions are impacted by the poor state of the infrastructure mostly built before 1970 and remain among the worst in Europe.</p>

<p>Non-governmental organisations (NGO)&nbsp;working on prison conditions, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://en.desk-russie.eu/2021/11/12/the-russian-prison-system.html" rel="external">report that torture and other ill-treatment continues to be a problem in certain corrective colonies, and impunity for the perpetrators is near-total</a>. This is also confirmed by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/media_2022/01/World%20Report%202022%20web%20pdf_0.pdf" rel="external">Human Right Watch World Report 2022</a>.</p>

<p>Corruption in Russian prisons is wide-spread. One’s actual detention conditions may depend on their financial status and connections in the criminal world. This is evidenced by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://meduza.io/feature/2018/08/09/vse-soobscheniya-o-pytkah-etogo-goda-v-odnoy-tablitse-ih-uzhe-bolshe-polusotni" rel="external">reports of&nbsp;Russian media and human rights activists</a>.</p>

<p>On&nbsp;15 March 2022, Russia announced its withdrawal from the Council of Europe under Article 7. On 16 March, the Committee of Ministers decided to expel Russia with immediate effect. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://takiedela.ru/notes/menshe-zashhity-prav/" rel="external">Russian human rights experts noted</a> that Russia’s discontinued membership at the CoE with their subsequent denunciation of ECHR and the exit from the ECtHR jurisdiction are expected to exacerbate the problem of human rights violations.</p>

<p>There is now a system for public monitoring of prison conditions in Russia. It was introduced in 2008 based on the UK model of Independent Monitoring Boards.</p>

<h4>Accommodation</h4>
<p>In Russia, separate prison facilities are used for sentenced prisoners (colonies and prisons) and those on remand (pre-trial detention centres).</p>

<p>In pre-trial detention centres, a cell normally accommodates one or several persons.</p>

<p>In corrective colonies prisoners are accommodated in barracks with the capacity of twenty beds or more, and are expected to work until they reach retirement age. Prisoners serving their sentences in colony settlements are also accommodated in barracks, but are allowed to move freely within the confines of the settlement during the day, and may live with their families on the territory of the settlement.</p>

<p>There are eight prisons in Russia where prisoners are confined to cells. These accommodate prisoners convicted for most severe crimes, those in breach of their ongoing sentence regime or sentenced for life, and repeat offenders.</p>

<p>Overcrowding of prisons in Russia is gradually becoming less of a problem. Russia is among the low-density prison population countries in Europe with its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://wp.unil.ch/space/files/2022/05/Aebi-Cocco-Molnar-Tiago_2022__SPACE-I_2021_FinalReport_220404.pdf" rel="external">penitentiary institutions loaded to 66.6% of their capacity in&nbsp;2021</a>. Each prisoner is provided with a separate bed, a mattress, a pillow and a blanket. Bedding is usually changed on a weekly basis.</p>

<p>There are normally washbasins, electricity and running cold water in the cells/barracks. Cells/barracks may or may not have hot water, and most of them have natural light. Cells/barracks are normally heated from October until May.</p>

<h4>Food and Diet</h4>
<p>Normally, prisoners are entitled to three hot meals a day. The diet includes carbohydrates, fats and proteins. It is based on the calorific intake sufficient to sustain human health, but tends to be bland and lacking fresh vegetables/fruits or dairy products. Those with severe health issues/disabilities, adolescents and pregnant women are entitled to an improved diet. The prison diet does not cater to specific religious or lifestyle needs. Prisoners can supplement their diet by buying food from a prison shop with the money from their private prison account. However, there is a limit to the amount of money one can spent each month, depending on the detention regime. The food can also be brought or sent by family/friends, although there are multiple restrictions on what can/can’t be brought, and they vary depending on a specific facility. There is also a limit to the number/weight of parcels which a prisoner is entitled to, and it depends on the detention regime.</p>

<p>In Russian prisons, tap water is normally used for drinking, but the quality of water may vary depending on the geographic region.</p>

<h4>Hygiene</h4>
<p>Barracks or cells normally have running cold water, but may or may not have hot water. There is usually a schedule to take hot showers at a prison facility. A prisoner can take a shower at least twice a week, while their underwear and bedding should be changed weekly. The shower facilities are communal.</p>

<p>Conditions at shower stalls and toilets may vary depending on a specific facility, and may be substandard at the older facilities.</p>

<p>Basic toiletries are provided by prison administrations and include soap, tooth paste/tooth brush, toilet paper, shaving razors for men and hygienic supplies for women. Basic toiletries are normally available at prison shops.</p>

<h4>Work and Study</h4>

<p>Work is compulsory for prisoners, and the type/place of work available is determined by the prison administration. Due consideration should be given to one’s psychical capacity, age and health conditions. Any work can be carried out at the prison premises only. The prisoners are supposed to be paid for their work, with their pay transferred to their personal prison accounts. The size of pay may vary depending on a type/amount of work done. The cost of prisoner sustenance is subtracted from their monthly pay. Regardless of the actual cost, a minimum of 25% pay should still be transferred to their accounts.</p>

<p>The working hours are defined in accordance with the Russian labour law and are normally 6-8 hours per day with a break for a hot meal, five-six days a week. The exact working schedule is set by the prison administration. Working prisoners are entitled to an annual leave from work of 12 working days. Prisoners usually work at the manufacturing facilities located at the prison premises. These usually include manufacturing of clothes or spare parts for machinery, wood processing or working at a prison kitchen.</p>

<p>Prisoners may be requested by the prison administration to work pro bono on repairing and renovating prison premises.</p>

<p>Vocational training courses with a subsequent qualification are normally available at Russian prisons. Prison administrations are expected to support those prisoners, who wish to be enrolled in postal studies, within the limits set by the prison infrastructure. Prisoners should be able to speak Russian to get enrolled in either. Enrolling in postal studies with a foreign institution/in a foreign language is normally not allowed.</p>

<h4>Contact and languages</h4>
<p>In most colonies, contact with other inmates is not restricted, while it may be restricted in prisons or special colonies. Contact with other inmates may also be restricted for those subjected to disciplinary actions due to breach of prison regulations. The prisoner is then relocated to a disciplinary cell or a single person cell for a certain amount of time.</p>

<p>A prisoner may or may not be put in a barrack/cell with other English–speaking inmates. This depends on the goodwill of the prison administration and availability of space. Prison guards are not required to speak a foreign language, including English. Some of them may have very basic English-language skills obtained as part of their secondary school education. Prisons do not offer language classes for non-Russian speaking inmates. Access to mobile phones is prohibited in Russian prisons. Internet access is also not available. Prisoners are able to make phone calls at their own expense using designated prison land-lines. These may or may not include international calls depending on prison’s technical capacity.</p>

<p>Prisoners can use writing supplies purchased at their own expense or brought by family/friends. Prisoners can send and receive letters by post. All incoming and outgoing correspondence is subject to censorship.</p>

<p>Prisons normally have libraries, but the assortment of books may be limited and it may not include books in foreign languages. Prisoners can order English-language books from outside, but these will have to be censored by the prison authority before being handed over. No books depicturing crimes, violence, political issues, inciting hatred or conflicts or including erotic or pornographic materials are allowed on the prison premises.</p>

<p>Prisoners are allowed to watch a television provided by prison administration and shared by inmates. Prisoners can’t have their own TV or radio sets.</p>

<p>Getting enrolled in studies, demonstrating good results at work and taking part in social activities in prison is seen positively by the prison authorities and reflected on the prisoner’s record accordingly.</p>

<p>You can request local language materials through the post from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a>(including language textbooks and dictionaries).</p>

<h4>Exercise</h4>
<p>In colonies, prisoners are permitted to go outdoors within the prison premises and move around during the day: to/from work - in a group accompanied by prison guards, or unaccompanied during their free time. Prisoners are not allowed to leave their barracks at night. Movement around premises is restricted for the prisoners in special colonies/prisons, those serving in other types of colonies under strict regimes or subjected to disciplinary actions. Those under strict imprisonment conditions are allowed an hour long walk at a specially designated outdoor area. Depending on their type/regime as well as their infrastructure, prisons may have sport facilities available to prisoners and organize regular group exercises for inmates.</p>

<h4>Climate</h4>
<p>Russia is a vast country occupying many climatic zones, and the weather conditions vary a great deal across Russia. Climate in central Russia is somewhat similar to that of the UK in the summer and several degrees colder in the usually snowy winter, while the north of Russia is known for their harsh winters with the temperature dropping down to -30 C or lower. For the winter, prisoners are provided with a set of warm clothing, which they can supplement with their own warm underwear.</p>

<h4>Religion</h4>
<p>Prisoners are free to take part in religious services of their choice or refrain from any religious activities. Prisoners are allowed to have religious books and items and conduct religious ceremonies. Prisoners have a right to the unrestricted number of up to two hour individual meetings with a clergyman of their choice. Normally, a prison member of staff is present at such meetings. If requested by the prisoner and agreed by the clergyman, the meeting can be held so prison staff could observe but not listen into it. Only the representatives from the officially registered confessions are allowed onto prison premises.</p>

<p>In Russia there are no religious ministers among prison staff.</p>

<h4>Rules and regulations (including drugs)</h4>

<p>Upon arrival in a penal facility, a prisoner is placed in a quarantine ward for up to fifteen days. While there, the prisoner is given a summary of prison rules and regulations, their own rights and responsibilities, daily schedule, fire safety instructions as well as possible sanctions for breaching any of these. A foreign national prisoner is also informed of their right to request a transfer to their home country. The prisoner has to sign to say they have read all the above. Possible punishment for breaching the prison regulations include a verbal reprimand, a fine, a transfer to solitary confinement for up to fifteen days. Repeat offenders may be transferred from barracks to cells for up to one year, or to solitary confinement for up to six months. Such punishment is also complemented by temporary restriction of access to phone calls, visits, shopping in a prison store, receipt of parcels, and outdoor walks. According to the Russian Criminal Enforcement Code, the most severe violations of prison regulations include use of psychoactive substances, threats or disobedience to prison staff, manufacturing of prohibited items, dodging of forced treatment, staging or participating in riots, homosexual relations and refusal to work. Communities of inmates in Russian prisons frequently have a vertical hierarchy with a leader inmate and are self-governed. They often have their own code of honour, rules and regulations established or forced upon the inmates.</p>

<p>A prisoner can earn privileges for good behaviour. These include verbal or written acknowledgements, and up to four additional visits and parcels a year. Those subjected to earlier disciplinary action may also have the privileges annulled.</p>

<p>Prisoners guilty of drug-related crimes constitute a major share of inmates in Russian prison.&nbsp;In 2018, they accounted for 28% of all prisoners, while the majority of those were drug users rather than dealers or manufacturers.</p>

<p>Despite the strict prohibition, drugs may be available in Russian prisons through corrupt prison personnel or smuggling. The repeat use of the same syringes by different people leads to high incidence of HIV and hepatitis among prisoners. Drug replacement therapy is not available in Russian prisons. Smuggling, use or trade of drugs are among the most severe breaches of prison regulations. While prisoners are routinely tested for HIV and hepatitis, testing for drugs may or may not be available.</p>

<p>While safety of prisoners in Russia in general is a paramount concern, it is less so for foreign prisoners from the western countries, as their imprisonment is highly scrutinised by their respective diplomatic missions. In case a foreign prisoner has a concern over their safety or wellbeing, they have a right to raise this with the prison authority verbally or in writing, their lawyer during a meeting and their diplomatic mission by phone, post or during a consular visit. Possible measures to be taken by prison administration include transfer of a prisoner to a safe place within their prison, or to a different penal facility. </p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.7 </span>Prison: access to help and services</h3>

<h4>Receiving money</h4>

<p>There are two ways you may be able to receive financial assistance while in prison:</p>

<ul>
  <li>private funds: deposited to you by your family or friends</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a>: depending on where you are detained, if your family cannot support you financially, Prisoners Abroad may be able to send you a small grant every quarter for essentials (enough for one hot meal a day).</li>
</ul>

<p>The UK government does not provide financial assistance to prisoners.</p>

<h4>Private funds</h4>
<p>While the FCDO does not provide financial assistance to prisoners, we may be able, within certain limits, to send you money from your family or friends.</p>

<p>The FCDO operates a ‘Prison Comfort’ system for money transfers to prisoners. Ask your family or friends to get in touch with the FCDO to arrange this.</p>

<p>We cannot receive payment by credit or debit card, or by cash.</p>

<h4>Prisoners Abroad</h4>
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a> may be able to assist you with funding for prison essentials and some medical care if you are not receiving regular donations from other sources. British national prisoners in Russia may be eligible for the Craig Feehan Fund and the Medical Fund, provided they don’t receive financial support from their family or friends. See Chapter 4 for more details.</p>

<h4>Medical and Dental treatment</h4>

<p>While you are detained, Russia is responsible for ensuring your basic medical needs are met. As provided by Russian law, all prisoners are entitled to free medical services by the state providers. Each prison has doctors and nurses on staff. All prisoners are subject to periodic blood/urine lab tests and chest X-ray tests as well as assessments by a GP. Emergency medical services are provided 24/7. In case of medical emergency, a prisoner should call the guard for assistance. A prisoner can request a routine appointment with a prison healthcare specialist by making a record in a medical appointment journal normally held by the head of their ward. If a prisoner requires a test or a specialist assessment/treatment which can’t be carried out on the prison premises, they will be transferred to the nearest external state hospital for prisoners. Most healthcare providers don’t speak English and the quality or services/medicines may be below the UK standards. Medical services provided to prisoners include psychiatric and dental services. Prescribed medication is normally provided by the prison, but it is most likely to be locally manufactured. Prescribed medicine can be brought or sent by family/friends, but it can only be taken by a prisoner under the direct observation of the prison medical personnel. Prisoners may receive supplementary preventive medical services and treatment at their own expense, through a written request to the prison administration. Prisoners can also order glasses at their own expense, or have them sent by family/friends. With your permission, we can make sure that any medical or dental problems you might have are brought to the attention of any police or prison doctor. We can also liaise with your GP in the UK if the police or prison doctor requests previous medical records and this is in your vital interests. With your permission, we can make sure that any medical or dental problems you might have are brought to the attention of any police or prison doctor. We can also contact your GP in the UK, if the police or prison doctor requests previous medical records and this is in your vital interests.</p>

<h4>Letters and parcels</h4>

<p>Prisoners are permitted to receive hand-delivered and posted parcels. The number of permitted parcels and their cumulative weight a year depends on the type of prison facility and the imprisonment regime. The number of parcels varies from twelve parcels (up to 20 kg) and twelve small posted packages (up to 5 kg) for prisoners under a flexible regime in the general colonies to one parcel and one small package for those under strict regime in special colonies.</p>

<p>Prescribed medicine and medical supplies can also be sent/hand-delivered and are not counted towards the above allocations.</p>

<p>Prisoners may order books to be delivered by official vendors. These will not be counted towards the above allocations.</p>

<p>All parcels are inspected by prison staff before they are handed over to a prisoner.</p>

<p>Prisoners can send and receive an unlimited number of postal cards, letters and telegrams at their own expense. All incoming and outgoing mail is subject to prison censorship. The prison authorities are responsible to complete translation/censorship of letters/cards/telegrams in a foreign language and release it to its recipient within seven working days.</p>

<p>Prisoners can buy envelopes/cards/post stamps at the prison shop or have them delivered by family/friends. British Embassy Moscow and British Consulate General Ekaterinburg may be able to accept mail and parcels on behalf of vulnerable prisoners, depending on their location and accessibility.</p>

<p>There are many restrictions as to what can be sent/hand-delivered to a prison. Prohibited items include, but are not limited to, drugs, alcohol and any toiletries containing it, weapons, drones, poisonous and radioactive substances, cash and other valuable items, mobile phones and other electronic devices, maps, photo and video cameras, pornographic and extremist materials, uncooked food. Any item which may potentially cause harm to a prisoner’s health, including self-inflicted harm, are forbidden (scarfs, shoe laces, notebooks bound by spiralled wire, berries and fruit which can be fermented).</p>

<p>Russian Post is not always reliable and items in foreign languages posted from outside Russia may not reach the recipient. Russia is a part of the international postal tracking system, and parcels/packages can be tracked using their ID.</p>

<p>When sending a letter or a parcel to a British national in prison in Russia, one needs to make sure that the full address/name of the prison as well as the prisoner’s name and the date of birth are indicated, alongside the sender’s full name/address. Prisoners in Russia are not assigned individual numbers and are identified by their full name and date of birth.</p>

<p>British Embassy Moscow can assist with obtaining and verifying postal details for a British prisoner in Russia.</p>

<h4>Telephone calls</h4>

<p>Prisoners are normally permitted to make phone calls. However, those subjected to a disciplinary action or serving their sentence under the strict regime may be granted permission for a phone call only in exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>Normally the number of calls per prisoner is not limited, but the administration of prisons with insufficient phone line capacity may reduce the number of calls to six a year.</p>

<p>Prisoners have to register the numbers they wish to call with the prison administration. Normally, calls to the registered numbers do not require any prior authorisation. The duration of each call doesn’t exceed fifteen minutes. While calls to both domestic and international numbers are normally allowed, the latter may not be possible due to the prison’s infrastructure limitations.</p>

<p>Calls can only be made through the prison land line and may be monitored by prison staff. The cost of calls can be charged to a prisoner’s personal account at the prison or covered out of their account/calling card with one of the several service providers - <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.zonatelecom.ru/" rel="external">ZonaTelecom</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://fsinet.ru/" rel="external">FSINet</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://rodnayasvyaz.ru/" rel="external">Rodnaya Sviyaz</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://msk.rt.ru/" rel="external">Rostelecom</a>. The latter can be topped up/purchased by family/friends using their official&nbsp;websites. Mobile phones are not allowed in Russian prisons. Those found in possession of a mobile phone can be subjected to disciplinary action.</p>

<p>Making a complaint about mistreatment</p>

<p>If you have been mistreated, you should inform consular staff as soon as it is safe for you to do so. We will then do our best to visit you, to check on your welfare, discuss the allegations, and explain any local complaints procedures and supportive organisations that you may wish to consider. With your permission, and where appropriate, we will consider approaching the local authorities if you have not been treated in line with internationally-accepted standards. If you have been mistreated, try to see a doctor, obtain a medical report and if possible take photos of your injuries.</p>

<p>As provided by Russian and international law, you have a right to keep in touch with your Embassy or Consulate and report any issues to them. If you have been mistreated, please inform Consular staff as soon as it is safe for you to do so. We will then do our best to visit you, check on your welfare, discuss the allegations, and inform you of any local complaints procedures and supportive organisations that you may wish to consider. With your permission, and where appropriate, we will consider approaching the local authorities if you have not been treated in line with internationally-accepted standards. If you have been mistreated, please try to see a doctor, obtain a medical report and, if possible, photos of the injuries you received.</p>

<p>According to Russian law, prisoners have a right to lodge complaints about imprisonment conditions or a mistreatment to prison administration verbally or in writing, and request an appointment with a member of prison administration, regional or federal FSIN representative or a prosecutor.</p>

<p>Foreign prisoners have a right to lodge a written complaint in their native language and receive a written response translated to their native language.</p>

<p>Complaints made to prison administration, including through a personal appointment, are recorded in the logbook. Response to verbal complaints may be given within one working day. A written complaint should be registered by prison chancery within three days, and a written response should be handed over to the prisoner within three working days after it has been issued.</p>

<p>Prisoners have a right to lodge a written complaint to the external governmental bodies including prison monitoring boards, Ombudsmen, court, prosecution or the Russian President. Such complaints are exempt from censorship by prison administration and should be put to post within one working day. If a prisoner has no funds on their account, such a complaint should be posted at prison expense.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Chapter 3: The Russian judicial system</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Overview</h3>

<p>Unlike the UK which is a common law country, the Russian Federation has a civil law system. It has many differences from the UK system. Russian law includes both codified laws (for example, the Civil Code and the Criminal Code) and other laws which must be consistent with the relevant codes.</p>

<p>International law is recognised as part of the Russian legal system but Russian domestic legislation may override provisions of international law.  The Russian court structure consists of federal and regional courts, both headed by the Supreme Court. Federal courts include commercial courts that resolve economic disputes and courts of general jurisdiction handling all other cases. Regional courts include magistrates’ courts resolving minor matters, and the constitutional (statutory) courts of the Russian regions, which handle cases concerning the regions’ constitutions (statutes). The Constitutional Court deals with disputes concerning the constitutionality of certain legal acts and is a separate judicial body in the Russian court system. Judgments by the Constitutional Court that contain interpretations of the law bind all courts, state agencies, legal entities and individuals.</p>

<p>Courts of general jurisdiction are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>magistrates’ courts and district courts</li>
  <li>courts of the regions (appellate)</li>
  <li>courts of the regions (cassation)</li>
  <li>the Supreme Court</li>
</ul>

<p>The Supreme Court is the court of cassation (second-tier) and the supervisory court handling cases on challenge of judicial acts of the Supreme Court and holding a final decision for both courts of general jurisdiction and commercial courts.</p>

<p>Supreme Court judgments are binding on the lower courts to ensure uniformity of legal practice. Quasi-legal authorities are not commonly used in the Russian Federation. An individual can apply to the ombudsman in the case of an infringement of their rights.</p>

<p>An independent judiciary is one of the key constitutional principles of the Russian legal system. Judges are supposed to be bound only by the Constitution and federal laws. However, Russian and international media and human rights groups make frequent reports of corruptions and judiciary acting on the orders from the government or law enforcement agencies, especially in politically motivated cases.</p>

<p>The legal system of the Russian courts is established by procedural legislation including the Civil, Commercial, Criminal and Administrative Procedure Codes. It adheres to all principles of the adversarial system, including the oral nature of judicial proceedings, publicity and directness. However, in practice judges are actively involved in investigating the facts of the case, clarifying the legal positions of the parties, specifying the legal grounds of a claim and so on. The parties to the court proceedings are responsible for gathering evidence.</p>

<p>The claimant and the defendant in civil proceedings (and the prosecutor and the accused in criminal proceedings) put evidence before the court. The court is not obliged to gather evidence. However, for the purposes of giving a reasonable and justified judgment, the court can participate and assist the parties in gathering evidence that cannot be obtained by the parties themselves.</p>

<p>In both civil and criminal proceedings, the court is responsible for examining evidence before the trial. The examination of the evidence is conducted either in the court room in the presence of the parties or in the field, if the evidence being examined cannot be delivered to the court room.</p>

<p>There is a possibility for the accused to enter a pre-trial plea to disclose information or compensate losses/damages to the affected person in hope for a more lenient punishment.</p>

<p>The results of evidence examination are fixed in the record of the proceedings. To ensure the impartial examination of the evidence, the court interrogates witnesses, involves experts in the proceedings and requires the parties to provide additional evidence. Having examined the evidence, the court has discretion to either proceed with the trial or to request the provision of the additional evidence.</p>

<p>Court cases are open to the general public except for cases involving state secrets, private matters (adoption of a child, etc.) or substantial concerns over a party’s security. A trial may also be closed to the public following a party’s petition.</p>

<p>Judicial hearings in all criminal cases are open to the public except where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it concerns state or other secrets protected by federal law</li>
  <li>the accused are under 16 years old</li>
  <li>it concerns private information regarding the participants</li>
  <li>It concerns the security of the participants or their relatives</li>
</ul>

<p>The key parties to civil proceedings are the claimant and the defendant. In criminal proceedings, the key parties are the prosecutor and the accused.</p>

<p>Persons assisting in the delivery of justice include witnesses, experts, interpreters, etc. Juries are used in criminal cases, except for those of terrorism and related crimes, mass unrests, state treason, espionage and armed rebellion. The jury is comprised of twelve people. Juries are not used in civil cases. The evidence gathered by the parties must meet the criteria of relevance, admissibility and reliability. If the evidence was received by breaching the law, the court must deem it inadmissible. If the evidence has a prejudicial effect, the court is not entitled to re-examine and re-assess it. The presence of a jury has no impact on these rules.</p>

<p>The Russian Constitution stipulates that every person accused of committing a crime is considered innocent until proven guilty. The burden of proof lies with the prosecution and can’t be transferred to the accused. In criminal cases, the accused can plead guilty or not guilty. In the UK a defendant who pleads guilty is automatically convicted and the remainder of the trial is used to determine the sentence. In Russia, a confession by the defendant is treated like evidence, and a full confession does not prevent a full trial from occurring or relieve the prosecutor from having to present a case to the court.</p>

<p>In civil cases, courts can hand down a verdict in favour of the claimant or the defendant. These include, but are not limited to, recognition of a right, specific performance of an obligation, compensation for losses. There are two possible verdicts in criminal cases: guilty and not guilty.</p>

<p>In civil cases, the court can hand down the following types of relief:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Recognition of a right</li>
  <li>Restoration of the status that existed before a right was violated and the suppression of actions that violated the right or created the threat of violation.</li>
  <li>Recognition of a voidable transaction as invalid and the consequences of that invalidity</li>
  <li>Recognition of an act by a state agency as invalid</li>
  <li>Specific performance of the obligation</li>
  <li>Compensation for losses</li>
  <li>Payment of a penalty</li>
  <li>Compensation for moral damage</li>
</ul>

<p>In criminal cases, the court can hand down the following penalties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fines</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Deprivation of the right to hold specific offices or to engage in specific activities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Deprivation of a special, military or honorary title</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>The main stages of a prisoner’s case are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Investigation into the criminal case by an investigating authority to gather evidence and establish the circumstances of the crime. Russian law sets no fixed limit for the duration of investigation and defines it as ‘reasonable’.</li>
</ul>

<p>During the investigation, the suspects/accused may be subjected to restriction measures: an undertaking not to leave, a house arrest or incarceration. Prisoners on remand are placed in the special remand prisons (pre-trial detention centres) where they remain until the court has made a verdict. The length of incarceration on remand does not normally exceed eighteen months.</p>

<p>A criminal case may be closed before it comes to court, if both parties have arrived at an amicable solution, or the accused has repaired the damages to the affected party;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Once the investigation has been completed, the investigating authority will forward the case to the state prosecutor;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The prosecutor has ten days to review the case and find it suitable for consideration by court, or return it to the investigating authority for further action;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the accused has been incarcerated, the court should schedule a preliminary hearing of the case (optional) or a trial within fourteen days. The court will make a verdict and determine a possible punishment. Russian law sets no time limit for completion of court proceedings and defines it as ‘reasonable’;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Upon delivery of a verdict, the accused has ten days to appeal the verdict at the appeal court, otherwise it comes in full force.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The rights of prisoners throughout the legal process are guaranteed by the Russian Civil Procedure Code and the Russian Criminal Procedure Code, and the Russian Ministry of Justice Order N189 of 14/10/2005 ‘On internal regulations of pre-trial detention centres’, among other.</p>

<p>The FCDO cannot interfere with the judicial system. We cannot ask for your case to be judged more quickly just because you are British, or ask the authorities to waive any penalties.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>First steps</h3>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>What should happen after you are arrested</h3>

<p>All details on detainee’s rights upon arrest and subsequent developments are available at Section: Police custody and initial arrival at prison.</p>

<p>If you have any questions on the legal aspects of your arrest, contact your lawyer. See for a list of local <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/russia-list-of-lawyers/list-of-lawyers">English-speaking lawyers</a>.</p>

<h4>How long you can be remanded in custody</h4>

<p>Normally, a suspect can be remanded in custody for the initial period of up to three months. Upon request of the investigator assigned to the criminal case, this period can be extended by court for another one to three months. There can be further extensions, but the total time on remand should not normally exceed eighteen months. If one is then sentenced to imprisonment, each day spent in a remand prison count toward their prison sentence as a day and a half. The same applies to the period of time spent by a convicted person during transportation from a remand prison to a penal colony.</p>

<p>There is an option to request a release on bail, but bail is rarely granted in Russia.</p>

<p>Prisoners on remand and sentenced prisoners: differences</p>

<p>Prisoners on remand are normally kept separately from the convicted ones. Rights of prisoners in remand prisons, those in penal colonies/prisons and conditions of imprisonment are detailed in the section Police custody and initial arrival at prison of Chapter 2.</p>

<p>After you are charged</p>

<p>As set out by Russian Criminal Procedure Code, in case sufficient evidence of one’s complicity in a crime has been gathered through a preliminary investigation, the investigator in charge can bring charges against a suspect. This is normally documented in a conclusion to indict providing all details of a suspect, the time, place and other circumstances of the alleged crime and naming respective articles of Russian law. The prison administration hands over a copy of the conclusion to indict to the detainee within three days of its completion, in presence of a defence lawyer, if one has been commissioned previously. A conclusion to indict is normally completed in the Russian language, and the prisoner may need an interpreter to explain it to them.</p>

<p>All rights of the accused are set out by the Russian Criminal Procedure Code. These include, but are not limited to, receiving a copy of the above statement, refrain from making a statement in order not to incriminate themselves, providing evidence, filing motions and objections, making statements in their native language, accessing services of a pro bono interpreter, firing a lawyer or commission a state-appointed pro bono one, having an unlimited number of visits by their lawyer in confidence, familiarising themselves with the case materials of the preliminary investigation. These rights should be read to the accused by the investigator in charge of the case at the first interrogation.</p>

<p>If detainees believe the charges are false, they now need to work with their lawyer to gather proof of their innocence to be presented during court trial.</p>

<p>The accused detainee may or may not enter a plea of guilty/not guilty at this stage, but this will be treated as a piece of evidence and can’t be used as a reason for terminating the subsequent legal proceedings – investigation and court trial.</p>

<p>Bail</p>

<p>Bail (залог) can be made during the investigation into a criminal case or when the case comes to court. In Russia, it is the court that can approve or reject bail. Funds, stock/bonds, real estate, valuables and other assets or property can be used to make bail. The court sets the amount/type of bail in relation to the financial situation of the detainee, the nature of the crime, the likelihood of the accused leaving Russia, etc.</p>

<p>The minimum bail is 50,000 RUR for minor offences, and 500,000 RUR for severe offences. Bail can be made by the accused, or a third person, who is not a party to the criminal proceedings.</p>

<p>Bail funds need to be deposited to a court/investigating authority bank account. The authority then issues a formal statement confirming the receipt of bail.</p>

<p>Bail is normally paid within 72 hours after it has been granted by court.</p>

<p>The Court may lay down certain bail conditions, including a prohibition to drive a car/other vehicle, enter/leave certain areas or meet certain people, use Internet, post/receive mail, etc.</p>

<p>British Embassy Moscow can assist prisoners with contacting friends and family who may be willing to help with raising bail.</p>

<p>If a detainee fails to adhere to their bail conditions, the assets/funds provided as bail will be transferred as income to the state budget by a separate court decision. In case of a closure of the criminal case by court, the bail is returned to the bail-maker.</p>

<p>The possibility of bail depends on the nature and severity of the crime. Release on bail is not a common practice in Russia, especially in cases involving foreign nationals.</p>

<p>The FCDO cannot transfer bail funds.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Trial and legal assistance</h3>

<h4>Legal assistance: lawyers and legal aid</h4>

<p>In Russia, a suspect or accused has the right to the services of a state-provided pro bono lawyer, can hire their own lawyer or refuse legal representation. The right to pro bono legal representation is unconditional. If you wish to hire a private lawyer, a list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/russia-list-of-lawyers/list-of-lawyers">English-speaking lawyers</a> is provided at the end of this pack. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a> can also supply information on legal aid, court proceedings and can advise on appointing a lawyer.</p>

<p>The costs of hiring a private lawyer as well as payment conditions may vary a great deal and need to be negotiated with the specific lawyer hired.</p>

<p>The interpretation services are normally provided pro bono by the state. You may hire your own interpreter using a list of interpreters provided at the end of this pack. The service fees may vary and need to be agreed with the specific service provider. British Embassy Moscow can assist with contacting friends or family in the UK to seek their financial support to cover the legal costs in Russia.</p>

<p>There is no legal aid in Russia. Accused or charged with certain types of a crime may consider contacting local human rights NGOs, which may be able to provide legal advice, support and representation. The human rights NGOs in Russia are detailed in Chapter 4 of this pack.</p>

<p>Court fees and trial costs may be borne by the state or charged to the defendant. This will be decided by court as part of their verdict. Costs of services of a state-provided interpreter and a defence lawyer are always covered by the state budget.</p>

<p>Court fees and trial costs may be charged to a defendant if the criminal case against him has been terminated. If a defendant has been cleared of any charges, no cost will have to be borne by them.</p>

<h4>Trial</h4>

<p>In Russia, when a criminal case comes to court, the judge may schedule a preliminary hearing or a trial. This is done within 14 days from the date of case receipt by court if a suspect/accused is on remand. A preliminary hearing may be held at a judge’s own discretion or as requested by a party to the proceedings. A preliminary hearing may be scheduled if admissibility of certain evidence has been challenged, if there has been a request for a jury trial, if the case needs to be returned to the prosecution, if there are reasons for the criminal case to be suspended or terminated, if there is a need to separate or merge criminal cases. Preliminary hearing is not open to general public.</p>

<p>A trial may be held over several sessions.</p>

<p>Once a trial has been scheduled, the judge subpoenas witnesses. A trial takes place no sooner than seven days from the date when the conclusion to indict was handed over to the accused and no later than fourteen days from the date of the judge’s decision to hold a trial (thirty days in case of a jury trial).</p>

<p>At a trial, the judge can question witnesses and the affected party through videoconferencing, while the defendant normally has to be present in the courtroom. A trial is normally open to general public except for cases involving state secrets, sensitive private matters or substantial concerns over a party’s security. Those present in a court room have a right to make written records or audio-recoding, while filming or taking photos can be done only with a prior permission of the judge.</p>

<p>The court verdict is always read at the final session open to the general public, except for state security-related cases when public can only hear the preliminary section and the sentencing section of the verdict.</p>

<p>None of the judges can be removed or replaced during a trial. If this happens, the trial has to be restarted. The members of the court normally include a judge, a judge’s assistant and a secretary, a state prosecution representative (has always to be present during a trial), a defence lawyer (who can be removed/replaced without restarting the trial) and experts. Court bailiffs are present and responsible for maintaining order in the courtroom. All proceedings in a court room are recorded in the session protocol, which is to be completed and signed off by a presiding judge within three days from the date of the session.</p>

<p>Trial normally has the following structure:</p>

<p>1) Opening Proceedings: the presiding judge announces the case to be tried; the assistant reports on attendance of those requested to appear; the presiding judge reads the interpreter their rights; the judge establishes the defendant’s identity and verifies if the conclusion to indict has been handed over to the defendant in due time; the judge introduces the participants and reads the right to recuse a judge; the judge reads the defendant, the affected and the experts their rights; the judge enquires about any motions by the parties; in absence of a participant, the judge consults with the parties and makes a conclusion to start/adjourn the trial.</p>

<p>2) Presenting and Examination of Evidence: the judge reads the charges and ask the defendant to plead guilty/not guilty and comment on the charges; the prosecution presents evidence; the defendant is interrogated; the affected party is questioned; the witnesses and experts are questioned; the judge may request an expert examination to be carried out; material evidence is examined; relevant documents are read; examination of location and facilities where the crime was committed takes place; crime re-enactment may take place; personal identification and medical examination may take place.</p>

<p>3) Presentation of Arguments and Final Statement: both parties present their arguments and the defendant makes their final statement; the court retires for deliberations.</p>

<p>4) Reading of Verdict: the judge reads the verdict. As the verdict is read in Russian, the court interpreter is responsible to provide simultaneous or consecutive translation of the reading. If the defendant is found not guilty or receives a penalty other than a prison or suspended sentence, they will be set free in the court room. In case the penalty is a prison sentence, the defendant is escorted from the courtroom to a prison. The defendant receives a copy of the verdict within no later than five days from the date it was read.</p>

<h4>Sentences</h4>

<p>The following penalties can be handed down by court:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>for administrative offence, as set out by Article 3.2 of the Russian Administrative Offence Code: a warning; a fine; confiscation of tool or subject of offence; revocation of right; expulsion; disqualification; short-term detention (up to fifteen days); suspension of activity; mandatory labour; prohibition to attend sport events;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for criminal offence, as set out by Article 44 of the Russian Criminal Code: a fine; restriction of right to take up a certain occupation/position; detention; revocation of title, grade or award; mandatory labour; correctional labour; restriction of military service; personal restraint; arrest; imprisonment for a period/life; death penalty (currently not applied due to moratorium).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Expulsion (выдворение) can only be handed down by court, while deportation (депортация) can only be ordered by a state authority (Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Justice or else). Both can be either self-administered (a British National (BN) has to depart by themselves within a set timeframe) or forced (a BN is transferred from the courtroom to a state deportation centre and remains there until they are escorted out of Russia).</p>

<p>A British National may or may not be deported from Russia upon their release from prison (if expulsion was not their court sentence). Based on a crime committed and prior incidents of legal offence in Russia, deportation may be imposed if the authorities conclude that the BN’s stay in Russia is not conducive to the public good. The cost of a forced expulsion/deportation should be covered by the BN themselves. It may be covered by the Russia state budget as a last resort, and this is a lengthy process. A purchase of a ticket by the BN or their family/friends can substantially expedite their departure from Russia.</p>

<p>British Embassy Moscow can help contacting family or friends in the UK for the purchase of a ticket to the UK and liaise with the authorities to forward the ticket to the prisoner.</p>

<p>A BN may be deported back to the country from where they came to Russia, or to the UK.</p>

<h4>Appeals</h4>

<p>The defendant as well as the state prosecution and the affected party may appeal the verdict made by court. They have ten days from the date the verdict was made (for prisoners on remand - from the date when the defendant received a copy of the verdict) to lodge the appeal.</p>

<p>Grounds for appeal may include severity or leniency in sentence, fact-finding errors, and approval or dismissal of a party’s motion, among other court decisions.</p>

<p>Appeal will be heard within 15 (if made to a district court), 30 (regional court) or 45 days (appeal court of general jurisdiction or Supreme Court) from the date it was lodged.</p>

<p>If no appeal has been lodged within 10 days, the verdict made by the court of first instance comes to full legal force.</p>

<p>After the verdict made by the court of first instance has come into force, the defendant and other parties to the proceedings may file a cassation appeal to the initial verdict made by court of first instance or to the subsequent decision of an appeal court in regards to the said verdict. Ground for cassation appeal is normally a breach of legal procedure during the initial trial/ appeal hearing, which resulted in the infringement of legal rights of a party to the proceedings.</p>

<p>Even if the appeal is made with a view to mitigate the original punishment, the actual appeal process may have the opposite result.</p>

<p>The Russian Administrative Procedure Code provided for the original judgement or the appeal/cassation decision to be reviewed should the new evidence come to light, a false statement made by a witness/expert during the trial, or a crime committed by a party (including judges) during the proceedings.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>Reaching the end of your sentence</h3>

<h4>Reduction of sentence (remission)</h4>

<p>Article 78 of the Russian Criminal Enforcement Code provides for remission - improving imprisonment conditions for good behaviour and productive labour. A prisoner may be transferred to a type of prison with more favourable conditions (from a special colony to a high-security colony, or from a high-security one to a general one) having served half of their sentence; or from a general prison to a colony settlement having served one–quarter of their sentence. A prisoner or their lawyer has to file a request for such a transfer with a local court.</p>

<p>Article 80 of the Russian Criminal Code provides for reduction of sentence. A court may agree to substitute the remaining part of a prison sentence with forced labour if a prisoner has demonstrated good behaviour and compensated losses/damages resulted from their crime.</p>

<h4>Early release</h4>

<p>Article 79 of the Russian Criminal Code provides for early release of a prisoner on parole (условно-досрочное освобождение or УДО) for good behaviour and compensation of losses/damages resulted from their crime. The decision is made by court, which will set the conditions to be observed for the remainder of the initial sentence. A prisoner may request a release on parole having served at least one-third of their sentence (in case they were sentenced for a minor or medium level offence), at least half of the sentence (a grave crime), or two-third of the sentence (a particularly grave crime), among other. The prison sentence of at least six months would have to be served in any case.</p>

<h4>Clemency or pardon</h4>

<p>Article 85 of the Russian Criminal Code provides for clemency. Clemency may come in the form of a pardon (forgiveness of a sentence) or a commutation (reduction of a sentence, remission of a penalty). In Russia, clemency can only be granted by the President. There is also a custom of granting amnesty to prisoners sentenced for minor or medium offences, on the most significant dates in Russia’s history, but these are rare.</p>

<h4>Financial penalties</h4>

<p>Financial penalties may be the whole, or part of the sentence, alongside restriction of freedom. Article 76.2 of the Russian Criminal Code provides for substitution of prison sentence with court fines in case of a minor or medium level offence, and if the offender has compensated the losses/repaired the damages done by their unlawful action to the affected party.</p>

<h4>Transfer to another prison within Russia</h4>

<p>Article 81 of the Russian Criminal Enforcement Code provides that normally all convicted persons serve their entire prison term in one penal institution.</p>

<p>Transfer to another prison within Russia is only possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>as a sentence remission, in accordance with a prisoner’s/their lawyer’s request made to court</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in case of a threat to prisoner’s safety and wellbeing, as provided by point 190 of the Ministry of Justice’s Order N295 of 16/12/16</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in case of substantial deterioration of prisoner’s health requiring medical intervention</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in case the prison is to be decommissioned or reorganised</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in case of a natural or a man-made disaster</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>at a prisoner’s request for transfer to a penal institution in the region where their family reside (possible only once throughout the sentence term)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Transfer to a prison in the UK</h4>

<p>The UK and Russia are both parties to the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons 1983, which enables transfer of prisoners from Russia to the UK.</p>

<p>To transfer to the UK, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>be a British citizen or have close family ties with the UK (normally through permanent residence in the UK)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>not be awaiting trial</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have exhausted all appeals against your conviction and/or the length of your sentence; or have waived your right to an appeal</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have at least 6 months of your sentence left to serve when you apply for transfer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have no outstanding fines or other non-custodial penalties</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The offence you were convicted for must also be a criminal offence in the part of the UK you wish to be transferred to: England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>The authorities in the sentencing country may refuse your request. Even if the sentencing country agrees to your transfer, the UK authorities may also refuse your request. Reasons for this might include if you have not lived in the UK for a number of years and you have no close family living there.</p>

<p>The procedure for transferring a foreign prisoner from Russia is provided by Article 469 of the Russian Criminal Procedure Code. If a British prisoner would like to serve the rest of their sentence in the UK, they need to make a written request to the prison governor. The latter will make a submission via FSIN to the Russian Ministry of Justice, who will contact the UK authorities for their consent to transfer. If the UK authorities are satisfied with the terms and conditions of transfer stipulated by the Russian side, they may grant their permission to transfer. Once the permission is granted, the Russian Ministry of Justice will inform FSIN accordingly, who will then submit a request for transfer to a local court. The final decision about transfer can only be made by Russian court. The court will take into consideration if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the offence committed is also a crime in the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are provisions and conditions for serving the sentence in the UK comparable to those in Russia</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the required warranties have been given by the UK authorities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the conditions of transfer are consistent with the international treaties, which Russia is a party to, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the prisoner has their permanent residence in Russia</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It may take about 1.5-2 years to complete a transfer of prisoner from Russia to the UK.

<h4>Release and deportation</h4>

<p>A foreign national prisoner may or may not have to leave Russia after they have completed their sentence. Subsequent expulsion may be part of the sentence handed down by court. Subsequent deportation may be ordered by a state authority if the BN’s stay in Russia is deemed not conducive to the public good. A prisoner may be able to contest their expulsion/deportation in a local court.</p>

<p>The information on expulsion/deportation process and how we can assist is available at Section Trial and legal assistance/Sentences of this document.</p>

<p>Sometimes people find that they face difficulties adjusting to life in the UK once they have left prison. You may find yourself ready for life on the outside but not prepared for living in the UK. You may not have lived in the UK before and have no connections there, or perhaps you have lost touch with friends and family. You may want to talk to another person who understands what you have been through, to help you consider what to do next.</p>

<p>If you are registered with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a>, you can visit Prisoners Abroad when you first arrive back in UK for advice, to take a shower, use their temporary luggage store, make essential phone calls or use a computer. If you have no belongings Prisoners Abroad may be able to help with basic toiletries and finding suitable clothing. If you know your release date in advance you should tell your consular caseworker when you are likely to arrive and what help you think you might need. If you have no money and nowhere to go, Prisoners Abroad’s Aftercare Service can help with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>advice on finding emergency accommodation in the London area</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>claiming welfare benefits, including emergency benefit payments if you are destitute</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>making appointments with doctors and dentists</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>putting you in touch with local agencies if you are not returning to the London area</p>

<span class="number">2.6 </span>Prisoners Abroad</h3>

<p>Since 1978 the charity Prisoners Abroad has offered practical support and advice to British citizens imprisoned overseas. It is the only UK charity providing this service and it is available to all, whether guilty or innocent, convicted or awaiting charge or trial. Prisoners Abroad is concerned with your health and welfare, both during your imprisonment and also on your return to the UK, through their resettlement service (if you have registered whilst in prison). They can also provide support and advice to your family during your imprisonment. In order to access any services, prisoners must first register with Prisoners Abroad by signing and returning their authorisation form.</p>

<p>Once you seek help from Prisoners Abroad, the Prisoner &amp; Family Support Service will be your point of contact for advice and information. The type of assistance they can offer will vary from country to country, but generally they can provide you with information, in English, on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>your rights as a prisoner and issues that may affect you such as health or transfer to the UK</p>
