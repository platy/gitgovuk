<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office operates a service which allows you to pay funds to us in the UK which we will pay out in local currency to the above overseas. The various ways you can pay us are detailed below.</p>

<p>Under the Consular Fees Amendment Order 2016, we are obliged to charge for this service. The fee is dependent on the amount that you wish to transfer as follows:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Amount being sent</th>
      <th scope="col" style="text-align: right">Fee</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>£0.01 - £99.99</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">£10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>£100 - £499.99</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">£25</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>£500 and above</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">£50</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>When forwarding funds, you should add the above fee to the amount that you wish to transfer. For example, if you want the recipient to receive £50, you will need to send us £60 (£50 to give to the recipient plus £10 fee). We retain the right to further deduct any local overseas charges we may incur in passing the fees to the recipient.
Should we be unable to pay the funds locally to the recipient, our policy is to refund amounts above £5 to the depositor by bank transfer. In this case, we would contact you for your bank details. Refunds may take several weeks as our internal processes can only start once all relevant costs have been cleared with local authorities.</p>
