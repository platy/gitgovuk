<span class="number">3. </span>Foreword</h2>

<p>The main aim of this guide is to help individuals and organisations with a statutory right to oppose an application for or to vary a goods vehicle operator’s licence, as well as to lodge complaints against the use of existing operating centres, to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>understand the main purposes of the goods vehicle operator licensing system;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>answer many of the questions about ‘making statutory opposition’ against the grant of a licence or to change an existing licence; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>assist with lodging opposition against applications</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This guide is not intended to provide legal advice.</p>

<p>The information contained in this guide is also intended to explain the process of opposing applications for those who are applying for and to vary operator’s licences, as well as outlining the complaints process for current licence holders.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Goods Vehicle Operator Licensing – Environmental Provisions</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>What is Goods Vehicle Operator Licensing and who needs a licence?</h3>

<p>Goods vehicle operator licensing is a system of licensing aimed at ensuring the safe and proper use of goods vehicles and the protection of the environment around operating centres (i.e. the place where an operator normally keeps his/her vehicles when they are not being used).</p>

<p>Most users of commercial vehicles that weigh over 3.5 tonnes (i.e. the maximum permitted total weight when loaded, including any trailer) require a licence.</p>

<p>In addition, users of light goods vehicles (LGV) over 2.5 tonnes also require an operator’s licence when carrying goods for hire or reward on an international journey. Operators holding LGV operator licences (i.e those authorising the use of vehicles (and trailers) over 2.5 tonnes, and up to and including 3.5 tonnes) are not required to specify an operating centre and are, therefore, not subject to the environmental provisions described in this guide. They are, however, subject to objections on other statutory grounds. For the purpose of this guide any reference to the need for an operating centre and environmental provisions refers to vehicles used under an HGV operator’s licence (i.e. usually those over 3.5 tonnes).</p>

<p>The holder of a licence is the ‘operator’. A licence will authorise an operator to use up to a maximum total number of motor vehicles and trailers, and to use a specific operating centre or centres, except in the case of LGVs as set out above.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>How does an operator obtain a licence?</h3>

<p>An operator must hold a licence in each Traffic Area where he/she has an operating centre or centres. Licences can authorise the use of more than one operating centre.</p>

<p>Licence applications are made to traffic commissioners. Each traffic commissioner is a separate public body and, whilst appointed by the Secretary of State, each is independent of any Government department regardless of whether they are exercising judicial functions or not. There are eight traffic areas and eight traffic commissioners (Details of the traffic areas are at Annex 1).</p>

<p>The suitability of a proposed operating centre is just one of a number of matters which a traffic commissioner must consider before granting an application. Other matters include an applicant’s fitness to hold a licence; the financial resources available for, and arrangements in place, to maintain his/her vehicles; and, where appropriate, professional competence.</p>

<p>Once a licence has been issued an operator can apply to amend (vary) it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Who can oppose the grant of an application?</h3>

<p>Owners and occupiers of land or buildings near an operating centre who feel that the use or enjoyment of their own land would be adversely affected by the proposed operating centre have a right to make their views known to a traffic commissioner. They are called representors; representations can be made only on environmental grounds.</p>

<p>Objections can be made by statutory objectors such as local authorities, planning authorities, the police, and certain Trade Associations and Trade Unions. They may object to the grant of an application on the grounds of repute or fitness to hold a licence, finance and the professional competence of the operator as well as on the environmental and general suitability of an operating centre.</p>

<p>Objectors and representors have different rights. This Guide deals with the rights of each separately.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>How are representors told about applications?</h3>

<p>An applicant for a new licence, or for a change to a licence which would affect an operating centre, must advertise the proposed use in a local newspaper circulating within the locality of the operating centre. The advertisement should give the name of the operator, the address of the operating centre and how many authorised, or additional, lorries and trailers will or are intended to be kept there if the application is granted. It will also show the address of the office where representations must be sent.</p>

<p>The advertisement gives potential representors the opportunity to respond within a certain period of time (within 21 days after the advertisement appears in a newspaper) and for other people who have an interest in the use of the site as an operating centre to consider drawing the application to the attention of statutory objectors to encourage them to make an objection. Details of how to lodge a representation are given in Part 3 of this guide. Please note that the statute only requires that an applicant for a licence must advertise in one or more local newspapers circulating in the vicinity of a proposed operating centre. The traffic commissioner has no legal authority to stipulate which newspaper is used. It is up to the applicant however to satisfy the traffic commissioner that they have met the requirements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span>How are objectors told about applications and is the proposed use of an operating centre advertised in any other way?</h3>

<p>A traffic commissioner must also publish details of most applications. This is done by using a publication called “Applications and Decisions” (As &amp; Ds), which is issued every week. Statutory objectors must respond within a certain period following the publication of application details if they wish to object, but anyone can subscribe to As &amp; Ds as it is a good way of being kept informed.</p>

<p>Copies of Applications &amp; Decisions are available free of charge at the website: 
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/traffic-commissioners/series/traffic-commissioner-applications-and-decisions">https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/traffic-commissioners/series/traffic-commissioner-applications-and-decisions</a></p>

<p>It is also possible to subscribe to the publications for a fee. Further information on subscribing to As &amp; Ds can be obtained from the Office of the Traffic Commissioner.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span>What happens next?</h3>

<p>A traffic commissioner will consider all objections and representations received provided that they are “duly made” (please see ‘How is a representation made?’ below). A traffic commissioner will also consider any other relevant information known about the proposed site and the applicant before making a decision on the application.</p>

<p>If a traffic commissioner decides to grant the application, he/she can impose:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>environmental conditions on the use of an operating centre if he/she feels they are necessary to prevent or reduce adverse effects, and/or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>road safety conditions if he/she considers they are necessary to prevent authorised vehicles causing danger to the public at any point where vehicles first join a public road on their way to and from an operating centre, and on any private approach road.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is a criminal offence to break licence conditions and an operator faces penalties if he does so.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.7 </span>What environmental conditions can be put on a licence?</h3>

<p>These can cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the number, type and size of authorised vehicles, including trailers, kept at the operating centre for maintenance or parking;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the parking arrangements for authorised vehicles, including trailers, at or in the vicinity of the operating centre;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the times when the centre may be used for maintenance or movement of authorised vehicles;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how authorised vehicles enter and leave the operating centre.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.8 </span>What are the limits to a traffic commissioner’s powers?</h3>

<p>Conditions on the use of an operating centre can apply only to the licence holder concerned and the use of vehicles authorised under the licence. A traffic commissioner cannot place restrictions on any vehicles which are visiting the site or are using it for other purposes.</p>

<p>It is important to recognise that the commissioner’s powers are quite separate and different from those of highway, planning and local authorities. A commissioner cannot control the use of the premises for other purposes. That is the responsibility of the local planning authority.</p>

<p>A traffic commissioner cannot take into account the non-environmental suitability, including safety, of the public highway leading to the operating centre or the road network. These are matters for the highway authorities.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Representations</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Who or what is a representor?</h3>

<p>Owners and occupiers of land or buildings near (within the vicinity, see ‘Who or what is a representor?’, of an operating centre who feel that the use or enjoyment of their own land would be “prejudicially” affected by the proposed operating centre can make a representation against the grant of an application and are called “representors”. Representations can be made only on environmental grounds and in response to an advertisement placed by an applicant (see ‘How are representors told about applications?’). A Representor must be directly affected by environmental nuisance emanating directly from the operating centre and not as a result of traffic on public highways.</p>

<p>A traffic commissioner may consider that some people who respond to an advertisement live too far away from the operating centre to be affected by it and may not accept the representation as valid.</p>

<p>The traffic commissioner’s decision on whether a representation is acceptable or not is final.</p>

<p>Parish Councils, residents associations and action groups cannot make representations unless they are owners or occupiers of affected land in the vicinity of an operating centre and can demonstrate that their use of that land or buildings will be prejudicially affected by environmental nuisance. Groups of residents, Parish Councils, or others who cannot be accepted as representors can consider the merit of approaching statutory objectors, such as local authorities, in order to put their case forward and ask them to consider making an objection.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>How is a representation made?</h3>

<p>For a representation to be valid it has to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>be made in writing to the address shown in the advertisement. There is no set form but the grounds must be clearly stated;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be made within 21 days of the date the advertisement appeared in the newspaper;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be signed. If an individual makes a representation it must be signed by that person.  If it is made by a firm or by any other group of persons it must be signed by one or more persons authorised to sign by that group of persons. A solicitor acting on behalf of a representor, be it individual, firm or other group may sign on their behalf. Anyone thinking of presenting a petition should read the notes below in paragraphs 3.3.1 and 3.3.2;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>state relevant grounds; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be copied to the applicant on the same day, or next working day, as the representation is made to the traffic commissioner</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Please also refer to ‘What grounds are relevant to a traffic commissioner’s consideration?’</p>

<p>Unless there are exceptional circumstances which would justify him/her doing otherwise, a traffic commissioner must refuse to accept a representation as ‘duly made’ (valid for the purposes of the traffic commissioner’s considerations) unless it is made by the required date and in the required manner.</p>

<p>When submitting a representation it is helpful to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>indicate in the letter of representation whether a copy has been sent to the applicant/operator and, if not, the reason for not doing so;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>submit a sketch map showing the distance from your property to the operating centre.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Is it worth getting a petition together?</h3>

<p>It is often difficult to determine from petitions whether all the people named are owners/occupiers of property within the vicinity of the proposed operating centre and parts of a petition may refer to matters outside the traffic commissioner’s jurisdiction. A petition might therefore have limited value.</p>

<p>If it is decided to proceed with a petition then one person should be nominated as the contact point for dealing with a traffic commissioner’s staff. The full name and address, including post code, should be given by all signatories who will usually be contacted on an individual basis by the Office of the Traffic Commissioner. The original of the petition should be made available to the traffic commissioner.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>What grounds are relevant to a traffic commissioner’s consideration?</h3>

<p>A representation can only be treated as valid if it is about the adverse environmental effects that the use of an operator’s vehicles at an operating centre is expected to have on the use or enjoyment of the property owned or occupied by the representor.</p>

<p>In considering the environmental impact an operating centre may have, the traffic commissioner will consider the proximity of the site to a representor’s property and the suitability of the site for its intended use.</p>

<p>A traffic commissioner can take into account:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the nature or use of any other land in the vicinity of the operating centre and the effect which the issue of the licence would be likely to have on the environment;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the site has been used as an operating centre before, the extent to which the grant of the application would result in a change which would adversely affect the environment of its vicinity;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if it has not been used as an operating centre before, any information known to him/her about planning permission relating to the operating centre or other land in the vicinity of the operating centre;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the number, type and size of authorised motor vehicles and trailers;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the arrangements, or proposed arrangements, for the parking of motor vehicles or trailers;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the nature and the times of use of the land as an operating centre;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the nature and times of use of equipment installed (or proposed to be installed) at the operating centre in connection with its use as an operating centre;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the means by which, and frequency of, vehicles authorised by the licence entering and leaving the operating centre.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Generally speaking a traffic commissioner will consider the effects of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Noise – from the applicant’s vehicles moving in and out of, and while at, the operating centre. This may be intrusive in the neighbourhood, bearing in mind the use of other land in the surrounding area and the intended hours of operation;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Visual Intrusion – the effect the parking of vehicles at the operating centre may have on the outlook from a representor’s property or land;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Vibration – the effect vehicle movements may have, either at the operating centre or on their way to or from the operating centre;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fumes/Pollution – the effect of fumes from the applicant’s vehicles on the use or enjoyment of property.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>NB. A traffic commissioner can consider the impact of only those vehicles to be operated by the applicant. If the site is already being used by other goods vehicle operators it is possible to make a complaint (see Complaints).</p>

<p>In order to assist you in lodging opposition to an application, a model template can be found at Annex 3 of this guide. Whilst there is no requirement for a representation to be submitted using this template, it is intended as a useful guide which sets out matters which the traffic commissioner may and may not take into consideration.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span>What happens after a representation has been submitted?</h3>

<p>Representations are acknowledged and sometimes supplementary information is sought. If representors do not reply to correspondence, the traffic commissioner may assume that they do not wish to pursue their opposition.</p>

<p>The applicant will normally be asked for his views on the matters raised by any representors and, where appropriate, he will be asked to liaise direct with representors to see if any differences can be resolved without formal intervention by the traffic commissioner.</p>

<p>The traffic commissioner may also ask for one of the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency’s (DVSA) Traffic Examiners to visit and report on an operating centre’s suitability insofar as his/her jurisdiction extends.</p>

<p>The traffic commissioner will then consider if he/she needs to hold a Public Inquiry to hear the evidence before reaching a decision or whether he/she already has sufficient evidence to make a decision.</p>

<p>On making a decision the traffic commissioner can grant the application as applied for, or with modifications, he/she can attach conditions or refuse the application.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span>Are representors told of the traffic commissioner’s decision?</h3>

<p>If it is decided to hear the application at Public Inquiry representors will be invited to attend and, in the case of “valid” representors, to put their case forward.</p>

<p>If the decision can be made on the basis of the written evidence before him/her the traffic commissioner will advise representors of the final decision in writing; this will include details of any special conditions or undertakings attached to the licence.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.7 </span>Is the traffic commissioner’s decision final?</h3>

<p>An operator or statutory objector may appeal to the Upper Tribunal against the decision of a traffic commissioner. Representors have no such right. If an appeal is lodged representors are told and have 14 days from date of notification to apply to the Upper Tribunal to be made party to the appeal. Representors may however, where they feel that a legal procedural requirement has not been complied with, request that the traffic commissioner reviews a decision. This may only be done however where proper procedure has not been followed.</p>

<p>Although representors cannot appeal to the Upper Tribunal against a traffic commissioner’s decision they can apply to the High Court for a judicial review.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>How are statutory objectors notified of any application?</h3>

<p>A publication known as ‘Applications and Decisions’ is regularly produced for each traffic area which contains details of all the applications for a licence made in that area during a given period. The publication is emailed on request to Statutory Objectors in the region covered by the traffic area. The list of recipients is kept as up to date as possible but if you feel that you should be receiving a copy and are not please contact the Office of the Traffic Commissioner.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>On what grounds can objections be made?</h3>

<p>Objections can be made on environmental or non- environmental grounds or both.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span>Environmental grounds</h3>

<p>Environmental objections may be made under the provisions of Section 12(1) (applications for) and Section 19(2)(a) &amp; (4)(a) (variations to) of the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995.</p>

<p>The environmental factors that result from the use of land as an operating centre and which can be considered relevant to an objection may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>noise;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>fumes;</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>visual intrusion.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Please see ‘What grounds are relevant to a traffic commissioner’s consideration?’ for further details.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span>Non-environmental</h3>

<p>Non-environmental objections may be made on one or more of the following grounds on the basis that the requirements of Section 13 of the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995 cannot be met. They can relate to:</p>

<p>a) the suitability of the applicant to hold an operator’s licence on the grounds that he/she cannot meet the requirements to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>of good repute (for standard licences only); or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>fit to hold a licence (for restricted licences only); or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of appropriate financial standing (for standard licences only); or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>professionally competent (for standard licences only).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>b) the suitability of the operating centre in relation to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>size for the number of vehicles and trailers proposed to be parked there;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the safety of the entrance and exit arrangements from the site onto the public highway; or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>parking facilities in or around the site.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.6 </span>Making an objection</h3>

<p>An objection to an application for or variation to an operator’s licence must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>be made in writing to the traffic commissioner at the Office of the Traffic Commissioner and should wherever possible quote the legislation under which the objection is being made;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be signed by an authorised signatory from the organisation making the objection;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be received at the Office of the Traffic Commissioner no later than 21 days after the date that notice of the application is published in ‘Applications and Decisions’;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be copied to the applicant on the same day, or next working day, as the objection is made to the traffic commissioner;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>state specific grounds and give sufficient particulars so that the applicant knows the case he/she has to answer to.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If any of the above criteria are not met the traffic commissioner will not accept the objection as duly made unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>In order to assist you in lodging opposition to an application, a model template can be found at Annex 4 of this guide. Whilst there is no requirement for an objection to be submitted using this template, it is intended as a useful guide which sets out matters which the traffic commissioner may and may not take into consideration.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.7 </span>What happens next?</h3>

<p>In the case of a valid objection the Office of the Traffic Commissioner will usually write to the operator asking for further information about the proposed use of the operating centre and seeking comments on the matters contained in the objection. The applicant and the objector will also be encouraged to try to resolve any possible differences between them through direct liaison.</p>

<p>The traffic commissioner will then decide if he/she is able to make a decision on the application or whether it is necessary to hold a Public Inquiry to hear evidence from both parties before reaching a decision. Where the traffic commissioner considers that it may be possible to resolve matters without a Public Inquiry he/she will seek the comments of the relevant parties on any proposed way forward before deciding whether or not the application can be determined at that stage, or whether it is necessary to proceed to a hearing.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.8 </span>What range of decisions are available to the traffic commissioner?</h3>

<p>There are a number of options available to the traffic commissioner, the more usual are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>grant the application as applied for;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>grant the application but attach conditions or record undertakings regarding the use of the operating centre;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>grant the application for a reduced number of vehicles and/or trailers;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>refuse the application.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.9 </span>Is the traffic commissioner’s decision final?</h3>

<p>Any decision not to grant an application in full, to attach conditions or record undertakings regarding the use of an operating centre or not to meet the wishes of a statutory objector can be challenged by appeal to the Upper Tribunal - Administrative Appeal Chamber (Transport).</p>

<p>Forms and guidance are available from:<br>
Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber),<br> 5th floor,<br> 7 Rolls Buildings,<br> Fetter Lane,<br> London,<br> EC4A 1NL.<br> Tel: 020 7071 5662<br> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/administrative-appeals-tribunal">https://www.gov.uk/administrative-appeals-tribunal</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Complaints</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>What are complaints?</h3>

<p>Unlike representations and objections which are made in response to applications, complaints can be made at any time by anyone.</p>

<p>In general, complaints can be about the use of an existing operating centre or about breaches of any of the terms, for example conditions, under which a licence was issued, including parking.</p>

<p>Where possible a traffic commissioner would encourage those parties involved to resolve any problems between themselves on a one-to-one basis. Quite often a direct approach to the operator can result in a satisfactory solution without substantial involvement by the commissioner, which may save time and money for all those involved.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>On what grounds can complaints be made?</h3>

<p>A complaint about an authorised operating centre can be on either environmental or road safety grounds.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span>How does someone make a complaint?</h3>

<p>Complaints should be made in writing to the Office of the Traffic Commissioner at: Hillcrest House, 386 Harehills Lane, Leeds, LS9 6NF. It should clearly:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>state who the complaint is from;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>state the grounds for complaint;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>identify the operating centre concerned giving the full address of the operating centre and the name(s) of the operator(s) using the operating centre to which the complaint relates, and if possible, details of the vehicles, and movements giving cause for concern.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In order to assist you in making a complaint about an existing operating centre, a model template (form GVenv05) can be found at Annex 5 of this guide.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span>What happens when the complaint is made?</h3>

<p>Complaints will be acknowledged and the person making the complaint will be sent further information about the complaints procedure.  If they have not already done so they will be asked to fill in form GVenv05 which can be found at Annex 5 of this guide. This is needed in order to provide the traffic commissioner with the further information he/she will need to consider the views put forward.</p>

<p>The relevant part of the form may be copied to the operator(s) concerned. This will give him/her the opportunity to comment on the matters raised and to rectify any problems of which he/she may not have been aware.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.5 </span>What happens next?</h3>

<p>Although a complaint may be made at any time against an operating centre specified on a licence, the traffic commissioner can only take immediate action if it is considered that the operator concerned is operating outside the terms of his/her licence. Otherwise, the time at which the traffic commissioner can act is determined by what is known as the ‘Review Date’ (see ‘Review of Operating Centres’).</p>

<p>Unless an operator applies to vary the use of his/her operating centre, the traffic commissioner has the opportunity to review the suitability of that centre only at five yearly intervals. Upon receipt, a complaint will be registered against the relevant operator’s licence. If it is not a complaint that indicates an operator is operating outside the terms of his/her licence, the complaint will be brought forward and taken into consideration at the operator’s licence review stage. If the complaint relates to operating outside of the licence terms, the details will be passed to the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency for investigation.</p>

<p>Further complaints can be made by the same person at any time before the review date.</p>

<p>People who make complaints will be advised when the next review date is due and all reasonable steps will be taken to inform them of the traffic commissioner’s decision at that time.</p>

<p>If in the meantime an operator applies to vary his/her licence in a way which would affect an operating centre the application will be published in As and Ds. Those who have made complaints can make representations or objections against the grant of the variation. The complaints already made will not be treated as representations or objections. Separate opposition will have to be made in accordance with Parts 3 and 4 of this guide.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Review of Operating Centres</h2>

<p>What is a review?</p>

<p>The complaints procedure (as outlined in Part 5), is linked to the traffic commissioner’s ability to review the suitability of the operating centre(s) on an operator’s licence. The traffic commissioner may conduct such a review every five years commencing with the date when a goods vehicle operator’s licence came into force.</p>

<p>The review is not however automatic and is at the traffic commissioner’s discretion. In making his/her decision whether or not to review he/she will take into account any complaints received against an operating centre in the preceding five years.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span>How will people know if a review is to take place?</h3>

<p>In most circumstances a person or organisation who has made a complaint against an operating centre will have been told when the operating centre(s) is due for review. Near to the review date the Office of the Traffic Commissioner may write to them again asking if the points made in the original letter are still relevant and if the writer still wishes them to be considered.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span>What happens next?</h3>

<p>The traffic commissioner will consider all the evidence before him/her and decide if it justifies a review of the operating centre concerned. As soon as the decision whether or not to review the operating centre has been made, anyone who has complained will be notified.</p>

<p>This does not mean that the operator is free to do as he/she pleases for five years.</p>

<p>The review procedure does not affect the traffic commissioner’s powers to act and take disciplinary action at any time if a licence holder is operating outside the terms of his/her licence, for example by breaking any condition of use that appears on the operator’s licence.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span>What happens if a review is to take place?</h3>

<p>The traffic commissioner will consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>whether the operating centre continues to be suitable for the purposes for which the operator’s licence authorises it to be used;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether, if it is considered to be no longer suitable, conditions for environmental or road safety reasons could be attached or changed which would make it suitable; or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether it is incapable of being made suitable by the imposition or changing of conditions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>On a review the traffic commissioner has the power to remove an operating centre from the licence or to attach conditions or vary existing conditions.</p>

<p>The traffic commissioner can attach conditions for environmental reasons, such as the times vehicles use the operating centre, or for non-environmental reasons such as road safety.</p>

<p>The traffic commissioner can remove an operating centre from a licence for both environmental and non-environmental reasons; but in the case of environmental reasons the operating centre can be removed in only limited circumstances.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.4 </span>Is the traffic commissioner’s decision final?</h3>

<p>Only the operator has a right of appeal to the Upper Tribunal against any decision made on review and then only if conditions have been varied or placed on the licence or if an operating centre has been removed. Complainants can only challenge the traffic commissioner’s decision by seeking a judicial review of that decision through the High Court.</p>
