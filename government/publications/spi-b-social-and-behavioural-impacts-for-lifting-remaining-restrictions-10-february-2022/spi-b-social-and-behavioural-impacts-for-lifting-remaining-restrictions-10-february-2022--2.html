<p><abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours">SPI-B</abbr> note on social and behavioural impacts of lifting restrictions, including testing
and self-isolation, February 2022</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Executive summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In the event of remaining restrictions being lifted, policy makers and communicators should seek to mitigate potential economic and social harms to those identifying as clinically vulnerable and those from deprived socioeconomic and minority groups. They should consider unintended consequences of any changes to current provision of testing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Removal of free access to testing will make it more difficult for people experiencing <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> symptoms to confirm infection and take actions (including self-isolation) to reduce transmission to others. Especially in the short term, these changes may increase anxiety among some people and limit their social participation outside the home, particularly those who are, or who live with, someone who is clinically vulnerable [<em>Medium confidence</em>].</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the legal requirement to self-isolate upon testing positive is lifted and becomes an item of public health guidance, it is likely to lead to further ambiguity among the public about the need for strict adherence. This will disproportionately impact vulnerable sections of the population, for example those who face greater pressure to work outside the home when ill because of financial hardship, precarious employment, or caring responsibilities. [<em>Medium to high confidence</em>] Evidence from multiple rounds of the ONS Opinions and Lifestyles Survey shows that, throughout the pandemic, only a minority of the population report that they are able to work from home. The majority report travelling to work at all times.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other countries’ efforts to reduce rates of infectious illness through improved sick pay have proved effective. There is scope to trial this in the UK and other ways to help people to stay at home when infectious.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Protective behaviours developed during the pandemic can easily reduce or cease if not promoted longer term [<em>High confidence</em>]. As perceptions of personal risk decline, messaging should continue to set out the importance of continued adherence to specific protective measures as well as the rationale for lifting restrictions. Messaging should emphasise voluntary adherence as a contribution to collective wellbeing, as well as the continuing risks for some groups.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Messaging on safe behaviours should stress recognition of the different risks, needs and risk appetites of others to help prevent abusive incidents, social tensions, and stigma towards minority groups. Some far-right and anti-vax groups have successfully tapped into these tensions (across traditional political boundaries) and will continue to do so over at least the next 2 months [<em>High confidence</em>].</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lifting remaining restrictions provides an opportunity to forge a new narrative about maintaining safe behaviours. The legitimacy of narratives may well be increased if the loss and trauma associated with the pandemic is acknowledged alongside messages about a return to normality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any communications should use a range of channels to increase their reach and accessibility. There is an important role for community champions in communicating public health advice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cross-national studies have shown that people have higher confidence in health advice from health professionals and scientists compared to politicians. Now may be an optimal time to shift responsibility for messaging from central government to public health and NHS agencies [<em>High confidence</em>]. However, it is important that Government departments remain consistent in their <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>-related communications to avoid undermining health-led messaging.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Policy makers need to recognise that adherence will be harder for some individuals as the legislative and normative environment changes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adherence can be promoted by ensuring institutions and environments are supportive. Organisations (such as workplaces) should be encouraged and enabled to decide and enact proportionate measures in consultation with local public health staff.</p>
  </li>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>1) What are the potential social and behavioural impacts if Government ceases to require <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> mitigation measures, such as testing and self-isolation?</h3>

<h4>Testing &amp; isolation</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Maintaining some protective behaviours will reduce transmission of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, benefiting individuals at risk and other citizens, such as people more at risk from infection or awaiting NHS treatment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The use of diagnostic tests for <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> has been reported as reassuring for people who have reason to believe that they may have been exposed to infection <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. In the short-term, removing access to free testing may therefore increase anxiety among some people, particularly those who are, or who live with, someone who is clinically vulnerable [<em>Medium confidence</em>]. It will also have the unintended effect of making it more difficult for socioeconomically underrepresented and minority populations (who often have comorbidities) to take precautionary actions and seek medical treatment <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>. It is unclear what, if any, impact the withdrawal of free testing would have on anxiety levels more generally.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout the pandemic, most people with <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> symptoms have failed to take a test <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>. In part, this was initially driven by lack of availability of tests and later by public confusion as to whether their specific symptoms suggest the presence of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> or are more likely due to some other infectious or non-infectious cause <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>. If testing ceases to be encouraged or facilitated, then, for the public, <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> symptoms will become ever more subsumed into the broader, ill-defined set of respiratory-illness symptoms that are common in the population and will be treated by the public in the same way as any other symptom [<em>High confidence</em>].</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years, NHS advice on what people experiencing flu-like symptoms should do has been to stay off work or school until recovered <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>. Very often, this advice is not followed, increasing the risk of transmission <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup> [<em>High confidence</em>].</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any withdrawal of free testing for those experiencing possible <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> symptoms or ending of requirements to isolate for those with <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> may unintentionally communicate the message to some that it is acceptable to continue with social contacts regardless of infection or symptoms. This may have particularly adverse impacts on the ability of some employees to take sick leave when experiencing (possible) symptoms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a growing body of evidence which explores the reasons why people who are ill attend work or school. These include issues such as the absence of sick pay, perceived pressure from employers, fear of increasing colleagues’ workload and cultural norms within an organisation. Risk factors such as the absence of sick pay have, in turn, been associated with a greater likelihood of disease outbreaks occurring within a workplace <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> becomes hidden among other ‘everyday’ infectious illnesses, reducing its impact on morbidity and mortality could be achieved if people with general symptoms of an infectious illness stay at home [<em>High confidence</em>]. Facilitating this would require the Government, employers, line managers and members of the public to address the broad range of factors set out in the referenced systematic reviews <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Previous attempts in other countries to reduce rates of infectious illness by providing improved sick pay have proved effective: as fewer sick staff attend work, less transmission occurs, leading to fewer staff absences overall. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup> Unfortunately, trials of interventions that encourage and enable more people to stay at home when ill are lacking in the literature.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Social and community tensions</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Advice on safe behaviours should acknowledge that different people view the risk of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> infection differently, often owing to morbidities which are invisible to others. Messaging should accordingly stress tolerance and recognition of the different needs and risk appetites of individuals. Stressing the need to respect others’ decisions is vital in order to prevent incidents of verbal abuse and physical assault, which have recently occurred in the UK and other countries. Social distancing, wearing face-coverings and other protective behaviours have become highly politicised and the potential for conflict is unlikely to diminish in the foreseeable future <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ending restrictions will produce greater uncertainty around how to act safely, generating more stigmatising and exclusionary behaviours [<em>Medium confidence</em>] <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup>. This uncertainty should be mitigated as it will impact health-seeking behaviours, including potentially around vaccination.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shifting responsibility for communicating the importance of protective behaviours to public health agencies may have a positive impact on adherence (public health agencies are more trusted than government [<em>High confidence</em>] – see also question 3). However, it is important that cross-government communications remain consistent to avoid undermining health-led messaging.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inconsistent messaging may lead to confusion and uncertainty among the public, and may feed into existing social and political tensions which have evolved over the course of the pandemic in response to broader public frustration over restrictions <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup>. Some far-right and anti-vax groups have successfully tapped into these tensions (across traditional political boundaries) and will continue to do so over at least the next 2 months [<em>High confidence</em>].</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistency of messaging is important to encourage protective behaviours; the Government’s intention to change the current policy mandating vaccination of NHS staff may cause tensions to fuel anti-vaccine sentiment. Public acceptability of vaccine mandates is mixed, and higher in some contexts (such as foreign travel) compared to others. If pursued, the need for vaccine mandates should be clearly communicated and consistently enacted <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Previous <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours">SPI-B</abbr> advice <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup> on the security and policing implications of lifting restrictions should be considered.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alongside the lifting of restrictions, consideration should be given to acknowledging and supporting the collective loss that has been experienced as a result of the pandemic. This can be done through communications, making practical support available and or symbolic commemoration <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup>. The legitimacy of communications may be increased if experiences of loss and trauma are acknowledged in public discourse through local and national commemorations by neutral figures [^21].</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Marginalised communities</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Previous <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours">SPI-B</abbr> advice has emphasised the need to consider the disproportionate economic, social and physical impacts of lifting restrictions on marginalised communities (such as migrant workers, people with disabilities and certain ethnic groups) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">[footnote 22]</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lifting of restrictions may have a disproportionate impact on the health of marginalised and socio-economically deprived groups and areas. Factors influencing this include health inequities and barriers to accessing healthcare, occupation and household circumstances. Previous <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours">SPI-B</abbr> advice on these impacts should be considered <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">[footnote 23]</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To minimise the disproportionate economic and long-term social and mental health impacts on marginalised communities, financial aid and public communications to groups who have been most acutely affected should be considered <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">[footnote 24]</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>The clinically vulnerable</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The lifting of remaining restrictions will affect the risk perceptions and ability to engage in society of those identifying as clinically vulnerable (which includes many from marginalised communities) particularly when levels of community transmission remain high [<em>Medium confidence</em>]. Any policy should consider and mitigate these harms through both policy measures and public communications.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>2) What is the key advice for encouraging maintenance of safe behaviours in the absence of restrictions?</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours">SPI-B</abbr> papers ‘Behavioural and social considerations when reducing restrictions’ <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:25" rel="footnote">[footnote 25]</a></sup> and ’Sustaining behaviours to reduce <abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> transmission’ <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:26" rel="footnote">[footnote 26]</a></sup> contain relevant advice on lifting restrictions, including the need for ongoing practical support to encourage public adherence to safe behaviours.</p>

<h4>Public perceptions of risk</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>As perceptions of risk decline, messaging should continue to set out clearly why continued adherence to specific protective measures is important, as well as the scientific evidence and rationale for lifting restrictions <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:27" rel="footnote">[footnote 27]</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Behavioural routines developed during the pandemic can easily reduce and cease if not promoted over the long-term <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:28" rel="footnote">[footnote 28]</a></sup> [<em>Medium to high confidence</em>]. Reminder campaigns would be useful at key times of the year such as the return to school in September or as part of the transition to winter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Responses to the important question of ’How safe is safe enough?’ are likely to differ between political leaders, experts and members of the public. Top-down designations of ‘safe enough’ will be less effective than co-created risk assessments and opportunities for collaborative, interactive monitoring and feedback. These collaborations should allow for quantitative measures and qualitative assessments to capture the unique challenges and successes of living and working in environments deemed ‘safe enough’ while the pandemic continues <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:29" rel="footnote">[footnote 29]</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A risk reduction framework may be a useful practical tool to help the public consider overall risk level in different situations rather than viewing risk as a binary decision (for example, indoor gatherings are ‘safe’ or ‘unsafe’), which could lead to an all-or-nothing approach [<em>Low confidence</em>].</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Enabling public adherence</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>As stated in previous papers <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:30" rel="footnote">[footnote 30]</a></sup>, communications should emphasise voluntary adherence as a contribution to collective wellbeing, as well as the continuing risks for some groups.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Policy needs to recognise that adherence will be harder for some individuals as the legislative and normative environment changes and that their ability to make choices will depend on personal circumstances.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government should consider how to encourage adherence to protective behaviours through broader social norms (as in many east Asian countries), particularly in a context where all restrictions may be lifted over a short time and <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> becomes a longer-term public health concern.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adherence can be promoted by ensuring institutions and environments are supportive, for example employers offer sufficient sick leave; transport operators promote mask use; and buildings provide effective ventilation, including the ability to open windows where this is part of the ventilation system [<em>High confidence</em>]. Where possible environments should be designed and managed to obviate the need for these kinds of behaviours (for example windows do not need to be opened if ventilation through a mechanical system is adequate without this).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some organisations have demonstrated that they can implement a variety of preventive measures in locally appropriate ways through collaboration with local public health staff. Guidance should be created through collaboration and consultation, and adequate notice is needed when guidance changes <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:31" rel="footnote">[footnote 31]</a></sup>. Organisations should be encouraged and enabled to decide and enact proportionate measures in consultation with local public health staff.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Communications should avoid simply providing reassurance about safety. Messages should explain clearly the reasons for changes to advice around protective behaviours and identify the ways in which safety will be monitored. Regular updates should be made available [<em>High confidence</em>] <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:32" rel="footnote">[footnote 32]</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>3) Are there implications if responsibility for communicating public health guidance shifts from central government to <abbr title="UK Health and Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> or NHS?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Lifting remaining restrictions provides an opportunity to forge a new narrative around maintaining safe behaviours, emphasising that the public faces an environment in which risks are nuanced rather than binary (see above). Cross-national studies have shown that people have higher confidence in health advice from medical workers and other health and scientific experts <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:33" rel="footnote">[footnote 33]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:34" rel="footnote">[footnote 34]</a></sup>. This is particularly the case when trust in government is low and where individuals report that government is less likely to follow scientific advice <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:35" rel="footnote">[footnote 35]</a></sup>. When trust in government is high regarding <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> control measures (namely, these are perceived as well organised and clearly messaged), there is a higher adoption of protective health behaviours <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:36" rel="footnote">[footnote 36]</a></sup> [<em>Medium to high confidence</em>].</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the above, it is advisable to build on the ongoing strong public trust in the NHS, which suggests that now may be a good time to shift responsibility for messaging from central government to public health agencies (NHS, <abbr title="UK Health and Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) [<em>High confidence</em>]. The profile of the NHS is obviously greater than the <abbr title="UK Health and Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, so that would be the preferred trusted source, though coherence and visibility of messaging remains important across a variety of sources.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Importance of consistent messaging from a variety of sources</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The nationally funded Community Champions programme was a successful central government pandemic policy which resulted in coherence and alignment of messaging across national sources, local authorities, NHS, Clinical Commissioning Groups (<abbr title="Clinical Commissioning Groups">CCGs</abbr>) and community organisations <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:37" rel="footnote">[footnote 37]</a></sup>. A similar framework should be considered to increase coherence of messaging going forward.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Community Champions programme has also demonstrated the importance of using trusted leaders and community members to improve communication strategies, as well as testing and vaccination rates during the pandemic, particularly for socioeconomically deprived groups. [<em>High confidence</em>]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Central government should ensure there is sufficient resourcing and support for devolved health systems, as well as giving a clear directive to local authorities to allocate sufficient resources to disadvantaged communities, where mainstream engagement efforts are less likely to be effective.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The public seeks and receives health guidance from a range of channels (beyond mainstream outlets such as press conferences and news media) [<em>High confidence</em>]. Any communication should use channels that the public engages with, including social media and messaging services, while taking care to correct misinformation and disinformation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the legal requirement to self-isolate when testing positive is lifted and becomes an item of public health guidance, it is also likely to lead to further ambiguity among the public about the need for strict adherence. This will disproportionately impact vulnerable sections of the population, for example those who face greater pressures to work outside the home when ill because of financial hardship, precarious employment or caring responsibilities [<em>Medium to high confidence</em>] <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:38" rel="footnote">[footnote 38]</a></sup>. Evidence from multiple rounds of the ONS Opinions and Lifestyles Survey show that, throughout the pandemic, only a minority of the population report that they are able to work from home. The majority report travelling to work at all times <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:39" rel="footnote">[footnote 39]</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Broader, long-term communications considerations</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Public information needs can change over the course of extreme events. For example, high demand for information about the immediate health impacts during the ‘emergency’ portion of a longer-term extreme event can transition to a heavier focus on information about the longer-term health and social impacts <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:40" rel="footnote">[footnote 40]</a></sup>. Shifting responsibility for communication to health authorities creates an opportunity for new dialogue and recognition of the longer-term health impacts of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> (such as long <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>), as well as longer-term wider impacts (for example waiting lists, developmental and educational delays, mental health and wellbeing impacts, community tensions and more). Information about the longer-term health impacts of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> will need to be provided separately to information about current infections.</p>
  </li>

    <p>Previous research into extreme events shows that perceptions of personal costs vary in nature and extent at different stages of an emergency <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:41" rel="footnote">[footnote 41]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:42" rel="footnote">[footnote 42]</a></sup>. For example, members of the public may experience personal costs associated with feelings of guilt if they survive an extreme event while others do not. Personal costs can also include secondary stressors that are more prevalent as an event runs on. For example, members of the public may experience ongoing economic and health consequences, difficulties with securing compensation, impacts on education and negative familial impacts as a result of the pandemic <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:43" rel="footnote">[footnote 43]</a></sup>. Health professionals and communicators will need to adapt their assessments to identify the impacts of pandemic-related secondary stressors, and potentially adapt the support offered.</p>
