<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> About this notice</h3>

<p>This notice explains what HMRC require when denatured alcohol is produced, distributed and used in the UK. Denatured alcohol is alcohol that has been made unsuitable for drinking by the addition of denaturants.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> What’s changed</h3>

<p>This notice has been updated to reflect the UK’s exit from the EU and the end of the transition period.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> How to get advice</h3>

<p>If you need any advice, or any of the forms and notices referred to in this notice, contact our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/excise-enquiries">excise general enquiries helpline</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span> Technical terms in this notice</h3>

<p>Technical terms are explained in either <a class="govuk-link" href="#glossary">the glossary</a> or body of the notice.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span> Parts of this notice that have the force of law</h3>

<p>The law states that some detailed rules may be set out in notices published by HMRC. Sections 9.5, 14.2 and 14.3 have a force of law.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Classes of denatured alcohol</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> The classes of denatured alcohol</h3>

<p>There are 3 approved classes of denatured alcohol in the UK:</p>

<ul>
  <li>completely denatured alcohol (<abbr title="completely denatured alcohol">CDA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>industrial denatured alcohol (<abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>trade specific denatured alcohol (<abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Completely denatured alcohol (<abbr title="completely denatured alcohol">CDA</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="completely denatured alcohol">CDA</abbr> is the most heavily denatured alcohol. The standard formulation for <abbr title="completely denatured alcohol">CDA</abbr> produced in the UK is with every 100 parts by volume of alcohol mix 3 parts by volume of isopropyl alcohol, 3 parts by volume of methyl ethyl ketone and one gram of denatonium benzoate.</p>

<h4>Information for Northern Ireland</h4>

<p><abbr title="completely denatured alcohol">CDA</abbr> made in an EU member state, in accordance with a <abbr title="completely denatured alcohol">CDA</abbr> formulation of that member state, must be accepted in Northern Ireland free of duty. The approved formulations of <abbr title="completely denatured alcohol">CDA</abbr> for all member states are prescribed in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 3199/93 and are listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section16">section 16</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Use of purple dye in <abbr title="completely denatured alcohol">CDA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Prior to 1 July 2013, the formulation of <abbr title="completely denatured alcohol">CDA</abbr> included methyl violet dye. The inclusion of the dye is no longer mandatory in the <abbr title="completely denatured alcohol">CDA</abbr> prescribed formulation. However, some users may still want to have the purple dye included.</p>

<p>A purple dye may be added if required and the mixture will still be treated as <abbr title="completely denatured alcohol">CDA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Industrial denatured alcohol (<abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr> is the grade of denatured alcohol designed for industrial use. It consists of 95 parts by volume of alcohol and 5 parts by volume of wood naphtha, or a substitute for wood naphtha.</p>

<p>Where a substitute for wood naphtha is used, the volume mixed with every 95 parts of alcohol may be less than 5 parts if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the resulting mixture contains the other substances that we approved, when we approved the substitute for wood naphtha in the proportions that we specify</li>
  <li>the proportion of the marker in the resulting mixture is, in the case of:
    <ul>
      <li>methyl alcohol, not less than 36 parts per thousand</li>
      <li>tertiary butyl alcohol, not less than one part per thousand</li>
      <li>other markers approved by us, not less than the proportion specified by us when we approved that marker</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Information for Northern Ireland</h4>

<p>Denatured alcohol that is not <abbr title="completely denatured alcohol">CDA</abbr> must be accepted in Northern Ireland free of duty if it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>was made in an EU member state in accordance with a formulation of that member state</li>
  <li>is incorporated into a product that is not for human consumption</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> Trade specific denatured alcohol (<abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> formulations are types of denatured alcohol approved to meet specific trade needs. There are, at the time this notice was published, 12 approved formulations of <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr>, all with different specific approved uses. These uses are given in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section18">section 18</a>.</p>

<span class="number">2.6 </span> Wood naphtha and wood naphtha substitutes</h3>

<p>Natural wood naphtha is made from the distillation of wood. Natural wood naphtha is not widely available, but substitute wood naphtha (with the same properties as natural wood naphtha) can be used.</p>

<p>The standards for wood naphtha and substitutes for wood naphtha are given in paragraph 7 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1524/schedule/made" rel="external">schedule to the Denatured Alcohol Regulations 2005</a> (reproduced in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section20">section 20</a>).</p>

<p>To have your own formulation for substitute wood naphtha approved, contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/alcohol-duties-national-registration-unit">Excise processing teams (<abbr title="Excise Processing Teams">EPT</abbr>)</a>. Your proposed substitute wood naphtha will have to meet the requirements given in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section20">section 20</a> before we’ll consider approving it.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Methyl alcohol (methanol) is not identical to legally defined wood naphtha, or to any approved wood naphtha substitute. You must not use methanol as a direct substitute for wood naphtha in the manufacture of any type of denatured alcohol.</p>

<p>(Northern Ireland only)</p>

<p><abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr> and <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> should be treated as any other duty-suspended alcohol when supplying to an EU member state. The Excise Movement Control System (EMCS) must be used for these movements.

<p><abbr title="completely denatured alcohol">CDA</abbr> supplied from Northern Ireland to an EU member state must be accompanied by a completed Simplified Accompanying Document (<abbr title="Simplified Accompanying Document">SAD</abbr>). An example of this can be found in the Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3649/92 of 17 December 1992, however Article 2.2 states that commercial documents, such as invoices or delivery notes, may also be used as the simplified accompanying document provided they contain the same elements of information, and the nature of the information is identified by a number corresponding with the relative box number of the example.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.3 </span> Check if you must receive a written statement or authorisation for these consignments</h3>

<p>Once the denatured alcohol leaves UK territory, control of the consignment passes over to the relevant country of destination. You’ll have to comply with any requirements imposed by the relevant country.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.5 </span> Applying for a multi-site authorisation</h3>

<p>Users with multi-premises businesses (for example, local authorities, NHS management committee and retail chains) may apply to be authorised to distribute <abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr> and <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> to premises (for example, schools, clinics, hospitals and branches) under their control.</p>

<p>Applications must be made using the form at <a class="govuk-link" href="#section19">section 19</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.6 </span> What your <abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr> and <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> authorisation will include</h3>

<p>Your authorisation will state:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what you’re entitled to receive</li>
  <li>where you’re entitled to receive, store and use it</li>
  <li>what you can use it for</li>
  <li>the conditions you must observe</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll review your authorisation from time to time and may vary the conditions or revoke the authorisation if we need to.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.7 </span> If details given in your application change</h3>

<p>If anything changes since you applied for authorisation you must write to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/alcohol-duties-national-registration-unit"><abbr title="Excise Processing Teams">EPT</abbr></a> with the details. You must not receive any more supplies of <abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr> or <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> until you’ve notified us of the changes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.8 </span> Before receiving and using <abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr> or <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> as an authorised user</h3>

<p>Before you receive <abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr> or <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> you must give your supplier a copy of your authorisation to receive and use <abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr> or <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The copy authorisation may cover any number of consignments of <abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr> or <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr>. However if anything changes you must give your supplier a copy of your amended authorisation before you receive more supplies of <abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr> or <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.9 </span> Receiving free samples of <abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr> or <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> without being authorised as a user</h3>

<p>If you consider using <abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr> or <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> but are not sure whether it will be suitable you may receive free samples of <abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr> or <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> without being authorised as a user, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#section8-5">section 8.5</a> for more information. However you should be aware that the use you’re trialling should be a permitted use.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.10 </span> Receipt of 5 litres or less of <abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr> or <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> to schools, colleges or universities</h3>

<p>Schools, colleges or universities that want to receive and use up to 5 litres of <abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr> or <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> per year are not required to get a user authorisation read <a class="govuk-link" href="#section8-6">section 8.6</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.11 </span> Blends of denatured alcohol are and how they are treated</h3>

<p>Blends of denatured alcohol are used in the printing ink industry. Blends are the printing ink <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> formulations with additional chemicals added to make printing ink components, but are not the final printing ink product. Once a <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> has had additional chemicals added to it, it is no longer a <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> as it does not meet a prescribed formulation.</p>

<p>In the above case, if you’re a producer of denatured alcohol, you’ll also be a user if you’re using the <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> to make printing ink components. You’ll need to be authorised as a user. The printing ink component can then be supplied to the printing ink manufacturer without the need for the manufacturer (printer) to be authorised.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.12 </span> If none of the approved <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> formulations are suitable for your needs</h3>

<p>HMRC are prepared to consider applications for alternative <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> formulations, but any new formulations must provide a similar level of revenue protection to that of the existing formulations. It may be worth contacting a licensed or authorised denaturer with your proposals to make sure that your proposed formulation can be produced.</p>

<p>Before a new <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> is approved, you must supply convincing evidence that the existing approved denatured alcohols, including TSDAs, are unsuitable for your intended purpose.</p>

<p>You must apply in writing explaining why <abbr title="completely denatured alcohol">CDA</abbr>, <abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr> or any of the approved <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> formulations in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section18">section 18</a> would be unsuitable for your intended use.</p>

<p>To help us consider a new application we may ask you to provide samples of the proposed formulation and any other information we think necessary.</p>

<p>Send your application to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/alcohol-duties-national-registration-unit"><abbr title="Excise Processing Teams">EPT</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>We’ll consider your proposals and contact you with a decision.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.13 </span> When to  provide a financial guarantee</h3>

<p>HMRC do not require a financial guarantee as a standard condition of authorisation. If, however, we find that your compliance with our requirements is poor we may require you to provide a guarantee to cover the duty element of the denatured alcohol you receive.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances we’ll tell you what you must do.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.14 </span> Check if you can recover the alcohol from contaminated <abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr> and <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> and use it again</h3>

<p>Not unless you have specific authorisation from us which allows you to do so.</p>

<p>Our requirements for recovery and laundering of <abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr> and <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section12">section 12</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.15 </span> Supplying <abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr> and <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> as an authorised user</h3>

<p>As an authorised user you may only supply <abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr> and <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> in quantities less than 20 litres at any one time to another authorised user provided your authorisation does not specifically restrict you from doing so. You must hold a copy of that user’s authorisation to receive <abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr> and <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> read <a class="govuk-link" href="#section8-4">section 8.4</a> for more information.</p>

<span class="number">12. </span> Recovery</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.1 </span> What recovery is</h3>

<p>Recovery involves the separation of alcohol or any other substance from any denatured alcohol or any product containing denatured alcohol.</p>

<p>After many processes which use denatured alcohol, a residue is left which contains contaminated alcohol. Although you may think that this residue is denatured alcohol, often the processes remove the legally required marker and denaturants present in denatured alcohol formulations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.2 </span> Check who can recover alcohol or any other substance</h3>

<p>Only someone who is approved by us in writing to do so may recover alcohol or any other substance from denatured alcohol or products containing denatured alcohol.</p>

<p>If you want to recover alcohol in order to produce denatured alcohol from it you’ll also need to be licensed as a producer.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.3 </span> How to become approved</h3>

<p>You must apply in writing to our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/alcohol-duties-national-registration-unit"><abbr title="Excise Processing Teams">EPT</abbr></a> for an approval to recover alcohol or any other substance. Your application must state:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your name</li>
  <li>the address of the premises where recovery or removal will take place</li>
  <li>the sources of the <abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr> and <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr> or product containing <abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr> and <abbr title="trade specific denatured alcohol">TSDA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>details of processes to be used</li>
  <li>details of what will be removed or recovered</li>
</ul>

<p>Your approval will set out any conditions that will apply.</p>

<p>If you recover alcohol it will be liable to Excise Duty unless it is used to produce denatured alcohol.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.4 </span> General conditions you must comply with if you’re approved</h3>

<p>Any alcohol or product from which any other substance is removed must be kept:</p>

<ul>
  <li>under the control of the person who recovered or removed it, and</li>
  <li>under lock or otherwise secured until disposed of or otherwise dealt with in accordance with any condition imposed as part of your approval</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.5 </span> What you should do if (as a distributor) you have a stock surplus</h3>

<p>Investigate and record the reasons for the surplus. Inform the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/excise-enquiries">Excise Written Enquires team</a> and amend your records to reflect the quantities of alcohols actually in stock.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.6 </span> Disposal of stock</h3>

<p>If you want to dispose of any stock, you may do so whenever you like. No prior notification or approval is required by HMRC. However, your records should evidence the reason for disposal and the method of disposal.</p>

<p>If your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>business is discontinued while you’re holding stocks of denatured alcohol, or</li>
  <li>authority or licence to hold stocks of denatured alcohol is revoked</li>
</ul>

<p>You must ensure that transfer of any remaining stock of denatured alcohol is to a person who is approved to receive it . You must note the details of the transfer in your business records and, once all stocks are disposed of, you must write to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/alcohol-duties-national-registration-unit"><abbr title="Excise Processing Teams">EPT</abbr></a>  to request cancellation of your licence or authority.</p>

<p>If the discontinuance of business is caused by the death of a producer, distributor or other person, their personal representatives must contact the <abbr title="Excise Processing Teams">EPT</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.4 </span> Getting your records inspected</h3>

<p>HMRC will visit you from time to time to inspect your premises and examine any denatured alcohol you have on your premises.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.5 </span> What will happen if something is wrong</h3>

<p>HMRC may require you to pay the duty on the alcohol lost in the unauthorised processes or supplies. You may also be liable to penalties and we may withdraw your authorisation.</p>

<p>Unauthorised processes or supplies include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>unexplained losses of undenatured or denatured alcohol</li>
  <li>producers who do not denature to the required standards</li>
  <li>producers or distributors who supply to persons who are not authorised users</li>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span> Certificates of denaturing for exported cosmetics and toiletries</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.1 </span> When a certificate of denaturing is needed</h3>

<p>Some countries may require a certificate of denaturing if you export cosmetics or toiletries containing spirits to them. The certificate provides evidence that your products have been produced using alcohol denatured to acceptable UK standards to obtain relief from duty.</p>

<p>Customs authorities in the country of destination will normally accept a certificate of denaturing endorsed by us.</p>

<p>You should find out about the import requirements of any country before you export your cosmetics and toiletries there.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.2 </span> Who may apply</h3>

<p>You may apply to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/alcohol-duties-national-registration-unit"><abbr title="Excise Processing Teams">EPT</abbr></a> for a certificate of denaturing if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are a UK manufacturer of cosmetics and toiletries produced using denatured alcohol, and</li>
  <li>hold a valid authority to receive and use denatured alcohol for the manufacture of cosmetics and toiletries</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also qualify if you receive toiletries made elsewhere (read paragraph 15.5).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.3 </span> How to apply</h3>

<p>You must prepare a certificate using your company letterhead. The certificate must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>state the brand names of the cosmetics and toiletries concerned</li>
  <li>state the reference number of your authority to receive denatured alcohol (<abbr title="industrial denatured alcohol">IDA</abbr> and TSDAs), and</li>
  <li>include a signed declaration to the effect:</li>
</ul>

<p>‘All cosmetics and toiletries listed above have been manufactured in the United Kingdom using ethanol denatured to UK standards.</p>

<p>Signed …………………………………………………………………………………..…’</p>

<p>You must also include the following statement for us to endorse:</p>

<p>‘HM Revenue and Customs certifies that (state your company name) is authorised to receive ethanol denatured in accordance with UK standards to manufacture the cosmetic and toiletry products listed above.</p>

<p>Officer’s Signature ……………………………………………………………………….’</p>

<p>This certificate remains valid for one year from the date of official endorsement. Customs authorities in the country of destination may accept photocopies of the certificate. You should find out in advance the certification requirements of the EU country to which you intend to send your products. We cannot make enquires on your behalf.</p>

<p>If you want to add products to the list contained in the certificate, you’ll need to submit a new statement. It should include the product additions for our endorsement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.4 </span> Checks on your application</h3>

<p>HMRC may want to visit your premises and inspect your records to confirm the accuracy of your application.</p>

<p>The records you normally keep as an authorised user of denatured alcohol will usually be sufficient for this purpose.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.5 </span> Exporting products you do not make</h3>

<p>You may apply for a certificate of denaturing provided that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your application is supported by a copy of the manufacturer’s authority to receive and use denatured alcohol for the manufacture of cosmetics and toiletries or a copy of the manufacturer’s certificate of denaturing, and</li>
  <li>you undertake to give us access to your premises and records</li>
</ul>

<p>Certificates cannot be endorsed where supporting evidence is unsatisfactory or where you do not give an undertaking to provide access. We cannot make enquiries on your behalf where you cannot provide satisfactory evidence to support your application.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">20. </span> Standards for denaturants and markers</h2>

<p>This section lists the standards for denaturants, markers and dyes as described in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1524/schedule/made" rel="external">schedule to the Denatured Alcohol Regulations 2005</a>.</p>

<h3>Denatonium benzoate</h3>

<p>Denatonium benzoate is benzyldiethyl [(2,6-xyly carbamoyl) methyl] ammonium benzoate.</p>

<h3>Use of water</h3>

<p>When making denatured alcohol in accordance with a formulation specified in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1524/schedule/made" rel="external">schedule to the Denatured Alcohol Regulations 2005</a> water may be mixed with the alcohol before denaturing or with the denatured alcohol but the quantity of water added must not reduce the proportion or quantity of denaturing substances or dyes in the resulting mixture below the proportions or quantities specified in the formulation, and for the purpose of ascertaining the proportion or quantity of denaturing substances or dyes in any such mixture the water shall be treated as if it were alcohol.</p>

<h3>Standards for wood naphtha and other denaturing substances</h3>

<p>Wood naphtha, substitute for wood naphtha, tertiary butyl alcohol and denatonium benzoate used in making denatured alcohol must conform to the respective standards and meet other respective requirements of paragraphs 7 to 11 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1524/schedule/made" rel="external">schedule to the Denatured Alcohol Regulations</a>.</p>

<h3>Wood naphtha and substitute for wood naphtha</h3>

<p>Wood naphtha must, to the satisfaction of the Commissioners, possess such properties as to render a mixture of one part of the naphtha with 19 parts of plain spirits of a strength of not less than 95%. alcohol by volume, unfit for use as a beverage.</p>

<p>Wood naphtha must contain not less than 72% by volume of methyl alcohol.</p>

<p>In the case of a substitute for wood naphtha:</p>

<p>(a) the substitute must possess, to the satisfaction of the Commissioners, such properties as to render a mixture of one part of the substitute with 19 parts of plain spirits, of a strength of not less than 95% alcohol by volume, unfit for use as a beverage</p>

<p>(b) all the ingredients and their amounts which are to constitute the substitute must be approved by the Commissioners, and</p>

<p>(c) must contain as a marker:</p>

<p>not less than 72% by volume of methyl alcohol, or 2% by volume of tertiary butyl alcohol, or</p>

<p>such other marker as the Commissioners may approve, in the proportions specified by them.</p>

<h3>Quality</h3>

<p>All substances used in the production of denatured alcohol must be of sufficient quality to make sure that the alcohol is properly denatured.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">21. </span> Review and appeal procedures</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">21.1 </span> If you disagree with any decision HMRC makes about your affairs</h3>

<p>When we make a decision that you can appeal against, we’ll tell you and offer you a review. We’ll explain the decision and tell you what you need to do if you disagree.</p>

<p>For example with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the amount of an assessment</li>
  <li>the issue of a civil penalty, or</li>
  <li>a decision specifically connected to the relevant duty</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll usually have 3 options. Within 30 days you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>send new information or arguments to the officer you’ve been dealing with</li>
  <li>have your case reviewed by a different officer</li>
  <li>have your case heard by an independent tribunal</li>
</ul>

<p>A review will be handled by a different officer from the one who made the decision. If you prefer to have an independent tribunal hear your case, you must write directly to the Tribunals Service.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">21.2 </span> Time limits to ask for a review</h3>

<p>If you want us to review a decision, you must write to the person who issued the decision letter, within 30 days of the date of that letter. We’ll complete our review within 45 days, unless we agree another time with you.</p>

<p>You cannot ask the tribunal to hear your case until 45 days (or the time we agreed with you) has expired, or we’ve told you the outcome of the review.</p>

<p>If you’re not satisfied with the review’s conclusion, you have 30 days within which to ask the tribunal to hear your case.</p>

<p>If we cannot complete our review within 45 days, or any time we agreed with you, we’ll ask you whether you’re willing to agree to an extension so that we can complete the review. If you do not agree to an extension, the review is treated as concluding that the decision being reviewed is upheld.</p>

<p>We’ll write and tell you this: you then have 30 days from the date of that letter to ask the tribunal to hear your case.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">21.3 </span> What to include in your request for review</h3>
