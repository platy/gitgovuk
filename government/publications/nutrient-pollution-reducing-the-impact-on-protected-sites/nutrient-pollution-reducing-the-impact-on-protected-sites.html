<h2>Our protected sites and nutrient pollution</h2>

<p>As set out in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/25-year-environment-plan">25 Year Environment Plan</a>, England’s protected sites are a vitally important part of this government’s ambitious commitments on the environment, including delivering the Environment Act target to halt species decline by 2030. They represent some of the nation’s most precious and sensitive habitats, providing wintering and breeding habitats for wetland birds, and supporting rare and characteristic species. They provide many important services to society, including flood control, carbon capture, climate change adaptation, and access to nature, with many benefits to public health and wellbeing. However, one of the significant causes of decline in our protected sites is the damage caused by nutrient pollution in water courses.</p>

<p>Nutrient pollution is a particular problem for our freshwater habitats and estuaries. Increased levels of nutrients (especially nitrogen and phosphorus) can speed up the growth of certain plants, disrupting natural processes and impacting wildlife. This process damages water dependent sites, harming the plants and wildlife, and affects the oxygen carrying capacity of the water. In technical terms it can put sites in ‘unfavourable condition’. The sources of excess nutrients are site specific, but predominantly originate from wastewater treatment works and agricultural pollution.</p>

<h2>Nutrient neutrality</h2>

<p>Many of our most internationally important water bodies are designated as protected sites under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/1012/contents/made" rel="external">Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017</a>, and termed “Habitats Sites” in the National Planning Policy Framework. Under the Habitats Regulations, competent authorities, such as local planning authorities and the Environment Agency, must assess the environmental impact of projects and plans (such as planning applications or local plans) that come forward which affect these sites. This is one of the ways environmental impacts are considered in the planning system (other examples include Environmental Impact Assessment, Strategic Environmental Assessment and Biodiversity Net Gain). Local Planning Authorities can only approve a project if they are certain it will have no negative effect on the site’s condition.</p>

<p>As a result of these regulations and European case law, Natural England has previously advised a total of 32 local planning authorities that where protected sites are in unfavourable condition due to excess nutrients, projects and plans should only go ahead if they will not cause additional pollution to sites. They can demonstrate this through “nutrient neutrality”. This means that new residential development can only happen if the nutrient load created through additional wastewater from the development is mitigated. This typically involves creating new wetlands to strip nutrients from water or creating buffer zones to revert to nature. This has had a significant negative impact on the number of homes granted planning permission in affected areas.</p>

<p>Following further work to understand the sources of site deterioration, Natural England have identified a further 20 protected sites that are adversely impacted by nutrient pollution. As a result, Natural England have today advised a further 42 Local Planning Authorities that their areas are covered by this advice. Different Local Planning Authorities are affected to different degrees – some will have only a small fraction of their area affected, and others will be impacted to a much larger extent.</p>

<h3>Government support for nutrient neutrality</h3>

<p>We recognise that delivering ‘nutrient neutrality’ under the Habitats Regulations may impose additional costs on development. For some Local Planning Authorities, the requirement for new development to be nutrient neutral will have an impact on their ability to approve some new development quickly, in particular housing.</p>

<p>The government is clear that this can only be an interim solution. We must act to address the sources of pollution and tighten up the associated regulatory frameworks to prevent further harm to protected sites. We are committed to taking action to reduce the mitigation burden in order for communities to get the homes they need.</p>

<p>The government is committed to sustainable development and building the homes the country needs for the future, whilst addressing the sources of pollution to restore our protected sites. We have developed a package of support to ensure that developers and local planning authorities are able to achieve nutrient neutrality. This has three components.</p>

<h3>Practical support</h3>

<p>Local authority and developer stakeholders have told us that implementing nutrient neutrality is onerous, time-consuming, and reliant on detailed expertise. We are addressing this through:</p>

<h4>Tools and guidance from Natural England</h4>

<p>To provide greater certainty upfront. Catchment-specific calculators will allow developers to calculate exactly the amount of nutrient mitigation required, tailored to the specific needs of each catchment. Natural England is also developing a framework for assessing the effectiveness of habitat restoration mitigation and an associated reference tool. The results are expected shortly, and will be developed into guidance on best practice for the use of nature-based solutions to mitigate nutrient pollution.</p>

<h4>Additional staff</h4>

<p>Government is offering £100,000 to each affected catchment to support cross-Local Authority work to meet Natural England requirements and enable development to continue. This money is funding dedicated catchment officers, who will work to establish catchment-wide approaches to mitigation, which is far more efficient than on a project-by-project basis. The Planning Advisory Service has also hired dedicated nutrients advisors who will work with the catchment officers to provide advice and share best practice, as well as running a series of workshops to support affected local planning authorities.</p>

<p>Natural England has increased their capacity to address the increased statutory casework relating to nutrient neutrality and to provide support in assessing the suitability of mitigation projects.</p>

<h4>Improving wastewater treatment works</h4>

<p>Ofwat is developing a proposal that could enable water companies to directly accept developer contributions for improvements to wastewater treatment works as a means of mitigating nutrient loads from new developments.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State for Defra and the regulators will shortly be writing to water companies with a call for evidence to identify suitable projects - along with attendant costs, benefits and risks - that could be funded by developers in the current water company price review period (2020 to 2025).</p>

<h4>Nutrient markets</h4>

<p>We are piloting nutrient trading schemes with EnTrade in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.push.gov.uk/defra-trading-platform/" rel="external">Solent and in Somerset</a> this year and will use this learning to inform our next steps. Through the Natural Environment Investment Readiness Fund, we have funded 13 projects that explore water quality issues, including nutrient management and credit trading. The results of the pilots and lessons learned from the fund will allow us to determine how we could support the creation of nutrient markets in each catchment in the future.</p>

<h3>Financial support</h3>

<p>Mitigation typically relies on buying land to create wetlands. Local Authorities in Kent, Somerset and the Solent have already paved the way in creating these ‘nature-based solutions’, allowing planning permissions to be granted. These schemes have the potential to bring big benefits beyond mitigation if done correctly. That is why we are working with water companies who have pledged to provide new funding for strategic solutions to reduce nutrient pollution across the whole of a river’s catchment area.</p>

<p>We welcome the new and  proactive investment from Severn Trent Water, United Utilities, South West Water and Yorkshire Water in collectively investing an additional £24.5 million in reducing nutrient pollution affecting these sites, including nature based solutions. We will work with the wider industry to deliver further action, as far as possible.</p>

<h3>Improving the legislative framework</h3>

<p>We will explore legislation to further strengthen requirements to reduce nutrients at source, enabling more sustainable development.  This will provide greater certainty for Local Authorities.</p>

<p>As set out in our Nature Recovery Green Paper, we are committed to maintaining protections for our most precious habitats, and we are aware that the existing Habitats Regulations Assessment process could do more to promote nature recovery, including through making the processes clearer to all users. Our proposals would aim to create a more strategic approach that sits alongside measures that better target the impacts from primary contributors to nutrient pollution at protected sites and provides up front solutions. This seeks to create a system which works better for nature recovery, and our commitment to ensure more people have a home of their own.</p>

<h2>Addressing nutrient pollution at source</h2>

<p>The 25 Year Environment Plan commits us to restoring 75% of our one million hectares of terrestrial and freshwater protected sites to favourable condition by 2042, and to return at least three quarters of our waters to as close to their natural state as soon as is practicable.</p>

<p>We have launched our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/environment-act-2021-environmental-targets">Environment Act 2021 environmental targets consultation</a>. This includes proposals for legally binding long-term targets to directly address nutrient pollution in the water environment from agriculture and wastewater:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduce nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment contribution from agriculture in the water environment by at least 40% by 2037 (against a 2018 baseline)</li>
  <li>reduce phosphorus loadings from treated wastewater by 80% by 2037 (against a 2020 baseline)</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to meet these goals, government is committed to taking action to reduce nutrient pollution.</p>

<h3>Pollution from wastewater</h3>

<p>We are working with the water industry and regulators to ensure that considerable investment is directed at reducing nutrient pollution from wastewater:</p>

<ul>
  <li>from 2020 to 2025, water companies are investing £2.5 billion in measures that reduce nutrient pollution</li>
  <li>under the landmark Environment Act, we have made it a statutory duty for water companies to produce comprehensive statutory Drainage and Sewerage Management Plans setting out how they will manage and develop their drainage and sewerage system over a minimum 25-year planning horizon. This will include a requirement to assess the environmental impacts of the sewerage system, such as the impact of phosphorus and nitrogen loads from wastewater treatment works</li>
  <li>for the forthcoming Price Review period, Defra have recently published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/strategic-policy-statement-to-ofwat-incorporating-social-and-environmental-guidance/february-2022-the-governments-strategic-priorities-for-ofwat">Strategic Policy Statement to Ofwat</a>, making clear that Ofwat and water companies should consider nutrient pollution in line with their environmental duties (which includes the Habitat Regulations), and that water companies should be challenged to prioritise improvements to protected sites and to work with wider stakeholders to support efforts to tackle nutrient pollution</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pollution from agriculture</h3>

<p>We are taking action to enforce current regulations and support farmers to go further to reduce pollution and deliver for nature:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we have provided new funding for 50 additional officers since January 2022. Environment Agency inspections will be more targeted and will increase from 400 to at least 4,000 inspections a year by 2023</li>
  <li>Defra will publish guidance on the Farming Rules for Water shortly. This will raise standards of nutrient pollution management by setting clearer expectations for farmers</li>
  <li>the new Farming Investment Fund offers grants for equipment and infrastructure to help farmers increase their productivity whilst reducing pollution. The first round offered grants for items such as nutrient analysis equipment, slurry separators and low-emission spreaders. Later this year we will open applications for grants for covered slurry stores. We expect to continue to expand our grant offers drawing on further innovative methods to harness nutrients effectively and avoid pollution, both on livestock farms and by supporting nutrient sharing techniques with arable farms</li>
  <li>the Catchment Sensitive Farming (CSF) partnership provides specialist, free, 1-2-1 environmental advice to farmers in England and since 2006 has improved water quality by up to 6% in the areas it has focussed on. Its funding will double by early 2023 to cover all of England</li>
  <li>our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://defrafarming.blog.gov.uk/2021/06/23/how-farming-is-changing/" rel="external">Future Farming programme</a> will reward farmers for sustainably managing their nutrients and reducing run off. We are developing a nutrient management standard for the Sustainable Farming Incentive, which will build on existing pilots and help spread best practice amongst farmers. Furthermore, the first round of Landscape Recovery projects focusses on species recovery and river restoration, which will encourage improvements in our protected sites and reduce pollution</li>
</ul>

<h2>Restoring our protected sites</h2>

<p>All this work will be essential to restore our protected sites. Protected Site Strategies will address the greatest challenges facing protected sites through the development of a tailored package of measures to tackle pressures in catchments, including nutrient pollution. In doing so, we will create opportunities for nature recovery, support housing development, and put sites on a pathway to recovery.</p>

<p>Natural England will launch their first five pilots later this spring, which will test the mechanism’s capability to deal with key pressures including air quality, water quality and overgrazing, proposing actions to restore nature on affected sites. A number of the pilots will address nutrient pollution directly.</p>
