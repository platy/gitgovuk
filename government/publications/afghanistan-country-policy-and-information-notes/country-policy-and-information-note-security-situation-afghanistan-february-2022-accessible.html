<h2>Preface</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>This note provides country of origin information (COI) and analysis of COI for use by Home Office decision makers handling particular types of protection and human rights claims (as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Introduction">Introduction</a> section). It is not intended to be an exhaustive survey of a particular subject or theme.</p>

<p>It is split into 2 parts: (1) an assessment of COI and other evidence; and (2) COI. These are explained in more detail below.</p>

<h3>Assessment</h3>

<p>This section analyses the evidence relevant to this note - that is information in the COI section; refugee/human rights laws and policies; and applicable caselaw - by describing this and its inter-relationships, and provides an assessment of, in general, whether one or more of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a person is reasonably likely to face a real risk of persecution or serious harm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the general humanitarian situation is so severe that there are substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk of serious harm because conditions amount to inhuman or degrading treatment as within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">paragraphs 339C and 339CA(iii) of the Immigration Rules</a> / Article 3 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=basictexts&amp;c=" rel="external">European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the security situation is such that there are substantial grounds for believing there is a real risk of serious harm because there exists a serious and individual threat to a civilianâs life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in a situation of international or internal armed conflict as within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">paragraphs 339C and 339CA(iv) of the Immigration Rules</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a person is able to obtain protection from the state (or quasi state bodies)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a person is reasonably able to relocate within a country or territory</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a claim is likely to justify granting asylum, humanitarian protection or other form of leave, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if a claim is refused, it is likely or unlikely to be certifiable as âclearly unfoundedâ under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/41/section/94" rel="external">section 94 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Decision makers must, however, still consider all claims on an individual basis, taking into account each caseâs specific facts.</p>

<h3>Country of origin information</h3>

<p>The country information in this note has been carefully selected in accordance with the general principles of COI research as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.refworld.org/docid/48493f7f2.html" rel="external">Common EU [European Union] Guidelines for Processing Country of Origin Information (COI)</a>, April 2008, and the Austrian Centre for Country of Origin and Asylum Research and Documentationâs (ACCORD), <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.coi-training.net/researching-coi/" rel="external">Researching Country Origin Information â Training Manual,</a> 2013. Namely, taking into account the COIâs relevance, reliability, accuracy, balance, currency, transparency and traceability.</p>

<p>The structure and content of the country information section follows a <a class="govuk-link" href="#Version_control_and">terms of reference</a> which sets out the general and specific topics relevant to this note.</p>

<p>All information included in the note was published or made publicly available on or before the âcut-offâ date(s) in the country information section. Any event taking place or report/article published after these date(s) is not included.</p>

<p>All information is publicly accessible or can be made publicly available. Sources and the information they provide are carefully considered before inclusion. Factors relevant to the assessment of the reliability of sources and information include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the motivation, purpose, knowledge and experience of the source</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how the information was obtained, including specific methodologies used</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the currency and detail of information</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the COI is consistent with and/or corroborated by other sources.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Multiple sourcing is used to ensure that the information is accurate and balanced, which is compared and contrasted where appropriate so that a comprehensive and up-to-date picture is provided of the issues relevant to this note at the time of publication.</p>

<p>The inclusion of a source is not, however, an endorsement of it or any view(s) expressed.</p>

<p>Each piece of information is referenced in a footnote. Full details of all sources cited and consulted in compiling the note are listed alphabetically in the bibliography.</p>

<h2>Assessment</h2>

<p>Updated: 9 February 2022</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Basis of claim</h3>

<p>1.1.1 That the security situation in Afghanistan is such that there are substantial grounds for believing there is a real risk of serious harm because there exists a serious and individual threat to a civilianâs life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in a situation of international or internal armed conflict, as within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">paragraphs 339C and 339CA(iv) of the Immigration Rules</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Consideration of issues</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Credibility</h3>

<p>2.1.1 For information on assessing credibility, see the instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Assessing Credibility and Refugee Status</a>.</p>

<p>2.1.2 Decision makers must also check if there has been a previous application for a UK visa or another form of leave. Asylum applications matched to visas should be investigated prior to the asylum interview (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visa-matches-handling-asylum-claims-from-uk-visa-applicants-instruction">Asylum Instruction on Visa Matches, Asylum Claims from UK Visa Applicants</a>).</p>

<p>2.1.3 In cases where there are doubts surrounding an personâs claimed place of origin, decision makers should also consider the need to conduct language analysis testing (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/language-analysis-instruction">Asylum Instruction on Language Analysis</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Exclusion</h3>

<p>2.2.1 Decision makers must consider whether there are serious reasons for considering whether one (or more) of the exclusion clauses is applicable. Each case must be considered on its individual facts and merits.</p>

<p>2.2.2 If the person is excluded from the Refugee Convention, they will also be excluded from a grant of humanitarian protection (which has a wider range of exclusions than refugee status).</p>

<p>2.2.3 For further guidance on the exclusion clauses and restricted leave, see the Asylum Instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/asylum-instruction-exclusion-article-1f-of-the-refugee-convention">Exclusion under Articles 1F and 33(2) of the Refugee Convention</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/humanitarian-protection-instruction">Humanitarian Protection</a> and the instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restricted-leave-asylum-casework-instruction">Restricted Leave</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Convention reason(s)</h3>

<p>2.3.1 A state of civil instability and/or where law and order has broken down does not of itself give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution for a Refugee Convention reason.</p>

<p>2.3.2 In the absence of a link to one of the 5 Refugee Convention grounds necessary to be recognised as a refugee, the question to address is whether the person will face a real risk of serious harm in order to qualify for Humanitarian Protection (HP).</p>

<p>2.3.3 However, before considering whether a person requires protection because of the security situation, decision makers must consider if the person faces persecution for a Refugee Convention reason. Where the person qualifies for protection under the Refugee Convention, decision makers do not need to consider if there are substantial grounds for believing the person faces a real risk of serious harm meriting a grant of HP.</p>

<p>2.3.4 For further guidance on the 5 Refugee Convention grounds see the Asylum Instruction, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Assessing Credibility and Refugee Status</a>.</p>

<p>2.3.5 For general guidance on humanitarian protection see the Asylum Instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/humanitarian-protection-instruction">Humanitarian Protection</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Risk</h3>

<h3>a. Security situation</h3>

<p>2.4.1 Paragraphs 339C and 339CA(iv) of the Immigration Rules - which set out that a real risk of serious harm as a serious and individual threat by reason of indiscriminate violence in a situation of international or internal armed conflict - only apply to civilians who must be non-combatants. This could include former combatants who have genuinely and permanently renounced armed activity.</p>

<p>2.4.2 The ECtHR, in <a class="govuk-link" href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62012CJ0285&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre=" rel="external">DiakitÃ© (C-285/12)</a>, concluded that âThe usual meaning in everyday language of âinternal armed conflictâ is a situation in which a Stateâs armed forces confront one or more armed groups or in which two or more armed groups confront each other.â (para 28) but that</p>

<p>ââ¦internal armed conflict can be a cause for granting subsidiary protection only where confrontations between a Stateâs armed forces and one or more armed groups or between two or more armed groups are exceptionally considered to create a serious and individual threat to the life or person of an applicant for subsidiary protection for the purposes of Article 15(c) of Directive 2004/83 because the degree of indiscriminate violence which characterises those confrontations reaches such a high level that substantial grounds are shown for believing that a civilian, if returned to the relevant country or, as the case may be, to the relevant region, would â solely on account of his presence in the territory of that country or region â face a real risk of being subject to that threatâ (para 30).</p>

<p>2.4.3 In the country guidance case of <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2012/163.html" rel="external">AK (Article 15(c)) Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 00163(IAC)</a> (18 May 2012), heard on 14 and 15 March 2012, the Upper Tribunal, which considered evidence up to early 2012, held that</p>

<p>ââ¦the level of indiscriminate violence in that country taken as a whole is not at such a high level as to mean that, within the meaning of Article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive, a civilian, solely by being present in the country, faces a real risk which threatens his life or personâ (paragraph 249B(ii)).</p>

<p>2.4.4 In the country guidance case <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2020/130.html" rel="external">AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan (CG) [2020] UKUT 130 (IAC)</a> (1 May 2020), heard on 19 and 20 November 2019 and 14 January 2020, the UT, which considered evidence up to January 2020, held</p>

<p>âThere is widespread and persistent conflict-related violence in Kabul. However, the proportion of the population affected by indiscriminate violence is small and not at a level where a returnee, even one with no family or other network and who has no experience living in Kabul, would face a serious and individual threat to their life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence.</p>

<p>ââ¦ the level of indiscriminate violence in Kabul is not sufficient to meet the threshold in Article 15(c) QDâ (paragraphs 253(ii) and 255).</p>

<p>2.4.5 The Upper Tribunal in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2020/130.html" rel="external">AS (Safety of Kabul)</a> also held that the country guidance promulgated in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2012/163.html" rel="external">AK</a> in relation to Article 15(c) remained unaffected by its decision (paragraph 253(vi)).</p>

<p>2.4.6 Following changes in the political and security situation since the Taliban takeover of the country in August 2021, the number of security incidents (such as armed clashes and improvised explosive devices (IEDs)) and conflict-related civilian casualties has reduced significantly (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#General_security">General security</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.7 The Taliban is now in de-facto control of the whole country and fighting with the former governmentâs security forces has ceased, though clashes with the National Resistance Front (NRF) occur. The Talibanâs main military rival is the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), an offshoot of the Islamic State (ISIS), which has different teachings of strict Sunni beliefs (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Actors">Actors</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Nature_and_levels_1">Nature and levels of violence</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.8 Whilst a number of sources have stopped reporting on the security situation, available data indicates a decrease of over 90% for all security incidents. Between 19 August and 31 December 2021, the United Nations recorded 985 security-related incidents, a 91% in 2020. Data provided by the Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project (ACLED) recorded 269 incidents between 1 September and 10 December 2021 compared to 3,133 in the same period of 2020. Most ACLED-recorded security incidents between 1 September and 10 December 2021 took place in the provinces of Nangarhar (considered a stronghold of ISKP) and Kabul, although the capital still saw a nearly 50% decrease in security incidents (44) compared to the same period in 2020 (82) (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Security_incidents">Security incidents</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.9 Attacks by ISKP targeting civilians, particularly Shia Hazaras, have increased since the Taliban takeover, especially in northern and southern provinces as well as in Kabul City, although they do not control any territory. Clashes between ISKP and Taliban forces also occur, which have resulted in casualties on both sides, as well as civilians caught in the crossfire. However, as indicated by the overall decline in security incidents, armed battles in general have dramatically reduced since the Taliban takeover. Although the ability of the Taliban to contain ISKP remains unclear, the Taliban controls the whole country with far superior numbers of military forces, weapons, supplies and use of infrastructure, and attacks by ISKP are isolated (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Actors">Actors</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Nature_and_levels_1">Nature and levels of violence</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.10 Although ISKP have mounted some high profile attacks against civilians they generally concentrate IED and small arms attacks on Taliban military forces. The security situation for the general population has improved since the Taliban takeover and in particular rural areas are considered much safer with people now travelling to districts deemed too dangerous for the past 20 years. There have been reports of areas once considered too risky to negotiate now being âclogged with trafficâ (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#General_security">General security</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.11 Whilst country information indicates an internal armed conflict continues between the Taliban and ISKP, it is only in some areas and is to a far lesser extent following withdrawal of international forces. The Taliban generally maintains control of all areas of the country. Since August 2021, the levels of indiscriminate violence arising out of conflict have significantly diminished in all areas of the country. Although there remain hotspots in Kabul and Nangarhar, even here levels are lower than they once were (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Nature_and_levels_1">Nature and levels of violence</a>). The levels of violence are significantly lower than was prevailing at time of the CG cases of <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2012/163.html" rel="external">AK</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2020/130.html" rel="external">AS (Safety of Kabul)</a>.</p>

<p>2.4.12 Given the significant decrease in the levels of violence, there is no part of Afghanistan where, in general, conditions are such as to result in serious harm because there exists a serious and individual threat to a civilianâs life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence generally across the country Comparable to the Upper Tribunalâs findings in <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2012/163.html" rel="external">AK</a>. Indiscriminate violence is not at such a high level that it represents, in general, a real risk of harm contrary to paragraphs 339C and 339CA(iv) of the Immigration Rules.</p>

<p>2.4.13 Even where there is not in general a real risk of serious harm by reason of indiscriminate violence, decision makers must consider whether there are particular factors relevant to the personâs circumstances which might nevertheless place them at risk. The more a person is able to show that they are specifically affected by factors particular to their personal circumstances, the lower the level of indiscriminate violence required for them to be at a real risk of serious harm.</p>

<p>2.4.14 Therefore, a person may still face a real risk of serious harm, even where generally there is not such a risk, if they are able to show that there are specific reasons over and above simply being a civilian for being affected by the indiscriminate violence (see also the Country Policy and Information Note on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/afghanistan-country-policy-and-information-notes">Afghanistan: Fear of the Taliban</a>).</p>

<span class="number">2.5 </span> Internal relocation</h3>

<p>2.5.1 In <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2012/163.html" rel="external">AK</a>, the Upper Tribunal held that internal relocation to Kabul was reasonable, bar some limited categories (lone women and female heads of household). This was confirmed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2020/130.html" rel="external">AS (Safety of Kabul)</a>.</p>

<p>2.5.2 In <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2020/130.html" rel="external">AS (Safety of Kabul)</a> the Upper Tribunal held that:</p>

<p>âThere is widespread and persistent conflict-related violence in Kabul. However, the proportion of the population affected by indiscriminate violence is small and not at a level where a returnee, even one with no family or other network and who has no experience living in Kabul, would face a serious and individual threat to their life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence.</p>

<p>âHaving regard to the security and humanitarian situation in Kabul as well as the difficulties faced by the population living there (primarily the urban poor but also IDPs and other returnees, which are not dissimilar to the conditions faced throughout many other parts of Afghanistan) it will not, in general, be unreasonable or unduly harsh for a single adult male in good health to relocate to Kabul even if he does not have any specific connections or support network in Kabul and even if he does not have a Tazkera [tazkira].</p>

<p>âHowever, the particular circumstances of an individual applicant must be taken into account in the context of conditions in the place of relocation, including a personâs age, nature and quality of support network/connections with Kabul/Afghanistan, their physical and mental health, and their language, education and vocational skills when determining whether a person falls within the general position set out above. Given the limited options for employment, capability to undertake manual work may be relevant.</p>

<p>âA person with a support network or specific connections in Kabul is likely to be in a more advantageous position on return, which may counter a particular vulnerability of an individual on return. A person without a network may be able to develop one following return. A personâs familiarity with the cultural and societal norms of Afghanistan (which may be affected by the age at which he left the country and his length of absence) will be relevant to whether, and if so how quickly and successfully, he will be able to build a network (paragraphs 253(ii) to 253(v)).</p>

<p>2.5.3 Whilst there continues to be some indiscriminate violence, the widespread and persistent conflict-related violence in Kabul, as well as elsewhere in the country, all but ceased following the Taliban takeover. The security situation has improved since <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2012/163.html" rel="external">AK</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2020/130.html" rel="external">AS (Safety of Kabul)</a> were promulgated and it remains the case that a single, adult male may be able to relocate to Kabul depending on his circumstances. As the conflict has diminished across the country and indiscriminate violence is not at such a high level that it represents, in general, a real risk of harm contrary to paragraphs 339C and 339CA(iv) of the Immigration Rules, a single adult male may also be able to relocate to areas outside of Kabul.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Security situation: September 2021 to January 2022</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Actors</h3>

<p>5.1.1 Al Jazeera described the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP) in an article dated 27 August 2021:</p>

<p>âISKP is known as an offshoot of the ISIL (ISIS) armed group that claimed to be seeking to establish an Islamic âcaliphateâ in Iraq and Syria. Khorasan refers to a historical region under an ancient caliphate that once included parts of Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and Turkmenistan. The armed group was formed in 2014 by breakaway fighters of the Pakistan Taliban and fighters from Afghanistan who pledged allegiance to the late ISIL leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. ISKP has strong roots in northeastern Afghanistan but set up sleeper cells in Kabul and other provinces. They are adversaries of the Taliban, with different teachings of strict Sunni beliefsâ¦</p>

<p>âWhile it is not clear how many fighters have joined the group, ISKP has been responsible for some of the worst attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan in recent years, killing people at mosques, public squares and even hospitalsâ¦</p>

<p>âAt a news briefing on Friday [27 August], Pentagon spokesman said that the Taliban released âthousandsâ of ISIS-K fighters from US prisons at Bagram in Afghanistan.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.2 In October 2021, Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that:</p>

<p>âThe ISKP has posed a serious threat to Hazaras and other Afghan civilians since at least 2015, when the Islamist armed group began attacks on mosques, hospitals, schools, and other civilian facilities, especially in predominantly Shia neighborhoods. These attacks have killed at least 1,500 civilians and injured thousands more, mostly religious minorities.</p>

<p>âISKP attacks have taken place in Kabul, Jalalabad, Herat, and other cities. Some have targeted Hindu and Sikh religious minorities, as well as Hazara. The ISKP has also killed journalists, civil society activists, and health workers, and targeted schools, particularly girlsâ schools in Nangarhar in 2018. Their attacks first surged in 2016-2018 and then ebbed after the group suffered military setbacks in 2019. Since 2020, attacks have again increased.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.3 Bill Roggio, editor of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) Long War Journal (LWJ), stated on 23 November 2021:</p>

<p>âAfter defeating the Islamic Government of Afghanistan and taking control of the country on Aug. 15, the Taliban is beginning to ramp up its fight against the Islamic Stateâs Khorasan Province.</p>

<p>âThe Islamic Stateâs Khorasan Province or ISKP, which is often referred to as ISIS-K, has increased attacks against the Taliban over the past two months. ISKP has orchestrated a handful of high-profile suicide attacks on soft targets such as mosques and hospitals, and conducted smaller but more numerous IED [improvised explosive device] and small arms attacks against Taliban military forces. In response, the Taliban has sent more than 1,000 fighters to battle the group in Nangarhar province, the hub of ISKP operations, according to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/11/22/taliban-isis-afghanistan/" rel="external">The Washington Post</a>.</p>

<p>âMuch of the reporting from Afghanistan has boosted the threat of ISKP while ignoring the Talibanâs very real advantages in the fight. The Taliban has the advantage in all of the key areas, save one. The Taliban has state sponsors, terrorist allies, regional support, a marked superiority in weapons and numbers, and controls all of Afghanistan. ISKP can only match the Taliban in one area, and this their will to fight and persevere.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.4 Listing the advantages the Taliban had over ISKP, Bill Roggio noted the ISKP had limited resources (the core group in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces retains an estimated 1,500 to 2,200 fighters, according to the UN in June 2021<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>), whilst the Taliban forces ranged between 70,000 and âwell over 100,000â, the higher estimate of which was most likely, according to the LWJ<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>5.1.5 In a January 2022 article for the CTC Sentinel, a monthly publication by the Combating Terrorism Center, contributors Amira Jadoon, Abdul Sayed and Andrew Mines present a slightly less optimistic view of the Talibanâs ability to contain ISKP:</p>

<p>ââ¦the recent wave of attacks conducted by ISK, including the Kabul airport attack and attacks against the regionâs Shi`a communities, have highlighted the severe implications of ISKâs resurgence and continued survival on the Talibanâs ability to govern as a state actorâ¦</p>

<p>âISKâs sources of strength are drawn from across the region, and its survival is likely to exacerbate violence across the region and disrupt any plans for Afghanistanâs stability rooted in geo-economics. It also opens up the country for renewed proxy warfare. Given that the Taliban have so far been incapable of delivering proper security to Afghan citizens and have yet to receive necessary levels of foreign assistance to stem the growing humanitarian crisis, the Talibanâs control and power may erode quickly.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.6 In a December 2021 report, the Danish Immigration Service (DIS) reported on recent events in Afghanistan, citing a range of sources, and noted in regard to the presence of ISKP:</p>

<p>âAccording to the expert in Afghan security policy, ISKP have in recent months been able to bolster their ranks by recruiting both from abroad as well as from within Afghanistan. In this relation, there have been reports of ISKP recruiting former members of the ANDSF [Afghan National Defence and Security Forces] as well as Taliban fighters due to safety and monetary concerns. Furthermore, âhundredsâ of ISKP prisoners were released by the Taliban as they captured Afghan cities during the summer of 2021. Afghanistan analyst Antonio Giustozzi estimated the current number of ISKP fighters in Afghanistan to be approximately 4,000.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.7 However, the LWJ report noted:</p>

<p>âThe Taliban is fully in control of all of Afghanistan 34 provinces while the Islamic State does not control any ground. The Taliban can muster the resources of all of Afghanistanâs provinces; troops, weapons, ammunition, fuel, food, and other supplies. The Taliban can operate hospitals, recruiting and training centers, and base troops. It can tax the local population and border crossings. ISKP must operate clandestinely and is extremely limited in how it can support its forces.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.8 In slight contrast, the Secretary-Generalâs Special Representative for Afghanistan, Ms Deborah Lyons, expressed the view in her address to the UN Security Council on 17 November 2021 that, âAnother major negative development has been the Talibanâs inability to stem the expansion of the Islamic State in Iraq and in Levant Khorasan Province. Once limited to a few provinces and Kabul, ISILKP now seems to be present in nearly all provinces and increasingly active.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.9 In its âAfghanistan: Country Focusâ, dated January 2022 and based on a range of sources covering events between 15 August and 8 December 2021, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) referred to Deborah Lyons comments on the presence of ISKP, noting:</p>

<p>âIn email correspondence with EASO, Abdul Sayed, security specialist and researcher of radical militant groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan, commented that he did not âunderstand the barometers behind this assessmentâ. According to Sayed, ISKP members could possibly have spread across Afghanistan individually, particularly escaped prisoners, but this did not mean that they âposed a threat in those areasâ. Based on ISKP attacks and Taliban raids against hideouts, Sayed stated that ISKP had a strong presence in Eastern Afghanistan (Nangarhar and Kunar provinces), as well as Kabul and northern Afghanistan.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.10 The EASO report also noted:</p>

<p>âAccording to media reports, ISKP used âthe same hit-and-run tacticsâ until recently practiced by the Taliban against the previous Afghan government, including roadside explosions and targeted killings. The security incidents were particularly reported in northern and southern provinces as well as in Kabul City. Attacks were particularly reported to take place in Nangarhar province, defined as a âstrongholdâ of ISKP, and its capital, Jalalabad. On several instances, ISKP targeted the Shia (Hazara) community. Researcher Antonio Giustozzi told Reuters in early November 2021 that ISKP âhad been carrying out a campaign of targeted killings since around the summer of 2020 and had continued since the Taliban victory in August 2021 on a âroughly comparable scaleâ.ââ<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.11 In January 2022, France24 reported that:</p>

<p>âOnce a fringe force in Afghanistan, analysts say the local chapter of IS has been increasingly active since the United States agreed to a deal in 2020 with the Taliban to withdraw foreign troops from the countryâ¦The latter group was âstrengthenedâ as the Taliban took control of the country and opened prisons, releasing many battle-hardened IS fighters, says Ibraheem Bahiss, an Afghanistan specialist at the International Crisis Groupâ¦Since then, âviolence against the Taliban has increasedâ, even if they try to play it down, Bahiss saysâ¦âThese days, there is at least one attack a week,â said Sajjad, a Taliban unit leader, adding his men are on high alert âat all timesâ. The attackers, he told AFP, âcome in twos or threesâ¦ in a [motorised] rickshawâ¦ and shoot at us with Kalashnikovs or pistolsâ. According to Abdul Sayed, an academic specialising in jihadist networks, the group is responsible for nearly 100 attacks since mid-September â some 85 percent aimed at the Taliban â and Jalalabad is the front line.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.12 The DIS report noted in regard to the presence of other non-state armed actors:</p>

<p>âAccording to an assessment from the UNSC from June 2021, the number of al-Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan ranges between âseveral dozen to 500 personsâ operating in at least 15 of Afghanistanâs 34 provinces, primarily in the east, southern and south-eastern regions. As part of the Doha Peace Agreement of February 2020, the Taliban had committed to preventing al-Qaeda from operating on Afghan soil. Following their conquest of Afghanistan, the Taliban reportedly received âcongratulatory messages from al-Qaeda and its regional affiliates.â Furthermore, according to the UNSC, there are close ties between especially the Haqqani-network â whose leader Sirajuddin Haqqani currently serves as interim minister of interior â and al-Qaeda.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.13 The EASO report also referenced al-Qaeda, noting:</p>

<p>âRegarding al-Qaedaâs presence in Afghanistan, US Defence Secretary Lloyed Austin stated that the group âmay attempt to regenerateâ in the country. In June 2021, the UN Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team estimated the human capacity of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan as ranging âfrom several dozen to 500 people.â While during the negotiations of the peace agreement with the US the Taliban stated it would not allow al-Qaeda or any other extremist group into areas under its control and renewed this statement after the takeover of 15 August 2021, it was reported that the Taliban received âcongratulatory messages from al-Qaeda and its regional affiliates.â Following the Taliban takeover, sources referred to reported relations between al-Qaeda and the Haqqani network, whose leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, was appointed interior minister in the interim government. In September 2021, Zabihullah Mujahid rejected accusations that al-Qaeda maintained presence in Afghanistan.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.14 The DIS report noted:</p>

<p>âIslamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) consists of up to 700 people, including family members of fighters located in Faryab, Sar-e Pul and Jawzjan Provinces. Prior to the Taliban conquest, IMU reportedly relied on local branches of the Taliban for financial backing.</p>

<p>âEastern Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM) consist of âseveral hundred membersâ and primarily operates in Badakhshan and neighboring provinces.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> General security</h3>

<p>5.2.1 The DIS report noted in regard to the security situation that:</p>

<p>âSince the Taliban takeover of Kabul on 15 August 2021, the overall security situation in the country has changed. According to the UN, conflict related security incidents such as armed clashes, air strikes and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) have decreased significantly since the Taliban conquered the country. In this relation, two of the sources consulted for this report echoed that certain elements of the security situation for the general population in Afghanistan have improved because fighting has ceased. Especially the rural areas are safer, and people can travel to districts that were deemed too dangerous or inaccessible for the past 15-20 years, as the security on the roads have improved due to the drop in IEDs. Although it is safer for children to go to school, two sources describe how other aspects of security for the civilian population have deteriorated since the Talibanâs takeover. The Kabul-based journalist emphasised that the fear of Taliban, coupled with the absence of clear laws and policing, has created insecurity and local acts of unpunished vigilantism.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.2.2 On 19 October 2021, the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) said âThe overall security situation in the country remains relatively calm, though isolated but violent incidents continue to take civilian lives.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.2.3 On 29 October 2021, BBC News reported:</p>

<p>âAfghanistan is now more peaceful, following the end of the Talibanâs insurgency. In Jalalabad, however, their forces are facing a near-daily stream of targeted attacks. IS, known locally as âDaesh,â is using some of the same hit-and-run tactics that the Taliban so successfully employed against the previous government, including roadside bombs and stealthy assassinations. IS accuses the Taliban of being âapostatesâ for not being sufficiently hardline; the Taliban dismiss IS as heretical extremists.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.2.4 In her address to the UN Security Council on 17 November 2021, the Secretary-Generalâs Special Representative for Afghanistan, Ms Deborah Lyons, recognised that since the conflict had mostly ended, the overall security situation in Afghanistan had improved<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup>. However, on a less positive note, she cited attacks by ISKP, âThe number of attacks has increased significantly, from last year to this year. In 2020 â 60, so far this year â 334 attacks attributed to ISILKP or, in fact, claimed by ISILKP. ISILKP continues to target the Shiâite communities.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">[footnote 22]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.2.5 The EASO report of January 2022 noted:</p>

<p>âAs reported by international media sources in mid-September, a considerable decrease in conflict-related violence was seen in most parts of Afghanistanâs countryside. Farmers in Mizan district of Zabul province told WSJ [Wall Street Journal] that they could water their fields at night with a flashlight without a risk of being shot, and in Qalat, the capital of Zabul, young men had started with overnight picnics in the desertâ¦</p>

<p>âTravelling by road was reported to have become safer in certain areas. According to WSJ, commuting from Kandahar city to Lashkargah, the capital of Helmand, previously considered too dangerous, was reportedly âclogged with trafficâ in September 2021.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">[footnote 23]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.2.6 In a report published in January 2022 by the Australian Governmentâs Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), covering political and security developments between August 2021 and January 2022 and drawing on a range of sources, it was stated that:</p>

<p>âAfghanistan is volatile but the country as a whole is (relatively) less dangerous than before August 2021 for many Afghans, due to the cessation of most armed conflict after the Taliban claimed victory. It nevertheless remains a dangerous country with ongoing threats of terrorism and kidnapping and other forms of violence. The Taliban asserted control over the entire country quickly and with relatively little opposition following the announcement of the US-led withdrawal of foreign forces.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">[footnote 24]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.2.7 The same report noted that:</p>

<p>âThere have been multiple mass-casualty terrorist attacks since the Taliban takeover, with most claimed by Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP). ISKP carried out dozens of terrorist attacks in 2020 and 2021 against the erstwhile Afghan national government and also the Taliban. Terrorist attacks remain possible anywhere in the country, but major attacks are most likely in key cities given the increased profile ISKP gets from such attacks.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:25" rel="footnote">[footnote 25]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.2.8 In relation to the security situation in Kabul, the same report observed, âKabul remains insecure and has been subject to multiple attacks. On 2 November 2021, for example, at least 25 Afghans were killed and more than 50 injured when two large explosions hit Kabulâs largest hospital, immediately followed by an assault by a group of gunmen. The attack was claimed by ISKP.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:26" rel="footnote">[footnote 26]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.2.9 The same DFAT report stated that:</p>

<p>âThe cessation of conflict between the Taliban and the former administration has made many parts of the country, especially rural areas, effectively free from armed conflict; however, the situation is highly volatile. The ability of the Taliban to control violent actors is not currently clear. This applies particularly to ISKP but also its related entity, Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, which targets Pakistan. There is significant potential for violence across the country, especially in the eastern provinces where ISKP is strongest.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:27" rel="footnote">[footnote 27]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.2.10 In a briefing to the UN Security Council on 26 January 2022, published by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), the Secretary-Generalâs Special Representative for Afghanistan, Ms Deborah Lyons, stated:</p>

<p>âSince my previous briefing it appears that the de facto authorities have attempted to constrain the Islamic Stateâs ability to carry out major attacks, and yet small-scale attacks are still being carried out, particularly against religious minorities. The existence of numerous terrorist groups in Afghanistan remains a broad international and especially regional concern. The desire of the de facto authorities to take on this threat across the board remains to be convincingly demonstrated. And yet at the same time, a certain amount of realism is required regarding its capacity to do soâ¦â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:28" rel="footnote">[footnote 28]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.3.2 The Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project (ACLED) continued to collect coded data on security incidents from reports in open sources, though noted that following the fall of Kabul, âsourcing events in Afghanistan has become increasingly difficult.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:32" rel="footnote">[footnote 32]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.3.3 According to data collected by ACLED and obtained by CPIT using ACLEDâs export data tool, between 1 September and 10 December 2021 there were a total of 269 security incidents across Afghanistan, with 44 in Kabul city, (coded as âbattlesâ, âexplosions/remote violenceâ and âviolence against civiliansâ) compared to 3,133 security incidents (82 in Kabul city) in the same period of 2020<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:33" rel="footnote">[footnote 33]</a></sup>, a decrease of over 90% for all security incidents, and a nearly 50% decrease in Kabul.</p>

<p>5.3.4 ACLED data for the period 1 September to 10 December 2021 showed the majority of security incidents, number in parentheses, were in the provinces of Nangarhar (66) and Kabul (50), followed by Kandahar (18) and Panshir (15)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:34" rel="footnote">[footnote 34]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>5.3.5 A report of the UN Secretary General to the UN Security Council on the situation in Afghanistan and its implications for international peace and security, published on 28 January 2022, summarised the security situation:</p>

<p>âThere has been a significant decline in the overall number of conflict-related security incidents as well as civilian casualties since then. Between 19 August and 31 December, the United Nations recorded 985 security-related incidents, a 91 per cent decrease compared to the same period in 2020â¦ There has been an increase in other types of security incidents such as crime amid a rapid deterioration of the economic and humanitarian situation. The eastern, central, southern and western regions accounted for 75 per cent of all recorded incidents, with Nangarhar, Kabul, Kunar and Kandahar the most conflict-affected provinces. Despite the reduction in violence, the de facto authorities encountered several challenges, including an increase in attacks against their members. Some of the attacks are attributed to the National Resistance Front comprising some figures from the former Government and oppositionâ¦â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:35" rel="footnote">[footnote 35]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.3.6 With regard to ISK the same report summarised:</p>

<p>âAttacks claimed by or attributed to ISIL-KP increased and expanded beyond the movementâs previous areas of focus in Kabul and eastern Afghanistan. Between 19 August and 31 December, the United Nations recorded 152 attacks by the group in 16 provinces, compared to 20 attacks in 5 provinces during the same period in 2020. In addition to the de facto authorities, the group also targeted civilians, in particular Shia minorities, in urban areasâ¦â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:36" rel="footnote">[footnote 36]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.5.1 In its regional overview for the week 18 to 24 September 2021, the Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project (ACLED) noted:</p>

<p>âIn Afghanistan, IS claimed responsibility for several explosions in the center of Jalalabad city of Nangarhar province on 18 and 19 September. The explosions killed at least three people and injured over two dozen. Taliban fighters are reported to be amongst the casualties. Later clashes between IS and Taliban forces in Jalalabad also resulted in multiple fatalities. Further unattributed explosions and shootings targeting the Taliban also took place in the city throughout last week.
