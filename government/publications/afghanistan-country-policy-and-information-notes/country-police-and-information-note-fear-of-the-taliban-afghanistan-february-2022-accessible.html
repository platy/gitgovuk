<h2>Preface</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>This note provides country of origin information (COI) and analysis of COI for use by Home Office decision makers handling particular types of protection and human rights claims (as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Introduction">Introduction</a> section). It is not intended to be an exhaustive survey of a particular subject or theme.</p>

<p>It is split into 2 parts: (1) an assessment of COI and other evidence; and (2) COI. These are explained in more detail below.</p>

<h3>Assessment</h3>

<p>This section analyses the evidence relevant to this note - that is information in the COI section; refugee/human rights laws and policies; and applicable caselaw - by describing this and its inter-relationships, and provides an assessment of, in general, whether one or more of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a person is reasonably likely to face a real risk of persecution or serious harm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the general humanitarian situation is so severe that there are substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk of serious harm because conditions amount to inhuman or degrading treatment as within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">paragraphs 339C and 339CA(iii) of the Immigration Rules</a> / Article 3 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=basictexts&amp;c=" rel="external">European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the security situation is such that there are substantial grounds for believing there is a real risk of serious harm because there exists a serious and individual threat to a civilian’s life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in a situation of international or internal armed conflict as within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">paragraphs 339C and 339CA(iv) of the Immigration Rules</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a person is able to obtain protection from the state (or quasi state bodies)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a person is reasonably able to relocate within a country or territory</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a claim is likely to justify granting asylum, humanitarian protection or other form of leave, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if a claim is refused, it is likely or unlikely to be certifiable as ‘clearly unfounded’ under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/41/section/94" rel="external">section 94 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Decision makers must, however, still consider all claims on an individual basis, taking into account each case’s specific facts.</p>

<h3>Country of origin information</h3>

<p>The country information in this note has been carefully selected in accordance with the general principles of COI research as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.refworld.org/docid/48493f7f2.html" rel="external">Common EU [European Union] Guidelines for Processing Country of Origin Information (COI)</a>, April 2008, and the Austrian Centre for Country of Origin and Asylum Research and Documentation’s (ACCORD), <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.coi-training.net/researching-coi/" rel="external">Researching Country Origin Information – Training Manual,</a> 2013. Namely, taking into account the COI’s relevance, reliability, accuracy, balance, currency, transparency and traceability.</p>

<p>The structure and content of the country information section follows a <a class="govuk-link" href="#Terms_of_reference">terms of reference</a> which sets out the general and specific topics relevant to this note.</p>

<p>All information included in the note was published or made publicly available on or before the ‘cut-off’ date(s) in the country information section. Any event taking place or report/article published after these date(s) is not included.</p>

<p>All information is publicly accessible or can be made publicly available. Sources and the information they provide are carefully considered before inclusion. Factors relevant to the assessment of the reliability of sources and information include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the motivation, purpose, knowledge and experience of the source</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how the information was obtained, including specific methodologies used</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the currency and detail of information</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the COI is consistent with and/or corroborated by other sources.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Multiple sourcing is used to ensure that the information is accurate and balanced, which is compared and contrasted where appropriate so that a comprehensive and up-to-date picture is provided of the issues relevant to this note at the time of publication.</p>

<p>The inclusion of a source is not, however, an endorsement of it or any view(s) expressed.</p>

<p>Each piece of information is referenced in a footnote. Full details of all sources cited and consulted in compiling the note are listed alphabetically in the bibliography.</p>

<h2>Assessment</h2>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Updated: 4 April 2022</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Basis of claim</h3>

<p>1.1.1 Fear of persecution and/or serious harm by the Taliban because the person has opposed, is perceived to have opposed, or does not conform with its moral, religious or political views. In practice, the reasons for fearing persecution or serious harm are potentially wide-ranging (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Convention_reasons">Convention reason(s)</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Points to note</h3>

<p>1.2.1 Where the person made an asylum and/or human rights claim before the Taliban had taken de facto control of Afghanistan, decision makers should (where appropriate) provide them with the opportunity to explain what or whom they fear on return given the significantly changed country circumstances.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Consideration of issues</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Credibility</h3>

<p>2.1.1 For information on assessing credibility, see the instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Assessing Credibility and Refugee Status</a>.</p>

<p>2.1.2 Decision makers must also check if there has been a previous application for a UK visa or another form of leave. Asylum applications matched to visas should be investigated prior to the asylum interview (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visa-matches-handling-asylum-claims-from-uk-visa-applicants-instruction">Asylum Instruction on Visa Matches, Asylum Claims from UK Visa Applicants</a>).</p>

<p>2.1.3 Decision makers should also consider the need to conduct language analysis testing (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/language-analysis-instruction">Asylum Instruction on Language Analysis</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Exclusion</h3>

<p>2.2.1 Decision makers must consider whether there are serious reasons for considering whether one (or more) of the exclusion clauses is applicable. Each case must be considered on its individual facts and merits.</p>

<p>2.2.2 If the person is excluded from the Refugee Convention, they will also be excluded from a grant of humanitarian protection (which has a wider range of exclusions than refugee status).</p>

<p>2.2.3 For further guidance on the exclusion clauses and restricted leave, see the Asylum Instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/asylum-instruction-exclusion-article-1f-of-the-refugee-convention">Exclusion under Articles 1F and 33(2) of the Refugee Convention</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/humanitarian-protection-instruction">Humanitarian Protection</a> and the instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restricted-leave-asylum-casework-instruction">Restricted Leave</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Convention reason(s)</h3>

<p>2.3.1 The person’s actual or imputed political opinion – most likely due to their actual or perceived support for the former government and/or international forces – and/or, depending on the person’s individual profile, their race, religion or particular social group (PSG).</p>

<p>2.3.2 In the country guidance case, <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKIAT/2004/00328.html" rel="external">NS (Social Group - Women - Forced marriage) Afghanistan CG [2004] UKIAT 00328</a>, heard 21 September 2004 and promulgated 30 December 2004, the Tribunal found that women in Afghanistan form a PSG within the meaning of the Refugee Convention. The country conditions have not significantly changed with regard to the status of women and as such this still remains the case.</p>

<p>2.3.3 Unaccompanied children could also form a PSG. For further guidance see the Country Policy and Information Note on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/afghanistan-country-policy-and-information-notes">Afghanistan: Unaccompanied children</a>.</p>

<p>2.3.4 Establishing (a) convention reason(s) is not sufficient to be recognised as a refugee. The question to be addressed is whether the person has a well-founded fear of persecution because of that/those convention reason(s).</p>

<p>2.3.5 For further guidance on Convention reasons see the instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Assessing Credibility and Refugee Status</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Risk</h3>

<p>2.4.1 The Taliban assumed de facto control of the country on 15 August 2021 (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Taliban_%E2%80%93_background">Taliban – background</a>). Between September and October 2021, the Taliban appointed a cabinet to act in its interim government. The cabinet is all male, made up of mostly religious clerics affiliated to the Taliban and has little representation from ethnic minorities (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Governance">Governance</a>). The Taliban also announced that Sharia law regulates all matters of governance and re-established the Ministry for Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, often referred to as the ‘religious’ or ‘morality’ police. Whilst enforcement may vary by region, guidance issued by the ministry:</p>

<ul>
  <li>orders women to be escorted by a close male relative (mahram) if travelling over 72km (45 miles), and to wear the hijab,</li>
  <li>prohibits the broadcast of entertainment shows featuring women,</li>
  <li>advises barbers against shaving or trimming beards, and</li>
  <li>bars other acts deemed unIslamic by the Taliban such as gambling, cinemas and listening to music audible outside the home.</li>
</ul>

<p>Adultery, sex outside of marriage and same-sex relationships are also banned, the same as under the former government’s penal code, although the punishments for transgression may be more severe (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Rule_of_law">Rule of law</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#%E2%80%98Religious%E2%80%99_police">‘Religious’ police</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#Women">Women</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#LGBTQ_persons">LGBTQ persons</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.2 After gaining control, the Taliban announced a ‘general amnesty’ for anyone who had fought against them. However, there are reports indicating this amnesty and other guidance and policy announced by the Taliban leadership has not been followed across the country and that some Taliban members are acting in revenge, arbitrarily and under their own authority. Reports indicate that the Taliban have conducted door to door house searches to find former security forces personnel or those who have worked for international organisations, and those deemed to be critical of the Taliban regime (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Taliban%E2%80%99s_%E2%80%98general_amnesty%E2%80%99">Taliban’s ‘general amnesty’</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Taliban_justice">Taliban justice</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.3 Although Taliban soldiers have been instructed not to impose arbitrary penalties and to await a court’s judgment, acts of punishment have been reported in some areas, including public shaming of men accused of petty crimes, executions of persons accused of kidnap, whose bodies are then publicly displayed with signs warning other criminals of the same fate, and public stoning (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Taliban_justice">Taliban justice</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.4 There are reports of human rights abuses, including targeted killings, torture, threats and intimidation, against civilians associated with, or perceived to have supported, the former government or international community, former members of the security forces (which may depend on their previous role), women (particularly in the public sphere), LGBTQ persons, ethnic and religious minorities, journalists, human rights defenders, members of the judiciary, persons deemed to have transgressed cultural or religious mores (which may include those perceived as “Westernised”), and persons deemed to have resisted or opposed the Taliban.</p>

<p>2.4.5 Access to independently verified information is limited, often conflicting, and the scale of targeting is unclear. Reports are subject to claim, denial and counterclaim (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Life_under_the_1">Limits on reporting, propaganda and misinformation</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Potentially_vulnerable_groups">Potentially vulnerable groups</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.6 Other groups, though not exhaustive, may include: civilians accused of spying, teachers and those involved in the education sector including students, tribal elders and religious leaders who resist the Taliban’s doctrine, and family members supporting or perceived to be associated with the above profiles (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Potentially_vulnerable_groups">Potentially vulnerable groups</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.7 The country guidance case <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2020/130.html" rel="external">AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan (CG) [2020] UKUT 130 (IAC)</a> (1 May 2020), heard on 19 and 20 November 2019 and 14 January 2020 held that ‘A person who is of lower-level interest for the Taliban (i.e. not a senior government or security services official, or a spy) is not at real risk of persecution from the Taliban in Kabul’ (paragraph 253(i)).</p>

<p>2.4.8 Given the significant change in country circumstances, at the time of writing there are – as per paragraphs 46 and 47 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/940.html" rel="external">SG (Iraq) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 940 (13 July 2012)</a> – very strong grounds supported by cogent evidence to justify a departure from paragraph 253(i) of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2020/130.html" rel="external">AS (Safety of Kabul)</a>. However, each case must be considered on its facts.</p>

<p>2.4.9 The current evidence suggests that persons likely to be at risk of persecution, because they may be considered a threat or do not conform to the Taliban’s strict interpretation of Sharia law, include but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>former government employees and members of the Afghan National Armed Forces (ANSF), including the police</p>
  </li>

<p>2.4.10 However, not all incidents committed by the Taliban should be considered a systematic campaign of targeting and may be due to Taliban members settling old disputes. Each case must be considered on its facts with the onus on the person to demonstrate that they would be at real risk on return.</p>

<p>2.4.11 On risk relating to unaccompanied children, see the Country Policy and Information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/afghanistan-country-policy-and-information-notes">Afghanistan: Unaccompanied children</a>.</p>

<p>2.4.12 The country guidance case of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKIAT/2009/00001.html" rel="external">AJ (Risk to Homosexuals) Afghanistan CG [2009] UKAIT 00001 (5 January 2009)</a>, heard on the 28 October 2008, focussed on the situation for gay men. The findings in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKIAT/2009/00001.html" rel="external">AJ</a> pre-date <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/31.html" rel="external">HJ (Iran)</a>. The Upper Tribunal in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKIAT/2009/00001.html" rel="external">AJ</a> applied the ‘reasonably tolerable’ (to act discreetly and conceal identity) test, which was found to be incorrect and rejected by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/31.html" rel="external">HJ (Iran)</a>, and so much of AJ’s findings cannot now be relied on.</p>

<p>2.4.13 The Upper Tribunal’s conclusions in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKIAT/2009/00001.html" rel="external">AJ (Risk to Homosexuals)</a> in Headnotes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 and related paragraphs should therefore not be followed. The test that should be adopted are in paragraphs 35 and 82 in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/31.html" rel="external">HJ (Iran)</a>.</p>

<p>2.4.14 If a person does not live openly as LGBTQI, consideration must be given to the reasons why they do not. Each case must be considered on its facts with the onus on the person to demonstrate that they would be at real risk on return. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/31.html" rel="external">HJ (Iran)</a> provides that, even if a person would not be open about their sexuality, if the reason why they would not do so is fear of persecution then they will still be a refugee.</p>

<p>2.4.15 Furthermore, if a person chooses to change their behaviour on return to Afghanistan, by modifying their political beliefs, denying their religious faith (or lack of one) or feigning belief, decision makers must consider the reasons why. If it is to avoid persecution then they are likely to require protection. Each case must be considered on its facts with the onus on the person to demonstrate that they would be at real risk on return.</p>

<p>2.4.16 For further guidance on assessing risk, see the instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Assessing Credibility and Refugee Status</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> Protection</h3>

<p>2.5.1 The Taliban have taken control of every major city in Afghanistan, have re-established the Islamic Emirate and implement (their version of) Sharia law. Given the Taliban have de facto control of the country, where a person has a well-founded fear of persecution from the Taliban, they will not be able to obtain protection.</p>

<p>2.5.2 For further guidance on assessing the availability of state protection, see the instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Assessing Credibility and Refugee Status</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span> Internal relocation</h3>

<p>2.6.1 Where the person has a well-founded fear of persecution or serious harm from the Taliban, they are unlikely to be able to relocate to escape that risk.</p>

<p>2.6.2 In regard to internal relocation to Kabul, the country guidance case <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2020/130.html" rel="external">AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan (CG) [2020] UKUT 130 (IAC)</a> (1 May 2020), held that:</p>

<p>‘Having regard to the security and humanitarian situation in Kabul as well as the difficulties faced by the population living there (primarily the urban poor but also IDPs and other returnees, which are not dissimilar to the conditions faced throughout many other parts of Afghanistan) it will not, in general, be unreasonable or unduly harsh for a single adult male in good health to relocate to Kabul even if he does not have any specific connections or support network in Kabul and even if he does not have a Tazkera.</p>

<p>‘However, the particular circumstances of an individual applicant must be taken into account in the context of conditions in the place of relocation, including a person’s age, nature and quality of support network/connections with Kabul/Afghanistan, their physical and mental health, and their language, education and vocational skills when determining whether a person falls within the general position set out above. Given the limited options for employment, capability to undertake manual work may be relevant.</p>

<p>‘A person with a support network or specific connections in Kabul is likely to be in a more advantageous position on return, which may counter a particular vulnerability of an individual on return. A person without a network may be able to develop one following return. A person’s familiarity with the cultural and societal norms of Afghanistan (which may be affected by the age at which he left the country and his length of absence) will be relevant to whether, and if so how quickly and successfully, he will be able to build a network’ (paragraphs 253(iii) to 253(v)).</p>

<p>2.6.3 Decision makers must give careful consideration to the relevance and reasonableness of internal relocation taking full account of the individual circumstances of the particular person. While the onus is on the person to establish a well-founded fear of persecution or real risk of serious harm, if there is a safe place the person can relocate to escape that risk, decision makers must demonstrate that internal relocation is reasonable having regard to the individual circumstances of the person.</p>

<p>2.6.4 In the country guidance case of <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2012/163.html" rel="external">AK (Article 15(c)) Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 00163(IAC)</a>, heard on 14-15 March 2012 and promulgated on 18 May 2012, the Upper Tribunal held that it would be unreasonable to expect lone women and female heads of household to relocate internally without the support of a male network (paragraph 249B (v)). This was confirmed in the country guidance case <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2020/130.html" rel="external">AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan (CG) [2020] UKUT 130 (IAC)</a> (1 May 2020) and continues to apply.</p>

<span class="number">2.7 </span> Certification</h3>

<p>2.7.1 Where a claim is refused, it is unlikely to be certifiable as ‘clearly unfounded’ under section 94 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.</p>

<p>4.1.2 In her book, ‘Negotiating Survival: Civilian–Insurgent Relations in Afghanistan’, published in August 2021 and based on extensive research in-country (including over 400 interviews conducted between July 2017 and February 2019 in fifteen different provinces), Ashley Jackson noted that ‘much of what we think we know about the Taliban relies on reportage or indirect research which has often turned out to be either incorrect, misleading or incomplete’.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.3 This is preceded by her own conclusions that ‘For observers and analysts, the Taliban’s use of violence… has had a blinding effect’ but that this ‘is only useful if it is situated in a broader understanding of the political, administrative and ideological aspects of how they exercise power.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.4 She argued that ‘One way to understand the Taliban’s power is to examine it from the vantage point of those over whom that power is exercised. Looking at the Taliban through the eyes of the civilians they live among is the fastest way to shake loose faulty but persistent assumptions. Few of the generalisations that proliferate about the Taliban hold up when examined through the lens of civilian experiences’.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.5 On 19 September 2021, the Taliban’s ‘Government Media and Information Centre’ (GMIC) announced 11 media regulations or ‘journalism rules’ for Afghan journalists, various sources reported, including the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>, Reporters Without Borders (RSF),<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> and Al Jazeera.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.6 According to sources, the rules did not comply with international norms, including Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>. The IFJ said that the rules ‘are binding and apply to all journalists and media organisations across Afghanistan and place restrictions on independent media and freedom of expression more broadly.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.7 Relaying the rules, RSF said ‘The first three rules, which forbid journalists to broadcast or publish stories that are “contrary to Islam,” “insult national figures” or violate “privacy,” are loosely based on Afghanistan’s existing national media law’, but added, ‘there is no indication as to who determines, or on what basis it is determined, that a comment or a report is contrary to Islam or disrespectful to a national figure.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.8 RSF continued ‘Three of the rules tell journalists to conform to what are understood to be ethical principles. They must “not try to distort news content,” they must “respect journalistic principles” and they “must ensure that their reporting is balanced.” But the absence of reference to recognised international norms means that these rules can also be misused or interpreted arbitrarily.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.9 Citing the remaining rules, the RSF report stated:</p>

<p>‘Rules 7 and 8 facilitate a return to news control or even prior censorship, which has not existed in Afghanistan for the past 20 years. They state that, “Matters that have not been confirmed by officials at the time of broadcasting or publication should be treated with care” and that “Matters that could have a negative impact on the public’s attitude or affect morale should be handled carefully when being broadcast or published.”</p>

<p>‘The danger of a return to news control or prior censorship is enhanced by the last two rules (10 and 11), which reveal that the GMIC has “designed a specific form to make it easier for media outlets and journalists to prepare their reports in accordance with the regulations,” and that from now on, media outlets must “prepare detailed reports in coordination with the GMIC.” The nature of these “detailed reports” has yet to be revealed.</p>

<p>‘The ninth rule, requiring media outlets to “adhere to the principle of neutrality in what they disseminate” and “only publish the truth,” could be open to a wide range of interpretations and further exposes journalists to arbitrary reprisals.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.10 In relation to the new media regulations, Human Rights Watch (HRW) stated that ‘[the] provisions are so broad and vague as to prohibit virtually any critical reporting about the Taliban.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.11 According to the IFJ, the Taliban’s Ministry of Virtue and Prevention of Vice announced 8 ‘religious guidelines’ on 21 November 2021 which restrict the broadcasting of media that contravenes Islamic values, with several edicts exclusively targeting women journalists and media workers. Hakif Mohajir, a Taliban spokesperson, stated that:</p>

<p>‘the “religious guidelines” prohibit the screening of films or television programmes “against Islamic or Afghan values”. The rules also called on broadcasters to cease airing soap operas or dramas featuring women. All female journalists will also be required to wear an “Islamic hijab” whilst at work, an unclear edict subject to interpretation by the Taliban. In addition to the restrictions on women, the guidelines also prohibit any media that shows imagery of the prophet Muhammad or revered persons, comedic programs that “humiliate people”, and any films that contravene “Afghan” law.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.12 In a special report for the online news site Deadline, dated 20 September 2021, war and foreign policy journalist, Hollie McKay, wrote ‘A month into the Taliban takeover of Kabul, and the misinformation and disinformation continues to soar into dizzying territory – driven not only by both clumsy, opportunistic social media sharing, but also seemingly structured propaganda initiatives both inside and outside Afghanistan.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup> McKay referred to ‘fake social media accounts… set up to mimic major news organizations’ spreading misinformation and disinformation, as well as ‘images that are either doctored, fake, or entirely out of context or without context.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.13 The report also cited Emerson Brooking, a resident senior fellow at the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council, who said:</p>

<p>‘Afghanistan has fallen into a chaotic and global information war. Taliban spokespeople have issued statements that are revealed to be lies by either open-source evidence or the candid testimony of other Taliban… Meanwhile, a surreal coalition of opposition groups – among them members of the Afghan diaspora, Iranian exile organizations, Indian ultranationalists and Western military veterans – have pushed back against the Taliban. In the process, they have spread falsehoods of their own.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.14 According to a 23 November 2021 report by Tolo News, ‘NAI<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup>, an organization supporting media in Afghanistan, said that since the Islamic Emirate rule, over 257 media outlets have ceased operating in the country due to financial challenges as well as restrictions. This includes print, radio and TV stations. According to NAI, over 70 percent of media workers have become jobless or left the country.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Territorial control</h3>

<p>5.2.1 By 16 August 2021, Kabul and 32 other provinces were reported to be under Taliban control, reported the Long War Journal (LWJ), a project by the non-profit policy institute, the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (FDD).<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup> On 6 September 2021, the Taliban announced they had taken control of Panjshir province, which had been under the resistance of the National Resistance Front (NRF).<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup> However, on 5 October 2021, France24 cited an interview with Ali Maisam Nazary, head of foreign relations for the NRF, who said the resistance in Panjshir was continuing and that the NRF was in control of ‘more than half’ of Panjshir.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">[footnote 22]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.2.2 On 29 November 2021, France 24 reported on the Taliban in Panjshir valley, noting ‘Once a bustling hub of activity, Panjshir is now largely deserted. The few residents who have stayed are now under constant surveillance, and are struggling to survive amid a crippling economic crisis.’ In the video report, correspondents noted a number of check points on the road to the province’s capital, Bazarak. Taliban Chief of Security in Panjshir indicated that due to their vigilance, the province was the safest in Afghanistan. The Taliban claimed the NRF had been neutralised and, whilst the Chief of Security had heard that there was resistance on the ground, he had not encountered any and did not believe they (NRF) existed.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">[footnote 23]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span> Governance</h3>

<p>5.3.1 The supreme leader of the Taliban (Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan – IEA) is Hibatullah Akhundzada, though he remains out of the public eye.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:25" rel="footnote">[footnote 25]</a></sup><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:26" rel="footnote">[footnote 26]</a></sup><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:27" rel="footnote">[footnote 27]</a></sup> There was some speculation as to whether Akhundzada was alive or dead<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:28" rel="footnote">[footnote 28]</a></sup>. AAN noted, however, that ‘Whether alive or not, he does not seem to have much of a concrete role beyond providing the illusion of a centre of gravity and a leader who transcends worldly affairs.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:29" rel="footnote">[footnote 29]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.3.2 On 7 September 2021 the Taliban announced an all-male interim 33-member government, drawn from its own ranks.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:30" rel="footnote">[footnote 30]</a></sup><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:31" rel="footnote">[footnote 31]</a></sup><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:32" rel="footnote">[footnote 32]</a></sup> Commenting on the appointments, the International Crisis Group (ICG) said ‘The cabinet is filled with long-time key Taliban figures from their days as a government and later an insurgency, and it bears a strong resemblance to their former regime of the 1990s.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:33" rel="footnote">[footnote 33]</a></sup> A Taliban spokesman stressed that the appointments were temporary, but did not indicate when or how they would change.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:34" rel="footnote">[footnote 34]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.3.3 The AAN noted on 12 September 2021 ‘The list of ministers and other senior officials is almost exclusively Pashtun, with just two Tajiks and one Uzbek, and no Hazaras, Shia Muslims or members of Afghanistan’s smaller minorities. The list is further all-male and made up mostly of clerics, either mullahs or mawlawis (who have a higher Islamic madrassa education).’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:35" rel="footnote">[footnote 35]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.3.4 On 21 September 2021, the Taliban expanded its cabinet although, like its initial announcement of ministers, the list did not include any women.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:36" rel="footnote">[footnote 36]</a></sup><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:37" rel="footnote">[footnote 37]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.3.5 A September 2021 policy brief published by the research institute Swisspeace noted:</p>

<p>‘The Taliban have deliberately remained vague in their response when it comes to their policy direction on women, with the women’s ministry more or less also disbanded. When asked to clarify their policy on the matter, the Taliban’s generic answer is their “support for women’s rights under the Sharia law”. No further explanation is provided on what that means in practice. In a recent interview with the BBC, Taliban leader Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai had clearly indicated that “women will not be in the cabinet or top government positions [in their government]. But they could work at a lower level”. This statement reaffirms that the Taliban’s perception of women in Afghanistan has not changed.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:38" rel="footnote">[footnote 38]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.3.6 The ICG stated in regard to the new appointments that ‘The list of new appointees very slightly broadens the new government’s makeup, as the interim administration is no longer composed entirely of Taliban stalwarts. Most of the new appointees either have no prior affiliation with the group or are not prominent members of it.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:39" rel="footnote">[footnote 39]</a></sup> However, ‘many of these outsiders are considered sympathetic to the Taliban.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:40" rel="footnote">[footnote 40]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.3.7 In regard to ethnic minority inclusion, the ICG noted that the cabinet now had ‘four [4] Tajiks, two [2] Uzbeks, one Turkmen, one Hazara, one Nuristani (an ethnic group native to Nuristan province) and one Khwaja (claiming Arabic lineage, Khwajas generally speak Dari as their native tongue).’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:41" rel="footnote">[footnote 41]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.3.8 A third round of appointments were made on 4 October 2021, adding to the all-male cabinet.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:42" rel="footnote">[footnote 42]</a></sup> The AAN listed the caretaker cabinet and other senior appointments as at 5 October 2021.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:43" rel="footnote">[footnote 43]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.3.9 In her address to the UN Security Council on 17 November 2021, the Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Afghanistan, Ms. Deborah Lyons, viewed that the Taliban was:</p>

<p>‘making genuine efforts to present itself as a government. These efforts are partly constrained by the lack of resources and capacity, as well as a political ideology that in many ways clashes with contemporary international norms of governance so present in this chamber. The Taliban have not yet established full trust with much of the Afghan population or convinced them of their capacity to govern. The movement is also struggling to manage some serious internal divisions. Ultimately, however, the Taliban must decide on whether to govern according to the needs and the rights of the diverse Afghan population, or whether to rule on the basis of a narrow ideology and an even narrower ethnic base.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:44" rel="footnote">[footnote 44]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span> Rule of law - Sharia</h3>

<p>5.4.1 On 7 September 2021 the Taliban supreme leader Haibatullah Akhundzada announced that Sharia Law would ‘regulate all matters of governance and life in the country.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:45" rel="footnote">[footnote 45]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.4.2 In August 2021, Al Jazeera cited an independent Afghan analyst who said:</p>

<p>‘while the “theoretical interpretation of the Sharia would remain by and large the same as the 90s”, the prevailing circumstances – which are usually taken heavily into account to arrive at legal judgements – are different… “Whilst a fully democratic system is unlikely, it is plausible that features of the previous regime [Ghani’s] would remain, so long as these complied with the general ethos of the new, Taliban-approved ‘Islamic system’”.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:46" rel="footnote">[footnote 46]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.4.3 In January 2022, France 24 showed the differences in the way Sharia law was imposed in different regions, indicating that Taliban applied the law more harshly in Herat than in Kabul, though it was evident that not everyone adhered to the restrictions.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:47" rel="footnote">[footnote 47]</a></sup> For example, despite orders, some shop owners in Herat refused to remove the heads of their manequins, and women in Kabul were seen entering cafes without full face coverings even though posters at the door instructed otherwise.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:48" rel="footnote">[footnote 48]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.4.4 On 28 September 2021, Pajhwok News reported that the Taliban’s Ministry of Justice ‘said the caretaker government would adopt the constitution of King Mohammad Zahir Shah era without the parts which are in conflict with Islamic Sharia,’ and added that the Taliban respected ‘any international documents which were not in conflict with Sharia and Emirate rules…’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:49" rel="footnote">[footnote 49]</a></sup> Zahir Shah ruled Afghanistan from 1933 to 1973, when he was ousted in a bloodless military coup.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:50" rel="footnote">[footnote 50]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.4.5 However, speaking to Tolo News, an anonymous government source said that the decision to enforce that constitution, which was ratified in 1964, had not been finalised.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:51" rel="footnote">[footnote 51]</a></sup> Tolo News also noted that, according to a number of lawyers, ‘most parts of Zahir Shah’s era constitution are not compatible with the current situation.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:52" rel="footnote">[footnote 52]</a></sup> The article added:</p>

<p>‘Meanwhile, officials from the Cultural Commission of the Ministry of Information and Culture said if articles of the constitution which was enstated [sic] in 2004 (current constitution) are not in conflict with Sharia Law, they will remain in use until a new constitution is promulgated. Anaamullah Samangani, a member of the commission, said efforts have started to draft a new constitution based on the Quran and Sunnah.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:53" rel="footnote">[footnote 53]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.4.6 A report by the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, dated 28 September 2021, noted:</p>

<p>‘The Taliban’s return to power raises major concerns as regards the respect of human rights in Afghanistan. These concerns are twofold: that the progress which has been achieved in the past twenty years, especially in areas such as women’s rights, is dismantled; and that the Taliban, even when holding de facto power, continue to pursue the same methods they used as an insurgent group, including summary and targeted killings, torture, and other human rights and humanitarian law violations.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:54" rel="footnote">[footnote 54]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span> ‘Religious’ police</h3>

<p>5.5.1 The Ministry for Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice was re-established under the newly formed government, which under previous Taliban rule punished behaviour deemed un-Islamic, reported The Washington Post on 8 September 2021.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:55" rel="footnote">[footnote 55]</a></sup> Actors under the Ministry are often referred to in the media as the ‘religious’ or ‘morality’ police.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:56" rel="footnote">[footnote 56]</a></sup><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:57" rel="footnote">[footnote 57]</a></sup> Al Jazeera stated on 18 September 2021 that the new ministry was located in the building that once housed the Ministry of Women’s Affairs in Kabul.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:58" rel="footnote">[footnote 58]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.5.2 On 27 September 2021, it was reported that the Taliban had issued a decree banning barbers in Helmand province from shaving or trimming beards. As reported in an article attributed to the AP, the order stated ‘If anyone violates the rule (they) will be punished and no one has a right to complain’, although it was not clear what penalties would be faced by barbers if they ignored the order.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:59" rel="footnote">[footnote 59]</a></sup> On 12 October 2021, CNN reported ‘When asked about a recent edict in Helmand province that barber shops could be punished for shaving men’s beards, he [Mawlavi Abdullah Mohammad, Director of the Ministry of Virtue and Prevention of Vice] presented a document from the Taliban’s leadership, condemning the decree’.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:60" rel="footnote">[footnote 60]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.5.3 A December 2021 article by Voice of America (VOA) indicated that a new decree issued by the Taliban ‘appears to stop short of the outright ban on trimming beards’.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:61" rel="footnote">[footnote 61]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.5.4 On 17 January 2022, RFE/RL’s Radio Azadi, cited by Gandhara, reported that officials from the Taliban in the country’s southern Uruzgan Province had ordered male employees to stop trimming their beards and wear a turban at work. A senior Taliban official in Uruzgan, Mulawi Taib, told a gathering on 16 January 2022 that the group wanted people to obey Islamic law. Taib stated that, ‘All employees… should understand that the policy of the Islamic Emirate [of Afghanistan] is based on Shari’a law. All employees are forbidden to shorten their beards and must come to work wearing turbans’.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:62" rel="footnote">[footnote 62]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.5.5 Reuters reported on 28 March 2022 that government employees were instructed by the Taliban not to shave their beards and ‘to wear local clothing consisting of a long, loose top and trousers, and a hat or turban’.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:63" rel="footnote">[footnote 63]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.5.6 On 12 October 2021, CNN reported that in Ghazni, the religious police were encouraging residents to follow sharia law. Director of the Ministry for Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice in Ghazni, Mawlavi Abdullah Mohammad, told CNN ‘“We [act] with accordance to Sharia law… Firstly, we inform people about good deeds. We preach to them and deliver the message to them in a nice way; the second time we repeat to them, again; the third time we speak to them slightly harshly”.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:64" rel="footnote">[footnote 64]</a></sup>’</p>

<p>5.5.7 CNN noted that guidelines on how to work have been issued to the religious police in the form of a blue booklet. Mohammad said ‘We abide by laws and rules. We give advice, but to grab someone’s hand, to beat him up, to send them notice or to send them a warning letter, is against the Emirate’s policy. If anyone has done this, it is a self-assertive act’.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:65" rel="footnote">[footnote 65]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.5.8 Posters put up outside cafes and shops in Kabul ordering women to cover up, reported VOA News on 7 January 2022. A spokesman for the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice said, ‘If someone does not follow it, it does not mean she will be punished or beaten, it’s just encouragement for Muslim women to follow Sharia law’.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:66" rel="footnote">[footnote 66]</a></sup>. VOA added that the Taliban, eager for international recognition, ‘have so far refrained from issuing national policies. Instead, they have published guidance for men and women that has varied from province to province’’.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:67" rel="footnote">[footnote 67]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.5.9 In an article discussing the guidelines, HRW stated on 29 October 2021 that ‘The Taliban issued the “By-Law of the Commission for Preaching and Guidance, Recruitment and Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice” in 2020, and a revised version in February 2021 when it was controlling growing areas of the country. The ministry has used it in a number of provinces since the Taliban took over Kabul on August 15’.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:68" rel="footnote">[footnote 68]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.5.10 HRW referred to some of the chapters, opining:</p>

<p>‘The manual is largely devoted to enforcing rules against “vice,” but its final chapters set out guidelines for all Afghans and for Taliban members, including tough restrictions on the conduct of women and girls. It instructs religious leaders to teach people about which male family members can act as a mahram (a chaperone) for women and older girls and states that women “shall be commanded to put on a veil when faced with non-mahrams.” Another provision states: “Women shall be prohibited from not wearing hijab and veil in public and against non-mahrams,” but adds that these mandates should be enforced in “an easy and kind way”.’</p>

<p>5.5.11 On 26 December 2021, Al Jazeera reported that guidance issued by the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice stated that women must be accompanied by a mahram only if they are travelling for more than 72km (45 miles).<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:69" rel="footnote">[footnote 69]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.5.12 HRW noted other restrictions cited in the manual:</p>

<p>‘The manual also imposes abusive restrictions on personal autonomy and other liberties. It prohibits sex outside of marriage – which the penal code adopted by the previous government also prohibited – along with adultery, same-sex relations, and “immorality and vice.” “Strong allegations” of adultery or homosexuality must be reported to the ministry’s district manager for further action, presumably punishment. When the Taliban were previously in power, they executed women and men for adultery and there were reports that they executed some men found to have engaged in same-sex relations.</p>

<p>‘In the manual, the Taliban discourages people from “helping, befriending…infidels” and instructs religious leaders to advise men on growing their beards. Those who fail to pray or fast as required by religious obligations are to be reported. It prohibits parties and listening to music audible outside a home, cinemas, gambling, and “inappropriate use of tape cassettes, dish antenna, computer and mobile.”</p>

<p>‘The Taliban also condone abusive responses to so-called “vice.” The manual sets out five stages for people to respond to prohibited acts, beginning with educating the person and graduating to guidance, then prohibiting the vice in “an aggressive, angry and scary manner,” prohibiting the action “physically,” and finally reporting it to the district manager for action’.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:70" rel="footnote">[footnote 70]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.7.2 On 23 September 2021, the Associated Press (AP) cited its interview with Mullah Nooruddin Turabi, one of the founders of the Taliban who acted as justice minister and head of the Ministry of Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice during the Taliban’s previous rule. The AP reported that the Taliban ‘will once again carry out executions and amputations of hands, though perhaps not in public.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:95" rel="footnote">[footnote 95]</a></sup> The AP added that Turabi:</p>

<p>‘dismissed outrage over the Taliban’s executions in the past, which sometimes took place in front of crowds at a stadium, and he warned the world against interfering with Afghanistan’s new rulers.</p>

<p>‘“Everyone criticized us for the punishments in the stadium, but we have never said anything about their laws and their punishments,” Turabi told The Associated Press, speaking in Kabul. “No one will tell us what our laws should be.

<p>5.7.5 The AP report added:</p>

<p>‘In recent days in Kabul, Taliban fighters have revived a punishment they commonly used in the past – public shaming of men accused of small-time theft.</p>

<p>‘On at least two occasions in the last week, Kabul men have been packed into the back of a pickup truck, their hands tied, and were paraded around to humiliate them. In one case, their faces were painted to identify them as thieves. In the other, stale bread was hung from their necks or stuffed in their mouth.

<p>5.7.6 Similar public shaming was reported on 17 November 2021 by Jurist, a law-school based legal news and commentary service under the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, which received reports from law students and lawyers in Afghanistan.

<p>5.7.10 However, on 26 October 2021, Jurist cited a staff correspondent in Kabul who indicated the complexities within the Taliban, which resulted in them not always following leadership policy:</p>

<p>‘They [Taliban] are not one group. Haqqani network, Al-Qaeda, and many other militants assisted the Taliban throughout the last two decades. Each and every one of these groups follows their own agenda and policy at the moment.</p>

<p>‘Haqqani network are the most dangerous and extremist group within the Taliban. They have said that anyone who stood against them during the past 20 years should be prosecuted by the Taliban. Therefore, when it comes to targets and threats every one of the groups listed above has their own agenda – they look at people as their own enemies. They do not hold the same opinions. They do not follow one single policy.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:109" rel="footnote">[footnote 109]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.7.11 Actions by some Taliban appeared to confirm that official policy was not always followed when a Jurist staff correspondent referred to an incident of public shaming in Badakhshan province even without any judicial proceeding or official order from the Taliban.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:110" rel="footnote">[footnote 110]</a></sup> According to the same report, ‘the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice released statements against the imposition of such punishments without a competent court order. However, it appears that some of the group’s members are not following such advisory or are violating official orders.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:111" rel="footnote">[footnote 111]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.7.12 In a similar vein on arbitrary acts of justice, a civil activist in Ghor province told the independent Afghan newspaper, Hasht-e Subh, in regard to Taliban seeking revenge from those who fought against them, that ‘The Taliban doesn’t have a specific leadership, but their members act arbitrarily in areas, and each of them has their own rule…’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:112" rel="footnote">[footnote 112]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.7.13 In a December 2021 report, the Danish Immigration Service (DIS) reported on recent events in Afghanistan, citing a range of sources, and noted in regard to the Taliban’s actions:</p>

<p>‘All the consulted sources… explained that many of the incidents committed by Taliban members toward members of the civilian population since the Taliban conquest should not be viewed as a systematic campaign against adversaries and enemies of the Islamic Emirate. Rather, these incidents should be understood as individual Taliban members settling old personal disputes and feuds. In this relation, both the London-based journalist and the Afghan professor of law pointed out that many Taliban members have in the past been treated poorly by officials of the former government, such as members of the security forces or the previous judiciary. Taliban members are now taking advantage of the current situation in Afghanistan to resolve personal disputes and revenging themselves or family members, who have been treated poorly by Afghans employed by the former government. Other incidents can be explained as a manifestation of individual Taliban members or ethnic Pashtuns not affiliated with the Taliban taking advantage of the current situation in Afghanistan in order to advance their own agenda and personal interests.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:113" rel="footnote">[footnote 113]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.7.14 The DIS report added:</p>

<p>‘According to the Afghan professor of law, this disconnect between statements from the Taliban leadership and the actions on the ground have occurred in part because of the Taliban’s highly decentralised composition. This means that the Taliban leadership are not able to control the Taliban fighters’ actions. This assessment was echoed by the London-based journalist, who argued that the Taliban leadership does [not] have the capacity to ensure that every Taliban member with a weapon follows their commands, and that they might not be willing to either.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:114" rel="footnote">[footnote 114]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.7.15 In a statement the Taliban warned of rogue elements in their ranks, acting in their own interests in an attempt to harm the image of the group, reported Al Jazeera on 4 November 2021.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:115" rel="footnote">[footnote 115]</a></sup> Following reports of Taliban fighters abusing journalists and seizing property, a decree issued in late September by the office of supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhunzada said the Taliban was banned from entering homes or offices ‘in Kabul or its surroundings under the pretext of checking vehicles or equipment. No one is allowed to take vehicles or equipment.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:116" rel="footnote">[footnote 116]</a></sup> However, in apparent defiance of this decree, The Guardian reported in January 2022 that, ‘Taliban gunmen have raided the homes of women’s rights activists in Kabul, beating and arresting female campaigners in a string of actions apparently triggered by recent demonstrations.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:117" rel="footnote">[footnote 117]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.7.16 Emphasising the need for good behaviour of Taliban fighters, ‘The Purification Commission of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan ordered a ban on arbitrary military operations and courts and warned that those accountable will be brought to justice or dissolved,’ reported Khaama Press on 13 November 2021.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:118" rel="footnote">[footnote 118]</a></sup> Afghan Voice Agency (AVA) reported on 14 November 2021 that, following accusations of abuse, ‘The Taliban interim government has reported that the Filtration Commission has dismissed more than 400 security forces from their duties and jailed many of them.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:119" rel="footnote">[footnote 119]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.7.17 AVA reported on 23 November that the Taliban said prisoners should not be detained beyond a certain period of time and that all cases should be referred to the judiciary and dealt with according to Sharia law. The report added that ‘In the past, most [prisoners] during the previous regime repeatedly claimed to have been detained for no reason or for too long. Moreover, the process has continued since the Taliban took control, and many people have been arrested or imprisoned without knowing their fate.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:120" rel="footnote">[footnote 120]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.7.18 Jurist, a law-school based legal news and commentary service under the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, received reports from law students and lawyers in Afghanistan. On 25 November 2021, a staff correspondent for Jurist in Kabul expressed concern at the Taliban’s Ministry of Justice hiring policy, which stipulated the following conditions on hiring officials for the Ministry:</p>

<p>‘1. Should be a scholar (they mean that applicants should have Islamic knowledge);</p>

<p>‘2. Should be honest, have good reputation, and be faithful to the Taliban’s values and principles;</p>

<p>‘3. Should not have worked in the former government;</p>

<p>‘4. Have taken part in the war in the past two decades;</p>

<p>‘5. Have professional knowledge and serve the people in a good way.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:121" rel="footnote">[footnote 121]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.7.19 The staff correspondent regarded that, ‘The Taliban are finding ways to hire their own soldiers into the different governmental organizations and because these soldiers have no skills and academic background, such actions mean that the Taliban are paving the way for their own.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:122" rel="footnote">[footnote 122]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.7.20 Reporting on 1 December 2021, Gandhara, an English language news hub affiliated to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, noted ‘Taliban Justice Minister Mullah Abdul Hakim also declared that only Taliban-approved lawyers can work in their Islamic courts, effectively revoking the licenses of some 2,500 lawyers in Afghanistan. His order has raised deep concerns about the impartiality and fairness of criminal trials under the Taliban…’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:123" rel="footnote">[footnote 123]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.7.21 On 3 January 2022, Jurist staff reported:</p>

<p>‘Afghanistan’s Justice Ministry reiterated Monday that the country’s independent lawyers will need to re-certify under a new qualification process set by the Ministry, signaling the intent of the Taliban authorities to plough ahead with plans to strip the country’s legal profession of its independence.</p>

<p>According to the statement, the country’s lawyers will be authorized to continue practicing with their previous licenses until the new certification process has been finalized.</p>

<p>This was the latest step in a series of efforts by the new regime to crack down on the activities of the Afghanistan Independent Bar Association (AIBA), an organization established in 2008 to oversee the licensing of new lawyers, and to champion the rule of law and social justice.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:124" rel="footnote">[footnote 124]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.7.22 On 7 December 2021, Hasht-e Subh, an independent Afghan newspaper, reported on the arrest of 4 people for the rape of 2 women.

<span class="number">6.1 </span> Taliban’s ‘general amnesty’</h3>

<p>6.1.1 For background on the Taliban’s announcement of a ‘general amnesty’ against ‘all those who had fought against us’,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:126" rel="footnote">[footnote 126]</a></sup> see sections 4.2 and 4.3 of the Country Policy and Information Note on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ecoi.net/en/document-search/?country%5B%5D=afg&amp;countryOperator=should&amp;srcId%5B%5D=11502&amp;srcIdOperator=should&amp;useSynonyms=Y&amp;sort_by=origPublicationDate&amp;sort_order=desc" rel="external">Afghanistan: Fear of the Taliban v1.0</a>.</p>

<p>6.1.2 In her book, ‘Negotiating Survival: Civilian–Insurgent Relations in Afghanistan’, published in August 2021 and based on extensive research in-country (including over 400 interviews conducted between July 2017 and February 2019 in 15 different provinces), Ashley Jackson explained that this policy is not new.</p>

<p>‘The Taliban also made concerted efforts to ‘demobilise’ Afghan forces rather than simply kill them, though targeted killings continued alongside this. In 2016, the practice became an official policy whereby the Taliban offered amnesty to anyone associated with the government or international forces. For example, Afghan security forces were allowed to return to civilian life, provided they surrendered their arms, apologised for the harm done and had a trusted elder vouch for them.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:127" rel="footnote">[footnote 127]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.1.3 A joint report, dated September 2021, by Amnesty International (AI), International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation against Torture (OMCT) cited a range of sources and noted:</p>

<p>‘Although the Taliban had assured a general amnesty for all previous government workers, there was no formal decree to this effect – and to protect the rights of journalists. Contrary to this reassurance, the Taliban continued to crackdown on journalists and tortured them for reporting about protests in the country. Female protestors took to the streets demanding equality and freedom in Nimroz, Kabul, Herat, Mazar-e-Sharif and other cities and provinces in Afghanistan – despite violent crackdowns on protestors on 2 and 6 September in Mazar-e-Sharif. Reporters were threatened by the Taliban to not report the protest in Mazar-e-Sharif.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:128" rel="footnote">[footnote 128]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.1.4 The Report of the Secretary General on the situation in Afghanistan, published on 2 September 2021, said that:</p>

<p>‘After seizing Kabul, Taliban fighters erected checkpoints throughout the capital and increased patrols, without uniforms. Reports also suggested that some people had been shot after having crossed checkpoints without approval. While statements by the Taliban included instructions not to enter anyone’s house without permission and that “life, property and honour” would be protected, numerous reports emerged of the Taliban conducting house-to-house searches for government personnel, weapons and property, and in some cases confiscation of the latter. Some reports indicated that the Taliban were allegedly searching for people who had “worked with foreigners” and at times, beating them.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:129" rel="footnote">[footnote 129]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.1.5 A report on political, security-related and humanitarian developments in Afghanistan and consequences for Europe and the region by the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, dated 28 September 2021, noted ‘While in their public discourse, the Taliban have pledged to respect human rights – within the framework of Sharia law – the reality on the ground contradicts these statements, as reported by the United Nations, NGOs and media sources.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:130" rel="footnote">[footnote 130]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.1.6 The Jurist’s Staff Correspondent in Kabul said in a report dated 26 October 2021 that:</p>

<p>‘The Taliban announced that there would be no revenge and no one would be targeted – even those who worked with foreign forces in Afghanistan – but reality reports otherwise. There is a gap between what they said and what they are actually doing.</p>

<p>‘Many individuals have reported that they have been threatened by the Taliban since they seized power in August in Afghanistan. But the Taliban themselves have not commented on any incident reported by the media. Many others fear to report any warnings from the Taliban to the media.</p>

<p>‘It’s mostly social activists, former military and government officials, CSOs, and traders who have been targeted, warned, and even affected by the Taliban…’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:131" rel="footnote">[footnote 131]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.1.7 Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported on 30 November 2021 that, despite a general amnesty, more than 100 members of the former security services have been killed or disappeared in 4 provinces between 15 August and 31 October 2021. The report also indicated family members of former security forces had also been targeted.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:132" rel="footnote">[footnote 132]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.1.8 On 31 January 2022, Al Jazeera reported that UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, when referring to the deaths of over 100 Afghan government and security force personnel, said in a report addressed to the UN Security Council that:</p>

<p>‘“more than two-thirds” of the victims were allegedly killed extrajudicially by the Taliban or its affiliates. “Despite announcements of general amnesties for former members of the Government, security forces and those who worked with international military forces, [the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan] UNAMA continued to receive credible allegations of killings, enforced disappearances, and other violations” against former government and coalition members, the report said. The UN mission also documented 44 cases of temporary arrests, beatings and threats of intimidation, 42 of them by the Taliban.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:133" rel="footnote">[footnote 133]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.1.9 A joint statement by numerous foreign governments, including the US, UK and EU, expressed concern at findings in the HRW report and called on the Taliban to enforce the amnesty.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:134" rel="footnote">[footnote 134]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.1.10 Responding to the HRW report, the Taliban’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said ‘any Islamic Emirate member “found breaching the amnesty decree will be prosecuted and penalized”’ whilst the Taliban’s reform commission said it had ‘not registered any cases of killings of former members of the security forces.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:135" rel="footnote">[footnote 135]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.1.11 AVA reported on 1 December 2021 that in contrast to some statements announcing that Taliban soldiers would be held accountable for breaching the amnesty, ‘the Taliban prime minister implicitly legitimized the targeted assassinations of former government employees. He said the Taliban were committed to the principle of amnesty but were punishing those who acted against them.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:136" rel="footnote">[footnote 136]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.2.2 Reuters reported on 10 September 2021 that Rohullah Azizi, brother of the former Afghan vice president, had been killed by the Taliban. A text received by Reuters from Azizi’s nephew said ‘They [Taliban] executed my uncle… They killed him yesterday and would not let us bury him. They kept saying his body should rot.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:137" rel="footnote">[footnote 137]</a></sup> Deutsche Welle (DW) said that another nephew told the AP that Rohullah and his driver were stopped at a Taliban checkpoint, in Khanez village in Panjshir province, and shot. The Taliban claimed he was killed during fighting in the province.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:138" rel="footnote">[footnote 138]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.2.3 According to DW, reporting on 11 September 2021, ‘Videos circulating on social media purportedly show the Taliban opening fire on anti-Taliban fighters in Panjshir whom they have arrested.

<p>6.2.4 Hasht-e Subh Daily, an independent Afghan newspaper, reported on 18 October that according to sources in Ghor province, ‘the Taliban has demanded blood money from people in some villages of the province. The Taliban in Ghor province has reportedly demanded the members of the former government and public uprising to pay a ransom for the blood of Taliban fighters killed in the past.’ The Taliban denied the accusations, saying that any past animosity between the Taliban and residents was under ‘the mediation of influential and local elders.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:140" rel="footnote">[footnote 140]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.2.5 On 12 October 2021 it was reported that Patricia Gossman, associate director for the Asia division of Human Rights Watch, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) that there were many reports of people being arrested ‘purely for having any association with the former security forces and family members being interrogated or beaten by Taliban looking for former officials,’ and according to the same source, ‘The Taliban forces carrying out these abuses appear to have been given a free hand while officials at the top deny it is happening.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:141" rel="footnote">[footnote 141]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.2.6 In a meeting on 23 October 2021 with UN Secretary-General’s special representative to Afghanistan, Deborah Lyons, the Taliban’s Deputy Prime Minister gave assurances that UN organisations and staff would be protected in the country.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:142" rel="footnote">[footnote 142]</a></sup><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:143" rel="footnote">[footnote 143]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.2.7 Citing the Financial Times, Khaama Press reported on 24 October 2021 that the EU were making plans to reopen its diplomatic representation in Kabul.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:144" rel="footnote">[footnote 144]</a></sup> In response, the Taliban’s foreign ministry spokesman, Abdul Qahar Balkhi, welcomed the move and said, ‘Just as security of other embassies in Kabul is guaranteed, the security of EU embassy &amp; personnel will also be guaranteed’, reported Afghan Voice Agency (AVA).<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:145" rel="footnote">[footnote 145]</a></sup> However, prior to this promise of security, the Guardian reported on 5 October 2021 that a former British Embassy driver in Kabul was attacked at home by 5 armed men, whom he believed were affiliated to the Taliban and which he said was linked to his employment at the embassy.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:146" rel="footnote">[footnote 146]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.2.8 On 26 October 2021, the Jurist’s Staff Correspondent in Kabul gave their ‘observations on the Taliban’s targeting of perceived or potential opponents in Afghanistan who publicly object to their policies, who were associated with the previous government, or who worked with foreign forces prior to the Taliban takeover.’ They said:</p>

<p>‘former government officials in Panjshir, Mazar, and Samangan provinces have been targeted, leading to the death of one in Samangan province. A few weeks ago the Taliban even went farther and stated some specific individuals – especially those who worked with the foreign forces – should give themselves up to be prosecuted or they will prosecute their family members if they find them. Anyone on the Taliban’s blacklist is in great danger.</p>

<p>‘The Taliban are using different techniques in targeting people. They have issued warning letters to some former government officials stating that if they do not give themselves to them then their families would be arrested. Several officials of the central bank received warning letters in the last three weeks. They all received written warning letters signed and stamped by the Taliban. One of the warning letters shared with me said “You should have stopped working with a slave government under control of Americans; we shall punish you so others take a lesson.” Fortunately, the target of this letter is already out of the country. In another incident from the central bank, the Taliban went to check the former Chief of Staff of the central bank who was said to have worked with the ex-governor of the bank too closely. However, they could not find him.</p>

<p>‘The Taliban appear to have monitored government officials closely before they seized power in August. Most of the people who got killed by them were government officials. I myself lost three friends in a car bombing several months ago.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:147" rel="footnote">[footnote 147]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.2.9 The DIS report of December 2021 noted:</p>

<p>‘according to the Afghan professor of law, the treatment of Afghans associated with the previous government by the Taliban has varied depending on their professions and previous tasks. As an example hereof, he explained that health workers and people employed in the health sector have largely not been targeted by the Taliban. The same is true for people employed in the education sector, although there have been restraints on the curricula in some parts of the country, because education has been regarded as somewhat controversial. The London-based journalist and the Kabul-based journalist shared this view that the treatment Afghans associated with the previous government has varied depending on what job they previously held.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:148" rel="footnote">[footnote 148]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.2.10 The DIS report also noted in regard to persons associated with the international community:</p>

<p>‘One source stated that the lack of empirical data makes it very difficult to assess how Taliban regards Afghans previously employed by international organisations or foreign states in Afghanistan, and how they have been treated.</p>

<p>‘All sources consulted assessed that the Taliban members regard Afghans previously employed by international organisations or foreign states in Afghanistan in a similar fashion to how they approach Afghans employed by the former government. As such, whether or not an Afghan previously employed by international organisations or foreign states risks being targeted by the Taliban may depend on their previous tasks and their previous employers. The Afghan professor of law elaborated that the number of Afghans who have worked for either an international organisation or a foreign country in Afghanistan is so high that the Taliban does not possess the capacity to target all of them even if they wanted to.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:149" rel="footnote">[footnote 149]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.2.11 In slight contrast, the DIS report noted that ‘the expert in Afghan security policy stated that Afghans who have worked at embassies of Western states in recent years are… at risk, because it is difficult to conceal one’s occupation in Afghanistan.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:150" rel="footnote">[footnote 150]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.2.12 The DIS report also added, ‘Regarding Afghans employed by Western NGOs, two sources stated that whether or not such individuals would be at risk of persecution by members of Taliban depended on what work the NGO carries out and not from what country the NGO originates.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:151" rel="footnote">[footnote 151]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.2.13 BBC News reported on 13 January 2022 that ex-British Council teachers ‘who were employed to spread British values and teach English in Helmand province’, were living in hiding in fear of reprisals by the Taliban.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:152" rel="footnote">[footnote 152]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.3.2 The DIS report of December 2021 noted that sources consulted, ‘agreed that Afghans previously employed by Western militaries, and especially the American military, top the hierarchy of risk. The expert in Afghan security policy elaborated that Afghans previously working at enclosed military facilities would be of less risk of being targeted, as this occupation is easier to conceal’.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:153" rel="footnote">[footnote 153]</a></sup></p>

According to HRW, persons have been detained, executed or forcibly disappeared within days of their registration. The report also noted that the Taliban undertook house to house searches or night raids looking for former ANSF members, ‘often threatening and abusing family members to reveal the whereabouts of those in hiding.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:159" rel="footnote">[footnote 159]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.4.6 Referring to Afghan military pilots who had fled to Uzbekistan and, according to one pilot, feared returning to Afghanistan for fear of reprisals by the Taliban, Reuters reported on 3 September 2021 that the Taliban said there would be no reprisal killings and that they ‘will be inviting former military personnel, including pilots, to join their new security forces.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:160" rel="footnote">[footnote 160]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.4.7 Citing various sources, a joint report by Amnesty International (AI), International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation against Torture (OMCT) said ‘In an attack on 4 September [2021], the Taliban were accused of killing Banu Negar, a former woman police officer, in front of her children. She was eight months pregnant at the time. She had worked for the police force in Ghor for 15 years.

The 2 pilots said the Taliban were threatening their Afghanistan-based families and those of over 100 other pilots in Tajikistan, demanding they return to the country. The Taliban denied the allegations and suggested that the stories were a ruse to gain refugee status.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:162" rel="footnote">[footnote 162]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.4.14 In a December 2021 report, the Danish Immigration Service (DIS) reported on recent events in Afghanistan, citing a range of sources, and noted in regard to targeting members of the former ANSF:</p>

<p>‘All of the sources consulted for the report stated that the Taliban have engaged in some degree of systematic targeting, especially of Afghans with links to the security sector of the previous government, since their conquest of Afghanistan. The London-based journalist stated that the Taliban have launched raids on employees of the former government by going from door to door in cities. The expert in Afghan security policy echoed this, and further advised that the Taliban have engaged in low intensity retribution campaigns against former members of the security sector and especially former members of the National Directorate of Security (NDS) since assuming power.

<p>6.4.15 The same report added:</p>

<p>‘All consulted sources for this report agreed that Afghans previously employed in the security forces generally face a greater risk of being targeted than Afghans employed as civilians at the former government. The sources further agreed that Afghans previously employed in the security forces also faced a varying degree of risk depending on their previous job.

<p>6.5.2 Reporting on the loss of women’s rights since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, HRW reported on 1 November 2021:</p>

<p>‘Secondary schools have reopened for boys but remain closed to the vast majority of girls. Women are banned from most employment; the Taliban government added insult to injury by saying women in their employ could keep their jobs only if they were in a role a man cannot fill – such as being an attendant in a women’s toilet. Women are mostly out of university, and due to new restrictions it is unclear when and how they can return. Many female teachers have been dismissed.</p>

<p>‘The policy of requiring a mahram, a male family member as chaperone, to accompany any woman leaving her home, is not in place according to a Kabul official but Taliban members on the street are still sometimes enforcing it, as well as harassing women about their clothing. The Taliban have systematically closed down shelters for women and girls fleeing domestic violence.

<p>6.5.3 Former female Afghan lawyers and judges claim that ex-prisoners, freed by the Taliban, have been searching for them to take revenge for their convictions and imprisonment. The women have been unable to return to work following the Taliban takeover and now live in fear of reprisals from both the Taliban and convicted criminals, some saying they received death threats on a daily basis.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:176" rel="footnote">[footnote 176]</a></sup><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:177" rel="footnote">[footnote 177]</a></sup><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:178" rel="footnote">[footnote 178]</a></sup><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:179" rel="footnote">[footnote 179]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.5.4 HRW indicated in a report on women in the city of Herat, dated 23 September 2021, that, ‘Since taking over the city on August 12, 2021, the Taliban have instilled fear among women and girls by searching out high-profile women; denying women freedom of movement outside their homes; imposing compulsory dress codes; severely curtailing access to employment and education; and restricting the right to peaceful assembly.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:180" rel="footnote">[footnote 180]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.5.5 Regarding high-profile women, the HRW report noted:</p>

<p>‘The women interviewed said that they had heard reports that the Taliban had searched for at least some women’s rights activists and high-profile women in Herat, and one of the women had seen her own name on a Taliban flyer. One woman said that elders in her neighborhood told her that the Taliban had come to them with a list of 25 high-profile women, including her, and had asked them for help finding those women. The elders said they protected her by saying they did not know her. “Those 25 were with big organizations, government offices, and were reporters, civil society activists, and those who spoke against the Taliban in the media or criticized the Taliban – they said all were listed there.” She named several high-ranking female members of the former provincial government whom she said were also reportedly listed.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:181" rel="footnote">[footnote 181]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.6.2 The US Department of State (USSD) noted in its 2020 Human Rights report on Afghanistan that ‘Under Islamic sharia law, conviction of same-sex sexual activity is punishable by death, flogging, or imprisonment.

<p>6.6.6 France 24 noted on 2 November 2021 that ‘Although the militant group has not yet officially said how it plans to deal with acts of homosexuality, reports are increasingly suggesting that the Taliban is applying a strict interpretation of Sharia law, under which same-sex relations may be punishable by death.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:202" rel="footnote">[footnote 202]</a></sup></p>

According to the NGO, identities may have been exposed as foreign rights groups drew up lists of potential evacuees following the Taliban takeover. Citing Rainbow Railroad Executive Director, Kimahli Powell, France 24 reported ‘the Taliban seem to have complemented these lists through active persecution, by means of “entrapment” and data leaks. “[Some] individuals who have reached out to us have told us about how they’ve received a mystery email from someone claiming to be connected with Rainbow Railroad asking for their information and passport.

<p>‘the Taliban have continued their persecution and harassment of Shi’a Hazaras outside Kabul even since the takeover. The statue of Abdul Ali Mazari, an anti-Taliban Shi’a Hazara leader who was later tortured and killed by the Taliban, was destroyed.

<p>‘Even if one were to believe that the Taliban leadership has changed, it does not mean that their fighters and commanders on the ground will conform to their “new” vision, particularly on Shi’a Hazaras.

<p>‘In early October 2021, the Taliban and associated militias forcibly evicted hundreds of Hazara families from the southern Helmand province and the northern Balkh province. These followed earlier evictions from Daikundi, Uruzgan, and Kandahar provinces. Since the Taliban came to power in August, the Taliban have told many Hazaras and other residents in these five provinces to leave their homes and farms, in many cases with only a few days’ notice and without any opportunity to present their legal claims to the land.

<p>6.7.9 Despite deep mistrust, there were elements of hope, as indicated in a report by the Independent on 16 November 2021: ‘“In comparison to their previous rule, the Taliban are a little better,” said Mohammed Jawad Gawhari, a Hazara cleric who runs an organization helping the poor. “The problem is that there is not a single law.

The AA report noted:</p>

<p>‘As the Taliban made its recent lightning advances across the country, the majority of the two communities came to Kabul and stayed at a temple in the Katre Pawran neighborhood. After the capital also fell, however, a team of the Taliban went to the temple and assured them of their safety. “I’m in constant contact with the President of the Gurdwara Committee in Kabul … Even today, Taliban leaders came to Gurdwara Sahib and met the Hindus and Sikhs and assured them,” said [Sikh community member Talwindar Singh Chawla].’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:230" rel="footnote">[footnote 230]</a></sup></p>

Sikhs in Kabul said they were unable to organise an event due to their ‘busy schedules’ and because the granthi (principle religious official) was not in Kabul.

<span class="number">6.9 </span> Human rights defenders, including lawyers and judges</h3>

<p>6.9.1 On 3 November 2021, UN Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders (HRDs) indicated that HRDs were ‘living under a climate of fear, threats, intense insecurity and growing desperation’. According to the report:</p>

<p>‘“The threat is very real,” said Mary Lawlor, the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders. “Defenders tell me of direct threats, including gendered threats against women, of beatings, arrests, enforced disappearances, and of defenders being killed. They describe living in a climate of constant fear.</p>

<p>‘“Among those most at risk are defenders documenting alleged war crimes, women defenders, in particular criminal lawyers, cultural rights defenders, especially those working in banned sectors such as music, and defenders from minority groups. Defenders tell me that some have erased their online data history to evade identification, and that the Taliban are resorting to other ways of finding them - for example that one HRD was identified by an injury to his leg.”</p>

<p>‘Lawlor said she had received online testimonies from around 100 human rights defenders, including those in rural provinces, detailing specific tactics used against them. The Taliban have raided the offices of human rights and civil society organisations, searching for the names, addresses and contacts of those who used to work there, she said.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:265" rel="footnote">[footnote 265]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.9.2 In its ‘Afghanistan: Country Focus’, dated January 2022 and based on a range of sources covering events between 15 August and 8 December 2021, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) noted:</p>

<p>‘IAJ [International Association of Judges] and IAWJ [International Association of Women Judges] published at joint statement in which judges were stated to be in “very grave danger”, and stressed that revenge killings might occur, and that judges had been subjected to house-searches, threatening messages and physical harassment, and had their bank accounts suspended. Also, family, friends and neighbours were said to have been pressed to reveal judges’ whereabouts. A similar account was published by Business Insider quoting a former judge, who claimed that “Taliban fighters went into his house looking for him and searched the homes of his families, friends, and colleagues.” Another former judge in hiding told Business Insider that some Taliban fighters were pursuing ‘personal vendettas’ against judges, and could not be controlled by the Taliban leadership.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:266" rel="footnote">[footnote 266]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.9.5 On 25 November 2021, the Jurist published an English translation of a warning issued by the Taliban to human rights and civil society workers in Panjshir province, an area that resisted the Taliban takeover. The warning said that persons or organisations working under the name of civil society or human rights activists were considered illegal and that the Taliban were therefore ‘instructed to seriously find and pursue them and arrest them as soon as possible to stop their false and anti-religious activities. In case of any violations and their resistance, they should be dealt with seriously in order to be a lesson for others.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:269" rel="footnote">[footnote 269]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.9.6 The Jurist reported on 24 November 2021 on an appeal for help made by President of the Afghanistan Independent Bar Association (AIBA), Rohullah Qarizada, who said that, on 23 November, ‘“fifty armed Taliban came in AIBA and forcibly took over Bar.” The Jurist added ‘The incursion occurred… in the wake of a Taliban cabinet directive authorizing the Ministry of Justice to strip the AIBA of its lawyer licensing authority and vest that instead in the Ministry.’ According to the Jurist, ‘… before the Taliban takeover, the Association had more than 2,500 registered lawyers practicing in the Afghan courts.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:270" rel="footnote">[footnote 270]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.9.7 A lawyer in Kabul gave the Jurist an eyewitness account of the raid, which occurred when he went to the AIBA office to renew his license. He said that the Taliban demanded entry and once inside searched the offices and evicted everyone inside. When a colleague protested the invasion, the lawyer said the Taliban made threatening remarks, saying ‘“It is enough for you that we do not kill you now.”’ The lawyer added ‘all the lawyers information is in databases and files, and they can easily access that information. This access and identification of the lawyers is a serious risk for all of us.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:271" rel="footnote">[footnote 271]</a></sup></p>

<p>‘Similar reports have emerged on social media of young Afghan men being targeted for wearing T-shirts.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:273" rel="footnote">[footnote 273]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.10.3 A video dated 9 September 2021 of clothes merchants in Kabul, posted by the South China Morning Post (SCMP) on 11 September, indicated a rise in the purchase of traditional clothing, whilst the sale of jeans and t-shirts had fallen since the Taliban takeover.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:274" rel="footnote">[footnote 274]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.10.4 Reporting on life in Kabul following the Taliban takeover, and questioning whether the harsh laws under previous Taliban rule would be imposed, Al Jazeera noted on 29 September 2021 that ‘young men still play cricket and watch traditional wrestling matches in the city’s Chaman-e-Hozori Park. Under their previous rule, the Taliban banned many sports, but so far have not done so this time.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:275" rel="footnote">[footnote 275]</a></sup> Women’s sports have been banned.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:276" rel="footnote">[footnote 276]</a></sup><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:277" rel="footnote">[footnote 277]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.10.5 Al Jazeera noted that in beauty salons, ‘some advertisements on the windows had been defaced or covered to scratch out images of women, but some of the ads were untouched.’ According to Al Jazeera, some women were seen wearing longer coats and headscarves, or the burqa, and fewer men were wearing Western dress, ‘Government employees were the ones who most often wore Western-style clothes, and they have now switched over to the traditional shalwar-kameez combination of long shirt and baggy pants.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:278" rel="footnote">[footnote 278]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.10.7 On 17 November 2021, the AAN reported on the Taliban’s unofficial ban on music, noting:</p>

<p>‘Until the eve of the Taleban’s takeover, the impression was that traditional Afghan music would be tolerated and that their censorship would largely affect more modern forms of music and instruments… In December 2020, a Taleban representative reportedly told a delegate representing the media at the Doha peace talks that “they wanted [the western-style music competition television show] Afghan Star closed down for good”…</p>

<p>‘However, a clearer glimpse of their future attitudes to music emerged once they consolidated their hold on towns which fell during their 2021 spring-summer offensive. In Balkh, for example, which they captured on 21 June, the Taleban implemented a ban on music. Local radio stations were only allowed to play religious chants and men caught listening to music in the bazaar were reportedly subjected to corporal punishments….</p>

<p>‘The days following the fall of the Republic on 15 August were marked by the destruction of musical instruments, either as a political message or acts of vandalism… Music shops across the country were closed down within days and have remained so ever since.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:280" rel="footnote">[footnote 280]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.10.8 Gandhara reported on 29 November 2021 that ‘Afghans across the country have complained that Taliban fighters are prying into the personal photos and videos, contacts, and social media accounts on their smartphones. The presence of music or videos that the Taliban deems to be violating its strict moral code has often led to harassment and violence, residents said. In many cases, Taliban fighters have confiscated, broken, or erased data from smartphones.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:281" rel="footnote">[footnote 281]</a></sup> Gandhara referred to 2 incidences in which men were beaten following Taliban searches of their phones.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:282" rel="footnote">[footnote 282]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.10.9 The Taliban denied the allegations, although in a speech on 23 November 2021, Gandhara reported that ‘Mufti Lutfullah Hakimi, the head of a Taliban commission established to weed out “undesirable” individuals within the group’s ranks, rejected that denial’, as he questioned why people’s privacy was being infringed upon.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:283" rel="footnote">[footnote 283]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.10.10 On 27 November 2021, the Jurist cited its staff correspondent in Kabul, who said ‘local media are reporting that the Taliban connected to the Ministry of Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice have examined people on whether or not they can and know how to pray in Uruzgan province. This ministry – in that province – have announced that people who do not wish to learn daily prayers will be punished.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:284" rel="footnote">[footnote 284]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.10.11 On 6 December 2021, AVA reported that the Taliban seized 800 litres of alcohol in the province of Parwan and 10 sellers were arrested.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:285" rel="footnote">[footnote 285]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.10.13 In its ‘Afghanistan: Country Focus’, dated January 2022, EASO referred to persons seeking asylum or living abroad, noting:</p>

<p>‘According to an Afghan human rights expert, there was a negative narrative on Afghans that had left Afghanistan among Taliban sympathizers and some Taliban segments. According to the source, people who had left were seen as not having any Islamic values or being on the run from things they have done. On the other hand, the Taliban have prioritised passports for Afghan labours [sic] working abroad as that would mean an income for the country. So, on one level the Taliban might understand the economic aspect, but on another level, know that many abroad disagree with them.</p>

<p>‘An Afghan law professor described two narratives of the Taliban on persons leaving Afghanistan to live in Western countries. In one narrative the Taliban said that people flee due to poverty and that it has nothing to do with any fear of the Taliban, but life is better economically in the West. The other narrative was about the elites that left: they were not seen as “Afghans”, but as corrupt “puppets” of the “occupation”, opposed to the population. They were said to have no “roots” in Afghanistan, so as soon as “the foreigners” left, they took this group with them. This narrative could also include, for example, activists, media workers and intellectuals, and not only former government officials. According to the source the Taliban often said that a “good Muslim” would not leave and that many who left for the West were not “good enough Muslims”.</p>

<p>‘Dr. Andrea Chiovenda and Dr. Melissa Kerr Chiovenda, anthropologists at Zayed University, described a similar narrative that people who wants to leave are not “the right kind of person” and not perceived as “good Muslims”. However, they separated the tradition of Pashtun men going abroad for periods to work, which is a long tradition, from other Afghans who go away and stay in non-Muslim countries – which is not “the right way to do it”. They further stated that in rural Pashtun areas a person wanting to leave for Europe or the US would in general be perceived with suspicion, and even persons having Western contacts.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:287" rel="footnote">[footnote 287]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.10.14 The EASO report also cited Austrian newspaper Kronen Zeitung, which published an interview on 30 August 2021 with Taliban spokesperson Zabihulla Mujahid, which stated, ‘When asked whether Afghan asylum seekers in Germany or Austria with rejected asylum claims and who had possibly also committed crimes would be accepted back into the country, Mujahid replied that they would be accepted if deported, and presented to a court to decide on how to proceed.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:288" rel="footnote">[footnote 288]</a></sup> The EASO report added ‘It was not clear whether Mujahid referred to returnees in general or only returnees who had committed crimes in this statement.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:289" rel="footnote">[footnote 289]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.11.2 On 10 September 2021, Spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ravina Shamdasani, called on the Taliban to ‘cease the use of force towards, and the arbitrary detention of, those exercising their right to peaceful assembly and the journalists covering the protests.’ The call came in light protests that had been taking place since the Taliban takeover and the increasingly violent response by the Taliban.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:290" rel="footnote">[footnote 290]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.11.3 In the press briefing, Shamdasani said:</p>

<p>‘From 15 to 19 August, people gathered in Nangarhar and Kunar provinces to mark national flag-raising ceremonies. According to credible reports, during these three days when protests took place, the Taliban reportedly killed a man and a boy, and injured eight others, when firing in an apparent attempt to disperse the crowds. On Tuesday this week (7 September), during a protest in Herat, the Taliban reportedly shot and killed two men and wounded seven more. That same day in Kabul, credible reports indicate that the Taliban beat and detained protesters, including several women and up to 15 journalists.’ On 8 September the Taliban issued an instruction banning unauthorised assemblies.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:291" rel="footnote">[footnote 291]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.11.5 On 27 September 2021, BBC News reported that, ‘Before the Taliban took power in Afghanistan last month, there were numerous influential social media users in the country who were strong opponents of the group’s policies. But since 15 August, Afghans have been deleting photos and tweets from their past - and many have turned away from social media altogether for fear of being targeted by Taliban forces.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:292" rel="footnote">[footnote 292]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.11.6 Hasht-e Subh Daily reported on 7 November 2021 on what appeared to be a revenge killing, noting that ‘Sources in Takhar told Hasht-e Subh that a young man had been shot dead by a Taliban commander. According to locals, the man had a record of joining the public uprising forces against the Taliban in the province. According to sources, the young man, named Nematullah, had killed the Taliban commander’s son in the past.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:293" rel="footnote">[footnote 293]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.11.7 On 11 November 2021, AVA reported that a 19 year old man was shot by the Taliban for listening to music in a village in Badakhshan.

<p>6.11.8 Gandhara reported on 3 December 2021 on the alleged torture and murder of a Facebook user who criticised the Taliban in a Facebook post. The report noted ‘Taliban fighters detained Naweed Azami after he made a Facebook post criticizing the militant group. Three days after he was taken into custody, the 30-year-old’s body was found along a riverbank on the outskirts of the southern Afghan city of Lashkar Gah. The Taliban claimed that Azami escaped detention. But his family has accused the militant group of torturing and killing him.’ The Taliban said the death was being investigated.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:295" rel="footnote">[footnote 295]</a></sup></p>
