<h2>Information for personnel who have received an assignment order to a <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot site</h2>

<p>Once you are assigned with a report for duty date at a <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> Pilot site you will have new range of accommodation choices. This means that you will be able to plan and move in smoothly in advance of your start date.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> Pilot sites</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Her majesty's naval base">HMNB</abbr> Clyde</li>
  <li>Aldershot Garrison</li>
  <li>RAF Wittering</li>
</ul>

<p>A summary of the steps you will need to take are listed below.  Detailed information on these steps is provided in the sections that follow:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Consider your options. Watch the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> video to learn more, or read up on the individual options.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Submit your Accommodation Preference Form in <abbr title="joint personnel administration">JPA</abbr>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Once your accommodation type is confirmed, you’ll be informed of the steps you’ll need to follow.</p>

<p>If you have questions about what to do, you can email the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> Cell at the pilot site you are joining:</p>

<ul>
  <li>

</ul>

<p>You can also talk to your chain of command, to the local Army HIVE, RAF HIVE or Naval Service Family and People Support (NS-FPS) at the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot site you are joining.</p>

<p>If you are already assigned to a <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot site and are happy with your current accommodation choice, then you do not need to do anything. If you wish to apply to change your current accommodation read on to find further information on what to do, and the support available.</p>

<h2>What is happening as part of the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot</h2>

<p>The Ministry of Defence (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>) has been looking at how it can improve the accommodation offer for service personnel (<abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr>), to make it fairer and more flexible, whilst keeping it affordable for the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>. Starting in September 2019, the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> decided to pilot a new way of providing living accommodation to personnel and their families. The <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot will test the new policy, the way it is delivered to personnel, and what accommodation options they prefer. A decision will be made about whether to roll out <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> across the UK after the pilot is complete.</p>

<p>The current accommodation system was developed many years ago and we know it works well for some people. However, there are a number of reasons why we think it needs to change:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the current accommodation model does not support how some personnel want to live, meaning that some have no choice but to opt out of subsidised accommodation</li>
  <li>the current system is based in part on rank, rather than need, for example, the size of a service person’s family</li>
  <li>the current accommodation system has large overheads and an increasing need for repairs. It is also inefficient, as large numbers of houses are kept empty to allow personnel to move around</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide more choice to more personnel over where, how, and with whom you live</li>
  <li>provide you with an accommodation subsidy based on your need, rather than rank or relationship status</li>
  <li>enable you to remain mobile, while also providing support if you want greater stability for yourself and/or your family</li>
</ul>

<p>A decision will be taken in 2022 on whether to extend <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> across the rest of the UK. If a decision is taken to develop a different accommodation policy to <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr>, there will be continuity for personnel who are already receiving <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> accommodation allowances.  Personnel on the pilot will receive allowances for an additional three years, or until they are assigned from the pilot site (whichever is the sooner). Thereafter <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> will be informed of future accommodation policy.</p>

<h2>Sites piloting <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr>
</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot is taking place across 3 sites in the UK with a limited number of personnel and units invited to take part. The pilot will enable the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> to test the proposed policy and gather feedback from personnel so that improvements can be made to the final policy.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot launched on 30 September 2019 and will run for approximately 3 years. The sites taking part in the pilot have been selected by the front-line commands (FLCs) and endorsed by their boards.</p>

<h2>What you need to do</h2>

<h3>If you are already based at a <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot site</h3>

<p>If you are already assigned to a <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot site and are happy with your Single Living Accommodation (<abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr>) or Service Families Accommodation (<abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>) accommodation choice, then you do not need to do anything.  You will continue to receive and pay for your current accommodation as you do today.</p>

<p>If you are considering changing your accommodation choice, or if you already rent in the private sector, there are steps you will need to take. Detailed information on these steps is provided in the sections that follow.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Confirm you are eligible for <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider your accommodation options and transitional protection status, if relevant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Submit your accommodation preference form, if you want to change to <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>, <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr>, want to rent in the private market, are buying a home at a Pilot site, are a homeowner away from a Pilot site (weekly commute) or already rent.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Once your accommodation preference is confirmed, you will be informed of the steps you need to follow.</p>

<p>Please note that when you choose to change your accommodation due to personal preference and are not required by the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> to move, any costs incurred including removals, will need to be met by you. . This applies if you decide to change your current accommodation at the start of the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot. This would be considered a mid-tour move therefore you would not be eligible for <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> funding (unless you are already based at the pilot site and opt to purchase your own home during the pilot).</p>

<h4>If you are assigned to a <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot site</h4>

<p>Please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/future-accommodation-model-what-you-need-to-know/what-you-need-to-know-about-fam#information-for-personnel-who-have-received-an-assignment-order-to-a-fam-pilot-site">Information for personnel who have received an assignment order to a <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot site</a> for details on your options and what to do next.</p>

<h3>Check if <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> applies to you</h3>

<h4>Eligibility for the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot</h4>

<p>You are eligible for <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> if <strong>all</strong> of the following apply to you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are in Regular or Full Time Reserve Service (Full Commitment) and are in or assigned to an eligible unit based at a pilot site (eligible UIN list is available on the Defence Intranet)</li>
  <li>you have 1 year of service with the military</li>
  <li>you have 6 months or more left on your posting at that pilot site</li>
  <li>and you have a Report for Duty Date before 31 March 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Available accommodation options</h2>

<p>The table below provides a high level summary of the accommodation options available under the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot. Further detail on each option is provided in the sections below.</p>

      <td>Availability will vary by location. You will   receive a rental payment to enable you to rent a property equivalent to the <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>   you need, at broadly the same cost. The rental payment you receive will   depend on individual circumstances. You can also get a loan from <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> to cover deposit and  expenses related to finding a property  if you are moving into the <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr>, or moving property within the <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr>. Note: This is not available for social housing.</td>
      <td>You may receive financial support towards   maintaining your own home depending on eligibility. You might receive a   payment towards your regular mortgage payments, and could receive other   support (such as refund of legal expenses). You can also make use of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/forces-help-to-buy">Forces Help to Buy</a>.        If you currently rent your home you may also be   eligible for support, depending how far from the pilot site your home is.</td>
    </tr>

</table>

<p>Your choice of preferred accommodation option might be affected by one or more of the following:</p>

<h4>Long term relationships</h4>

<p>Under the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot, personnel in an established long term relationship (<abbr title="established long term relationship">LTR(E)</abbr>) will be entitled to, rather than eligible for, subsidised accommodation. In other areas, that are not part of the pilot, the entitlement extends to surplus accommodation only.</p>

<p>In line with current policy, you will need to register your <abbr title="established long term relationship">LTR(E)</abbr> on <abbr title="joint personnel administration">JPA</abbr> and have it verified by unit <abbr title="human resources">HR</abbr> for it to be approved. This will enable your <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> payments to be calculated correctly. Details of what a qualifying LTR is can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-464-tri-service-accommodation-regulations-tsars"><abbr title="Joint Service Publication">JSP</abbr> 464, Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter 1</a>.</p>

<h4>Entitled children</h4>

<p>If you are eligible for accommodation at a <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot site and have children living with either you or an <abbr title="established long term relationship">LTR(E)</abbr> partner that are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>under 18 years old</li>
  <li>or 24 years or under and in full-time education at a school, college or university</li>
</ul>

<p>and are resident with you for over 80 nights per calendar year, then you may be entitled to additional accommodation support. Full details on the eligibility of child dependants can be found in  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-464-tri-service-accommodation-regulations-tsars"><abbr title="Joint Service Publication">JSP</abbr> 464, Volume 4, Chapter 1, Section III</a>.</p>

<p>Whilst personnel are still allowed to have nannies or au-pairs, they will not qualify as dependants under <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr>, meaning you would need to contribute extra to cover the additional bedroom(s) required	.</p>

<p>You will need to register your qualifying dependants on <abbr title="joint personnel administration">JPA</abbr> for them to be recognised and included in your <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> payments. This should be done prior to submitting an accommodation preference form (<abbr title="accommodation preference form">APF</abbr>).</p>

<h4>Adaptations</h4>

<p>If you require physical adaptations, adapted <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> and <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> will always be provided as an option under the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot. These adaptions will be made at a cost to <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>, as per current policy.</p>

<p>If you choose to live in the <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr>, physical adaptation requirements will not be funded by the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> and will be your responsibility to source through the local authority or other organisation.  You should therefore be mindful of the adaptations you require and search for a property that supports your needs.</p>

<h3>Single Living Accommodation (<abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> will continue to be available for all personnel eligible under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-464-tri-service-accommodation-regulations-tsars"><abbr title="Joint Service Publication">JSP</abbr> 464</a>. If you are already based at a pilot site and already live in <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr>, you do not need to take any further action. To apply for <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> you will need to fill out an <abbr title="accommodation preference form">APF</abbr>. In the event that there is no available <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> at your <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot site, you will be offered Substitute Service Single Accommodation (<abbr title="substitute service single acommodation">SSSA</abbr>).</p>

<p>If you currently own or rent your own home or plan to purchase a house under the pilot and are in receipt of Get You Home (Travel) (GYH(T)), you will receive a ‘core payment’ in place of your <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> waiver for <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> in the working week (but those already on site will need to opt in).</p>

<p>Note that there are exceptions to this, please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-464-tri-service-accommodation-regulations-tsars"><abbr title="Joint Service Publication">JSP</abbr> 464 Volume 4, Chapter II, Section IV</a> for further details.</p>

<h3>Service Family Accommodation (<abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>)</h3>

<p>If you are already based at a pilot site and already live in <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>, you do not need to take any further action and can continue living there during the pilot.</p>

<p>If you are moving to a <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot site and wish to express a preference for <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> (removals and disturbance paid for), or if you are already at a pilot site and wish to move from your current accommodation into <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> (at your own expense) you will be required to fill in an <abbr title="accommodation preference form">APF</abbr> selecting <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> as your preference. If your <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> preference is assessed and confirmed by your local <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> Cell you will then be able to request an <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> property at, above, or below eligibility in line with current accommodation policy for <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The following rules apply when requesting <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> as part of the pilot:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if under current policy you are entitled to <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>, you can request <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> under the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot by completing an <abbr title="accommodation preference form">APF</abbr> and the existing accommodation policy <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-464-tri-service-accommodation-regulations-tsars">(<abbr title="Joint Service Publication">JSP</abbr> 464 Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter III)</a> rules will apply</li>
  <li>if you are single but have entitled children you are eligible to request <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>if you are single (not in an established long-term relationship) with no entitled children you are not eligible to request <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-464-tri-service-accommodation-regulations-tsars"><abbr title="Joint Service Publication">JSP</abbr> 464, Volume 4, Annex G</a> for further information on eligibility for those in LTR(E)s to <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you select <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> as your preference on your <abbr title="accommodation preference form">APF</abbr> and the type of <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> you require:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is available; you <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> choice will be confirmed by the local <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> cell. You may also request <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> 1-up, or 1-down, dependent on availability</li>
  <li>has limited availability; your preference will be confirmed on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with the current <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> allocation team as per the current process</li>
  <li>not available; you will be directed to look for accommodation in the private rental sector</li>
</ul>

<h4>Transitional protection (<abbr title="transitional protection">TP</abbr>)</h4>

<p>Under <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr>, accommodation will be provided according to your need, rather than relationship status or rank. As a result, some personnel will receive an increase, and some will experience an overall reduction in the accommodation offer they receive.</p>

<p>Personnel experiencing a reduction will be eligible for <abbr title="transitional protection">TP</abbr>. If this applies to you, you will be eligible for the same type of <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>, where available, at a pilot site in line with current policy. If <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> is not available, you will be eligible for a Rental Payment to enable you to rent a property in the <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr> broadly equivalent to your current <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> entitlement.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please note that TP will only apply if you request SFA or SLA as your preference at a FAM pilot site. If you choose another accommodation type as your preference, TP will not apply and your accommodation subsidy will be based on FAM entitlement levels for that accommodation type.</p>
</div>

<p>Further information on eligibility for <abbr title="transitional protection">TP</abbr> can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-464-tri-service-accommodation-regulations-tsars"><abbr title="Joint Service Publication">JSP</abbr> 464, Volume 4, Chapter 1, Section IV</a>.</p>

<h3>The Private Rental Sector (<abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Many Service personnel have been living in the <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr> for years, but now support is available to help them, as well as those who would also like to make this move. Under this option, the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> will provide a level of financial support to enable you to rent a property that meets your needs which is broadly comparable to <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>.</p>

<p>You can rent a home on your own, with friends, your partner or family.</p>

<p>The payments you will receive will be based on the location of your property, your relationship status, the number of registered entitled children you have and the average cost of housing equivalent to <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> at the location of your pilot site. New renters can also access allowances to help with securing a rental property.</p>

<p>Each pilot site has a <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> Cell who can provide support. Under special circumstances, for example if you are serving overseas or deployed on operations, further support is available.</p>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-464-tri-service-accommodation-regulations-tsars"><abbr title="Joint Service Publication">JSP</abbr> 464, Volume 4, Chapter II, Section VI</a> for further information.</p>

<p>The following conditions apply when applying for the <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in order to be eligible for financial support under the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot, your <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr> property needs approval as a Residence at Work Address (<abbr title="residence at work address">RWA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>you can choose where you want to live provided it is in line with home to duty regulations and within a specified distance as set out in the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> policy. Full details can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-464-tri-service-accommodation-regulations-tsars"><abbr title="Joint Service Publication">JSP</abbr> 464, Volume 4, Chapter 2, Section I</a>
</li>
  <li>you can choose to share a home with someone who does not qualify as partner or dependant under the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot. However, if you are required to move for duty reasons, <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> will only cover the cost of your share of the tenancy costs, and you will need to make your own arrangements with those you choose to live with when it is time for you to move out (it’s important they are aware of the consequences for them if you are required to move for service reasons).</li>
  <li>you cannot claim <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> payments for renting a home that you have previously owned. Whether you owned this alone or with a spouse, civil partner or someone you were in a recognised <abbr title="established long term relationship">LTR(E)</abbr> with</li>
  <li>you cannot claim <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> payments to rent a room in a property where the landlord is resident. You must have a tenancy agreement with your name on it to claim your <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> payments. This means lodging tenancy agreements and lodging licences are excluded from the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> policy</li>
  <li>if you choose to live with another <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> then the rental payment will be split between the two of you</li>
</ul>

<p>Please refer to the <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr> section of this website for further information on selecting, living in, and moving out of your home.</p>

<h3>Home ownership</h3>

<h4>Currently own a home</h4>

<p>If you currently maintain your own home you may continue to do so under <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr>.</p>

<p>The support you are eligible for will depend on how far from the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot site your home is located.  If you are eligible for <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> at your pilot site you will receive a core payment towards maintaining your home if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are already maintaining your own home, as your selected place of residence which is more than the specified distance, as set out in the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> policy, from your assigned <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot site. If your home is less than the specified distance then you will not receive a <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> core payment.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you receive a core payment to maintain your own home this will be in place of any <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> waiver you receive today for the duration of your assignment to the pilot site. Further information on eligibility for the maintain own home option can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-464-tri-service-accommodation-regulations-tsars"><abbr title="Joint Service Publication">JSP</abbr> 464, Volume 4, Chapter 5</a>.</p>

<p>Note: If you already own a home outside the specified distance and want to receive the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> core payment, you will need to submit an Accommodation Preference Form, followed by taking your legal paperwork to Unit <abbr title="human resources">HR</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Buying a home</h4>

<p>You have the choice to buy a new home, whether you are single or in a relationship. If you are eligible for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/forces-help-to-buy">Forces Help to Buy</a>, you can also choose to make use of this scheme in line with current policy.</p>

<p>If you are eligible for <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> at your pilot site you will receive a Core Payment towards your home if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you buy a new home, within 50 miles of the assigned pilot site, as a residence at work address (<abbr title="residence at work address">RWA</abbr>) (Note: If you purchased your home before your assigned pilot site went live and you live within 50 miles of your assigned pilot site, you will not receive a <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> payment)</li>
  <li>you buy a new home, greater than 50 miles away from the pilot site, as a selected place of residence</li>
</ul>

<p>If you receive a core payment to maintain your own home this will be in place of any <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> waiver you receive today for the duration of your assignment to the pilot site. Further information on eligibility for the maintain own home option can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-464-tri-service-accommodation-regulations-tsars"><abbr title="Joint Service Publication">JSP</abbr> 464, Volume 4, Chapter 5</a>.</p>

<p>If you choose to buy a home as part of the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot, you will need to complete an Accommodation Preference Form and take your legal paperwork to Unit <abbr title="human resources">HR</abbr> to initiate the Core Payment. Talk to your <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> Cell to find out more.</p>

<p>If you choose to buy your own home when you are already living at a pilot site, you will be entitled to a funded move.</p>

<p>If you choose to buy your first home when you have been assigned to a <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot site, you will also be entitled to a payment to help towards the costs of legal expenses and legal fees incurred when buying a home. Refund of legal expenses (new buyer) (<abbr title="refund of legal expenses (new buyer)">RLE (NB)</abbr>) is a reimbursement payment for actual receipted costs paid to a solicitor or conveyancing legal professional. The payment is capped at £1,500 and can only be claimed on completion of the house purchase.</p>

<h2>Submitting your <abbr title="accommodation preference form">APF</abbr> and what happens next</h2>

<p>Once you know you are eligible for <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> and have decided on your preferred accommodation, or if you are eligible for <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> and are already renting in the private sector, you will be required to complete and submit an Accommodation Preference Form (<abbr title="accommodation preference form">APF</abbr>) via <abbr title="joint personnel administration">JPA</abbr>. The form will ask for your preferred accommodation, alongside details of your role, assignment, and personal details that impact your accommodation requirements and eligibility. There will be a free text box to capture any additional support requirements. If you are unsure how to complete this box, please speak to your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.army.mod.uk/people/support-well/hive/" rel="external">local Army HIVE</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.raf.mod.uk/serving-families/hive-finder/" rel="external">RAF HIVE</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/community-and-support/advice-and-support" rel="external">NS-FPS</a>.</p>

<p>It’s important that you are accurate and honest in completing this section, the information is needed to make sure that decisions can be made in an informed and fair way. All information provided will be treated in confidence. Your local <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> Cell for the relevant pilot site will then review your details and respond within 5 working days. You will be notified of this decision via <abbr title="joint personnel administration">JPA</abbr>. This is confirmation of your accommodation preference, for example <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr>, <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>, <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr>, and is not confirmation of an address. The <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> Cell response will include relevant links and information should you have any questions about the decision, and there is more information on next steps in this section below.</p>

<p>If you highlight a need for additional support, for example welfare needs, the local <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> Cell will verify this with your stated welfare team and/or your chain of command, and will take this into consideration when deciding on the most suitable accommodation to meet your needs, as well as your preferences and any other key factors.</p>

<p>Wherever possible, you will be supported to live in your preferred accommodation, however sometimes your preference may not be available.</p>

<p>Next immediate steps once preference is confirmed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>: you will need to complete and submit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-infrastructure-organisation-service-family-accommodation#applying-for-and-allocation-of-sfa"><abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> application form e1132</a> as per the current process. You will then receive an offer of a property from <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> via the industry partner within 15 working days in line with current timelines</li>
  <li>moving to the <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr>: you can apply for relevant <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> advances and once you have found a property, will need to bring your signed tenancy agreement to Unit <abbr title="human resources">HR</abbr> to receive your <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> rental payment. Further detail is provided in the payments and advances section</li>
  <li>already renting in the <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr>: you will need to bring your signed tenancy agreement, which pre-dates the start of the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot at your site, to Unit <abbr title="human resources">HR</abbr> to receive your <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> payment. Further detail is provided in the payments section.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr>: you can apply for <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> through current processes.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have chosen to buy a home or you’re currently living in a home you already own, you will need to submit an accommodation preference form. Speak to your local <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> Cell to confirm your eligibility for <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> payments, find out how you can apply for these, and the documents you will need to provide. You can also read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-464-tri-service-accommodation-regulations-tsars"><abbr title="Joint Service Publication">JSP</abbr> 464, Volume 4, Chapter 5</a>.</p>

<h4>Changes in your personal circumstance</h4>

<p>If your circumstances change you may be required to complete another <abbr title="accommodation preference form">APF</abbr>. You should discuss changes in circumstances with the local <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> Cell as soon as possible to ensure they have up to date information on your accommodation needs and entitlement, and ensure your <abbr title="joint personnel administration">JPA</abbr> record is updated to receive all relevant payments. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-464-tri-service-accommodation-regulations-tsars"><abbr title="Joint Service Publication">JSP</abbr> 464, Volume 4, Chapter 2, Section IX</a> provides details on different types of changes in circumstances and whether <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> will fund your move.</p>

<h2>Payments and advances</h2>

<p>This section outlines the payments and advances available to you. Final payments and allowances provided may vary depending on individual circumstances and eligibility for additional support. If you are ultimately allocated <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> or <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> under the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot, current charges, payments and allowances will apply.</p>

<h4>Payments for the private rental sector</h4>

<p>If your preference to live in the private rental sector is confirmed by the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> Cell, the following payments apply to you:</p>

<h4>The <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> rental payment</h4>

<p>This is a regular payment towards the cost of your rent, and is made up of two parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the core payment: this is a standard fixed sum payment made to eligible personnel on pilot sites. All renters will receive the core payment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the geographical payment, this varies based on your location and will be adjusted based on the number of eligible children. It also includes an adjustment to reflect the cost of council tax in the area. Renters living within 50 miles of the pilot site will receive this payment too</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-464-tri-service-accommodation-regulations-tsars"><abbr title="Joint Service Publication">JSP</abbr> 464, Volume 4, Annex I</a> for more detail.</p>

<p>In addition to your <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> rental payment you will need to contribute towards your rent. This is your personal contribution. This will be broadly equivalent to the charge required to live in a comparable <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> property at <abbr title="Combined Accommodations and Assessment System">CAAS</abbr> Band B.</p>

<p>You can choose a property that costs more than the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> rental payment you are eligible to receive however; you will have to cover the additional cost yourself through an increased personal contribution. You may also choose a property which has a lower value than the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> rental payment you are eligible to receive. In this event, both your rental payment and expected personal contribution would be reduced. This is called gainshare which ensures any savings made are shared between you and the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>.</p>

<p>For more information on how the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> rental payment is calculated and gainshare, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-464-tri-service-accommodation-regulations-tsars"><abbr title="Joint Service Publication">JSP</abbr> 464, Volume 4, Chapter 2, Section III</a>.</p>

<p>In order to receive the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> rental payment, you will need to provide unit <abbr title="human resources">HR</abbr> at the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot site with a copy of your signed tenancy agreement. Unit <abbr title="human resources">HR</abbr> may also wish to see evidence that are covered by transitional protection if relevant, for example a copy of your <abbr title="accommodation preference form">APF</abbr>. Unit <abbr title="human resources">HR</abbr> will then update <abbr title="joint personnel administration">JPA</abbr> and confirm the rental payment you will receive. Your monthly salary will be adjusted to include this rental payment value. You are responsible for paying your landlord, the monies will not be deducted from your pay.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> section of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://discovermybenefits.mod.gov.uk/" rel="external">Discover My Benefits (<abbr title="Discover my benefits tool">DMB</abbr>)</a> website will help you estimate your total <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> rental payment based on your individual circumstances.</p>

<h4>Advances for the private rental sector</h4>

<p>There are also financial advances available to help you with the upfront costs of securing a property. These advances are available if you are moving into the <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr> for the first time, or once you are in the <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr> if you are moving from one <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr> property to another. The Discover My Benefits (<abbr title="Discover my benefits tool">DMB</abbr>) tool can also be used to estimate the total advance amount you may receive.</p>

<h4>Deposit and 1 month’s rent advance (repaid at end of tenancy)</h4>

<p>It is normal to pay a deposit for a property in the <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr> in order to secure it. This is generally equal to between 5 and 8 weeks rent. In addition, the first month’s rent may be requested before the move in date. These payments are required before, or when, the tenancy agreement is signed.</p>

<p>If you believe you may need financial support to meet these upfront costs and you are moving into the <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr> for the first time, or moving property within the <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr>, you can apply for a deposit and a 1 month rent advance from the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> before beginning your new property search. This will ensure that you have the funds available to secure a property at the earliest opportunity. The deposit and 1 month rent advance is available in the form of a salary advance because you will apply for and receive this before you find a property:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you may be given more money than you end up needing to cover the final deposit amount. If this happens, once you have paid your deposit and first month’s rent any extra amount will be recovered through payroll</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you may request less than you end up needing. You’ll be responsible for covering the shortfall upfront, but this shortfall will be addressed by an additional deposit and one month’s rent amount delivered through payroll</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://discovermybenefits.mod.gov.uk/" rel="external">Discover My Benefits Tool</a> can help you in estimating the amount of deposit and upfront rent you are likely to need. We know that working out the amount of advance to apply for isn’t easy. Your <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> Cell can help to advise on how much to apply for based on the local area. If you apply for more than you need, be aware that you will need to pay this back.</p>

<p>Once your iExpense request for a deposit and 1 month’s rent advance has been processed, you will receive your advance within 3 working days and can begin your property search. You will have 90 days within which to find accommodation. Once you have secured a property you will need to take your tenancy agreement to unit <abbr title="human resources">HR</abbr> which will provide details on the final deposit requirements. At this point, unit <abbr title="human resources">HR</abbr> will update <abbr title="joint personnel administration">JPA</abbr> with the exact details of the deposit and if relevant immediately recover any excess amount paid to you via payroll.</p>

<p>If you request and receive a deposit and 1 month’s rent advance and have not presented a tenancy agreement to unit <abbr title="human resources">HR</abbr> within a 3 month time frame, the full amount you received will be recovered. If you have extenuating circumstances that have prevented you from securing a property within this time frame, please ensure you speak to your local <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> Cell as soon as possible so appropriate action can be taken.</p>

<p>If you find yourself in a position where you have to pay rent for 2 different properties for a period of time and therefore experience an overlap in rental accommodation cost, you will be permitted to request a second deposit and 1 month’s rent advance for the second <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr> property.</p>

<p>The amount that you paid your landlord/agency for deposit and first month’s rent will be recovered from you by <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> at the end of your tenancy, once you have received your deposit back. You have the option to repay this earlier if you wish, talk to unit <abbr title="human resources">HR</abbr> to find out more.</p>

<h4>Rental advance (repaid monthly)</h4>

<p>You can apply for a rental advance in addition to your deposit and 1 month’s rent advance, if you are moving into the <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr> for the first time, or moving property within the <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr>. You can apply for a rental advance for up to 6 months rent in advance to help secure your rental property. This may be for reasons such as, but not limited to; short notice assignments, <abbr title="joint personnel administration">JPA</abbr> processing times, payroll submission deadlines which would result in the rental payment not reaching you in time to commence payment of rent. If you are unable to secure a tenancy agreement without a guarantor, you can also request a rental advance in lieu of a guarantor, subject to this being accepted by their landlord or rental agency.</p>

<p>Your tenancy agreement will provide information on the start date of your tenancy and your monthly rental amount which will inform the rental advance you are eligible for. Once approved, your rental advance will be processed via <abbr title="joint personnel administration">JPA</abbr> and you will receive the full rental advance within 3 working days.</p>

<p>The rental advance amount will be repaid to the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> from your monthly pay. The recovery process will be deferred until 3 months after the date you applied for the rental advance. The monthly amount deducted from your pay will be subject to minimum drawing rate regulations and will be a maximum of 1 month’s rent. For example, if you ask for 3 months advance, you will repay the sum borrowed over 3 months. You have the option to repay this earlier if you wish, talk to your unit <abbr title="human resources">HR</abbr> to find out more.</p>

<h4>Expenses relating to sourcing a property</h4>

<p>You are entitled to up to 7 days leave when sourcing a property in the <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr>, if you are moving into the <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr> for the first time. In this instance you can also claim reasonable expenses incurred, for example travel and subsistence when searching for your property for 4 of these 7 days. Transaction costs payable for each qualifying move are limited. For more detail on sourcing costs, including which moves qualify for this provision, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-464-tri-service-accommodation-regulations-tsars"><abbr title="Joint Service Publication">JSP</abbr> 464, Volume 4, Chapter 2, Section V</a>.</p>

<h4>Early Surrender Relief</h4>

<p>Early Surrender Relief (<abbr title="Early surrender relief">ESR</abbr>) covers any contractual rental costs you incur, whether you are already renting or new to the <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr>, when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are given an assignment order which doesn’t give you enough time to inform your landlord or agency within the notice period required by your tenancy agreement</li>
  <li>the assignment date falls within the month and you are required to make a full month’s payment for that month</li>
</ul>

<p>You can apply for <abbr title="Early surrender relief">ESR</abbr> via an iExpense. For more information on <abbr title="Early surrender relief">ESR</abbr> please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-464-tri-service-accommodation-regulations-tsars"><abbr title="Joint Service Publication">JSP</abbr> 464, Volume 4, Chapter 2, Section V</a>.</p>

<h4>Accommodation cost overlap</h4>

<p>You are eligible for accommodation cost overlap, whether you are already renting or new to the <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr>, if you receive an assignment order requiring you to move and are you are unable to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>align the termination of your existing tenancy agreement with the start of a tenancy agreement on a new property</li>

</ul>

<p>Accommodation cost overlap is provided to enable service personnel to maintain 2 <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr> properties for a period of up to 1 month (or up to 3 months for schooling requirements). Accommodation cost overlap is not provided if you choose to move from the <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr> into a home you have purchased. You may require chain of command approval to receive accommodation cost overlap.</p>

<h4>Payments and advances for home ownership</h4>

<p>If you currently own a home or want to rent a home more than 50 miles from your <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot site, you are eligible for the core payment. This is a standard fixed sum payment made to eligible personnel on pilot sites. If you currently own a home you will receive the core payment instead of your <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> waiver.</p>

<p>If you choose to buy a home anywhere in the UK after the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot has begun, you are also eligible for the core payment. Additionally, if you are a New Buyer (NB), you will be entitled to a payment to help towards the costs of legal expenses and legal fees incurred when buying a home. <abbr title="refund of legal expenses (new buyer)">RLE (NB)</abbr> is a reimbursement payment for actual receipted costs paid to a solicitor or conveyancing legal professional. The payment is capped at £1,500 and can only be claimed on completion of the house purchase.</p>

<p>If you are an existing home owner within the specified distance from your <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot site, you will not qualify for the core payment.</p>

<h2>A guide to the private rental sector (<abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr>)</h2>

<h4>Selecting a property</h4>

<p>When you enter into the private rental sector (<abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr>), there are a number of things to think about before selecting a home or room to rent. For example, tenancy factors such as rent and bills which you will be required to pay directly.Properties suitable for pets, or other factors such as the security of the area, local amenities and schools. You can speak to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.army.mod.uk/people/support-well/hive/" rel="external">local Army HIVE</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.raf.mod.uk/serving-families/hive-finder/" rel="external">RAF HIVE</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/community-and-support/advice-and-support" rel="external">NS-FPS</a> to find out more. You can view the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/806216/6.5707_MHCLG_How_to_Rent_v4.pdf" rel="external">How to rent: the checklist for renting in England</a> for additional guidance on renting in general.</p>

<p>If schools are an important factor, you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/school-performance-tables">contact your local authority to find schools in your area</a>, and visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/schools-admissions">schools admission section</a> of GOV.UK for further guidance on applying to schools. You are eligible for a payment called the accommodation cost overlap for up to 3 months to minimise disruption to education during term time or to help you secure an address in advance of a school term.</p>

<p>Once you’ve found a property or room you like, try to find out as much about it as possible before you apply. If you’ve never rented privately before or are looking for advice on this there is also further information available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/private-renting">private rental</a> gov.uk website.</p>

<p>These sources will provide additional information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing evidence for renting</li>
  <li>tenancy agreements</li>
  <li>credit scores</li>
  <li>getting a guarantor</li>
  <li>protecting your deposit</li>
  <li>rent increases, disputes and arrears</li>
  <li>multiple occupancy</li>
  <li>anti-social behaviour</li>
</ul>

<p>When you rent a property you become a tenant which comes with a number of responsibilities. Your landlord also has a number of responsibilities. Specific tenant and landlord responsibilities may vary depending on the details in your tenancy agreement, however an outline of what is usually expected is given below.</p>

<h4>Your responsibilities</h4>

<p>As a tenant you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pay the rent on time. If you don’t, you could lose your home because you have broken your tenancy agreement. If you have problems <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/private-renting/rent-arrears">GOV.UK</a> has links to further advice. Including these <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/rent-arrears-problems-paying-your-rent" rel="external">practical steps for paying your rent on time</a>. You are responsible for paying your landlord directly, the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> will not do this on your behalf</li>
  <li>pay any other bills that you are responsible for on time, such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/housing-local-services/council-tax">council tax</a>, gas, electricity and water bills, which you will have to pay directly from your own bank account. If you pay the gas or electricity bills, you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/consumers/household-gas-and-electricity-guide/how-switch-energy-supplier-and-shop-better-deal/how-switch-energy-supplier-if-you-re-tenant" rel="external">choose your own energy supplier</a>
</li>
  <li>look after the property. Get your landlord’s permission before attempting repairs or decorating. It’s strongly advised that you get contents insurance to cover your possessions too, because the landlord’s insurance won’t cover your things</li>
  <li>be considerate to the neighbours. You could be evicted for anti-social behaviour if you are not</li>
  <li>not take in a lodger or sub-let without checking whether you need permission from your landlord</li>
</ul>

<p>It is also worth:</p>

<ul>
  <li>making sure you know how to operate the boiler and other appliances, and know where the stopcock, fuse box and any meters are located</li>
  <li>regularly testing your smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors, at least once a month</li>
  <li>reporting any need for repairs to your landlord. There will be a risk to your deposit if a minor repair turns into a major problem because you did not <a class="govuk-link" href="https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/repairs/how_to_report_repairs_to_a_private_landlord" rel="external">report it</a>
</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote">registering to vote</a> and registering your family to a <abbr title="General Practioner">GP</abbr>. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/GP/LocationSearch/4" rel="external">compare <abbr title="General Practioner">GP</abbr> practices</a> according to facilities, services, access and performance before you decide</li>

<h4>Your landlord’s responsibilities</h4>

<p>A landlord is generally expected to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maintain the structure and exterior of the property and keep the property you live in safe and free from health hazards</li>
  <li>fit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/smoke-and-carbon-monoxide-alarms-explanatory-booklet-for-landlords">smoke alarms</a> on every floor and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/smoke-and-carbon-monoxide-alarms-explanatory-booklet-for-landlords">carbon monoxide alarms</a> in rooms with appliances using solid fuels, such as coal and wood, and make sure they are working at the start of your tenancy. If they are not there, ask your landlord to install them</li>
  <li>deal with any problems with the water, electricity and gas supply</li>
  <li>maintain any appliances and furniture they have supplied</li>
  <li>carry out most <a class="govuk-link" href="https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/repairs/landlord_and_tenant_responsibilities_for_repairs" rel="external">repairs</a>. If something is not working, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/repairs/how_to_report_repairs_to_a_private_landlord" rel="external">report it to your landlord or agent</a> as soon as you can</li>
  <li>arrange an annual <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gassaferegister.co.uk/" rel="external">gas safety check</a> by a gas safe engineer where there are any gas appliances</li>
  <li>get a licence for the property if it is a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/house-in-multiple-occupation-licence">licensable property</a>
</li>
  <li>insure the building to cover the costs of any damage from flood or fire</li>
</ul>

<h4>Landlord grievance</h4>

<p>If you enter the <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr>, you will have the same legal protection that civilians currently have. The agreement you have between you and your landlord is a private agreement, and disputes would be considered a private matter and should be dealt with accordingly. If you have a problem with your landlord, or agency, dependent on your tenancy agreement, you should follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Complain to your landlord or agency, they should have a complaints policy that you can follow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make a complaint to a designated person such as your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/" rel="external">MP</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors">a local councillor</a> or a tenant panel if you can’t resolve the problem with your landlord.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contact your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">council or local authority</a> if you and your landlord still can’t resolve the problem.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In order to solve a residential property dispute, you can apply to the first tier tribunal (property chamber residential property). The cases you can apply for include <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/private-renting/rent-increases">rent increases</a> for ‘fair’ or ‘market’ rates, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/leasehold-property/leasehold-disputes">leasehold disputes</a>, for example variable <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/leasehold-property/service-charges-and-other-expenses">service charges</a>, recognising a tenants’ association, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/leasehold-property/right-to-manage-and-management-disputes">management disputes</a>, financial penalties, rent repayment orders.</p>

<p>The tribunal is independent of government and will listen to both sides of the argument before making a decision.</p>

<p>You may want to get help and advice before you apply. Contact <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.lease-advice.org/" rel="external">Leasehold Advisory Service</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/about-us/contact-us/contact-us/contact-us/" rel="external">Citizens Advice</a>.

<h3>Moving out of your home</h3>

<p>You may be required to move out of your home for one of the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for service reasons</li>
  <li>due to an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/private-renting-evictions">eviction / notice to vacate/ notice to quit</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the reason you are moving out of your home, you will need to follow certain steps and may be entitled to support.</p>

<p>If you choose to leave your property midway through your assignment for anything other than service reasons or qualifying change of circumstances as per <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-464-tri-service-accommodation-regulations-tsars"><abbr title="Joint Service Publication">JSP</abbr> 464, Volume 4, Chapter 2, Section IX</a>, then a mid-assignment move will not be supported.</p>

<h4>Moving out of your home for service reasons</h4>

<p>There will be no change to the process of moving from your own home, <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> or <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> under the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot.</p>

<p>If you have chosen to rent in the private sector, in addition to the financial support for rent, you may be eligible for other payments (transaction costs) to any early termination fees. Payments would be provided when you are required to move before the end of your tenancy agreement in the <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr> for service reasons, but not when self motivated.</p>

<p>Early surrender relief (<abbr title="Early surrender relief">ESR</abbr>) covers any contractual rental costs you incur when you are given insufficient notice of assignment to inform the landlord or agency, or the assignment date falls within the month and you are required to make a full month’s payment for that month. This will cover the remaining lease term up to a maximum of 6 months from the point at which you are notified of the requirement to relocate.  You can apply for <abbr title="Early surrender relief">ESR</abbr> via an iExpense. For more information on <abbr title="Early surrender relief">ESR</abbr> please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-464-tri-service-accommodation-regulations-tsars"><abbr title="Joint Service Publication">JSP</abbr> 464, Volume 4, Chapter 2, Section V</a>. For further details on how <abbr title="Early surrender relief">ESR</abbr> applies when sharing in the Private Rental Sector please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-464-tri-service-accommodation-regulations-tsars"><abbr title="Joint Service Publication">JSP</abbr> 464, Volume 4, Chapter 2, Section IV</a>.</p>

<p>If you are assigned away from a <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot site to a non-<abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> location, your eligibility to accommodation under the <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot may continue, and be transferrable to the non-<abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> site. This retained entitlement is referred to as preserved rights. For more information and eligibility on preserved rights please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-464-tri-service-accommodation-regulations-tsars"><abbr title="Joint Service Publication">JSP</abbr> 464, Volume 4, Chapter 6, Section I</a>.</p>

<h4>Moving out of your home due to an eviction / notice to vacate/ notice to quit</h4>

<p>If you are evicted or are given a notice to quit from your <abbr title="private sector">PRS</abbr> property, you are required to inform your local <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> Cell as soon as possible under <abbr title="Future Accommodation model">FAM</abbr> pilot policy. It should be noted that each eviction or notice to vacate or notice to quit case will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Depending on the type of eviction, fault or non-fault, costs may be recovered from you as deemed appropriate for this move.</p>

<p>If you do receive an eviction notice, it may be worth consulting your tenancy agreement to ensure the eviction is in line with the landlord’s rights. If not, this may be something that you choose to challenge through your landlord or letting agent.</p>

<p>You may be considering leaving your home at the end of your fixed tenancy agreement, or the landlord may choose to exercise their right to end your tenancy agreement at another time in line with your tenancy agreement. If the landlord refuses to renew a tenancy whilst you are mid-assignment, this will be deemed to be a non-fault eviction, and you will be given support in line with this.</p>

<p>You should submit a new accommodation preference form to enable you to find your next property, and then apply for the relevant advances.</p>

<p>Upon ending your tenancy, there are a number of expectations of both landlords and tenants. If the landlord chooses to end your tenancy, they must provide sufficient notice in line with the terms of your tenancy agreement. As a vacating tenant, you are responsible for ensuring all bills are paid and that the property is left in a satisfactory state in line with the terms of your tenancy agreement. This is necessary in order to receive your deposit back in full from the landlord or agency. If you do not receive the full amount back you will have to pay the difference when costs are recovered from you. To fully understand and comply with your responsibilities, you should consult your tenancy agreement to ensure you have met all terms of the contract before vacating.</p>

<p>Visit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/private-renting-evictions">GOV.UK guidance</a> for more information on the matters outlined above, and for links to support if you have any problems during the tenancy.</p>

<h4>Renewing your tenancy agreement</h4>

<p>At the end of a fixed tenancy, you may decide you want to stay in your home and therefore sign a new fixed term contract. In this situation, you should review the terms and conditions of the new contract, for example, additional costs for renewal and increased rent before deciding to continue your tenancy agreement. If you do choose to sign a new tenancy agreement, you must bring a copy of this into Unit <abbr title="human resources">HR</abbr> so they can update <abbr title="joint personnel administration">JPA</abbr> in line with your new agreement, and ensure you are provided with the relevant financial support that you are eligible for.  See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-464-tri-service-accommodation-regulations-tsars"><abbr title="Joint Service Publication">JSP</abbr> 464, Volume 4, Chapter 2, Section IV</a> for more detail.</p>
