<p>You must not release common pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) or red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) into the wild on European sites<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> or within 500 metres of their boundary (known as the buffer zone), except under a licence.</p>

<p>This general licence allows an authorised person<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> to release into the wild a specified number of common pheasants or red-legged partridges in these areas that would otherwise be unlawful under section 14 of the 1981 Act<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this licence, the word ‘gamebirds’ is used to collectively refer to common pheasants and red-legged partridges.</p>

<h2>Legal basis of this licence</h2>

<p>The Secretary of State<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> has issued this general licence under the powers in section 16(4) and 16(5) of the 1981 Act. The Secretary of State has also been advised by Natural England as to the circumstances in which, in their opinion, general licences should be granted.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State may modify or revoke this licence at any time.</p>

<h2>Purpose of this licence</h2>

<p>This licence allows you, as an authorised person, to release a specified number of common pheasants or red-legged partridges into the wild in an area which is a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-sites-and-500-metre-buffer-zones-in-england-on-31-may-2021">European site and within the 500m buffer zone</a> around the boundary of the site.</p>

<h2>Who can use this licence</h2>

<p>You can only act under this licence if you are an authorised person. This includes the owner or occupier of the site on which the release of common pheasants or red-legged partridges will be carried out, or any person authorised by the owner or occupier of that site.</p>

<p>You do not need to apply or register to use this licence.</p>

<h2>Who cannot use this licence</h2>

<p>You, or anyone acting on your behalf, cannot act under this licence if you have been:</p>

<p>i) notified in writing by Natural England that you are subject to a formal investigation or a sanction<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> as a result of damage caused to a European site by releasing common pheasants or red-legged partridges</p>

<p>ii) convicted on or after 1 January 2010 of a wildlife offence<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup> unless in respect of that offence, the person is a rehabilitated person for the purpose of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/53/contents" rel="external">Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974</a> and the conviction is spent, or a court has made an order discharging them absolutely</p>

<p>If you cannot use this general licence for these reasons, or because you are unable to comply with its conditions,  you may still <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/wildlife-licences">apply to Natural England for an individual licence</a>. You can use this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://defragroup.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8uMtOaO1yU9nDMi" rel="external">online advice service</a> to check whether you can use this general licence, or if you need to apply for an individual licence. If you’re unable to access this form, email Natural England: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:gamebirds@naturalengland.org.uk">gamebirds@naturalengland.org.uk</a></p>

<p>You must not use this licence if the Secretary of State has withdrawn your permission to use it. Read the section on <a class="govuk-link" href="#enforcement">enforcement and penalties for misuse of this licence</a>.</p>

<h2>When and where you can use this licence</h2>

<p>This licence is valid in England from 31 May 2022 to 30 May 2023.</p>

<h2>Enforcement and penalties for misuse of this licence</h2>

<p>Failure to comply with the conditions of this licence may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mean you commit a criminal offence under the 1981 Act - the penalty for this offence on summary conviction is a 6-month custodial sentence or a fine of any amount</li>
  <li>result in your authorisation to use this licence being withdrawn - the Secretary of State will notify you in writing if your authorisation to use this licence is withdrawn and the Secretary of State may impose a similar sanction in relation to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/general-licences-for-wildlife-management">other wildlife management licences</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The density of red-legged partridges released within a European site must be no more than 700 birds per hectare of land they inhabit, or lower if required by a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-areas-sites-of-special-scientific-interest#get-consent-to-carry-out-operations-on-your-land"><abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> consent</a>. Any release, including single or trickle releases, must not exceed this limit.</p>

<p>Where any red-legged partridges are shot or killed, you must not release further birds where this would exceed the allowed limit.</p>

<p>You must site red-legged partridge release pens in cover crops<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup> on arable land or on improved grassland within a European site. You must not site them in semi-natural or unimproved habitats<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Condition 2. Release of gamebirds within the 500m buffer zone of a European site boundary</h3>

<p>For the release of common pheasants and red-legged partridges into the wild, the following conditions apply.</p>

<h5>Common pheasants: release density</h5>

<p>The density of common pheasants released within the 500m buffer zone of a European site must be no more than 1,000 birds per hectare of release pen. Any release, including single or trickle releases, must not exceed this limit.</p>

<p>Where any common pheasants are shot or killed, you must not release further birds where this would exceed the allowed limit.</p>

<h4>Red-legged partridges: release density</h4>

<p>The density of red-legged partridges released within the 500m buffer zone of a European site must be no more than 1,000 birds per hectare of land they inhabit. Any release, including single or trickle releases, must not exceed this limit.</p>

<h2>Advice on how to comply with the conditions of this licence</h2>

<p>Use the advice to help you comply with the conditions of this licence.</p>

<h3>Activity in the buffer zone</h3>

<p>To help you comply with the activity in the buffer zone, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>release gamebirds as far from a European site boundary as possible</li>
  <li>release gamebirds into linear features, such as hedgerows, linear plantations or game-cover crops where this will encourage them away from the boundary of an adjacent site</li>
  <li>provide a suitable habitat and linear features near the release site</li>
  <li>position strawed feed rides, feed hoppers and drinkers away from the site boundary</li>
  <li>position artificial shelters, dust baths and grit stations away from the site boundary</li>
  <li>disperse gamebirds that are grouping near the boundary</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information and advice specific to this licence</h2>

<ol>
  <li>This licence does not provide consent under section 28E of the 1981 Act for those <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-areas-sites-of-special-scientific-interest#find-out-about-your-land-within-a-sssi">operations requiring Natural England’s consent</a> as listed on a notification of a <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr>.<br><br>
</li>
  <li>Before you can release or permit the release of gamebirds in a <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> that is also a European site, you need to know if Natural England needs to give <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> consent. The owner or occupier of the land will need to check if <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> consent is needed.</li>
</ol>

<p>You only need Natural England’s <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> consent if the release or related activities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take place in a <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> that is also a European site</li>
  <li>are listed on the <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> notification as operations that need Natural England’s consent</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to have Natural England’s consent, where this is necessary, before releasing or permitting the release of gamebirds within the <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr>.</p>

<p>You need to follow the terms and conditions of that consent.</p>

<p>This also applies to related activities that are listed as requiring Natural England’s consent, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>erecting and maintaining release pens</li>
  <li>providing supplementary feeding</li>
  <li>driving vehicles on the site</li>
</ul>

<p>When you report release activity, you need to provide Natural England with the details of the <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> consent under which the release activity is operating.</p>

<p>Use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://magic.defra.gov.uk/" rel="external">MAGIC maps</a> to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-areas-sites-of-special-scientific-interest#check-if-your-land-is-within-a-sssi">check if your proposed activity under this licence is within a <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr></a> that is also designated as a European Site.</p>

<p>Use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteSearch.aspx" rel="external">Designated Sites View database</a> to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-areas-sites-of-special-scientific-interest#check-if-you-need-consent">find out if your proposed activity under this licence is listed</a> as an ‘operation requiring Natural England’s consent’.</p>

3. You are required to register gamebirds on the Animal and Plant Health Agency <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/poultry-including-game-birds-registration-rules-and-forms">poultry register</a> if you keep 50 or more gamebirds. This is to comply with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/2701/contents/made" rel="external">Avian Influenza (Preventive Measures) (England) Regulations 2006</a>.

<p>It is voluntary to register gamebirds if you keep fewer than 50 birds.<br><br>
4. You should read this licence alongside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/69379/pb13356-game-birds-100720.pdf" rel="external">Code of Practice for the Welfare of Gamebirds Reared for Sporting Purposes</a> and the requirements of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wildlife-management-advice-notice-the-animal-welfare-act-2006-wml-gu02">Animal Welfare Act 2006</a>.<br><br>
5. Nutrient run-off from release pens and feeding stations could affect the water quality of nearby European sites. To avoid this, you should place pens and feeding stations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on level ground</li>
  <li>at least 50m away from a watercourse flowing towards a European site designated for its river, wetland or intertidal habitat</li>
</ul>

<p>On sloping ground, you should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/farming-rules-for-water-in-england">farming rules to protect watercourses</a>, that recommend placing pens and feeding stations on slopes of less than a 12-degree angle.</p>
