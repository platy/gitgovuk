<h2>About Help to Build</h2>

<p>Help to Build will open soon for applications. As one of our valued partners, we’re asking you to help us spread the word about it.</p>

<p>This toolkit contains useful information on how to use Help to Build marketing materials and how to get them.</p>

<p>We’ve included some links to useful resources too.</p>

<p>If there are additional items that you would like to help you promote Help to Build, please get in touch by email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:helptobuildcomms@homesengland.gov.uk">HelpToBuildComms@homesengland.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>We also encourage you to signpost potential Help to Build customers to our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/help-to-build-making-building-your-own-home-more-affordable">prospectus</a> and encourage them to register their interest for the scheme at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://help-to-build.homesengland.org.uk/" rel="external">https://help-to-build.homesengland.org.uk/</a>.</p>

<h2>What is Help to Build?</h2>

<p>Help to Build is a government home ownership scheme to help people in England to custom or self build their own home.</p>

<p>The scheme aims to make custom and self build more affordable for the younger generation.</p>

<p>Custom and self builders can apply for an equity loan to put towards their land and build costs. Successful Help to Build customers will then have 3 years to build their home.</p>

<p>To start the process, they will need a 5% deposit, and will need to apply for a self build mortgage from a lender registered with Help to Build.</p>

<p>At the end of the build, we’ll pay the equity loan to the mortgage lender. The lender will change the self build mortgage to a repayment mortgage.</p>

<p>The equity loan is based on the estimated costs to buy a plot of land and build the home. The equity loan amount can be between 5% to 20% (up to 40% in London) of the total estimated cost.</p>

<p>Eligible customers can spend up to £600,000 on building their home and buying the land. The most they can spend on the build cost is £400,000, even if they already own the land.</p>

<p>No interest is charged on the equity loan for the first 5 years from the date of payment. Interest is paid from year 6.</p>

<p>Help to Build aims to scale up the number of SME builders in the market, and this could create 2,000 new custom and self build homes. It also aims to diversify the housing market as customers can appoint smaller builders and contractors to help with their development.</p>

<h2>Other key things to know</h2>

<p>Help to Build is not a discount scheme or a price reduction - the land and build costs will be the same without an equity loan.</p>

<p>The total amount a customer repays on their equity loan is linked to the value of the home, not the original amount they borrowed.</p>

<p>The self build mortgage must be provided by a lender registered with Help to Build.</p>

<p>Customers must have outline planning permission before they apply for an equity loan.</p>

<h3>Help to Build customer journey</h3>

<p>This graphic has been removed as it could not be made accessible. Please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:enquiries@homesengland.gov.uk">enquiries@homesengland.gov.uk</a> citing the name of the document if you need this information.</p>

<h2>Who is eligible?</h2>

<h3>Customer eligibility</h3>

<p>A Help to Build customer can apply if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are 18 years of age or over, and have a right to live in England</li>
  <li>will live in the newly-built home as their only home</li>
  <li>secure a self build mortgage from a lender registered for Help to Build</li>
</ul>

<h3>Property eligibility</h3>

<p>Help to Build is available on a custom and self build property as defined under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/17/contents/enacted/data.htm" rel="external">Self-build and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015</a>.</p>

<p>It must be a new-build property, or any home previously occupied either by an owner-occupier, licensee or a tenant; or a building which is to be demolished in full in order to build a new custom and self build property.</p>

<p>Shell properties designed to allow customisation of internal walls, completion of second fix and final fit-out are allowed.</p>

<p>Self build warranties are required and need to be in place before completion.</p>

<h2>Brand guidelines</h2>

<h3>The Help to Build brand</h3>

<p>When helping us to share information about Help to Build, it should be in line with our mission and values. It should also be clear, accurate and consistent.</p>

<p>We must use the Help to Build identity in a consistent way to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>create a strong visual style</li>
  <li>be unique and easily recognised</li>
  <li>prevent fraudulent use of the brand</li>
</ul>

<p>More detailed guidance for using the Help to Build brand elements can be found in the brand guidelines. You can request access by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:helptobuildcomms@homesengland.gov.uk">HelpToBuildComms@homesengland.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Tone of voice</h2>

<p>Tone of voice is a crucial element of how we connect with consumers, colleagues, and strategic partners and should underpin how we communicate.</p>

<p>Tone of voice must be:</p>

<p>1 Underpinned by our values and responsibilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>compliant - fair, clear, and not misleading</li>
  <li>accessible - using plain English</li>
  <li>channel appropriate</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Informed by our target audience’s characteristics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ambitious</li>
  <li>independent</li>
  <li>lifestyle focused</li>
</ul>

<p>Tone may need to be dialled up or scaled back depending on channel, customer circumstance, or previous communications. More guidance can be found in our tone of voice guidelines. You can request access by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:helptobuildcomms@homesengland.gov.uk">HelpToBuildComms@homesengland.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Key messages</h2>

<p>You can include these key messages about Help to Build in any materials you share about the scheme.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Help to Build is a government equity loan available to those in England who want to custom or self build their home.</li>
  <li>Help to Build will make custom and self build more affordable and a more attractive choice for the younger generation.</li>
  <li>Help to Build means customers can build a home with a lower deposit than usual, making custom and self build more accessible.</li>
  <li>On completion of the custom or self build home, the equity loan is paid to the repayment mortgage lender and the self build mortgage must switch to a repayment mortgage.</li>
  <li>The equity loan reduces the loan to value ratio of the mortgage and helps to reduce risk for the lender.</li>
  <li>The land and build costs will be the same with or without the equity loan.</li>
  <li>Customers are not charged interest on the equity loan for the first 5 years. Interest payments start from year 6.</li>

<h2>Caveats for marketing materials</h2>

<h3>Full version</h3>

<p>Help to Build is a government equity loan for people in England who want to build their own home. Government lends 5% to 20% (40% in London) of the estimated value of the home when it’s built.</p>

<p>Repayments: You cannot make monthly payments to reduce your equity loan amount. You must repay at the end of your mortgage or equity loan term, when you sell your home, or you can repay any time before.</p>

<p>Interest rate: Years 1 to 5 fixed rate of 0% each year. Year 6 fixed rate of 1.75% each year. Year 7 on, previous year’s interest rate increases by 2% plus CPI (or a min. 2% if CPI is zero or less). Homes England is the lender, and will secure the equity loan as a second charge on your home.</p>

<p>Help to Build is subject to eligibility, terms, and conditions: <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.ownyourhome.gov.uk/Help-to-Build" rel="external">http://www.OwnYourHome.gov.uk/Help-to-Build</a>. Your home may be repossessed if you do not keep up repayments on your repayment mortgage, equity loan or other loans secured against it.</p>
