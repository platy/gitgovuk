<p>Hopwas Woods is out of bounds for 1 hour prior to and 1 hour after the firing timings listed.</p>
</div>

<h2>COVID-19 update</h2>

<p>The days that firing will take place on the long ranges will be shown with start and finish timings.</p>

<p>In this very trying time in which Government is dealing with the COVID-19 virus, most military units are supporting or preparing to support Government plans. This has led to almost all the range bookings being cancelled. But as we move with Government policy and Military training begins again, bookings will increase.</p>

<p>We also have had, on a couple of occasions, units who were booked to fire not actually arriving to do so. It has then taken time to open the woods for access and the change could not be published due to short notice.</p>

<p>We apologise for these issues arising and thank you for your patience as we work through these matters. We will try to fully resolve all such issues in the shortest time.</p>

<p>This enables staff to have time to raise flags and lock off gates and post sentries to ensure nobody enters the range danger area when firing is taking place.</p>

<p>We cannot emphasise enough how dangerous it would be to enter the danger area when firing is taking place as it could lead to loss of life.</p>

<p>The measures we put in place will ensure this should not happen.</p>

<p>The bridleway from Common Lane via the range and Hopwas Hey Lane to Hopwas Bridge on the canal will be closed as per byelaws when firing is due to take place until after firing is complete.</p>

<p>During this time with little firing taking place, please stick to the only access route along the bridleway. We have seen a large number of people who feel they can go anywhere they want; this is not the case. Please stick to the bridleway route when crossing the range.</p>

<p>Gates have now been installed on both the Hopwas bridge and the Tamhorn bridge. They will be locked when firing is taking place and locked in the open position when no firing is taking place.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you are requested by a Military Sentry not to proceed past a given point please adhere to their instructions as they are given for your own safety. All sentries are equipped with body cameras to ensure all behaviours are correct.</p>
</div>

<p>We would like also like to take this opportunity to thank those who have assisted us by reporting incidents seen whilst using the woods. It greatly assists by receiving early notification of such matters and allows us to react in a timely manner.</p>

<p>We request that care is taken in these extreme conditions. Please do not be careless with any flammable products. No fires of any kind or BBQs are allowed in the woods.</p>

<p>If you know of somebody who would like to receive firing times please let us know to enable them to be added to our database.</p>

<p>Any questions or queries can be addressed to the contact phone numbers at the top of this page.</p>

<p>Military Personnel may still carry out dry training, none live firing training, within the bounds of the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> lands within Hopwas Woods during this period.</p>

<h2>Your safety</h2>
<p>Do not enter the danger area when in use, this could result in loss of life. For your own safety do not touch any military debris, it may be dangerous.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If the red flags and/or lights are hoisted, regardless of the timings, do not enter the training area. This is a danger to life.</p>
