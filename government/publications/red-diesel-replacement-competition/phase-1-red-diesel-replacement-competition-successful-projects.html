This will validate the fuel flexibility of <abbr title="Monolithic Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Development">mSOFC</abbr> with the potential to use green hydrogen when production is scaled in the future alongside Calor’s renewable hydrocarbons such as <abbr title="renewable dimethyl">rDME</abbr> and <abbr title="biopropane">BioLPG</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Gen-ZE: Fuel cell generator</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Lead Partner: Bramble Energy</li>
  <li>Lot number: 2</li>
  <li>Total grant: £460,000</li>
</ul>

<p>Within the Gen-ZE project Bramble Energy will develop, test and trial a ruggedised, portable hydrogen fuel cell generator demonstrating a zero-emission solution to replace diesel generators targeted for the construction sector. Bramble’s printed circuit board fuel cell (<abbr title="printed circuit board fuel cell">PCBFC</abbr>) technology offers cost advantages over conventional fuel cells, and the simplified, robust design using PCBs will be demonstrated to meet the construction sectors needs for zero-emission portable power generation.</p>

<h3>Hybrid Gas Engine <abbr title="Hybrid Gas Engine">HGE</abbr>
</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Lead Partner: CAGE Technologies Limited</li>
  <li>Lot number: 2</li>
  <li>Total grant: £382,022.90</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Hybrid Gas Engine">HGE</abbr> (Hybrid Gas Engine) is a project that will develop a multi-gas engine technology that enables the same engine to run on conventional gas fuels or hydrogen, or a mixture of gas fuels with no fundamental change to the engine. This enables a smooth transition to net zero power by enabling users to purchase a net zero compliant technology now yet operate it on conventional clean fuels whilst the hydrogen supply chain is developed.</p>

<h3>High Pressure Hybrid Pumping System for Hydrogen Storage and Dispensing</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Lead Partner: CATAGEN Limited</li>
  <li>Lot number: 1</li>
  <li>Total grant: £437,700</li>
</ul>

<p>This project looks to develop an alternative approach that overcomes issues with current methods of delivering high pressure hydrogen for storage, transportation and dispensing at fuelling stations with a new system and process. Existing methods employ large gaseous compressors with intercoolers to deliver hydrogen gas. These methods are relatively inefficient, expensive to manufacture and display various operational issues in use, such as overheating and high fuelling times.</p>

<h3>E-fuel as a drop-in replacement for red diesel</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Lead Partner: CATAGEN Limited</li>
  <li>Lot number: 3</li>
  <li>Total grant: £350,000</li>
</ul>

<p>The project is to determine the feasibility of developing new capabilities and technologies to combine with known re­circulating gas reactor test technology to yield a production machine and process that can produce an easily transportable green E­diesel. This new process will utilise green hydrogen and <abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> sequestered from the air as feedstock, with the proposed new technology production reactor and process to be powered using renewable electricity resulting in a carbon NET ZERO process. The output of the project will mean E­diesel can be produced at a renewable energy site alongside green hydrogen production.</p>
