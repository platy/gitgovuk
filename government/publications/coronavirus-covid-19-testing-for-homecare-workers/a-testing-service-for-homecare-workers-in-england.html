<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>NHS Test and Trace is making weekly COVID-19 testing available to all homecare workers in England.</p>

<p>All registered homecare agencies will be contacted with details of how to apply for test kits for their homecare workers. Homecare agencies will be responsible for ordering and distributing test kits to all homecare workers for them to conduct at home on a weekly basis.</p>

<p>Homecare worker testing should only be conducted on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays (if the homecare worker is able to access a priority post box with Sunday collections).</p>

<p>We will be extending this service shortly to all homecare workers in adult social care, including unregistered organisations and live-in carers.</p>

<h2>Webinars</h2>

<p>For more information you can join our webinars, which will be hosted every Tuesday and Thursday, starting the week of 23 November.</p>

<p>These live webinars will talk you through the end-to-end process for homecare worker testing and include a live Q&amp;A with the homecare testing team, who will be happy to answer your questions.</p>

<p><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://event.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1405251&amp;tp_key=79f1786e36">Sign up for the webinars</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Summary: testing for homecare workers</h2>

<h3>About the service</h3>

<p>The service involves:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>weekly testing of all homecare workers in adult social care. This includes all carers in domiciliary care organisations</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>agency managers should order tests every 28 days for their homecare workers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>4 tests are delivered for each homecare worker to the agency, for a 28-day testing cycle</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>each homecare worker should be given 4 test kits every 28 days</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>every 7 days a care worker should take a test, register it online, and return it by post between Thursday and Sunday</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>homecare workers will receive their results in 2 to 4 days by email and text message (SMS)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Why testing is important</h3>

<p>Testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifies homecare workers who currently have COVID-19 so they are able to self-isolate if positive</li>
  <li>protects those receiving care from infection passed to them by homecare workers who are confirmed positive</li>
  <li>prevents and controls the spread of the virus by identifying asymptomatic cases</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Eligible organisations</h3>

<p>Your organisation is eligible if you are a Care Quality Commission (<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>)-regulated homecare organisation in England providing personal care.</p>

<p>This is defined in the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> data as locations with the primary inspection category ‘Community based adult social care services’ and providing the service type ‘Domiciliary care service’.</p>

<p>If you believe you match this criterion and have not been contacted by NHS Test and Trace with information on ordering test kits, please call 119.</p>

<h4>If you are not eligible right now</h4>

<p>If you’re a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-personal-assistants">personal assistant supporting adults over 18 in England</a>, you can access regular testing.</p>

<p>For testing purposes, we have defined a personal assistant as someone who is directly employed by an individual (or self-employed) to provide care and support to enable them to live as independently as possible. This care could include support in the home, or to go out into the community. All personal assistants who provide care that requires them to come within 2 metres of the person they support and who support adults over the age of 18 are eligible for testing.</p>

<p>We are working hard to increase our testing capacity, develop new technologies and reach more people.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Your involvement</h3>

<h4>Agency managers</h4>

<p>If you are the manager of a homecare agency, responsible for a team of homecare workers or you have been delegated responsibility for testing by your organisation, your key responsibilities are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attend a webinar to understand the process</li>
  <li>order test kits for homecare workers for every 28-day testing cycle</li>
  <li>communicate your agency’s Unique Organisation Number (<abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr>) to homecare workers</li>
  <li>distribute test kits to homecare workers</li>
  <li>encourage and support your homecare workers to complete weekly testing between Thursdays and Sundays</li>
</ul>

<h4>Homecare workers</h4>

<p>If you are a homecare worker who visits people with care and support needs at their homes, your key responsibilities are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>conduct tests weekly between Thursdays and Sundays</li>
  <li>register your tests as soon as you have completed them each week using your agency’s Unique Organisation Number (<abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr>)</li>
  <li>return your test kits at a Royal Mail priority post box on the same day that you complete the test</li>
  <li>if you test positive: isolate, notify your line manager and provide contacts to NHS Track and Trace</li>
  <li>regardless of your result, continue following all infection prevention and control (IPC) measures such as wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), washing your hands and socially distancing where possible</li>
</ul>

<h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you have any queries with any of the steps please call the national coronavirus contact centre on 119</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span> Unique Organisation Number</h3>

<p>NHS Test and Trace assigns all participating organisations a single Unique Organisation Number (<abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr>).</p>

<p>Agency managers will receive their <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr> via the email address registered with <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>. Please make sure that the person who receives these emails understands the importance of this message and knows who to contact.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr> is an 8-digit number which is exclusive to an individual organisation. This can be used to login to all online elements of the testing process.</p>

<p>Agency managers will need to use their <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr> for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://request-testing.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk">ordering test kits</a></li>
  <li>contacting the national coronavirus contact centre for support (dial 119, or 0300 303 2713 in Scotland)</li>
</ul>

<p>Homecare workers will need to use their <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr> for <a href="https://gov.uk/register-organisation-tests" class="govuk-link" rel="external">registering completed test kits</a> to make sure they will receive their results.</p>

<p>If you have any issues with this process, please call 119.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> End-to-end process: agency managers</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Ordering test kits</h3>

<p>The agency manager is responsible for ordering test kits for the homecare workers in the team.</p>

<p>Each agency manager must <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://request-testing.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/">register for test kits</a>.</p>

<p>In order to apply, you will need:</p>

<ol>
  <li>your Unique Organisation Number (<abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr>)</li>
  <li>total number of homecare workers for testing</li>
</ol>

<p>When ordering you will be asked to enter the number of residents or non-staff. You should enter zero for this.</p>

<p>Once you have placed an order, you will receive a confirmatory email from <a href="mailto:organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>The agency manager will receive an email from <a href="mailto:organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk</a> when their test kits have been dispatched, informing them of their delivery date.</p>

<p>Test kits will be delivered in boxes of 40 to the address of your homecare agency, as registered with <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>.</p>

<p>The agency manager is responsible for taking delivery of the test kits.</p>

<p>The agency manager must then order kits every 28 days for their homecare workers.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you have any issues ordering test kits, please call 119.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Communicating to your homecare workers</h3>

<p>The agency manager is responsible for communicating key information that homecare workers will need to successfully conduct testing.</p>

<p>We encourage agency managers to use existing communication channels that are best suited to your team.</p>

<p>The activities which need to take place are in the following table.</p>

<h4>Communication responsibilities for agency managers</h4>

      <th scope="col">Communication</th>
      <th scope="col">When to do this</th>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Distributing test kits</h3>

<p>Once the kits are delivered to the registered address, it is the agency manager’s responsibility to distribute them to homecare workers.</p>

<p>The agency manager should inform their team that the kits have arrived. They can either distribute the kits, or advise carers to collect 4 test kits each as soon as possible.</p>

<p>You will know how best to handle the distribution process for your team but below are some suggestions that have been put forward by homecare agencies as part of our initial research.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Homecare workers can pick up kits at the same time they pick up other materials (for example, PPE, consumables and other medical supplies)</li>
  <li>Agency managers or supervisors can hand out the kits to the group at daily/weekly meetings</li>
</ol>

<p>Ensure each care worker collects 4 kits every month so that weekly testing can continue without interruption</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Each test kit should include a pink individual Royal Mail return label. Please check that there is one in each bag provided.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Encouraging participation</h3>

<p>In order to protect your homecare workers and for the people they support, it is important that homecare workers are encouraged to complete the end-to-end weekly process of:</p>

<ol>
  <li>completing the test between Thursday and Sunday each week</li>
  <li>registering the test online</li>
  <li>returning the test through a priority post box</li>
</ol>

<p>Below are some ideas that we have seen work well to encourage participation for homecare workers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>digital tracker (for example, Microsoft Teams) so homecare workers can confirm they have tested each week</li>
  <li>a physical tracker (for example, a matrix on a team notice board with stickers for completed tests)</li>
  <li>text or WhatsApp group message reminders to test</li>
  <li>sending outlook invite placeholders to remind team members to test</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> Support available to you</h3>

<p>The Infection Control Fund (<abbr title="Infection Control Fund">ICF</abbr>), set up in May, has been extended until March 2021, with an extra £546 million for the care sector to take key steps to improve infection prevention and control, enabling providers to restrict staff movement in care homes and pay normal wages to staff who are self-isolating.</p>

<p>This means we have provided over £1.1 billion of ring-fenced funding for infection control throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The extension of the <abbr title="Infection Control Fund">ICF</abbr> modified the conditions of the fund to recognise the vital role of community care providers, who have received £158.5 million through this grant.</p>

<p>Read more <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-infection-control-fund-round-2/adult-social-care-infection-control-fund-round-2-guidance" class="govuk-link">information on the conditions of this grant, as well as how to access funding</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> End-to-end process: homecare workers</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Collecting test kits</h3>

<p>The agency manager will inform homecare workers when test kits arrive and how they can be collected or distributed.</p>

<p>Each homecare worker should take 4 test kits, one for each of the 4 weekly testing cycles.</p>

<p>Please ensure you have postage labels for each test.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Prepare for testing by looking at guidance</h3>

<p>Before testing be sure to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read guidance for homecare workers</li>
  <li>read guidance included with your test kit</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-taking-swab-samples/how-to-use-the-self-swabbing-kit-for-a-combined-throat-and-nose-swab-video">watch the instructional video for self-swabbing</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If a homecare worker becomes symptomatic and has a kit available at home, they should test themselves in addition to the normal weekly cycle.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Using the test kits</h3>

<p>Homecare workers will conduct a combined throat and nose self-swab for the test</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-taking-swab-samples/how-to-use-the-self-swabbing-kit-for-a-combined-throat-and-nose-swab-video" class="govuk-link">Follow the instructional video on how to do a throat and nasal swab</a></p>

<p>You should only conduct your test between Thursdays and Sundays. Our labs are quieter on these days so results come back on average 30% faster.</p>

<p>Always leave 7 days between tests where possible.</p>

<p>If possible, please continue testing while on holiday (in the UK) or off work due to an illness not related to coronavirus.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> Registering test kits</h3>

<p>Each week you should register your test after you have completed your test.</p>

<p>Only use a Royal Mail priority post box. It will be labelled with the a ‘Priority Box’ sign and one of the regional NHS logos. Please do not enter any Post Office with the kit.</p>

<p>To ensure samples reach the laboratories in time:</p>

<ol>
  <li>please post the kit at least one hour before the last collection time to ensure that is not missed</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.royalmail.com/services-near-you" class="govuk-link" rel="external">locate your nearest priority post box and collection times</a> in advance of testing – tests should be posted on the day they are completed</li>
  <li>some post boxes do not collect post on Sundays, and so please check if there is a collection available before testing on Sunday</li>
</ol>
