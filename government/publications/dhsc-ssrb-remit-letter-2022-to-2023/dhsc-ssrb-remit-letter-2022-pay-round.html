Dr Martin Read CBE 
<br>Chair, Senior Salaries Review Body 
<br>Office of Manpower Economics 
<br>Level 3, Windsor House
<br>50 Victoria Street
<br>London 
<br>SW1H 0TL
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>Dear Dr Read,</p>

<p>I should firstly like to offer my thanks for the Senior Salaries Review Body’s (<abbr title="Senior Salaries Review Body">SSRB</abbr>) valuable work during the last pay round and for the observations on levels of pay for senior managers in the health and care sector, made within your 2021 report.</p>

<p>I write to you now to invite you to build upon these observations and provide a pay recommendation for very senior managers (<abbr title="very senior managers">VSMs</abbr>) in the NHS, and executive and senior managers in the Department for Health and Social Care’s (<abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) arm’s length bodies (<abbr title="arm's length bodies">ALBs</abbr>), for 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p>The government must balance the need to ensure fair pay for public sector workers while protecting funding for frontline services and ensuring affordability for taxpayers. We must ensure that the affordability of a pay award is taken into consideration to ensure that the NHS and <abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s <abbr title="arm's length bodies">ALBs</abbr> are able to recruit, retain and motivate its senior workforce, as well as deliver on other key priorities, including tackling elective recovery.</p>

<p>Independent consultants at NHS England and NHS Improvement (<abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSEI</abbr>) are putting together proposals for the revised <abbr title="very senior manager">VSM</abbr> pay framework – please review their proposals, giving particular consideration to the pay of medical directors and the alignment of the new integrated care board very senior managers (<abbr title="very senior managers">VSMs</abbr>) within the framework.</p>

<p>The evidence that my department and NHS England and Improvement will provide in the coming months, will support you in your consideration of all these factors.</p>

<p>We would welcome your reports in May 2022, subject to ongoing conversations with the Office of Manpower Economics.</p>

<p>Yours ever,</p>

<p>Sajid Javid
Secretary of State for Health and Social Care</p>
