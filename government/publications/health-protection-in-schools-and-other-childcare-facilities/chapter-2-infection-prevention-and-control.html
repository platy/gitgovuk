<p>This chapter provides general guidance for staff in education and childcare settings on the prevention and control of infections. A proactive and preventive approach is advised.</p>

<p>Germs are spread during the infectious period and for some diseases such as chicken pox and coronavirus (COVID-19) this can be before the person affected <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/people-with-symptoms-of-a-respiratory-infection-including-covid-19">shows any symptoms</a>.</p>

<p>Infection prevention and control measures aim to interrupt the chain of transmission.</p>

<p>This chapter includes information on:</p>

</ul>

<p>This guidance refers to public health exclusions to indicate the time period an individual should not attend a setting to reduce the risk of transmission during the infectious stage. This is different to ‘exclusion’ as used in an educational sense.</p>

<h2>Environment or placement of someone who develops an infection</h2>

<p>Prompt exclusion of children, young people and staff who are unwell with an infectious disease is essential to preventing the spread of infection in education and childhood settings.</p>

<p>Children with mild, respiratory symptoms such as a runny nose, sore throat, or slight cough, who are otherwise well, can continue to attend their education or childcare setting.</p>

<p>All settings should have a local policy for the appropriate removal of staff, children and young people while they are likely to be infectious. They should also have a procedure for contacting parents and/or carers when children become unwell at the setting.</p>

<p>Children who are unwell and showing <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nhs.uk" rel="external">the symptoms of an infectious disease</a>or a diagnostic result should be advised to stay away from their education or childcare setting for the minimum period recommended. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-protection-in-schools-and-other-childcare-facilities/chapter-3-public-health-management-of-specific-infectious-diseases">Chapter 3</a> and the accompanying table provide further detail on the symptoms of different infections and recommended action.</p>

<p>Staff or students who are close contacts of people who are unwell with an infectious disease or an infection do not usually need to be excluded from the setting. However, your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/health-protection-team">health protection team</a> (<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>) will  advise you if there are specific precautions to be taken in response to managing a case or outbreak. They will contact you if this is required.</p>

<p>In most cases, parents and carers will agree that a child who is unwell and has symptoms of an infectious illness, such as a fever should not attend your setting, given the potential risk to others.</p>

<p>If a parent or carer insists on a child with symptoms attending your setting, where they have a confirmed or suspected case of an infectious illness, you can take the decision to refuse the child if, in your reasonable judgement, it is necessary to protect other children and staff from possible infection. For some infections, individuals may be advised to remain away from a setting for a longer period of time. This will be advised by your <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Hand hygiene</h2>

<p>Hand washing is one of the most important ways of controlling the spread of infections, especially those that cause diarrhoea and/or vomiting and respiratory infections.</p>

<p>Settings should ensure that staff and students have access to liquid soap, warm water and paper towels. Bar soap should not be used.</p>

<p>All staff and pupils should be advised to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.who.int/teams/integrated-health-services/infection-prevention-control/hand-hygiene/training-tools" rel="external">wash their hands</a> after using the toilet, before eating or handling food, after playtime and after touching animals.</p>

<p>All cuts and abrasions should be covered with a waterproof dressing.</p>

<p>Alcohol hand gel can be used if appropriate hand washing facilities are not available but should not replace washing hands particularly if hands are visibly soiled or where there are cases of gastroenteritis (diarrhoea and vomiting) in the setting. Alcohol hand gel is not effective against norovirus. Further information is available here <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/hand-sanitiser/choosing-hand-sanitiser-surface-disinfectant.htm" rel="external">Choosing hand sanitisers and surface disinfectants to use during the COVID-19 pandemic (hse.gov.uk)</a>.</p>

<h2>Respiratory and cough hygiene</h2>

<p>Coughs and sneezes spread diseases. Covering the nose and mouth during sneezing and coughing can reduce the spread of infections.</p>

<p>Spitting should be discouraged.</p>

<p>Anyone with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/people-with-symptoms-of-a-respiratory-infection-including-covid-19">signs and symptoms of a respiratory infection</a>, regardless of the cause, should follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.infectionpreventioncontrol.co.uk/resources/catch-it-bin-it-kill-it-poster/" rel="external">respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette</a>, specifically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cover nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing and sneezing, and dispose of used tissue in non-healthcare risk waste bin and perform hand hygiene</li>
  <li>cough or sneeze into the inner elbow (upper sleeve) if no tissues are available, rather than into the hand</li>
  <li>keep contaminated hands away from the mucous membranes of the eyes and nose</li>
  <li>carry out hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions and contaminated objects and materials</li>
</ul>

<h2>Personal protective equipment</h2>

<p>If there is a risk of splashing or contamination with blood or bodily fluids during an activity, then disposable gloves and plastic aprons should be worn.</p>

<p>Gloves and aprons should be disposable, non-powdered vinyl/nitrile or latex-free and&nbsp;CE&nbsp;marked. Wear disposable eye protection (or if reusable decontaminate prior to next use) if there is a risk of splashing to the face.</p>

<h2>Aerosol generating procedures (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGP</abbr>)</h2>

<p>It is vital that all children, young people and students, including those with complex or additional health needs, are supported to continue their education and care in their education or children’s social care setting, where it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGP</abbr> is a medical procedure that can result in the release of airborne particles (aerosols) from the respiratory tract.</p>

<p>The full list is available <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-guidance-for-maintaining-services-within-health-and-care-settings-infection-prevention-and-control-recommendations#infection-control-precautions-for-seasonal-respiratory-infections">on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>Standard <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> recommendations for AGPs would include eye and face protection, apron and gloves to protect against the splashing or spraying of blood and bodily fluids.</p>

<p>If someone is performing an <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGP</abbr> on an individual who is suspected of being infectious with a respiratory agent (for example <abbr title="respiratory syncytial virus">RSV</abbr> or COVID-19) additional airborne <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-guidance-for-maintaining-services-within-health-and-care-settings-infection-prevention-and-control-recommendations#infection-control-precautions-for-seasonal-respiratory-infections">personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) should be used</a>, including an FFP3 respirator or equivalent.</p>

<h2>Safe management of the environment</h2>

<p>Keeping education and childcare settings clean, including toys and equipment, reduces the risk of infection. It is especially important to clean surfaces that people touch a lot.</p>

<p>It is important that cleaning schedules clearly describe the activities required, the frequency of cleaning and who will carry them out. Cleaning standards should be monitored regularly by the setting.</p>

<p>Cleaning staff should be appropriately trained and have access to the appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, such as gloves, aprons and surgical masks.</p>

<h2>Cleaning</h2>

<p>Cleaning with detergent and water is normally all that is needed as it removes the majority of germs that can cause disease.</p>

<p>Essential elements of a comprehensive cleaning contract include daily, weekly and periodic cleaning schedules.</p>

<p>Although there is no legislative requirement to use a colour coding system it is good practice and recommended by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk" rel="external">Health and Safety Executive</a>.</p>

<p>Colour-coded equipment should be used in different areas with separate equipment for kitchen, toilet, classroom and office areas (for example, red for toilets and washrooms; yellow for hand wash basins and sinks; blue for general areas and green for kitchens).</p>

<p>Cleaning equipment used should be disposable or, if reusable, disinfected after each use.</p>

<p>Consideration should be given to situations where additional cleaning will be required including during term time (for example in the event of an outbreak) and how the setting might carry this out.</p>

<p>A nominated member of staff should monitor cleaning standards and discuss any issues with cleaning staff, or contractors employed by the education or childcare setting.</p>

<p>Cleaning solutions should be stored in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coshh/" rel="external">Control of Substances of Hazardous to Health (<abbr title="Control of Substances of Hazardous to Health">COSHH</abbr>)</a>, and cleaning equipment changed and decontaminated regularly.</p>

<p>Effective cleaning and disinfection are critical in any education or childcare setting, particularly when food preparation is taking place. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.food.gov.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="Foos Standards Agency">FSA</abbr></a> strongly advises the use of either a dishwasher, a sterilising sink, or a steam cleaner to clean and disinfect equipment and utensils.</p>

<p>All areas or surfaces in contact with food, dirt or bodily fluids must be regularly cleaned and disinfected. Training should be provided for the use of any equipment and chemicals. Operation and maintenance of equipment should be according to the manufacturer’s instructions and include regular dishwasher interior cleaning cycles.</p>

<h3>Enhanced cleaning during an outbreak or incident</h3>

<p>In the event of an outbreak  of infection at your setting, your <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> team may recommend enhanced or more frequent cleaning, to help reduce transmission.</p>

<p>Advice may be given to ensure twice daily cleaning of areas (with particular attention to door handles, toilet flushes and taps) and communal areas where surfaces can easily become contaminated such as handrails.</p>

<p>Plans should be developed for such an event on how the setting might carry this out which could also include during term time. Dedicated cleaning equipment should be colour coded according to area of use.</p>

<h3>Sanitary facilities</h3>

<p>Good hygiene practices depend on adequate facilities. A hand wash basin with warm running water along with a mild liquid soap, preferably wall mounted with disposable cartridges, should be available.</p>

<p>Place disposable paper towels next to basins in wall mounted dispensers, together with a nearby foot-operated wastepaper bin.</p>

<p>Toilet paper should be available in each cubicle (it is not acceptable for toilet paper to be given out on request). If settings experience problems with over-use, they could consider installing paper dispensers to manage this.</p>

<p>Suitable sanitary disposal facilities should be provided where there are females including children aged 9 or over (junior and senior age groups).</p>

<h3>Keep occupied spaces well ventilated</h3>

<p>Ventilation is the process of introducing fresh air into indoor spaces while removing stale air. Letting fresh air into indoor spaces can help remove air that contains virus particles and prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory infections.</p>

<p>All education and childcare settings should keep occupied spaces well ventilated to help reduce the amount of respiratory germs.</p>

<p>Many areas of schools education and childcare settings are already well-ventilated with plenty of air movement.</p>

<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic the Department for Education provided education settings with access to CO2 monitors for staff to be able to identify where ventilation required improvement.</p>

<p>If there are areas of the setting identified that may have poor ventilation, there are several simple things that can be done to improve ventilation.</p>

<p>These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>partially opening windows and doors to let fresh air in</li>
  <li>opening higher level windows to reduce draughts</li>
  <li>opening windows for 10 minutes an hour or longer can help increase ventilation – where possible this can happen when the room is empty in between lessons, for example</li>
</ul>

<p>You should always balance the need for increased ventilation while maintaining a comfortable temperature.</p>

<h2>Safe management of linen and soft furnishings</h2>

<h3>Laundry</h3>

<p>There should be a designated area on site if there is a need for laundry facilities. This area should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be separate from any food preparation areas</li>
  <li>have appropriate hand washing facilities</li>
  <li>have a washing machine with a sluice or pre-wash cycle</li>
</ul>

<p>Staff involved with laundry services should ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>manual sluicing of clothing is not carried out as there is a risk of inhaling fine contaminated aerosol droplets; soiled articles of clothing should be rinsed through in the washing machine pre-wash cycle, prior to washing</li>
  <li>gloves and aprons should be worn when handling soiled linen or clothing</li>
  <li>hands should be thoroughly washed after removing the gloves and aprons</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dealing with contaminated clothing</h3>

<p>Clothing may become contaminated with blood or bodily fluids. If this occurs, clothing should be removed as soon as possible and placed in a plastic bag. It should be sent home with the child with advice for the parent on how to launder the contaminated clothing.</p>

<p>Any contaminated clothing should be washed separately in a washing machine, using a pre-wash cycle, on the hottest temperature that the clothes will tolerate.</p>

<h3>Managing nappies</h3>

<p>Children in nappies must have a designated changing area. This should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be away from play facilities and any area where food and/or drink is prepared or consumed</li>
  <li>have appropriate hand washing facilities available</li>
</ul>

<p>Staff should wash and dry their hands after every nappy change, before handling another child or leaving the nappy changing room.</p>

<p>Staff involved in managing nappies should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wrap soiled nappies in a plastic bag before disposal in the general setting waste</li>
  <li>clean children’s skin with a disposable wipe (flannels should not be used)</li>
  <li>label nappy creams and lotions with the child’s name and do not share with others</li>
  <li>wipe changing mats with soapy water or a mild detergent wipe after each use</li>
  <li>clean mats thoroughly with hot soapy water if visibly soiled and at the end of each day</li>
  <li>check mats weekly for tears and discard if the cover is damaged</li>
</ul>

<p>A designated sink for cleaning potties (not a hand wash basin) should be located in the area where potties are used. Disposable gloves should be worn to flush contents down the toilet. The potty should be washed in hot soapy water, dried and stored upside down.</p>

<p>Hands should be washed using soap and warm water and dried after removing disposable gloves.</p>

<h3>Children with continence aids</h3>

<p>Children and young people who use continence aids (like continence pads, catheters) should be encouraged to be as independent as possible. The principles of basic hygiene should be applied by both children, young people and staff involved in the management of these aids.</p>

<p>Continence pads should be changed in a designated area. Appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> (disposable gloves and a disposable plastic apron) should be worn and changed after every child. Hand washing facilities should be readily available.</p>

<p>Contact your education or childcare health team for further advice. Your local authority should be able to provide contact details for your school health team if unknown.</p>

<h2>Safe management of blood and bodily fluids</h2>

<h3>Cleaning blood and body fluid spills</h3>

<p>Any spillages of blood, faeces, saliva, vomit, nasal and eye discharges should be cleaned immediately, wearing <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. Use gloves and an apron if anticipate splashing and risk assess the need for eye protection.</p>

<p>Spillages must be cleaned using a product which combines detergent and disinfectant that is effective against both bacteria and viruses. Manufacturer’s guidance should always be followed.</p>

<p>Use disposable paper towels or cloths to clean up blood and body fluid spills. These should be disposed of immediately and safely after use. A spillage kit should be available for bodily fluids like blood, vomit and urine.</p>

<h3>Managing cuts, bites, nose bleeds and bodily fluid spills</h3>

<p>Standard precautions should be taken when dealing with any cuts/abrasions that involve a break in the skin or body fluid spills. This is because we do not always know if an individual has an infection or not.</p>

<p>Staff should be aware of their settings health and safety policies and manage incidents such as cuts, bites, bleeds and spills accordingly. These policies should include having nominated first aiders who are appropriately trained.</p>

<p>Standard Infection Prevention and Control (<abbr title="Standard Infection Prevention and Control">SIPC</abbr>) precautions should be used for everyone to reduce the risk of unknown (and known) disease transmission. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cuts-and-grazes/" rel="external">These include:</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>wearing gloves when in contact with any accident or injury (washing grazes, dressing wounds, cleaning up blood after an incident) and wearing a disposable plastic apron if possible</li>
  <li>carefully cleaning the wound under running water if possible or using a disposable container with water and wipes; carefully dab dry</li>
  <li>covering all exposed cuts and grazes with waterproof plasters</li>
  <li>keep the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/accidents-first-aid-and-treatments/how-do-i-apply-plasters-and-other-dressings/" rel="external">dressing clean by changing it as often as is necessary</a>
</li>
  <li>managing all <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/guidance/oce23.pdf" rel="external">spillages of blood or body fluids</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If someone suffers a bite, scratch or puncture injury that may have introduced someone else’s blood or experiences a splash of blood to the eye, area of broken skin or mouth, rinse well with water and seek medical advice.</p>

<h2>Safe management of waste (including sharps)</h2>

<p>Under the waste management duty of care, education and childcare settings must ensure that all waste produce is dealt with by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/managing-your-waste-an-overview">a licensed waste management company</a>.</p>

<p>Any used <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be placed in a refuse bag and disposed of as normal domestic waste. <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should not be put in a recycling bin or dropped as litter.</p>

<p>Settings that generate clinical waste should continue to follow usual waste policies.</p>

<p>Nappy waste can sometimes be produced in large quantities in places such as nurseries. Although considered non-hazardous, in quantity it can sometimes be offensive and cause handling problems.</p>

<p>Organisations that produce significant amounts of used nappies should contact their local authority to discuss appropriate disposal arrangements.</p>

<h2>Occupational safety and managing prevention of exposure to infection (including needlestick or sharps injuries, and bites)</h2>

<p>Occasionally children, young people or staff may injure themselves with discarded used hypodermic needles which they have found. If this happens then dispose of the needle safely to avoid the same thing happening to someone else.</p>

<p>This can be done by either contacting your local authority or school nurse.</p>

<p>If someone pricks or scratches themselves with a used hypodermic needle or has a bite which breaks the skin:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wash the wound thoroughly with soap and warm running water</li>
  <li>cover the wound with a waterproof dressing</li>
  <li>record it in the accident book and complete the accident form</li>
  <li>seek immediate medical attention or advice from your local accident and emergency department or occupational health provider</li>
</ul>
