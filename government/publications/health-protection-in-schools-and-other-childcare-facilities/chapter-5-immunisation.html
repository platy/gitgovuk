<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Immunisation is a key intervention to help give children the best start in life.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-complete-routine-immunisation-schedule">National routine childhood immunisation programme</a> has a direct positive impact on the health and wellbeing of children as well as communities.</p>

<p>Achieving high levels of immunity against vaccine preventable diseases is vital to reduce the spread of infection and prevent outbreaks. Herd immunity also extends protection from immunisation programmes to individuals who cannot be vaccinated for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>Education and childcare settings have a vital role to play to support the routine immunisation programme through sharing of information with parents about the routine immunisations their children should be up to date with at key contact points. Settings or parents and carers may wish to speak to their health visitor or school nurse about the support they can offer.</p>

<p>Universities and colleges are also encouraged to share information on vaccines such as <abbr title="measles, mumps, rubella">MMR</abbr> and <abbr title="meningococcal ACWY">MenACWY</abbr> and information on the signs and symptoms of meningococcal disease with newly enrolled students along with links to GP registration and other relevant healthcare services.</p>

<p>In addition, there are a number of school-based immunisation programmes whose success depends on close working relationships, communication and collaboration between the schools, school nurses and School-Aged Immunisation Service (<abbr title="School-Aged Immunisation Service">SAIS</abbr>) providers.</p>

<p>Evidence shows that school-based delivery of immunisations reduces health disparities by making access to vaccines easier for all, for example parents don’t need to take time off work to book immunisation appointments and children who are not registered with a GP are included.</p>

<p>The offer of the adolescent vaccines in school is an important opportunity to check that children are up to date with all their routine immunisations and to ensure they are caught up.</p>

<p>Children who miss out on the adolescent immunisation sessions remain eligible and should be caught up as soon as possible through their school aged immunisation service or by being referred to their GP.</p>

<p>Settings or parents and carers may wish to speak to their health visitor or school nurse about the support they can offer.</p>

<h2>Who offers school-aged immunisations</h2>

<p><abbr title="School-Aged Immunisation Service">SAIS</abbr> providers are commissioned by NHS England and Improvement (<abbr title="NHS England and Improvement">NHSEI</abbr>) to deliver the school aged immunisation programmes. Home schooled children and children not in mainstream schools for other reasons are also included.</p>

<p><abbr title="School-Aged Immunisation Service">SAIS</abbr> teams visit primary schools to offer the flu vaccine in the autumn term. The routine adolescent immunisation programmes are delivered throughout the academic year in secondary school years 8 and 9 with catch-up offered to older year groups if needed.</p>

<p><abbr title="School-Aged Immunisation Service">SAIS</abbr> teams work closely with education providers to ensure effective planning and delivery of the service. The <abbr title="School-Aged Immunisation Service">SAIS</abbr> team will provide you with an invitation to send to parents, guardians and carers. The letter includes information on the consent process and links to further guidance. It’s important that this is sent in good time and with a clear deadline for response.</p>

<p>It’s crucial that consent forms are returned at least 48 hours before the <abbr title="School-Aged Immunisation Service">SAIS</abbr> team arrives. This is because <abbr title="School-Aged Immunisation Service">SAIS</abbr> teams will order the required amount of vaccine in advance based on the consent returns.</p>

<p>This means that if parents, guardians or a person with parental responsibility misses the consent deadline, the <abbr title="School-Aged Immunisation Service">SAIS</abbr> team may not have enough vaccines for everyone who would like one on the day.</p>

<p>On the day of the immunisation session if a young person wishes to be vaccinated and a consent form has not been returned every effort will be made to contact the parent to seek their verbal consent.</p>

<p>By law, some young people may be mature enough to provide their own consent, so called ‘Fraser Guidelines’ it is up to the health professional to assess if a child under the age of 16 can be considered competent to understand the benefits and risks.</p>

<h2>The roles of the <abbr title="School-Aged Immunisation Service">SAIS</abbr> and the education setting</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="School-Aged Immunisation Service">SAIS</abbr> provider is contractually and legally responsible for the school immunisation programmes.</p>

<p>The setting is supporting the immunisation programme by hosting the <abbr title="School-Aged Immunisation Service">SAIS</abbr> team and helping them with aspects of the vaccination process, including providing space and time in the timetable for vaccination, reminding them about the date of the immunisation session(s),sharing information leaflets and consent forms and providing a list of eligible pupils and their parent or guardian’s contact details.</p>

<p>Where vaccination visits have been most successful, the team and the setting or school nurse have worked in close partnership, respecting each other’s different roles and responsibilities whilst working flexibly and planning together.</p>

<p>You will want to consider how to ensure the <abbr title="School-Aged Immunisation Service">SAIS</abbr> teams can best administer the immunisation programmes on your school site, facilitating access for the team and their equipment, providing practical support for clinical teams to take breaks and ensuring that their time in your school is maximised to vaccinate as many eligible and consented pupils as possible.</p>

<p>You can contact the <abbr title="School-Aged Immunisation Service">SAIS</abbr> team directly if you have any queries or questions or would like to start your planning with them ahead of this.</p>

<p>If you do not already have contact details for your <abbr title="School-Aged Immunisation Service">SAIS</abbr> team, your regional <abbr title="NHS England and Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> team will be able to help you to identify which organisation in your area will be delivering the school age immunisation programme and provide contact details.</p>

<p><abbr title="NHS England and Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> regional contact details can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/about/regional-area-teams/" rel="external">NHS England regional teams website</a>.</p>

<h2>How to support the <abbr title="School-Aged Immunisation Service">SAIS</abbr> before the immunisation session</h2>

<p>A <abbr title="School-Aged Immunisation Service">SAIS</abbr> team will contact your school to agree on suitable days for visits. You should nominate someone in your school to act as a link person for the <abbr title="School-Aged Immunisation Service">SAIS</abbr> team. This will help with early engagement ahead of the visit and support planning and set up for the day of the visit.</p>

<p>Communicate with pupils and parents or carers to support consent and uptake. <abbr title="School-Aged Immunisation Service">SAIS</abbr> or <abbr title="NHS England and Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> regional team can help with information to support parents and pupils to make an informed decision on consent. Settings or parents and carers may wish to speak to their health visitor or school nurse about the support they can offer.</p>

<p>Ensure that consent forms, leaflets and cover letters that will be provided to you by your <abbr title="School-Aged Immunisation Service">SAIS</abbr> team are sent to parents, guardians and carers in good time and with a clear deadline on return.</p>

<p>Consider what space could be made available and provide as much information as possible for the <abbr title="School-Aged Immunisation Service">SAIS</abbr> team so that they can plan their visit and be prepared on the day.</p>

<h2>How to support the <abbr title="School-Aged Immunisation Service">SAIS</abbr> teams on the day of their visit</h2>

<p>Ensure that the <abbr title="School-Aged Immunisation Service">SAIS</abbr> team can access the agreed space before the school day starts so they can set up.</p>

<p>Allow pupils to wear loose fitting short sleeved tops on the day of vaccination.</p>

<p>Provide a large, well-ventilated space to undertake the vaccinations – generally a sports hall or similar.</p>

<p>Identifying and supporting pupils who may find the procedure stressful, in partnership with school nurse.</p>

<p>Help to keep disruption and noise to a minimum.</p>

<p>Ensure a steady flow of pupils throughout the school day.</p>

<p>Providing, if possible, access to a power supply with extension cables and anti-trip mats, separation screens, defibrillator, gym mats, tables and chairs.</p>

<p>Removing any household waste generated on the day (<abbr title="School-Aged Immunisation Service">SAIS</abbr> team will remove any sharp, hazardous or medical waste).</p>

<p>Avoid any unscheduled fire drills etc to be schedule the same day as vaccinations.</p>

<h2>Staff immunisation</h2>

<p>It is important that all staff are up to date with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-complete-routine-immunisation-schedule">routine immunisation schedule</a>. Staff may wish to speak to their health visitor or school nurse for support or advice.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="measles, mumps, rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccination</h3>

<p>In particular all staff should make sure that they have had 2 doses of the <abbr title="measles, mumps, rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccine.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="measles, mumps, rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccine is the safest and most effective way to protect yourself against measles, mumps and rubella which are viral infections that can quickly spread and cause outbreaks in education settings.</p>

<p>Rubella caught in pregnancy can lead to miscarriage or cause very serious harm to the unborn baby and so all women who are considering a pregnancy should make sure they are up to date with their 2 doses of the <abbr title="measles, mumps, rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccine.</p>

<p>All staff should be encouraged to check their immunisation records and contact their GP practice if they are unsure if they are up to date or if they need to catch up. The <abbr title="measles, mumps, rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccine is available for free on the NHS with no upper age limit.</p>

<p>Further information is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/thinking-of-getting-pregnant-make-sure-you-re-protected-against-german-measles">Thinking of getting pregnant?</a> leaflet.</p>

<h3>Hepatitis B vaccine</h3>

<p>Hepatitis B vaccine is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/immunisation-against-infectious-disease-the-green-book">recommended for staff</a> who are involved in the care of children with severe learning disability or challenging behaviour who live in institutional accommodation.</p>

<p>In such circumstances, it is the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bma.org.uk/advice-and-support/gp-practices/vaccinations/hepatitis-b-vaccinations" rel="external">responsibility of the employer</a> to conduct an occupational health risk assessment and pay for the vaccine if it is indicated.</p>

<h2>Outbreak response</h2>

<p>Occasionally clusters and outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, mumps, hepatitis A and meningococcal disease are linked to education settings. Suspected outbreaks should be notified to your <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> HPT promptly in line with <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> guidance.</p>

<p>The HPT will conduct a risk assessment and as part of the control measures may consider offering vaccination to students and staff in the setting. This will require clear and prompt communication with parents and rapid coordination of arrangements for the vaccination offer.</p>

<h2>Immunisation resources for education settings</h2>

<p>A wide range of immunisation resources for education settings are available – schools are encouraged to share these with parents at appropriate opportunities such as at school entry with reminders at the beginning of each academic year.</p>

<p>Copies of printed publications and the full range of digital resources to support the immunisation programmes can be ordered through the Health publications orderline or downloaded online.</p>

<p>Log in to register and place your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://healthpublications.gov.uk" rel="external">order online</a>.</p>
