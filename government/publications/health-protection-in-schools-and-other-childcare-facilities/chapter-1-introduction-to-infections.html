<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Attending face to face education or childcare is hugely important for children and young people’s health and their future.  As we learn to live safely with coronavirus (COVID-19), the imperative remains to reduce disruption to children and young people’s education.</p>

<p>This guidance has been updated to provide a practical guide for staff in education and childcare settings, including those working in children’s social care, on managing a range of infections. This includes advice on managing COVID-19 and other infections spread by the respiratory route.</p>

<p>It provides advice on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>introduction to infections</li>
  <li>infection prevention and control</li>
  <li>managing specific infections and exclusion advice</li>
  <li>actions in the event of an outbreak or incident including when and how to seek help</li>
  <li>immunisation</li>
  <li>additional considerations such as educational visits and animal management</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not intended to be used as a tool for the diagnosis of infections. The information in this document is relevant to staff members as well as children and young people.</p>

<h2>Infections in education and childcare settings</h2>

<p>Childhood infections are common and for most children and young people the risk of severe disease is low. Infections can be acquired at home or in the community and brought into education or childcare settings or acquired and spread within the setting.</p>

<p>Infections are caused by micro-organisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites, otherwise known as germs. Germs are everywhere and most do not cause infection and can even be beneficial. However, some germs can cause infections, when they get into the wrong place, which can result in symptoms such as fever and sickness <a class="govuk-link" href="#refone">(1)</a>.</p>

<h2>How infections spread</h2>

<p>It is important to understand how germs are spread and the actions that can be taken to break the chain of infection.</p>

<p>The mode of transmission is a term used to describe how germs are spread from person to person <a class="govuk-link" href="#reftwo">(2)</a>. There are different ways that this can happen.</p>

<p>There are 10 elements of Standard Infection Prevention and Control Precautions which when carried out effectively help reduce the risk of transmission of infections:</p>

<p>1. Environment or placement of someone who develops an infection</p>

<p>2. Hand hygiene</p>

<p>3. Respiratory and cough hygiene</p>

<p>4. Personal protective equipment</p>

<p>5. Safe management of the environment</p>

<p>6. Safe management of equipment</p>

<p>7. Safe management of linen or soft furnishings</p>

<p>8. Safe management of blood and body fluids</p>

<p>9. Safe disposal of waste (including sharps)</p>

<p>10. Occupational safety or managing prevention of exposure to infection (including needlestick or sharps injuries, and bites)</p>

<p>Further information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-protection-in-schools-and-other-childcare-facilities/chapter-2-infection-prevention-and-control">chapter 2</a>.</p>

<h2>Airborne spread</h2>

<p>Respiratory infections can spread easily between people. Sneezing, coughing, singing and talking may spread respiratory droplets from an infected person to someone close by. Examples of infections that are spread in this way are the common cold, COVID-19, influenza, and whooping cough.</p>

<p>Droplets from the mouth or nose may also contaminate hands, cups, toys or other items and spread to those who may use or touch them, particularly if they then touch their nose or mouth.</p>

<h2>Direct contact spread</h2>

<p>Infections of the skin, mouth and eye may be spread by direct contact with the infected area to another person’s body. Examples of infections spread in this way are scabies, headlice, ringworm and impetigo.</p>

<p>Gastro-intestinal infections can spread from person to person when infected faeces are transferred to the mouth either directly or from contaminated food, water or objects such as toys or toilet flush handles. Examples of infections spread in this way include hepatitis A and Shiga Toxin-producing Escherichia Coli (<abbr title="Shiga Toxin-producing Escherichia Coli">STEC</abbr>).</p>

<p>Environmental surfaces such as door handles and tables may also be contaminated with infectious particles. This can occur with viral gastroenteritis (for example, norovirus) because vomit contains many infectious virus particles.</p>

<p>Blood borne viruses are viruses that some people carry in their blood and can be spread from one person to another by contact with infected blood or body fluids, for example, while attending to a bleeding person or injury with a used needle. Examples of infections spread in this way are hepatitis B and <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>.</p>

<p>Human mouths are inhabited by a wide variety of organisms, some of which can be transmitted by bites. Human bites resulting in puncture or breaking of the skin are potential sources of exposure to blood borne infections, therefore, it is essential that they are managed promptly.</p>

<h2>Transmission based precautions</h2>

<h3>Types of precautions</h3>

<h4>Contact precautions</h4>

<p>Used to prevent and control infections that spread via direct contact with a person or indirectly from the persons immediate environment (including equipment). This is the most common route of cross-infection from one person to another (transmission of infection).</p>

<h4>Droplet precautions</h4>

<p>Measures used to prevent, and control infections spread over short distances (at least one metre) via droplets from the respiratory tract of one person directly onto the eyes, nose or inside the mouth (a mucosal surface or conjunctivae) of another person. Droplets then spread into the respiratory system.</p>

<h4>Airborne precautions</h4>

<p>Measures used to prevent, and control infection spread without necessarily having close contact with another person via small respiratory particles (aerosols) from the respiratory tract of one person directly into a mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another person. Aerosols can penetrate deep into the lungs (respiratory system).</p>

<h2>Groups at higher risk from infection</h2>

<p>For most children and young people, the risk from common infections is low and few will become seriously unwell.</p>

<p>Some children and young people have impaired immune defence mechanisms in their bodies either as a result of a medical condition or due to treatment they are receiving (known as immunosuppressed). People who are immunosuppressed may have a reduced ability to fight infections and other diseases.</p>

<p>Most children and young people in this group will be under the care of a hospital specialist and will have received advice on the risks to them and when to seek medical advice. Children and young people in this group should continue to attend their education or childcare setting unless advised otherwise by their clinician.</p>

<p>Usually the education or childcare setting will be aware of these children and young people and it is important this information is shared with the school nurse.</p>

<p>If a child who may be at higher risk due to their immune system is thought to have been exposed to an infection such as chickenpox or measles in their setting, the parents and carers should be informed immediately so that they can seek further medical advice from their GP or specialist, as appropriate.</p>

<p>Women who are pregnant should ensure they are up to date with the recommended vaccinations, including COVID-19 immunisation (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-protection-in-schools-and-other-childcare-facilities/chapter-5-immunisation">chapter 5</a>). Pregnant women should consult their midwife or GP immediately if they come into contact with positive cases of measles, mumps, rubella, slapped cheek syndrome and chickenpox as contact with these illnesses can affect the pregnancy and/or development of the unborn baby.</p>

<p>They should also avoid contact with animal litter trays due to the risk of toxoplasmosis.</p>

<h2>Additional resources</h2>

<p>Children and young people should be taught how germs are spread and how to stop this for example by washing their hands. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.e-bug.eu/" rel="external">E-bug resources</a> support children and young people to learn about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>germs</li>
  <li>infection prevention and control</li>
  <li>antibiotics</li>
  <li>vaccination</li>
</ul>

<p>All resources have been developed by the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) together with teachers and scientists and are available for settings and communities to use.</p>
