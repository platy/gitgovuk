<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Education and childcare settings can benefit hugely from trips and outdoor learning activities.</p>

<p>Educational visits should be subject to risk assessments as normal and reflect any public health advice or in-country advice of the international destination.</p>

<p>General <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-and-safety-on-educational-visits/health-and-safety-on-educational-visits">guidance on educational visits</a> is available and is supported by specialist advice from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://oeapng.info/" rel="external">Outdoor Education Advisory Panel</a> (<abbr title="Outdoor Education Advisory Panel">OEAP</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Outdoor Education Advisory Panel">OEAP</abbr> provide guidance including actions to manage the risk of disease during a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://oeapng.info/downloads/specialist-activities-and-visits/" rel="external">variety of visits</a>. This guidance is also relevant if animals are brought into the setting.</p>

<p>For international educational visits, you should refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office travel advice</a> and the guidance on international travel before booking and travelling to make sure that the group meet any entry and in country requirements especially in relation to vaccinations. Additional information can be obtained from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/" rel="external">TravelHealthPro</a>.</p>

<p>Further details on health considerations and actions to take before, during and after a visit can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-and-safety-on-educational-visits/health-and-safety-on-educational-visits"><abbr title="Outdoor Education Advisory Panel">OEAP</abbr> guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>Educational visits involving water-based activities</h2>

<p>There is a risk of infection associated with any water-based activity on rivers, canals and freshwater docks, and also with the collection of specimens from ditches, streams and ponds.</p>

<p>Further details on health considerations and actions to take before, during and after the activity can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-and-safety-on-educational-visits/health-and-safety-on-educational-visits"><abbr title="Outdoor Education Advisory Panel">OEAP</abbr> guidance</a> .</p>

<p>It should be made clear to parents and carers that if their child becomes ill following participation in outdoor or water-based activities, the treating doctor should be made aware of the child’s participation in these activities.</p>

<p>Babies or <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/diarrhoea-vomiting-children.aspx" rel="external">children should not swim</a> in public swimming pools or participate in school swimming lessons for 2 weeks after diarrhoea and vomiting has stopped.</p>

<h2>Educational visits to locations such as farms and zoos</h2>

<p>There are a number of diseases that can be passed on to pupils and staff from infected farm animals such as Shiga Toxin-producing Escherichia Coli (<abbr title="Shiga Toxin-producing Escherichia Coli">STEC</abbr>) (including E. coli 0157), campylobacter, salmonella and cryptosporidium. These can cause serious illness, particularly in young children.</p>

<p>In order to protect their own health and that of their unborn child, those who are, or may be, pregnant should be advised to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pregnancy-advice-on-contact-with-animals-that-are-giving-birth">avoid close contact with livestock animals that are giving birth</a>.</p>

<p>People can become infected through direct contact with animals, contact with an environment containing animal faeces or consuming contaminated food or drink.</p>

<p>Even a small number of bacteria can cause infection, so it is essential to follow hygiene recommendations such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>washing hands thoroughly with soap and water immediately after contact with animals. Younger children should be supervised for hand washing</li>
  <li>reminding children not to eat, drink or put fingers in their mouths except when in designated eating areas and after they have washed and dried their hands thoroughly</li>
  <li>not using hand sanitiser as a substitute for handwashing with soap and water</li>
</ul>

<p>Further information relating to visiting farms is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://visitmyfarm.org/resources/code-of-practice" rel="external">Access to Farms</a> website.</p>

<h2>Pets and animal management</h2>

<p>Some education and childcare settings will choose to include pets and other animals to enhance the learning environment or provide respite for the students. However, contact with animals can pose a risk of infection including gastro-intestinal infection, fungal infections and parasites.</p>

<p>Some people may be at greater risk of developing a severe infection. However, sensible measures can be taken to reduce the risk of infection to children and to staff.</p>

<p>Settings should only consider pets that are mature, and toilet trained. A knowledgeable person needs to be responsible for the animal or animals.</p>

<p>This individual will need to abide by the Animal Welfare Act 2006, which places a duty on animal owners to ensure their animal’s welfare needs are met.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There should be a written agreement within the setting detailing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the types of animals allowed in the setting</li>
  <li>how to manage them and permitted behaviour whilst on the premises</li>
  <li>where they can go and where they cannot go when in the setting</li>
  <li>any insurance liability of owners and handlers</li>
</ul>

<h3>All pets in education and childcare settings</h3>

<p>Education and childcare settings should carefully follow specific advice for all pets on site, ensuring:</p>

<ul>
  <li>animals are always supervised when in contact with students</li>
  <li>students and staff are advised to wash their hands immediately after handling animals</li>
  <li>animals have recommended treatments and immunisations, are regularly groomed (including claws trimmed) and checked for signs of infection</li>
  <li>bedding is laundered regularly</li>
  <li>feeding areas are kept clean and their food stored away from human food</li>
  <li>food is not consumed within 20 minutes and is taken away or covered to prevent attracting pests</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cats in education and childcare settings</h3>

<p>There are some additional considerations for cats in education and childcare settings, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cat litter trays should be cleaned daily wearing disposable gloves</li>
  <li>litter trays should not be placed near food preparation, storage or eating areas</li>
  <li>hands should be washed immediately after cleaning litter trays</li>
  <li>pregnant staff should not clean litter trays due to a risk of toxoplasmosis</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reptiles in education and childcare settings</h3>

<p>Reptiles are not suitable as pets in education and childcare settings as all species can carry salmonella which can cause serious illness.</p>

<p>Babies, children under 5, those who are pregnant, the elderly and those with weaker immune systems are particularly at risk from salmonella infection.</p>
