<p>This guidance refers to public health exclusions to indicate the time period an individual should not attend a setting to reduce the risk of transmission during the infectious stage. This is different to ‘exclusion’ as used in an educational sense.</p>
</div>

<h2>What to do if you suspect an outbreak or incident</h2>

<p>All settings should have in place baseline infection prevention and control measures that will help to manage the spread of infection.</p>

<p>If an outbreak  or incident is suspected, education and childcare settings should review and reinforce the baseline infection prevention and control measures they already have in place.</p>

<p>This will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>encouraging all staff and students who are unwell not to attend the setting. Further guidance on the management of specific infectious diseases, including advised exclusion periods can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-protection-in-schools-and-other-childcare-facilities/chapter-3-public-health-management-of-specific-infectious-diseases">chapter 3</a>
</li>
  <li>ensuring all eligible groups are enabled and supported to take up the offer of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/nhs-vaccinations-and-when-to-have-them/" rel="external">national immunisation</a> programmes including coronavirus (COVID-19) and flu</li>
  <li>ensuring occupied spaces are well ventilated and let fresh air in</li>
  <li>reinforcing good hygiene practices such as frequent cleaning, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-protection-in-schools-and-other-childcare-facilities/chapter-2-infection-prevention-and-control">chapter 2</a>
</li>
  <li>considering communications to raise awareness among parents and carers of the outbreak or incident and to reinforce key messages, including the use of clear hand and respiratory hygiene measures within the setting such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.e-bug.eu/" rel="external">E-Bug</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Settings or parents or carers may wish to speak to their health visitor (childcare settings) or school nurse (all schools) about the support they can offer.</p>

<h2>When to seek advice from your <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> health protection team</h2>

<p>Most infectious diseases in education and childcare settings can be managed by following the advice provided in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-protection-in-schools-and-other-childcare-facilities/chapter-3-public-health-management-of-specific-infectious-diseases">Chapter 3</a> and ensuring children, young people and staff follow the recommended exclusion periods.</p>

<p>Registered medical practitioners in England and Wales have a statutory duty to notify their local authority or local UK Health security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) health protection team <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/notifiable-diseases-and-causative-organisms-how-to-report">(<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>)</a> of suspected cases of certain (notifiable) infectious diseases.</p>

<p>All laboratories in England performing a primary diagnostic role must notify <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> when they confirm a notifiable organism. Education and childcare settings will be contacted if there are actions required within the setting as part of public health management.</p>

<p>Education and childcare settings may consider seeking specialist advice from the relevant <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> if they are concerned and have seen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a higher than previously experienced and/or rapidly increasing number of staff or student absences due to acute respiratory infection or diarrhoea and vomiting <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>evidence of severe disease due to an infection, for example if a pupil, student, child or staff member is admitted to hospital <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>more than one infection circulating in the same group of students and staff for example chicken pox and scarlet fever</li>
</ul>

<p>Education and childcare settings are also asked to contact their <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> as soon as possible to report any outbreak or serious or unusual illness for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>E.coli 0157 or E coli STEC infection</li>
  <li>food poisoning</li>
  <li>hepatitis</li>
  <li>measles, mumps, rubella (rubella is also called German measles)</li>
  <li>meningococcal meningitis or septicemia</li>
  <li>scarlet fever (if an outbreak or co-circulating chicken pox)</li>
  <li>tuberculosis (TB)</li>
  <li>typhoid</li>
  <li>whooping cough (also called pertussis)</li>
</ul>

<h2>What information may be asked for</h2>

<p>If you are wishing to contact your <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> due to concerns about an outbreak or incident in your setting, then it will be useful to have the information listed below available. This will help the health protection team to assess the size and nature of the outbreak or incident and advise on any recommended actions.</p>

<p>Information includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>type of setting, for example nursery or special school</li>
  <li>total numbers affected (staff and pupils)</li>
  <li>total numbers attending (staff and pupils)</li>
  <li>any food handlers affected</li>
  <li>number of classes, rooms, year groups affected (including nursery if applicable)</li>
  <li>symptoms experienced</li>
  <li>date when symptoms started including a brief overview of the sequence of numbers of new cases since the outbreak started.</li>
  <li>any indications of severe disease such as overnight admissions to hospital</li>
  <li>were there any events or trips in the week prior to the start of the outbreak</li>
  <li>if known whether any tests or clinical assessments have taken place</li>
  <li>vaccination uptake (for example for MMR and other infections)</li>
  <li>if there are any individuals within the affected group at higher risk from severe disease</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find the contact details of your local <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/health-protection-team">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>What actions will be recommended</h2>

<p>If you need to contact your <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>, they will conduct a risk assessment of the situation based on the information provided, and the type of infection.</p>

<p>The risk assessment will then inform the need for any further actions which may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reinforcement of baseline infection prevention and control measures</li>
  <li>communication to parents and carers</li>
  <li>exceptionally, temporary advice to reduce mixing among a targeted group</li>
  <li>exceptionally, the temporary use of face coverings in communal areas</li>
</ul>

<p>Your <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> will advise on whether any of these actions are recommended.</p>

<p>They may consider holding an incident management team (<abbr title="incident management team">IMT</abbr>) meeting which would bring together local stakeholders and the appropriate local authority. If, in exceptional circumstances and as a last resort, limiting the number of children or young people attending the setting is considered necessary for public health reasons<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>, this should be discussed at an <abbr title="incident management team">IMT</abbr> meeting before being implemented.</p>

<h2>Classification of an outbreak</h2>

<p>An outbreak or incident may be defined in epidemiological terms as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an incident in which 2 or more people experiencing a similar illness are linked in time or place</li>
  <li>a greater than expected rate of infection compared with the usual background rate for the place and time where the outbreak has occurred</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 or more cases of diarrhoea or vomiting which are in the same classroom, shared communal areas or taking part in the same activities</li>
  <li>higher than usual number of people diagnosed with scabies</li>
  <li>higher than usual number of people with respiratory symptoms</li>
</ul>

<p>These definitions should not be taken as a threshold for reporting or action. Please follow the guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="#_When_to_seek">above</a> for when to seek help or report infections in your setting.</p>

<h2>Confidentiality</h2>

<p>It is important to note that health protection teams are bound to manage personal case details in strict confidence. Therefore, information given to settings from the team for distribution during an outbreak will never name cases or give out any personal details.</p>

<p>Organisations where cases are identified are also bound to manage personal case details in strict confidence.</p>

<p>Read further information on the Personal Information Charter which can be found on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education/about/personal-information-charter">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

    <li role="doc-endnote">
      <p>It is acknowledged  that all education and childcare settings have a baseline level of absences and that it is not always possible to know what children are ill with but that a setting may be able to identify where there is a noticeable change in absences over a few days or successive weeks, for example, ‘a rapidly increasing number’ may look like a doubling of absences across the setting or in a year group in a short space of time.&nbsp;<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
    </li>
    <li role="doc-endnote">
      <p>Being admitted to hospital is generally an indication of severe illness where this requires at least an overnight stay (note: where you are informed that assessment and discharge from a hospital ward have occurred on the same day this is not the same as being admitted and does not indicate a more severe illness)&nbsp;<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
    </li>
    <li role="doc-endnote">
      <p>Any decision for education or childcare settings to temporarily limit attendance for business continuity reasons, such as staff shortages, is for the setting management and local authority. Any communication to parents, carers and staff should make clear that this decision has not been made on public health grounds.&nbsp;<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
