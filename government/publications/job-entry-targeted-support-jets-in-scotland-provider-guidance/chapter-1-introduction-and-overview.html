<h2>Overview of <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland</h2>

<p>1.08	From 25 of January 2021 <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland will provide early light-touch employment support to complement the wider labour market offer of support through a sector-based approach that responds to local priorities.</p>

<p>1.09	<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland provides a light touch provision that includes, but is not limited to, transferable skills analysis, CV writing, job search, interview skills, self-efficacy/confidence building in the current environment, take a sector-based approach and help potential participants who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are of working age (18 in Scotland to State Pension age)</li>
  <li>have the right to reside and enter employment in the UK</li>
  <li>are in receipt of Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) in the All Work Related Requirements Group (Intensive Work-Search Regime) or New Style <abbr title="JSA (Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> at the point of referral</li>
  <li>have been unemployed for 13 weeks or more (not in any type of employment including zero hour contracts)</li>
  <li>in receipt of benefits for 13 weeks or more (periods of furlough are not counted)</li>
  <li>are motivated to find work and require light touch employment support</li>
  <li>are not in receipt of payments from the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note: State Pension age can vary per potential Participant.</p>

<p>1.10	In order to achieve sustained employment outcomes, the Provider will be required to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide Participants with targeted support which complements the wider labour market offer in their locality</li>
  <li>have strong links to Scottish, national and local employers</li>
  <li>link up and integrate with local services; and</li>
  <li>take a holistic approach to tackling barriers to employment faced by Participants</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Responsibilities</h2>

<p>1.11	Whilst Participants are on <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland some of the Provider’s key responsibilities are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>acknowledging a Participant referral and make contact with the Participant within 2 (two) working days</li>
  <li>ensuring the initial start appointment with the Participant takes place within 15 (fifteen) working days of the referral from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>helping Participants to find and stay in sustainable work by engaging with the Participants in accordance with the contract</li>
  <li>ensuring Exit Reports are produced within the final 10 (ten) working days of participation, and retained by the Provider until requested by Jobcentre Plus. You should issue a copy of the Exit Report form to the Participant within the last 10 (ten) workings days of the Participant completing the programme; and</li>
  <li>meeting the requirements of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Customer Service Standards (<abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note: The Provider’s performance against the above requirements (and others) will be measured. See <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr> for <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland in <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland Provider Guidance- Chapter 11 Performance Management, MI Requirements, Compliance and Assurance. For key timelines please see Annex X <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland quick guide to key timelines for Providers.</p>

<p>1.12	  While Participants are on the <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland, Jobcentre Plus will continue to maintain contact with them every 4 (four) weeks. Providers are expected to keep contact/personal details up to date.</p>

<p>1.13	Jobcentre Plus will continue where possible to collect any informal feedback that Participants volunteer about the services they receive from the Provider. This may be passed to the Provider’s performance managers.</p>

<p>1.14	The Provider must ensure Participants are fully informed about the Provider complaints process. Further information can be found in the <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland Provider Guidance Chapter 7 – Participant Complaints.</p>

<h2>Travel and additional costs</h2>

<p>1.15	You must ensure Participants are not worse off by virtue of attending <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland.</p>

<p>1.16	You must, at your expense, pay each Participant costs for travel to attend <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland Provision. If the Participant attends interviews arranged by you e.g. to undertake work related activities, job interviews or other related interviews, then you are responsible for funding their travel costs.</p>

<p>1.17	If the Participant attends interviews arranged by the Participant on your behalf and you have agreed to the costs to be incurred e.g. to undertake work related activities, job interviews or other related interviews, then you are responsible for funding their travel costs.</p>

<p>1.18	If the Participant contacts you to notify you about attending an interview that they have arranged, without previously discussing with you, it will be your decision as to whether or not you will cover the costs.</p>

<p>1.19	You must also at your expense pay childcare care costs if it poses a barrier to the potential Participant participating in <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland Provision.</p>

<p>1.20	There is no requirement to provide a Participant with travel expenses once they have moved into work, however, should you wish to offer to fund travel costs to cover the time between any last benefit payment and first salary payment, this will be at your discretion and will not be included in outcome payment claims.</p>

<h2>Key interactions with Jobcentre Plus</h2>

<p>1.21	While the Participant is on <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland, you will need to work together with Jobcentre Plus. 
1.22	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will notify the Provider if we become aware that a Participant has a change in their circumstance, the following changes will be prioritised if the Participant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>dies</li>
  <li>becomes a victim of domestic abuse</li>
  <li>becomes ill</li>
  <li>becomes Homeless; and/or</li>
  <li>develops complex needs</li>
</ul>

<p>1.23	It is essential that the Provider is in regular contact with the Participant to ensure the Provider has the latest personal information.</p>

<h2>Duration on Programme</h2>

<p>1.24	Once a Participant starts on <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland the Provider has 182 calendar days to work with that Participant, to help them into sustained employment.</p>

<p>1.25	Unless a Participant completes early, the Provider will be expected to deliver 182 calendar days of 
continuous support.</p>

<p>1.26	A tracking period for Job Outcomes of 56 calendar days will immediately follow the maximum 182 calendar days on the programme. Then there is an additional 61 days to track late Real Time Earnings (<abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr>) notifications and for providers to submit self-employment claims.</p>
