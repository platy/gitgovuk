<p>This is Job Entry: Targeted Support (JETS) in Scotland provider guidance.</p>
</div>

<h2>Participant completes <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland</h2>

<p>6.01	Providers are required to complete an Exit Report form (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER) which must be shared with the participant. This form must be shared with Jobcentre Plus upon request and can be found at Annex G on Jaggaer. This is for all Participants who complete 182 calendar days and for all completers who are not in employment or self-employment.</p>

<h2>Participant reaches 182 days on <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland</h2>

<p>6.02	Participation on <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland will end at 182 days where a Participant has not worked and reached the earnings threshold or a self-employment claim has not been paid. Or if the participant is not an early completer.</p>

<p>6.03	Whilst the participant ends provision on day 182 (if not achieved an outcome or an early completer), the Provider Referral and Payment (<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>) System will automatically calculate the end date for <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland Participants on 299 calendar days (this includes 182 calendar days on programme, 56 calendar days tracking period and a further 61 days for late HMRC notifications/claims) based on the start date you input following initial engagement. The line will automatically close in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> after the 299 calendar days.</p>

<p>6.04	You will not be required to complete an Exit Report form (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER) in the following exceptional circumstances for Participants who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>move abroad for a period longer than the remaining time on the programme</li>
  <li>are diagnosed with a terminal illness</li>
  <li>move onto alternative contracted provision; or</li>
  <li>become deceased during time on programme</li>
</ul>

<h2>Early completers</h2>

<p>6.05	An early completer is someone whose time on programme ends before the 182 calendar daysâ is reached.</p>

<p>6.06	 A Participant will complete <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland early in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>obtains employment and reaches the Â£1,000 earnings threshold</li>
  <li>achieves a self-employment outcome; or</li>
  <li>is referred to other alternative support by Jobcentre Plus that is not compatible with <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland, including for example, when they are subsequently identified as needing more intensive support. For further information on compatibility see Annex D â Compatibility with other Provisions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Participant reaches earnings threshold/self-employed claim fully validated</h2>

<p>6.07	When the employment outcome/self-employed outcome is achieved the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> record payment line will automatically close in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Participant moves abroad</h2>

<p>6.08	When a Participant moves abroad for a period longer than the remaining time on the programme, you should enter the date and completer reason â46 â Exceptional circumstancesâ into <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> to end their time on programme.</p>

<h2>Participant is diagnosed with a terminal illness</h2>

<p>6.09	Participants diagnosed with a terminal illness will have the choice to remain on the programme if they wish.</p>

<p>6.10	If you are notified by Jobcentre Plus that they no longer wish to take part in the programme (via a change of circumstances form), you should enter the date and completer reason â46 â Exceptional circumstancesâ into <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> to end their time on programme.</p>

<h2>Participant death</h2>

<p>6.11	If you are notified by Jobcentre Plus of a Participant death, you should enter the end date and completer reason â43 â Customer deceasedâ into <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> to end their time on programme.</p>

<p>6.12	The end date entered must be their actual date of death and not the date that the notification of the Participantâs death was received. Further information can be found in <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland Provider Guidance Chapter 10 â Change of circumstances and notifications.</p>

<h2>Participants signposted to other alternative provision</h2>

<p>6.13	You may be notified by Jobcentre Plus that the Participant will be referred to a more suitable <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> contracted provision. You will be notified of this via a change of circumstances form (UC78e or CEPD1). Upon receipt of the form, you should update the Participantâs record with completer reason â46- Exceptional circumstancesâ. Further information can be found in <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland Provider Guidance Chapter 10 - Change of circumstances and notifications.</p>

<h2>The purpose of the Exit Report Form</h2>

<p>6.14	The Exit Report form (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER) will be a key tool used to determine the most appropriate type of support for Participants upon their return to Jobcentre Plus.  It should also provide information for the participant to enable them to move closer to or into employment.</p>

<p>6.15	Jobcentre Plus work coaches will use the Exit Report forms (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER) you produce to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>build a profile of the Participant following their experience on <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland; and</li>
  <li>understand the level of support the Participant may require following <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland</li>
</ul>

<p>6.16	You must use the standard Exit Report form (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER) that has been supplied by Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<h2>Provider completes Exit Report Form</h2>

<h3>Participant present</h3>

<p>6.17	You should identify Participants who are due to complete the programme who are not in employment or self-employment and arrange an interview to complete the Exit report form with them within the last 10 working days of the Participant being on the programme.</p>

<p>6.18	An Exit Report form (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER) has been provided to you which meets the requirements for this programme. This form includes a summary of the Participantâs time on provision, along with details of additional support that can be accessed to support them going forward.</p>

<p>6.19	You must complete all Exit Report forms (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER) with Participants via a telephone conversation, video conference or any other method permitted by the contract, annotating in the report where you have been unable to obtain a Participantâs signature due to the COVID-19 event. You must retain a copy of the Exit Report form (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER) securely.</p>

<p>6.20	You should issue a copy of the Exit Report form (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER) to the Participant within the last 10 (ten) working days of the Participant completing the programme.</p>

<h3>Participant not present</h3>

<p>6.21	If you are no longer engaged with the Participant, you must complete the exit report independently. This will include a summary of the Participantâs time on provision, along with details of additional support that can be accessed to support them going forward. You should note your records that participant has disengaged.</p>

<p>6.22	The Exit Report form (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER) should be completed and a copy issued to the Participant within the last 10 (ten) working days of the Participant completing the programme, up to 182 days.</p>

<p>6.23	In instances where you have been unable to obtain a Participantâs signature, Jobcentre Plus may confirm the accuracy of the content with the Participant.</p>

<h2>Failure to attend the meeting</h2>

<p>6.24	Where you are unable to complete the Exit Report form with the Participant, for example they refuse to attend or fail to participate, you must still complete the Exit Report form (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER).  You must include reasons for non-attendance (if known) and why a signature was not possible; for example, annotating the report âno signature obtained due to COVID-19 eventâ; âdeclined appointment offersâ, or âno longer engagedâ, if the Participant has disengaged.</p>

<p>6.25	Where you are unable to issue a copy of the Exit Report form (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER) face to face, you must arrange for a copy to be sent to the Participant within the last 10 (ten) working days of completing the programme.</p>

<p>Consequence: Failing to issue a copy of the Exit report form (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER) to the Participant within the last 10 (ten) working days of the Participant completing the programme, will constitute failure to meet your Customer Service Standard (<abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr>).</p>

<h2>Completing the Exit Report Form</h2>

<p>6.26	The Exit Report form(<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER) must as a minimum include the following factual information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Participant surname</li>
  <li>Participant National Insurance number (<abbr title="National Insurance number">NINo</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Summary â actions undertaken, including activities such as:

      <li>qualifications</li>
      <li>skills achieved</li>
      <li>How the Participant benefited from the programme</li>
      <li>the progress against the activities undertaken by the Participant whilst on the programme; and</li>
      <li>details of additional support that can be accessed to support them going forward</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

      <li>CV writing</li>
      <li>Application Process</li>
      <li>Skills analysis including identified transferable skills</li>
      <li>Help with support to consider different employment sectors/routes; and ways of working including home working</li>
      <li>Re-building confidence and self-efficacy in a COVID-19 environment</li>
      <li>Signposted to other support (such as Local skills provision, Fair Start Scotland, NEA); and</li>
      <li>Other</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Next steps â with your recommendations to the Participant and Jobcentre Plus on the most appropriate further support</li>
</ul>

<p>6.27	The Exit Report form (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER) should include meaningful and personalised information, which will provide Jobcentre Plus with an insight into the Participants journey on programme. There is no minimum word count when completing the Exit Report form (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER), it contains tick boxes but additional information should be included where applicable. When completing the Exit Report (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER) you must adhere to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/framework-generic-guidance-provider-guidance"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> security as per Generic Provider Guidance Chapter 8 â Information Security</a>.</p>

<p>6.28	You should not include any Participant information that may be defined as Special Category data (as defined by the General Data Protection Regulations (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulations">GDPR</abbr>) in these forms.</p>

<p>6.29	You must comply with General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulations">GDPR</abbr>) requirements when processing Exit Report forms (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER).</p>

<p>6.30	Where you are unable to issue the Exit Report form (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER) face to face you must make arrangements for the form to be emailed or posted to the Participant. Before emailing or posting the Exit Report form (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER) you must ensure the Participant is aware of the risks of sending personal information to them via email or post. Where you are unable to inform them of this risk you must ensure no sensitive personal data is sent.</p>

<h2>Jobcentre Plus Requests Exit Report Form (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER)</h2>

<p>6.31	Jobcentre Plus may request Exit Report forms (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER) they wish to see when Participants complete the programme or return to Jobcentre Plus. Requests will be sent when required by unencrypted email. Each request will be made individually for each Participant and will contain the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>National Insurance Number (<abbr title="National Insurance number">NINo</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Jobcentre Plus Office</li>
  <li>request date</li>
  <li>report return deadline</li>
  <li>benefit type</li>
  <li>end date; and</li>
  <li>return email address</li>
</ul>

<p>6.32	The request will inform you of the completion date and the deadline for return of the Exit Report form (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER) to Jobcentre Plus and will set a read receipt.</p>

<p>6.33	The email will contain the header â<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland Exit Report Form Requestâ and on receipt of the email you should accept the read receipt.</p>

<p>6.34	You may receive an Exit Report form request from Jobcentre Plus for a Participant outside of your Contract Package Area (<abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr>)/Scotland who you have been supporting. These requests should be actioned in the same way as for Participants in your <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr>/Scotland.</p>

<p>Please Note: During the COVID-19 event there may be a delay to Jobcentre Plus requesting Exit Report forms. You should still complete them in every instance as described above.</p>

<h2>Provider returns Exit Report Form (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER) to Jobcentre Plus</h2>

<p>6.35	All Exit Report forms (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER) requested must be sent to Jobcentre Plus, via unencrypted email, within 10 (ten) working days of the request being made. Day 1 will be the date the request is made by Jobcentre Plus.</p>
