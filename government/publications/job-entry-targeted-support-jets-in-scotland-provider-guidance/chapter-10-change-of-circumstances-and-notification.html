<p>This is Job Entry: Targeted Support (JETS) in Scotland provider guidance.</p>
</div>

<h2>Provider notifies <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of Change of Circumstances (Disengagement/Re-engagement)</h2>

<p>10.01 There are three occasions where you must notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of a change of circumstances whilst on the Job Entry: Targeted Support (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) in Scotland. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when a Participant, after their start on the programme, has disengaged with you</li>
  <li>when a participant has re-engaged with you following a period of disengagement after having started on the programme; and</li>
  <li>after a change in the Participant’s circumstance and through discussions with them you jointly identify that alternative provision may better support the Participant. This must be in agreement with Jobcentre Plus</li>
</ul>

<p>10.02 Disengagement occurs when a Participant is no longer interacting with you for a continued period. Disengagement after starting on the programme is defined as a Participant failing to attend appointments or complete activities as agreed with you; and you have tried to re-engage with them at least three times on separate occasions/days within 10 (ten) working days from the date of the missed appointment or incomplete activities. The first attempt being within two working days as per your Customer Service Standards (<abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr>).</p>

<p>Please note: any attempted contact or interaction with a Participant must be recorded on the Participant’s record.</p>

<p>10.03 A Participant may also disengage from the programme if they inform you that they consider that they have received the support that they require from the programme and no longer wish to participate.</p>

<p>10.04 The disengagement process should be followed if you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attempted to re-engage with the Participant and not been able to make contact; or</li>
  <li>not received any notification from Jobcentre Plus to inform you of a change of circumstances on a CEPD1 or UC78e form</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disengagement Process after starting</h2>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If a Participant notifies you that they no longer wish to participate, or if you are unable to engage with the participant, you should notify Jobcentre Plus of the dis-engagement using the change of circumstances notification form (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S07); sent via unencrypted email</li>
  <li>You should attempt to discuss and agree a contact arrangement with the Participant for the remainder of their time on the programme, as agreed in your tender.  This will enable them to access any additional support they may require, as their circumstances may change and they may want to re-engage</li>
  <li>You must record the outcome of this discussion in the Participant’s records. Do not enter an early completer code into the Provider Referral and Payment (<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>) system. The place on the programme will remain open for the duration of the 182 calendar days to enable re-engagement, if appropriate</li>
</ul>

<p>10.05 If a Participant fails to attend an appointment or undertake agreed activities with you after they have attended the initial appointment and started, you must attempt to contact the Participant on 3 separate occasions/days within 10 (ten) working days (or alternative contact timescale if agreed). The first attempt being within 2 (two) working days. You must update your records for each attempt. If you fail to re-engage with the Participant within this timescale, you must notify Jobcentre Plus via a <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S07 of the Participant’s disengagement.</p>

<p>10.06 You must notify Jobcentre Plus on the first day you deem a Participant has disengaged from the programme by sending a <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S07 form. Only one <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S07 form should be sent per Participant by unencrypted email.</p>

<p>10.07 When notifying Jobcentre Plus of disengagement the <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S07 change of circumstances form must include details of the referring office and Jobcentre Plus work coach. The email subject field must contain the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland Participant Disengagement; or</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland Participant “alternative support discussion” (for those proposing to move to an alternative provision)</li>
  <li>Participants surname; and</li>
  <li>last three digits of their National Insurance Number (<abbr title="National Insurance number">NINo</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>10.08 A Jobcentre Plus work coach will contact the Participant to discuss participation on the programme. The work coach will notify you of the outcome of this interview on a CEPD1/UC78e change of circumstances form.</p>

<h2>Circumstances that are not considered disengagement – (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S07 not required for <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland)</h2>

<p>10.09 The disengagement process should not be followed and a <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S07 is not required to be completed in the following circumstances as there is contact with the Participant when you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make arrangements to tailor the level of engagement with a Participant who you are in contact with due to a change in circumstances, for example a Participant may have an operation and require two-weeks recovery. It is possible that a Participant’s participation will be affected by a change of circumstances or period of ill health. In these circumstances it may be appropriate to tailor engagement</li>
  <li>receive a CEPD1/UC78e change of circumstances notification from Jobcentre Plus where you may be asked to suspend or reduce engagement due to an easement (usually for a finite period of time); or</li>
  <li>are informed by Jobcentre Plus that the Participant wishes to disengage from the programme because they require no further support. Via phone/ email or letter, etc. you should agree a contact arrangement with the Participant for the remainder of their time on programme to enable them to access any additional support they may require as their circumstances may change and they may want to re-engage.  You may agree no further contact if the participant is adamant they do not want to re-engage for the remainder of the programme</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compliance Checks</h2>

<p>10.10 The <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Provider Compliance Officer (<abbr title="Provider Compliance Officer">PCO</abbr>) will review evidence of your disengagement/re-engagement process at regular intervals against what you have agreed to deliver in your bid and against your <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr>. However, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is aware that some Participants may not wish to receive continued support and engagement from Providers, and they may not be receptive to continuing attempts by Providers to keep in touch.</p>

<p>10.11 It is appropriate in these cases to support the needs of the Participant; therefore, you should ensure you annotate your records in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a Participant has asked you not to contact them again; or</li>
  <li>you have agreed to suspend/reduce engagement due to a change of circumstances (usually for a finite period)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Re-engagement – Completion of <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S07</h2>

<p>10.12 You must notify Jobcentre Plus on the <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S07 change of circumstances notification form and send one form per email, per Participant, by unencrypted e-mail when the Participant re-engages with you.</p>

<p>10.13 When notifying of Jobcentre Plus re-engagement, the <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S07 change of circumstances form must include details of the referring office and Jobcentre work coach. The email subject field must contain the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland Participant Re-Engagement</li>
  <li>Participant’s surname; and</li>
  <li>last three digits of their National Insurance Number (<abbr title="National Insurance number">NINo</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>10.14 To mitigate the risk of data being lost, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Operational Security has restricted the number of client records that may be transmitted via the unencrypted email process to a maximum of one participant record per form per email. If more than one participant record per email is sent via the unencrypted email process, this will constitute a security breach and must be reported to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> as per current instructions (see Generic Provider Guidance, Chapter 8 Information Security).</p>

<p>10.15 If you receive more than one form in an email and you are satisfied that the Participants are attached to you or your sub-contractors, you may process the change as normal as well as reporting this as a security incident to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Operational Security (see Generic Provider Guidance, Chapter 8 – Information Security).</p>

<p>10.16 If you receive a form for a potential participant who is not attached to you or your sub-contractors, you must report the security incident (see Generic Provider Guidance, Chapter 8 Information Security) and then delete the email and form(s). The format of the Jobcentre Plus email addresses will be ‘firstname.lastname@dwp.gov.uk’.</p>

<p>Please Note: All notifications for Special Customer Record (<abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr>) Participants will remain clerical notifications and will not be sent via email. Further information regarding <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> cases and what action you need to take please refer to Generic Provider Guidance Chapter 2, Delivering Provision.</p>

<h2>Forwarding emails to your sub-contractors</h2>

<p>10.17 You may forward UC78e or CEPD1 change of circumstances forms received by unencrypted email to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> approved sub-contractors and inboxes within your organisation, provided that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no more than one Participant record at a time is emailed</li>
  <li>a business need to share the information exists and sharing protocols are followed; and</li>
  <li>the recipient is legitimately entitled to receive the information (emails must not be automatically forwarded without ensuring this)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please Note: You must keep a record of where and when you sent the notification form for three months.</p>

<h2>Contingency process</h2>

<p>10.18 There may be occasions when due to circumstances such as IT failure you are temporarily unable to receive change of circumstances via unencrypted email from Jobcentre Plus offices.</p>

<p>10.19 In these circumstances you must ensure that your <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> District Third Party Provision Manager (<abbr title="Third Party Provision Manager">TPPM</abbr>) listed below, is kept informed of the situation and how long you anticipate it lasting.</p>

<h2>Self-Employment whilst on <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Please Note: During the COVID-19 event Jobcentre Plus will be resuming some Self-employment gateway interviews. However, this is subject to local operations, therefore you may not be notified of any self-employed <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> compliance activity and outcomes.</p>

<p>10.56 When a Participant report that they are self-employed, a Jobcentre Plus Gateway Interview is needed to provide an assessment of whether the Participant and/or partner is in gainful self-employment for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> purposes. You should advise the Participant to telephone the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Service Centre to arrange a Gateway Interview to disclose their self-employment. Jobcentre Plus will inform the Participant on the latest requirements. For further information see Overview of the Self Employment Gateway Interview which can be found on Annex A on Jaggaer.</p>

<p>10.57 The requirements set out in this section are for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> purposes only to advise you of what a Participant will need to do to meet the conditionality requirements of being self-employed whilst on <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>.

<p>10.61 If the Participant is treated as being gainfully self-employed, the Jobcentre Plus work coach will book a subsequent self-employed quarterly interview to take place at three, six and nine month stages. At the end of each quarterly interview (or at any other time when a change is reported), the Jobcentre Plus work coach will notify you if the Participant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has ceased self-employment</li>
  <li>start-up period has come to an end</li>
  <li>is no longer gainfully self-employed; or</li>
  <li>remains gainfully self-employed, but have not taken sufficient steps to increase their earnings during a start-up period. Where the start-up period ends, the Participant’s Labour Market Regime will be amended to Working Enough Regime if they would otherwise fall within the Intensive Work Search Regime and their participation becomes voluntary</li>
