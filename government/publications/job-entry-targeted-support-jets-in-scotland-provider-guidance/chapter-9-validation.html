<p>This is Job Entry: Targeted Support (JETS) in Scotland provider guidance.</p>
</div>

<h2>Validation Overview</h2>

<p>9.01. The Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) may, at its absolute discretion, undertake performance validation. We may vary the approach to validation to ensure ultimately we only verify legitimate outcomes.</p>

<p>9.02. For Self-Employed Outcomes you must report a qualifying outcome to the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) via Provider Referrals and Payment (<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>) System within the time limits. Self-Employed validation will be a mix of automated and manual checks pre and/or post payment. If applicable, the Special Customer Record (<abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr>) clerical claims process (as detailed further in this chapter) will also be subject to manual validation checks.</p>

<p>9.03. For Self-Employed Outcomes you must report a qualifying outcome to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> via <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> when you can robustly evidence the duration of self-employment and the job outcome criteria is met.</p>

<p>9.04. <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland eligibility for participants includes the receipt of Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) for those in the Intensive Work-Search regime or New Style Job Seeker’s Allowance (NS <abbr title="JSA (Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>).  Being on these benefits is compatible with the outcome definition, therefore an off-benefit check is not required to validate claims for <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland.</p>

<p>9.05. Where the Participant has claimed <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> during the claim period, a check may be undertaken to establish compliance with the appropriate conditionality regime. However, validators will seek assurance from various sources when conducting validation.</p>

<p>9.06. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may conduct pre-payment and/or post-payment sampling and may vary how the checks are carried out, within the terms of the contract to achieve legitimate outcomes. If <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> decides to alter the validation approach during the lifetime of the contract, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may include extrapolation where samples of outcomes are checked from across a wider population of claims.</p>

<p>9.07. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may conduct pre and/or post payment validation checks to determine whether you are entitled to receive payment(s) against the claims submitted and will recover any overpayment(s). This will be in accordance with the provision in your contract.</p>

<p>9.08. In a sampling regime where <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> identify incorrect outcomes, not only will these be recovered but the error rate will also inform any extrapolation calculation, which will be applied across untested like for like claims from the same period.</p>

<h2>Employed Outcomes</h2>

<p>9.09. Participants moving into employment (not self-employment) will be identified by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> solely using <abbr title="Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Real Time Earnings (<abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr>) or Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) on-line earnings data submitted by employers (subject to the notification by you of any Non-Qualifying Earnings and/or Special Customer Record (<abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr>) provision for clerical claims). This data is submitted to <abbr title="Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> each time an employee is paid by an employer and no evidence of this is required from you except in relation to paragraph 9.14.</p>

<p>9.10. Your outcomes will be based on the information contained within this <abbr title="Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> on-line earnings data. Further details can be found in Job Entry: Targeted Support (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) in Scotland Provider Guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/job-entry-targeted-support-jets-in-scotland-provider-guidance/chapter-8-payment-model-and-outcomes">Chapter 8  – Payment Model and Outcomes</a>.</p>

<p>9.11. The Outcome qualifying period runs for 238 calendar days from the Participant’s start date. Only earnings received within that period will count.</p>

<p>9.12. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will track Participant earnings from <abbr title="Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> data (by setting an ‘interest’ for the data) for the qualifying period - 238 calendar days from the Participant’s start date and will continue to look for late earnings received in the 61 calendar days after the 238th day up to day 299. Where a Participant exits the programme early the Department will end the registered interest with <abbr title="Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. Where an Employed Outcome is achieved <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will also end the interest with <abbr title="Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>9.13. The earnings will be cumulative from the Start Date of the 238 calendar days, but will be sought for 299 calendar days in case of late notification. This could be made up of earnings from any employment during the 238 calendar day period. Earnings prior to starting on the programme will not count towards an outcome. Earnings from any Non-Qualifying Period will also not count towards an outcome. For the avoidance of doubt, this includes all earnings during this period, regardless of the source of the earnings.</p>

<p>9.14. Tax refunds, payments in lieu of notice, payments made as a part of being Armed Forces Reservists, other retainer payments, and payments that are not related to qualifying employment generated whilst on <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland provision, can trigger a non-qualifying Outcome Payment. You must inform <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> when you are aware of these payments so that an Outcome Payment is not made. Further information can be found in <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland Provider Guidance Chapter 8 – Payment Model and Outcomes.</p>

<p>Please note – only one Outcome can be achieved per Participant and must be wholly achieved in either employment or self-employment. Self-Employed earnings cannot be combined with direct employment earnings for the purpose of achieving an Outcome.</p>

<p>9.15. As Employed Outcomes occur you will be able to generate a report in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> which details this information. This report will also contain information about when first earnings are registered for a Participant once they have started on the programme. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will not supply the name or address of a Participant’s employer.</p>

<p>9.16. The Employed Outcome process is automated. Once an Outcome has been achieved, or 299 calendar days for <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland have elapsed from the Participant’s Start Date the payment line will be automatically closed.  The line will also be closed when you notify <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> of an early completer. You will not have a right to appeal or request reconsideration of Employed Outcomes.</p>

<h2>Self-Employed Outcome – Validation Process</h2>

<p>9.17. You must ensure that you only submit accurate information for self- employment outcomes to which you are entitled. Where you are aware that a Participant has started employment which cannot be counted towards an Outcome in accordance with your Contract (i.e. any Non-Qualifying Period) you must inform <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to avoid incorrect outcomes being paid. Further information can be found in Job Entry: Targeted Support (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) in Scotland Provider Guidance Chapter 8 – Payment Model and Outcomes.</p>

<p>9.18. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will, to the extent it deems necessary, undertake checks on Outcomes you have achieved.</p>

<p>9.19. You are required to maintain, on an ongoing basis, a robust system of internal records and control, sufficient not only to support any Outcome claims you make, but also to allow you to undertake internal management checks and enable independent testing and validation by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and other external bodies. The records maintained must document how and when the appropriate supporting evidence was obtained and must be accurate at the point any validation is to/or does take place.</p>

<p>9.20. The risk of records being inaccurate and/or incomplete is wholly borne by you.</p>

<p>9.21. The onus is on you to collect and retain job outcome evidence as required.</p>

<p>9.22. As the data supplied by <abbr title="Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> does not contain earnings from self-employment, these outcomes are based on duration of Self-Employment and you will be required to claim all Self-Employed outcomes. You must update <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> with the date the self-employment started.</p>

<p>9.23. It is up to you to ensure that at the point of submitting a Self-Employed outcome you are entitled to do so.</p>

<p>9.24. To enable a successful Self-Employed Outcome claim, you must hold sufficient evidence for the entire claim period (up to and including the last date) proving that the Participant is Self-Employed. In addition, you must provide current, accurate and valid contact details for the Participant to enable <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to gain a response from the Participant and allow full validation to take place.</p>

<p>9.25. For the avoidance of doubt, any Self-Employed Outcome claim without a date, inaccurate or invalid contact details for the Participant including but not limited to not known at this address responses, dead letter boxes and unobtainable or out of date telephone numbers, will result in a claim being categorised as an Outcome Fail.</p>

<p>Please note: the information must be accurate at both the point of submission and the point of validation.</p>

<p>9.26. Self-Employment will be tracked solely by you. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> does not prescribe the way in which you should track or record information about self-employment activity. However, the evidence should demonstrate that it meets the <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland definition of self-employment.</p>

<p>9.27. In addition to current, accurate and valid contact details for the Participant, you must obtain evidence to confirm the Participant has been Self-Employed for the relevant period, this could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> registration.</li>
  <li>Proof of benefit claim closed (letter issued to claimant by Jobcentre Plus).</li>
  <li>Bank statement showing details of recent transactions/earnings.</li>
  <li>Invoices, purchase orders received/sent recently which are clearly in relation to the running of business.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please Note: this list is neither prescriptive, nor exhaustive</p>

<p>9.28. You will need to retain a suite of evidence to corroborate the totality of the trading period prior to making a claim.</p>

<p>9.29. There is specific information that you are required to input to the Job Details Screen within <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> when you submit a Self-Employed Outcome claim:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Current, accurate and valid Contact details, including the current address, contact name, full business telephone number and email address (where applicable). Please note, a valid telephone number is always required as this is the contact method used when validating a Self-Employed Outcome, unless in exceptional circumstances another method is used through your prior agreement with the Department</li>
  <li>The Participant’s contact details, where different from above</li>
  <li>Start date of self-employment</li>
  <li>End date of self-employment (where already known)</li>
</ul>

<p>9.30. Where <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> identifies that there are a significant number of Self-Employed Outcome claims but the start and end dates as submitted are unaligned, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may review your internal assurance processes.</p>

<p>9.31. For Self-Employed Participants your entitlement to claim a Self-Employed Outcome will be triggered when a Participant achieves and you can robustly evidence a cumulative period of not less than 56 days/8 weeks Self-Employment. i.e. self-employment lasting for 8 weeks, achieved within 238 days from the Participant’s Start Date. Please See Chapter 8 – Payment Model and Outcomes for examples of evidence to support claims.</p>

<p>9.32. To achieve a Self-Employed Outcome, you must submit a claim for a Self-  Employed Outcome through <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> within the 299-day period from the Participant’s Start Date. This is made up of the maximum 238 calendar days qualifying period in which Self-Employed Outcomes are achievable, and a 61-day period to claim the Outcome. The claim must be made within 90 days of the outcome being achieved (i.e. all job outcome is criteria met and you can robustly evidence self-employment).</p>

<p>Please note: Self-employed claims need to be submitted up to a maximum of 90 days from achievement, or up to the 299th calendar day from the date the participant started provision, whichever is the shorter. The authority may alter/set other such periods at their absolute discretion.</p>

<p>Please note: for self-employment validation purposes, a week is defined as   a seven-day period where a minimum of one day meets the criteria.</p>

<p>9.33. When a claim is received, <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> will conduct an automated check to see if the claim is submitted within the 90-day time limit for claiming outcomes.  If submitted within the time limit, the outcome will go on hold for manual validation.</p>

<p>9.34. A claim received outside of the 90-day time limit will be backed out of <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> and will not count towards one of the 3 attempts to claim.</p>

<p>9.35	Outcomes will be released and paid if they pass the manual validation or are considered Unable to Validate (<abbr title="Unable to Validate">UTV</abbr>). In this scenario <abbr title="Provider Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr> has either not been able to contact the employer and/or participant, or they are unable/unwilling to provide the information required to validate the outcome (see 9.38).  All claims will be backed out if the claim fails this manual check.  You will be able to make a further attempt to claim, provided you are satisfied the outcome definition criteria has been met and you are within a maximum of 3 attempts to claim a payment for this participant.</p>

<p>Please note: if your claim fails manual validation, you are only allowed three attempts in total to claim. If the third claim fails it will remain a fail and be recorded as an Outcome Fail. At this point the line will be closed. If an Employed Outcome is later achieved, this will be identified and counted as a performance outcome as part of the settlement process.</p>

<p>9.36. All outcomes will be subjected to manual validation, which may include the following or other sources of assurance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>checks within the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> system, to determine if participants are/were complying with the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> conditionality for self-employment</li>
  <li>direct contact with the Participant; and/or</li>
  <li>contacting the subcontractor (if appropriate)</li>
</ul>

<p>9.37. For those claims being subjected to manual validation there are three possible validation results – pass, fail, or unable to validate:</p>

<h3>Pass</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> validation checks have confirmed the outcome definition (including the minimum required duration of self-employment) and associated requirements have been met. This may, at <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s discretion, include situations where the period(s) of self-employment confirmed by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> overlap with but differ from those detailed by the provider in their claim. The <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> system provides evidence of a cumulative 56 calendar day period of self-reported self-employment or the Participant confirms the condition for performance award, as set out in the Self-Employed Outcome validation definition, has been met</p>

<p>Please Note:  other assurances may be sought where it is not possible to evidence the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> gainfully Self-Employed requirements. For New Style <abbr title="JSA (Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> claimants, the Participant (or subcontractor if appropriate) will be contacted to confirm self-employment status for the relevant period.</p>

<h3>Fail</h3>

<p>There is insufficient evidence within the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> system of a cumulative 56 calendar day period of self-reported self-employment or Participant (or subcontractor) supplies information which means the condition for performance award, as set out in the Self-Employed Outcome validation definition, has not been met and/or a combination of both.  For the avoidance of doubt, where current, accurate and valid contact details for the Participant are not supplied, this will result in a claim being a Fail.  You can run reports in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> to show which claims are on hold and which have been backed out, i.e. the fails. <abbr title="Provider Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr> will also notify you by email of any validation ‘fails’</p>

<h3>Unable to Validate (<abbr title="Unable to Validate">UTV</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has either not been able to obtain a response from the Participant using the contact details supplied by you (you must ensure such details are current, accurate and valid), or the Participant is unable/unwilling to provide the information required to validate the Outcome. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will release payment within 30 days, but will continue to try to validate the Outcome after the claim has been approved and entered onto <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Please note: <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will continue to validate the claim once a payment has been released for up to a maximum of 90 days from the first date of the claim being received. Should it be <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> can satisfy an outcome decision action will be taken to override the original decision (pass, fail). However, should we be unable to do so, the claim will form part of the end of cohort apportionment.</p>

<p>9.38. Where validation is conducted through contacting the Participant, the primary method for this contact is via the telephone. By exception, for any participant Outcome claim, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will consider alternative contact methods to this approach by prior agreement. In cases where <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is experiencing difficulty making contact with the Participant via the telephone, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may contact you to confirm the details you have supplied in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>, which you must supply within five working days of request.</p>

<p>9.39. You are required to hold and supply correct information which is accurate at both the point of submitting an Outcome claim and at the point of validation of that Outcome and which enables <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to gain a response from the Participant.</p>

<p>9.40. If you do not provide sufficient detail with the claim it will fail validation. You will be advised of this and have five working days to reply but the claim will remain as an Outcome Fail, unless sufficient information is supplied to enable <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to gain a response within the prescribed time which then enables the claim to be successfully passed. Outcome Fails remaining at the end of the cohort will be used in the apportionment calculation.</p>

<p>9.41. Validation processes may differ dependent on whether the Participant is in receipt of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>.</p>

<p>9.42. For Participants in receipt of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will access pertinent data within a Participant’s <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> record. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will use this to determine if a Participant is gainfully Self-Employed for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> purposes, but may also seek other sources of assurance.</p>

<p>9.43. For <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> claimants <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will be checking that during a cumulative period of 56 calendar days or more the Participant is in receipt of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and earnings are declared monthly (in line with <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> requirements) to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>9.44. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will be checking:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if earnings are declared not the amount of the actual earnings; and</li>
  <li>where <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> is not in payment, that the Participant continues trading continuously</li>
</ul>

<p>9.45. Where <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> confirm a Participant is Self-Employed for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> purposes within their manual pre-payment validation checks, subject to also meeting the Self-Employed Outcome definition, the claim will be sent for   outcome payment as soon as this is confirmed.</p>

<p>9.46. Where <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> confirm a claim has passed validation and the Participant is Self-Employed (non <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and referred to <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> whilst on New Style <abbr title="JSA (Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>) subject to also meeting the Self-Employed Outcome definition, the claim will be sent for outcome payment.</p>

<h2>Review Process</h2>

<p>9.47. There will not be a Review process for this provision as you will have three attempts to claim a valid outcome.</p>

<h2>Attempts to validate</h2>

<p>9.48. Self-Employed outcomes that are not submitted in the time limit will fail and will be backed out of <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> allowing you to reclaim, should you wish to do so, having made the necessary corrections to your claim. Should a claim submitted on time fail validation and you can   establish a subsequent valid Self-Employed Outcome for the Participant, the line will be available for you in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>, to submit or resubmit another claim. It is expected that the necessary steps will have been taken to establish the validity of the claim and the information supplied with it.
However, Self-Employed claims can be submitted/resubmitted up to a maximum of three attempts in total, after this point you will only be able to secure an employed outcome for the participant.</p>

<h2>Unable to Validate action</h2>

<p>9.49. You will be notified when a Self-Employed Outcome has been counted but may become classed as Unable to Validate and therefore subjected to apportionment at the end of the 299 calendar days.</p>

<p>9.50. In these cases, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will continue to undertake validation activity on the Self-Employed Outcome.  If still unable to verify the outcome up to day 90 of the claim being received, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will add the instance to a cohort of <abbr title="Unable to Validate">UTV</abbr> claims, prior to apportionment. You will be notified when this occurs.</p>

<h2>Apportionment</h2>

<p>9.51. At the end of the cohort <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will recover an appropriate proportion of the paid <abbr title="Unable to Validate">UTV</abbr> value. This will be calculated via apportionment against the total self-employment claim population within that cohort. In instances where multiple self-employment claims for an individual have been made, only one ‘outcome’ will contribute to the apportionment calculation i.e. only the pass will be included in cases where previous failed claims were made and in instances where several failed claims are present at the end of the cohort, only one fail will be included.</p>

<p>9.52. In advance of the calculation a clerical Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) check will be performed to test if any legitimate employment outcomes had occurred whilst the line had remained paid as a <abbr title="Unable to Validate">UTV</abbr>. These cases would be reclassified as an employment outcome and removed entirely from the apportionment calculation.</p>

<p>9.53. Individuals that have the presence of one or more unsuccessful self-employment claims but a subsequent paid employment outcome prior to the end of the cohort will be included in the apportionment calculation. The apportionment results will be shared with you and a financial recovery total will be made as and when required.</p>

<h2>Settlement</h2>

<p>9.54. The Department will conduct a check of the start cohort taking into account factors which may have impacted upon the total figures such as apportionment. If necessary, the Department will recoup any outcomes.</p>

<p>9.55. The very last Outcome payment will be made by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to the supplier no later than 329 days (299 days possible claim window + 30 days to pay) after the last start on programme.</p>

<h2>Management Checking</h2>

<p>9.56. In addition to the validation principles set out above, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may also conduct management checks to further verify the validity and robustness of Self-Employed Outcomes claimed.</p>

<p>9.57. These checks will support the exploration of controls around Self-Employed Outcome. Although these management checks will not form part of the standard validation process, they will aid <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in identifying potential patterns or fraudulent activities.</p>

<p>9.58. An example of a management check might include investigating jobs undertaken by Participants or if the <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland Participant’s business has a footprint such as an operating website, etc.</p>

<h2>Special Customer Records (clerical claim process)</h2>

<p>9.59. The majority of claims must be submitted via <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> however, where you have a Participant who is granted Special Customer Records (<abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr>) status (as determined by <abbr title="Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) due to the very sensitive nature of data to be held on the participant e.g. witness protection, you are required to submit a claim following the <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> clerical claim process.</p>

<p>9.60. Where <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> identifies that <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> status is not granted the claim will be rejected.</p>

<p>9.61. Where you have a <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> claim, you are required to print off the PRaP11 <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S  form available at Annex H on Jaggaer and complete manually.</p>

<p>Please note: You must only submit claims on these forms on the rare occasions that <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> status is granted.</p>

<p>9.62. This clerical process mirrors the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> automated process however as <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will be unable to monitor earnings on an on-going basis you will be required to track the participant’s earnings and then invoke the clerical claim process at the point the employed earnings threshold has been met.</p>

<p>9.63. For self-employment the tracking, verification and requirement to have robust evidence will mirror the Self-Employed processes above (also see Chapter 8 – Payment Model and Outcomes). The Provider Payment Validation Team will check the claim has been submitted within the timeline and validate employment with employers and/or Participants. Incomplete forms will not be acted upon and will be returned.</p>

<p>9.64. Where you have a <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> claim, you will need to follow a clerical process. If you receive an SL2 clerical referral you must only submit claims on the PRaP11 <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S form after tracking a Participant’s employment and confirming an outcome has been achieved.</p>

<p>9.65. Guidance to assist you in the completion of the form can be found in the second tab of the spreadsheet.</p>

<p>9.66. For <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> employed outcomes where you submit a clerical claim, we will attempt manual validation of the claim. If the claim cannot be validated it will become classed as Unable to Validate and therefore subjected to apportionment at the end of the 299 calendar days.</p>
