<p>This is Job Entry: Targeted Support (JETS) in Scotland provider guidance.</p>
</div>

<h2>Action planning</h2>

<p>4.01	Your evidence of action planning must comply with the Contract, including, without limitation, the Customer Service Standards (<abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>) set out in your tender and the Specification.</p>

<p>4.02	Following the initial engagement and provision start appointment, with the Participant, you should start high-level, initial action planning activity. Further information regarding the initial appointment can be found in <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland Provider Guidance Chapter 3 – Referrals, initial Participant engagement and Starts.</p>

<p>4.03	You are required to complete a full Action Plan (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S <abbr title="Action Plan">AP</abbr>), which has been agreed by you and the 
Participant, within 10 (ten) working days of the Participant’s start date.</p>

<p>4.04	This is one of the <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr> which you will be performance managed against. Further information can be found in <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland, Provider Guidance Chapter 11 Performance Management, MI Requirements, Compliance and Assurance. Where you are unable to obtain a Participant signature, annotate the Action Plan (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S <abbr title="Action Plan">AP</abbr>) available in Annex C on Jaggaer and your records with COVID-19.</p>

<p>4.05	The minimum requirements are that all activities in relation to Participants must be recorded in your evidence of action planning.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure the Participant understands what they are being asked to do, why they are being asked to do it and when it must be completed by</li>
  <li>Where you identify that a Participant has additional support requirements, you must carefully consider any impact these may have on the Participant’s ability to understand or comply with the requirements</li>
  <li>Set activities on Action Plan (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S <abbr title="Action Plan">AP</abbr>) which are <abbr title="Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound">SMART</abbr> (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound)</li>
  <li>Ensure evidence of all interactions are recorded, dated, signed and held for all Participants, in line with the customer journey detailed in your tender (signatures can be electronic). If a Participant cannot or refuses to sign, you must record the reason for this. Where you are unable to obtain a Participant signature, during COVID, annotate the Action Plan (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S <abbr title="Action Plan">AP</abbr>) with “COVID-19”. However, for the majority of the time signatures should be obtained electronically where they cannot be obtained in person. Providers should follow government guidelines on restrictions and customer’s preferences/needs when considering any Face to Face activity</li>
</ul>

<p>4.06	You must ensure the Action Plan (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S <abbr title="Action Plan">AP</abbr>) is reviewed, by both you and the Participant every 10 (ten) working days. The frequency of these meetings can be amended if the Participant prefers a different arrangement.</p>

<p>4.07	Make the information contained in the Action Plan (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S <abbr title="Action Plan">AP</abbr>) available to the Participant at their request (by paper or electronically depending on their preference).</p>

<p>4.08	The 10 (ten) working day completion of the <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland Action Plan forms part of your <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr> and will be checked, at regular intervals during the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Compliance Monitoring process, against what you agreed to deliver in your contract. Non-compliance in meeting these standards will result in failing this <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr>. For further information, please see Job Entry: Targeted Support (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland) Provider Guidance Chapter 11 Performance Management, MI Requirements, Compliance and Assurance.</p>
