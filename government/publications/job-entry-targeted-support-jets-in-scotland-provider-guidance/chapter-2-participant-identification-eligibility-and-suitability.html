<p>This is Job Entry: Targeted Support (JETS) in Scotland provider guidance.</p>
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>2.01	To be eligible for Job Entry: Targeted Support (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) in Scotland all Participants must be resident in Scotland, fall into the eligibility criteria and be of working age.</p>

<p>2.02 Jobcentre Plus Work Coaches will use their expertise and skills to perform the key role of identifying eligible Participants to participate in <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland and then engaging them to access the provision. Jobcentre Plus will be the final decision maker for determining if an individual is eligible and should be referred to <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland.</p>

<h2>Resident in Scotland</h2>

<p>2.03	People who will be considered to be living in Scotland legally are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK passport holders (or eligible to hold UK passport)</li>
  <li>foreign passport holders as long as there is an endorsement in their passport allowing them to undertake paid employment – that is, there are no employment restrictions/ prohibitions; and</li>
  <li>holders of EU passports (subject to any endorsement prohibiting them from working in the UK)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please Note: <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> reserves the right to amend these definitions following the end of the transition period following the UK’s departure from the European Union.</p>

<h2>Participant eligibility and entry points</h2>

<p>2.04	To be eligible for <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland potential Participants must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be of working age (18 years in Scotland to State Pension age)</li>
  <li>have the right to reside and enter employment in and the UK</li>
  <li>be in receipt of Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) in the All Work Related Requirements Group (Intensive Work Search Regime) or New Style Jobseekers Allowance (<abbr title="JSA (Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>) at the point of referral</li>
  <li>have been unemployed for 13 weeks or more (not in any type of employment contract)</li>
  <li>be in receipt of benefits for 13 weeks or more (periods of furlough are not counted)</li>
  <li>be motivated to find work and require light touch employment support; and</li>
  <li>not be in receipt of payments from the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note: State Pension age can vary by potential Participant.</p>

<p>2.05	Work coaches will use the above criteria to assess eligibility and suitability for participation in <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland. Potential Participants may have previously completed other <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Contracted Employment Provision (<abbr title="Contracted Employment Provision">CEP</abbr>) prior to their referral. However, this does not mean that they will be eligible/suitable for <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland.</p>

<p>2.06	The following are not eligible for <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland:</p>

<ul>
  <li>potential Participants who are in any paid work, on a zero-hour contract or have a job offer</li>
  <li>potential Participants that are identified as eligible for and require the more intensive support provided by for example, Fair Start Scotland</li>
  <li>potential Participants who are wanting to start a new business, or return to their previous/current self–employment, support through the New Enterprise Allowance maybe more appropriate</li>
  <li>potential Participants who do not need support to find employment or (where appropriate) apprenticeship and have the skills for independent job search/use of Recruitment Agencies support; and</li>
  <li>potential Participants who are already on or about to start on a <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> contracted provision or Scottish provision, e.g. Fair Start Scotland</li>
</ul>

<h2>Participant Suitability</h2>

<p>2.07	If the potential Participant fulfils the eligibility criteria, the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Work Coach, will identify those who are suitable and would benefit most from the support.</p>

<p>2.08	To be considered suitable for <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland the potential Participant must want to work, require this support and satisfy one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not expect to find work without help - Needs support/confidence building to overcome barriers to work</li>
  <li>Unable without help and direction to be able to undertake an effective job search needed to secure employment, for example been employed for many years in same type of work or lacks IT skills</li>
  <li>Need to identify transferable skills to widen job search opportunities in alternative sectors and/or establish new path to their career</li>
</ul>
