<h2>Performance Management and Intervention Regime (<abbr title="Performance Management and Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr>)</h2>

<p>11.01 <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> operates a robust performance management regime to hold providers to account for performance offers within their contract. This Performance Management and Intervention Regime (<abbr title="Performance Management and Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr>) has been developed to support the delivery of the Programme, and underpin your contract.</p>

<p>11.02 The aim is to support you and ensure you meet the performance levels and customer service standards (<abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>) stipulated in your contract.</p>

<p>11.03 There are four levels of this regime:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Level 1: Standard Action – Performance Manager( <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr>) Led</li>
  <li>Level 2: Enhanced Action – <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr>/Senior Performance Manager Led</li>
  <li>Level 3: Informal action – <abbr title="Employment Account Division">EAD</abbr> Account Manager led</li>
  <li>Level 4: Formal action – <abbr title="Employment Account Division">EAD</abbr> Account Manager led</li>
</ul>

<p>11.04 All levels of the <abbr title="Performance Management and Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr> can run independently or concurrently. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will with reasonable discretion be able to take action at any level at any time.</p>

<p>11.05 Generally, all contracts must have a Provider Action Plan in place submitted by the Contract Operational Lead to the <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr>. Subject to the agreement of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Account Manager, Providers with a Contract at Level 1 will be advised if a Provider Action Plan is not required. Unless advised otherwise, the Provider Action Plan is required to be in place immediately following the contract implementation period and reviewed at each Contract Performance Review (<abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr>) meeting’.</p>

<p>11.06 An example of the Provider Action Plan to be used is included at Annex K. You may use your own version if preferred, as long as it includes all areas covered in the example Provider Action Plan at Annex K.</p>

<p>11.07 The Provider Action Plan should include any improvement activity, how and over what timescale you expect to achieve/exceed minimum performance levels. All actions in the plan should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time bound (<abbr title="Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound">SMART</abbr>) and longer-term actions should incorporate <abbr title="Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound">SMART</abbr> milestone targets.</p>

<p>11.08 <abbr title="Performance Management and Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr> intervention levels will not necessarily be applied sequentially, e.g., if appropriate, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may move from <abbr title="Performance Management and Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr> Intervention Level 1 directly to <abbr title="Performance Management and Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr> Intervention Level 3, without applying Level 2.</p>

<h2>Level 1: Standard Action – <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> led</h2>

<p>11.09	May include actions such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> holding regular Contract Performance Review (<abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr>) meetings with you which will focus on achieving contractual performance levels and (<abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>) including but not limited to, on an in-month, rolling three month, rolling 12 month, cumulative and relative performance basis, in line with the Contract from Day One. Your Provider Action Plan will be reviewed as part of the <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr>. These meetings may be virtual, delivered through compatible on-line meeting platforms or via telephone conference facilities. Your <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> will discuss and confirm arrangements with you</li>
  <li>Performance Management on both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of your contract. Other staff, including those representing Jobcentre Plus, may also attend these meetings. You will be required to provide monthly Management Information five working days prior to the <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Level 2: Enhanced Action  – <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr>/<abbr title="Senior Performance Manager">SPM</abbr> led</h2>

<p>11.10 Whilst at Level 1, if it is determined that you may not achieve the performance levels or <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>, your <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> may undertake informal action to escalate you to Level 2, you will be notified of this in writing. You will be required to enhance your Provider Action Plan, to capture all agreed actions for performance improvement. You will also be required to provide a flightpath including incremental performance and pipeline data that may lead to outcomes to improve the achievement of the performance levels and <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr> in line with the Contract. Formats to be agreed with your <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Level 3: Informal Action – <abbr title="Employment Account Division">EAD</abbr> Account Manager led</h2>

<p>11.11 If the remedial actions at Level 2 were unable to lift your performance in order to meet the performance levels and <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr> in the Contract, the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Senior Performance Manager (<abbr title="Senior Performance Manager">SPM</abbr>) can propose escalation to Level 3.</p>

<p>11.12 You will be invited to a meeting to discuss your performance with Senior Managers and receive a Management letter to request that your performance improves. At this stage you will be informed that formal action could be taken in the event that performance doesn’t improve.</p>

<h2>Level 4: Formal Action – <abbr title="Employment Account Division">EAD</abbr> Account Manager led</h2>

<p>11.13	If you fail to meet the required standards at Level 3, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Employment Account Division (<abbr title="Employment Account Division">EAD</abbr>) and Commercial Directorate will take formal action to address the performance issues, considering and applying, where applicable, all the remedies available to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> under the contract.</p>

<h2>Cohort profiles and Management Information (<abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr>)</h2>

<p>11.14 <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will measure your performance using cohort measures based on the information you provided as part of your tender which has been incorporated in to your Contract.</p>

<p>11.15 The outcome definition for both employed and self-employed must have been met at or before 238 days from the Start Date. For self-employed outcomes, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will allow you until 299 days from the Start Date to submit a claim.</p>

<p>11.16 Performance data against these profiles will be taken from <abbr title="Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> data, the Provider Referral and Payment system (<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>) and, in the case of self-employed Participants, from outcome claims submitted by you. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> produces <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> Packs on a monthly basis. The <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> packs will contain the data input to <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> regarding your Participants, cohort profiles performance against the performance levels in the Contract. This will allow the Department to monitor your performance across various time periods including cohort, rolling three months, rolling 12 months and cumulative from day one of the contract.</p>

<p>11.17 You will be required to provide three performance returns containing key data that drives the performance of the Contract. These returns will be sent to you monthly via JAGGAER.</p>

<p>11.18 The first return is a monthly return where you will record both you and your Supply Chains’ staffing, caseload information and monthly performance data. This return is an excel file and a copy of it can be found in Annex L.</p>

<p>Please note: You must not amend the format of this Schedule including adding additional lines as this impacts the formulae within the spreadsheet. Please consult your Performance Manager if any issues arise with this document.</p>

<p>11.19 A copy of the second return can be found in Annex M is in excel format and records your achievements against the Customer Service Standards (<abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>) 4 and 6-10 (see paragraph 11.27 below) that are not monitored through the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> system. The return contains information detailing how each <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr> should be measured on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>11.20 A copy of the third return called the Customer Insight Return can be found in Annex N, is in excel format and it records:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of participants contacted</li>
  <li>the number of participants that responded, and</li>
  <li>the number of responses falling into each answer category</li>
</ul>

<p>11.21 All 3 returns must be returned via JAGGAER by the 15th working day of the month as per Schedule 8.8 – Management Information of the contract.</p>

<h2>Contract performance review (<abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr>)</h2>

<p>11.22 The purpose of the Contract Performance Review (<abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr>) is to formally examine both your performance, and that of your Supply Chain (if applicable), for this contract. All relevant aspects of performance will be assessed against contractual requirements and outcomes.</p>

<p>11.23 The usual frequency of <abbr title="Contract Performance Reviews">CPRs</abbr> is monthly, however, this can be reviewed as advised by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> at its absolute discretion.</p>

<h2>Content of the <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr> meeting</h2>

<p>11.24 The <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr> will focus on the ongoing achievement of performance levels and <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>. Depending on priority issues for each meeting, the <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr> is likely to cover some/all of the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Performance including relative performance</li>
  <li>Expected future performance based on information available (for example, earning commencements and current performance levels)</li>
  <li>Review of Provider Action Plan – including improvement expectations agreed at the last meeting</li>
  <li>Sub-contractor (end to end performance) and Supply Chain. performance</li>
  <li>Employer engagement</li>
  <li>Collaborative working (including Operational Process Updates)</li>
  <li>Decision Making and Appeals (<abbr title="Decision Making and Appeals">DMA</abbr>), where appropriate</li>
  <li>Participant experience/Customer Insight</li>
  <li>Assurance and Compliance Monitoring</li>
  <li>Performance Manager checks</li>
  <li>Exit feedback/CV/references</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> policy changes – latest <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> memos</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note: This list is not exhaustive.</p>

<h2>Performance requirements</h2>

<p>11.25 The Performance levels you are required to deliver are set out in your contract.</p>

<p>11.26 <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will actively monitor the service you deliver against these performance levels and <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>. This will be done using a combination of IT based management information, provider <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> submission, Assurance and Compliance checks conducted via a range of mediums. The following paragraphs show the categories under which performance will be measured and managed and the standards which relate to the delivery of customer service.</p>

<p>11.27 <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland does not have separate Customer Groups, therefore there is only one MPL: a 20% conversion rate of starts to achievement of £1,000 earnings. Performance will be measured and monitored on a cohort basis.</p>

<h2>Customer Service Standards</h2>

<p>11.28 The success of the programme will be measured against a series of Customer Service Standards (<abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>):</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The Contractor must acknowledge 99.5% of referrals on the Provider Referral and Payment (<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>) system within 2 (two) working days of receipt of the referral. This will be monitored through the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No more than 4% of referrals will be in backlog. Backlog means an accumulation of uncompleted work or matters needing to be dealt with in relation to <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr> 1 or 3. This will be monitored through <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No single referral will be in backlog for more than 25 working days of receiving the referral. This will be monitored through <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Provider will contact a potential participant within 2 (two) Working Days of receiving a Referral, to set up an initial appointment between the Provider and the potential participant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The initial appointment will take place within 15 (fifteen) Working Days of the Provider receiving the Referral. The Provider must also update <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> with a Start, Did Not Attend or Did Not Start by the 15th (fifteenth) working day for 99% of referrals. This will be monitored through the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Provider will provide the Participant with a copy of the customer service standards within 1 (one) Working Day of becoming a Participant. The customer service standards referred to here are details on the support that the Provider can provide to the Participant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Provider will work with the Participant to explore the Participant’s ambitions, goals, priorities and personal needs. This will help formulate an Action Plan. This Action Plan must be finalised within 10 (ten) Working Days of the Participant’s start on the programme.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Provider will engage the Participant (by telephone/video conference or any other method permitted by the Contract) every 10 (ten) Working Days as a minimum, to discuss the Participant’s wellbeing, Action Plan and job goals (“Booked Meeting”). The frequency of the Booked Meetings can be amended if the Participant prefers a different arrangement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Participant misses a Booked Meeting and the Provider is not contacted by the Participant with an explanation as to why, the Provider will attempt to contact the Participant within 2 (two) Working Days with a view to resolving any issues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Participant is not in employment or self-employment at the point they cease to be a Participant, the Provider will produce an Exit Report (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER). This will include a summary of the Participant’s time on <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland, along with details of additional support that can be accessed to support them going forward. The <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland Exit Report (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER) will be provided to Participants within the last 10 (ten) Working Days of the Participant being a Participant. The Provider will also maintain a copy of the <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland Exit Report (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER) securely, which must be sent to the Contracting Body upon request from the Contracting Body. The <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland Exit Report (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S-ER) form can be found on Annex G on Jaggaer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every month, the provider will be required to obtain information from the Participants on the usefulness of the Programme. This will be done by the provider asking the specific question(s) and follow up (by email, link to a provider portal, website or on-line survey and where no other option available, by telephone) detailed below.</p>

<p>11.29 Participants will be required to record their response to the question(s). Where Participants provide responses by telephone, the provider will create and maintain a detailed written record of the response. Providers are required to collate the Participant responses in the template to be provided by the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>11.30 The Provider will send the completed template to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> by the 15th day of the following calendar month. If the 15th day happens to be a non-Working Day, then the deadline shall move to the next Working Day. The Provider will maintain each Participant response, which <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may request to review in the future.</p>

<p>11.31 <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> reserves the right to publish Participant responses or a summary of Participant responses (either in the form provided, or in any other form it sees fit). <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> also reserves the right to amend the specific questions or add additional questions that providers ask Participants on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>11.32 Additionally, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> reserves the right to require providers to ask the Participants the question(s) on a more/less regular basis. The frequency of collating Participant responses and the deadline for providing <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> with the completed template can also be varied by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> also reserves the right to amend the template.</p>

<h2>Providing Good News Stories/Case Studies</h2>

<p>11.33  <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>/Jobcentre Plus regularly requires information on participants whose individual stories can be celebrated. This information will be used in marketing and publicity products which help celebrate and raise awareness of your provision and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>/Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<p>11.34 Consent must be obtained from each individual who agrees to their details being shared before any story can be published. This can be found on Annex R on Jaggaer.</p>

<p>11.35 Once completed, a copy of the consent form and good news story template available on Annex S on Jaggaer should be sent to your Performance Manager. This should be sent via unencrypted email; each email must only contain one template with the corresponding consent form. Your Performance Manager will ensure you have obtained all the appropriate information required and that the information is forwarded to DWPs national team.</p>

<p>11.36 The National Marketing and Publicity Manager may use your good news/case study in such things as ministerial speeches, newsletters, magazines, newspapers or television etc. The relevance of the story will be checked with you prior to publishing.</p>

<p>11.37 <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> does not stipulate how many good news stories you are required to produce, as a guide, you should aim to provide at least one each month which you can discuss with your Performance Manager at each Contract Performance review.</p>

<h2>Compliance monitoring</h2>

<p>11.38 <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> PMs and/or Performance Compliance Officers (<abbr title="Performance Compliance Officer">PCO</abbr>’s) may perform evidence based checks to identify if providers are adhering to the delivery models set out in their contracts. These checks may incorporate the use and quality of Participant Action Plans; Participant engagement; <abbr title="Decision Making and Appeals">DMA</abbr> activity (where appropriate); delivery of the <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr> and to seek assurance that you are addressing the Participants barriers to employment.</p>

<p>11.39 If there is a performance concern or an area of weakness identified, PMs may undertake ‘Go-Look-See’ and/or ‘Deep Dive’ visits. These may be undertaken remotely. PMs will discuss fully the objective of these visits and how they will be undertaken. PMs may also ask to attend sub-contractor end-to-end delivery and supply chain meetings.</p>

<p>11.40 Any issues arising from <abbr title="Performance Compliance Officer">PCO</abbr>/<abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> checks will be reported to you and relevant <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> stakeholders and discussed at <abbr title="Contract Performance Reviews">CPRs</abbr>.</p>

<p>11.41 <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> reserves the right to carry out physical/remote checks on documentation as part of this process.</p>

<h2>Evaluation and reporting</h2>

<p>11.42 Independent evaluation will be an important element of your Programme and you will be asked to co-operate in a range of evaluations commissioned by the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>11.43 Other interested parties and Government Departments as part of wider cross-government agendas may commission further evaluations and your assistance will be expected when required.</p>

<p>11.44 As part of this evaluation work, researchers may wish to visit and interview you and your sub-contractors and supply chain, Participants and employers involved in your Programme. You may be asked to provide the relevant contact details and, in order to facilitate this process; you should seek advance agreement from Participants to take part in evaluations.</p>

<p>11.45 Advance notice will be given where your co-operation is required.</p>

<p>11.46 An end of project evaluation report will also be required, highlighting innovative delivery practices and achievements against the cross cutting themes.</p>

<h2>Provider Assurance Team</h2>

<p>11.47	The primary purpose of the Contract Management and Partner Delivery (<abbr title="Contract Management and Partner Delivery">CMPD</abbr>) Provider Assurance Team (<abbr title="Provider Assurance Tea">PAT</abbr>) is to provide the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Contract Management and Partner Delivery">CMPD</abbr> Director with an assurance that Prime Provider systems of internal control are such that payments made to Prime Providers are in accordance with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and Treasury requirements.</p>

<p>11.48 <abbr title="Provider Assurance Tea">PAT</abbr> reviews and tests Prime Providers’ systems of internal control to establish how effective they are at managing risk to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in relation to <abbr title="Contract Management and Partner Delivery">CMPD</abbr> expenditure and service delivery, including the arrangements you have in place for your supply chain.</p>

<p>11.49 This work is carried out by <abbr title="Provider Assurance Tea">PAT</abbr> by reviewing your internal control systems to assess your ability to manage risk across three key areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Governance Arrangements – covering the Provider’s governance arrangements, systems for tracking and reporting performance and their anti-fraud measures</li>
  <li>Service Delivery – includes the Provider’s systems for starting, ending and moving Participants through F2F Provision and generally looks to ensure that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is getting the service it is paying for. This section also covers management of the supply chain</li>
  <li>Claim Procedures and Payments – looks to ensure that Prime Providers have in place effective systems to support their claims for payment, including appropriate segregation of duties</li>
</ul>

<p>11.50 <abbr title="Provider Assurance Tea">PAT</abbr> operates at a national level, enabling it to present <abbr title="Contract Management and Partner Delivery">CMPD</abbr> Providers operating across regions with a single view of the effectiveness of their systems; each Prime Provider will have a nominated Senior Provider Assurance Manager as a single point of contact within <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> for management of assurance related issues / concerns.</p>

<p>11.51 On completion of each review, providers are awarded an assurance rating from the following four categories – weak, limited, reasonable and strong. Providers will also receive a formal report detailing the review findings including key strengths and areas for improvement. Where weaknesses have been identified providers are asked to complete an action plan setting out appropriate steps for improvement. This is followed up until <abbr title="Provider Assurance Tea">PAT</abbr> is satisfied that all actions have been undertaken. The timescale for reviews is determined by risk.</p>

<h2>Findings from each Provider Review</h2>

<p>11.52 Findings from each review are routinely reported to the relevant Provision Leads and other <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> stakeholders. Remedial actions may be taken in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if, following a Weak or Limited Assurance level from the Provider Assurance Team, the Prime Provider’s subsequent assurance level is the same or worse for the same reasons, or the Prime Provider is awarded a consecutive third weak or limited assurance, regardless of the reasons</li>
  <li>following a review, if you fail to submit and/or implement the action plan within the agreed timescale; or</li>
  <li>where there are suspicions that you may be acting inappropriately, the team will refer to Counter Fraud and Investigations as the experts trained in the legalities and techniques required to carry out formal investigations</li>
</ul>

<p>11.53 <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may periodically publish Prime Provider assurance levels and names (note - this will not include reports or supporting information).</p>

<p>11.54 <abbr title="Provider Assurance Tea">PAT</abbr> will work with you to ensure that you understand what is expected. For further information on <abbr title="Provider Assurance Tea">PAT</abbr> please see Generic Provider Guidance Chapter 6 – Provider Assurance.</p>
