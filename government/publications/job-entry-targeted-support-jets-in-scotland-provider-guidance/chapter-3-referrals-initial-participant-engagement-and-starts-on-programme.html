<h2>Potential Participant referrals from Jobcentre Plus</h2>

<p>3.01	As part of the referral Jobcentre Plus will send over information on the potential Participant to support the initial engagement.</p>

<p>3.02	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may send you personal and sensitive information about the potential Participant. Information sent as part of the referral is sensitive personal data within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>), therefore handling, processing and transmission rules apply. The information sent as an anticipated minimum will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>full name, including title</li>
  <li>National Insurance number (<abbr title="National Insurance number">NINo</abbr>)</li>
  <li>full address including postcode</li>
  <li>telephone number Inc. area code</li>
  <li>other telephone number (mobile)</li>
  <li>email address where known</li>
  <li>Driving Licence (if appropriate)</li>
  <li>if the potential Participant has been mandated to attend the first appointment</li>
  <li>Incident Marker – notification where a potential Participant has had an incident recorded while working with Jobcentre Plus. The Jobcentre will issue you with a notification of control measures form by post to make you aware of any measures following an incident. Further information on incidents can be requested by contacting Jobcentre Plus</li>
  <li>Disability Status – notification that the potential Participant has informed Jobcentre Plus that they are disabled. Disabled potential Participant may require special arrangements when you meet with them</li>
  <li>referral ID</li>
  <li>provision ID</li>
  <li>date of referral; and</li>
  <li>Potential Participant who require additional support – this will be notified by the inclusion of the wording “May require reasonable adjustment or additional support” on their action plan</li>
</ul>

<p>3.03	You will need to work with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and your local Jobcentre Plus contacts to ensure an effective referral and engagement process with the potential Participant.</p>

<p>3.04	Information will be transmitted to you via the Provider Referral and Payment (<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>) system interface.</p>

<h2>Provider acknowledges referral</h2>

<p>3.05	You are required to ‘acknowledge’ the potential Participant’s referral in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> within 2 (two) working days of the referral being received by you. This is a Customer Service Standard (<abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr>) and will be measured and performance managed. Further information can be found in <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland Provider Guidance Chapter 11: Performance Management, MI Requirements, Compliance and Assurance.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Access <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Acknowledge Referral</li>
</ul>

<h3>Consequence – Failure to acknowledge a referral will mean that you will:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>fail to meet your <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>be unable to work with a potential Participant</li>
  <li>be unable to record a start date; and</li>
  <li>be unable to receive any performance outcomes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Referral – Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements (<abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr>) cases</h2>

<p>3.06	<abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> are statutory arrangements for managing sexual, violent and certain other offenders in the community in Scotland, England and Wales.</p>

<p>3.07	<abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> is not a statutory body but a mechanism through which agencies can better discharge their statutory responsibilities and protect the public in a co-ordinated manner.</p>

<p>3.08	<abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> cases who have not been given Special Customer Record (<abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr>) status will be referred through <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> (see process below). You will receive the referral, minus the address, postcode and contact telephone number.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The nominated officer from Jobcentre Plus will contact your nominated officer to give contact details and any restrictions that should be in place for each <abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> referral. They may decide to forward to you a copy of the <abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> J form which will detail the restrictions. Risks or restrictions will be different for every <abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> case</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> J form and any other clerical documents for each claim must be held securely, with restricted access, following the same process as you would for SL2’s</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take the same action on <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> as for non-<abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> cases to acknowledge and start the Participant</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3.09	You can set up normal electronic records on your IT systems for <abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> Participants. However, the record must only contain minimal information and should be marked restricted as per <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/multi-agency-public-protection-arrangements-mappa-guidance"><abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> Guidance</a> and that further information can be obtained from your nominated officer. Therefore, access to this record does not need to be restricted.</p>

<h2>Special Customer Record (<abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr>) Referrals (including <abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> cases given <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> status)</h2>

<p>3.10	Certain potential Participants are allocated <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> status, for cases where unrestricted access to potential Participants data poses a demonstrable risk to the potential Participants safety. These potential Participants must not have their details held on any electronic systems. Potential Participants who have been granted <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> status will be referred to you clerically via the SL2 process. There is no clerical equivalent of acknowledging an electronic referral for <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> cases, so this step does not apply in these instances.</p>

<p>3.11	In rare cases, some <abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> potential Participants may be given <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> status. You must ensure that you treat these cases as you would any other <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> Participants. Access to a <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> must be restricted to a set period of time and on an event-by-event basis.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will complete page one (of three) of the SL2 form, forwarding the entire form to your nominated officer</li>
  <li>Undertake start activity following receipt of SL2 form from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> (retaining pages two and three of the SL2 form) and complete and return page one to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> nominated officer</li>
  <li>Send a photocopy of page two of the SL2 form to the Provider Payment Validation Team (<abbr title="Provider Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>3.12	You must ensure you have a full understanding of who these Participants are and how you should deal with them. You must ensure full compliance with the <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> clerical record process.</p>

<p>3.13	The clerical completion and return of SL2 Forms for <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> Participants should always be undertaken by your nominated officer, who must ensure that “<abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> Participant” is clearly marked at the top of each form.</p>

<p>3.14	All information on <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> Participants whether received from Jobcentre Plus or generated by yourselves must be stored securely at all times.</p>

<p>3.15	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> expects you to have effective processes in place to meet all the above requirement and be able to demonstrate that you have conducted the necessary actions.</p>

<p>3.16	Should you require a copy of any of the forms mentioned in this chapter, please email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:jetsscotland.policy@dwp.gov.uk">jetsscotland.policy@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Initial engagement activity (Voluntary Referrals only)</h2>

<h3>Initial Appointment for Voluntary Potential Participants</h3>

<p>3.17	The initial appointment with the potential Participant, refers to the meeting arranged between both of you. Following your receipt of the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> referral from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, you must discuss the provision, and potentially agree the potential Participant’s start on the programme. This appointment must take place within 15 (fifteen) working days of you receiving the referral, to meet your Customer Service Standards (<abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>).</p>

<p>3.18	You must engage with the potential Participant and book an initial appointment with them, which may be by telephone call, video conference or any other method permitted by the contract, sending out details to the potential Participant to confirm. This must be confirmed on the <abbr title="JSA (Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> VAL <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S letter for New Style <abbr title="JSA (Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> potential Participants or the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> VAL <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> potential Participants via email or post. If it has not been possible to contact the potential Participant, you should still book an initial appointment, sending out details to the potential Participant to confirm. This activity must take place within two working days of receiving the referral from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to meet your <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>.</p>

<p>3.19	You must keep records of all the actions you have taken to contact the potential Participant to arrange the initial Appointment and by what means (that is, telephone, email or letter).</p>

<p>3.20	You must also take into account any additional support requirements.</p>

<p>3.21	If, when you contact them, the potential Participant informs you that they no longer wish to join the programme, you should enter a Did Not Start (<abbr title="Did Not Start">DNS</abbr>) into <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>. This should be done immediately where possible but no later than 15 (fifteen) working days following receipt of the referral and update your records. You do not need to book an initial appointment in these circumstances.</p>

<p>3.22	The initial appointment must take place within 15 working days of the provider receiving the referral from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to meet your Customer Service Standards (CCSs). It must also be recorded on <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> within 15 working days of receiving the referral from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, in line with your <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>.</p>

<p>3.23	If the potential Participant contacts you prior to the date of the appointment to request an alternative date. You may choose to agree to re-arrange the appointment, or you may request that they attend on the original date. If an alternative date is arranged, you must issue an updated <abbr title="JSA (Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> VAL <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S or <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> VAL <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S letter to the potential Participant with the new appointment details.</p>

<p>3.24 If a potential Participant fails to attend the initial appointment (and they have not contacted, you or let you know that they no longer wish to participate). In these circumstances, it would be good practice to continue to make use of the full 15 working days from your receipt of the referral to continue to try to arrange the initial appointment with them.</p>

<p>For example: where a voluntary potential Participant has failed to attend their initial appointment, to maximise their opportunity to engage with the programme you may consider offering at least two further appointment dates before inputting a Did Not Attend (<abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr>) into <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> by the 15th working day. Any subsequent appointments should be notified to the potential Participant via the <abbr title="JSA (Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> VAL <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S for New Style <abbr title="JSA (Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> potential Participants or the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> VAL <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> potential Participants.</p>

<p>3.25	Where a potential Participant attends their initial appointment and informs you that they no longer wish to participate on the programme you should input a Did Not Start (<abbr title="Did Not Start">DNS</abbr>) into <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> within 15 (fifteen) working days of your receipt of the referral. You should signpost the potential Participant back to Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<p>3.26	Where the initial appointment does not take place within 15 (fifteen) working days of you receiving the referral and you have not entered <abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr> into <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>, you will fail to meet your <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr>.  You should take action to input the <abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr> as soon as possible to ensure you do not fail any further <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>. The line will automatically close 30 calendar days from the referral being made.</p>

<p>3.27	If a voluntary potential Participant fails to attend the initial appointment and you input <abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr> into <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>, or the 30 calendar day period has lapsed. The Jobcentre Plus work coach at their discretion may make a new referral to you, if the potential Participant still wishes to take part in the programme.</p>

<h2>Initial engagement activity (for potential Participants who are mandated to attend and participate in their first appointment with the Provider)</h2>

<h3>First Appointment (Mandatory)</h3>

<p>3.28	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may mandate some potential Participants to attend and participate in their first appointment with you. You will be able to identify these potential Participants via <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> as they will be referred on the mandatory opportunity type on <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<p>3.29	The potential Participant can be sanctioned for failing to attend (<abbr title="failing to attend">FTA</abbr>) the first appointment with the provider, that the work coach has mandated them to attend and participate in. Participation in every element of <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland after the first appointment is voluntary for all potential Participants.</p>

<p>3.30	Once you have acknowledged the mandatory referral in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>, you must notify the potential Participant of the arrangements for them to attend their first appointment with you via the letter <abbr title="JSA (Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> MAL <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S for New Style <abbr title="JSA (Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> potential Participants or the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> MAL <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> potential Participants to enable their attendance. You must undertake this activity within 2 (two) working days from your receipt of the referral from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to meet your <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Please note: It is only during the first appointment that you will notify the potential Participant that they have been mandated to attend and participate in. For any subsequent appointments you may book following this appointment, their attendance will be on a voluntary basis.</p>

<p>3.31	It is always necessary to ensure that the timeframe between issuing the Mandatory Appointment Notification letter (<abbr title="JSA (Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> MAL <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S or <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> MAL <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S) and the potential Participant attending the appointment is reasonable. Where the letter is posted to the potential Participant, the assumption is that they will have received the notification on the second working day after posting (not including Saturday, Sunday, or bank holidays). It is advisable to allow additional time for the potential Participant to make any necessary arrangements to attend the appointment.</p>

<p>For example: if the appointment is due to start on the Tuesday at 9am, it would be advisable to send the <abbr title="JSA (Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> MAL <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S or the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> MAL <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S on the preceding Tuesday. It could then be assumed to have been received in good time.</p>

<p>3.32	The first appointment is the only appointment that you will need to use a <abbr title="JSA (Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> MAL <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S or the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> MAL <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S letter to invite the potential Participant to the appointment. The purpose of this appointment is the same as the Initial Appointment that takes place with voluntary Participant to enable them to join provision.</p>

<h3>Method of sending the First Mandatory Appointment Notification Letter</h3>

<p>3.33	It is not acceptable to use electronic methods, such as text or email, to send the Mandatory Appointment Notification letter to the potential Participant. The letter must be posted to their home address, or handed to them. Where a potential Participant is of no fixed abode use the potential Participant’s correspondence address. You may choose to use registered post to ensure delivery.</p>

<p>3.34	It is acceptable to communicate electronically with the potential Participant to remind them of their appointment after issuing the letter.</p>

<h2>Potential Participant fails to attend or attends and fails to participate the first appointment with you (Mandatory Referral – mandated to attend and participate in first appointment)</h2>

<p>3.35	The only exception to this is if the potential Participant contacted you prior to the date of the appointment to request an alternative date. You may choose to agree to re-arrange the appointment, or you may request that they attend on the original date. If an alternative date is arranged, you must issue an updated <abbr title="JSA (Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> MAL <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S or <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> MAL <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S letter to the potential Participant with the new appointment details.</p>

<p>3.36	For potential Participants who didn’t attend and/or participate in their first appointment which you notified them of via the <abbr title="JSA (Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> MAL <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S or the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> MAL <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S letter. You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>immediately notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of their non-attendance by completing <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S01 for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> potential Participants or <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S02 for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-style-jobseekers-allowance">New style <abbr title="JSA (Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr></a> potential Participants and sending it back to the designated email inbox address notified to you by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, via unencrypted email; and</li>
  <li>continue to try to re-engage with the potential Participant up until the 15th (fifteen) working day from receipt of the referral and continue to try to arrange their attendance at their initial appointment with you</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note: These subsequent appointments will be voluntary appointments therefore, you should not use the <abbr title="JSA (Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> MAL <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S or the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> MAL <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S to notify the potential Participant of these.

<p>For example: where a potential Participant has failed to attend and participate in their first appointment date, to maximise their opportunity to engage with the programme you may consider offering further appointments before inputting <abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr> into <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> by the 15th working day.</p>

<p>3.37	If by the 15th working day from receiving the referral, you have attempted to arrange for the potential Participant to attend their first appointment to discuss their potential start on the programme and they have not attended, you should enter <abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr> into <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> by the 15th working day to meet your <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>.

<p>3.46	The point at which the potential Participant agrees to participate in the programme, following an initial appointment is their start on the programme.</p>

<p>3.47	Where you are unable to arrange for the potential Participant to attend a subsequent appointment, because doing so would cause you to fail your <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr> target, the <abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr> date you input to <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> must be the latest date the potential Participant contacted you to try to arrange another appointment.</p>

<p>3.48	You must notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> immediately of the potential Participants attempt to rearrange the appointment by completing form UC194 <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S form and emailing it to the designated email inbox address notified to you by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Potential Participant starts work or has a job offer between referral and start</h2>

<p>3.51	Potential Participants may report that they have a job offer or have started employment or self-employment in-between their referral interview with Jobcentre Plus and engaging with you. These potential Participants should not continue to take part on the Programme.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If the potential Participant informs you prior to acknowledgement, signpost the potential Participant back to Jobcentre Plus (if appropriate) and update <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> with cancellation reason ‘inappropriate referral’.</li>
  <li>If the error is discovered after acknowledgment but you have not claimed the start line, then use reason ‘no contact’</li>
  <li>If the Participant informs you after acknowledged and recorded a start date, complete a PRaP14 and send to the <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland Policy inbox at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:JETSSCOTLAND.POLICY@DWP.GOV.UK">JETSSCOTLAND.POLICY@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.UK</a> and copy in the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> Operational Support Team (<abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr>) at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PRAP.SUPPORT@DWP.GOV.UK">PRAP.SUPPORT@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.UK</a>.

  <li>Upon receipt of the email you must promptly cancel the referral in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>, recording a cancellation reason of ‘No Contact’</li>
</ul>

<h2>Identity checks</h2>

<p>3.52	You must ensure that in all communications with Participants you are satisfied you are engaging with the correct person.</p>

<p>3.53	To do this, you may decide to ask them to state a combination of their personal information such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Full name</li>
  <li>Address</li>
  <li><abbr title="National Insurance number">NINo</abbr></li>
  <li>Other information, such as details that were included within the original referral from Jobcentre Plus</li>
  <li>Details you hold on your records</li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions to take when potential Participant confirms they want to start on programme (Voluntary initial appointment and Participant Mandated to the first appointment)</h2>

<p>3.54	You must check that the potential Participant is not in any form of employment including zero hour contracts. For further information, where a potential Participant finds work or receives a job offer between referral and the initial appointment (voluntary) and the first appointment (mandatory) please refer to potential Participants starts work or has a job offer between referral and start section of this chapter.</p>

<p>3.55 Check that the potential Participant is not in receipt of payments from the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS).</p>

<p>Please note: If the potential Participant is registered as self-employed with HMRC, they do not need to de-register to participate in <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland.</p>

<p>3.56 You must capture the potential Participant’s preferred method of communication at this appointment and begin action planning with them by keeping evidence of the discussion. Further information can be found in <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland Provider Guidance Chapter 4 – Action Planning.</p>

<p>3.57 You will provide the Participant with an induction pack, privacy notice and a copy of your customer service standards within one Working Day of them starting on the programme. Failure to do so will result in failing the <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr>.</p>

<p>3.58	You must take into account any additional support requirements and ensure this is recorded in the Action Plan (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S <abbr title="Action Plan">AP</abbr>). This can be found on Annex C on Jaggaer.</p>

<h2>Provider registers a start</h2>

<p>3.59	The start is the point at which the Participant agrees to participate in the programme following or at the initial/first appointment. The start date you record in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> must always be the point at which the potential Participant agrees to participate following or at the initial appointment, this may be a retrospective date if you are entering the start date after the appointment was conducted.</p>

<p>3.60	You must retain evidence of the start date. Examples of acceptable evidence will include evidence of initial action planning activity.</p>

<p>3.61	The Start Date is day one of the 182 calendar day period that you have to work with the Participant.</p>

<p>3.62	Once you have acknowledged the referral and engaged with the Participant you are required to register the start in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>. To meet the <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr> initial engagement and start activity, this must take place within 15 (fifteen) working days of receiving the referral from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>3.63	After 30 calendar days of the referral from Jobcentre Plus, the potential Participant record will automatically show as <abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr> in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>, unless you have, prior to the 30th day, input the potential Participant start date, <abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr> or <abbr title="Did Not Start">DNS</abbr>. If this occurs the potential Participant will not be a Participant on the Programme unless subsequently Jobcentre Plus makes a new referral for that potential Participant which results in a start.</p>

<p>3.64	Any potential Participant not recorded as a Start within 30 calendar days should be referred back to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, if appropriate.</p>

<h3>Consequence</h3>

<p>Failure to register a start as soon as you have conducted the initial appointment will mean that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr> tracking will not start promptly; and</li>
  <li>You will fail to meet your <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>3.65	If a Participant starts, input into <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> the delivery location or end to end sub-contractor you allocate the Participant to.</p>

<h2>Awareness of an Ineligible Payment</h2>

<p>3.66	You must inform <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> if you become aware of the following payments so that an Outcome Payment is not triggered. These payments are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tax refunds</li>
  <li>payments in lieu of notice</li>
  <li>holiday pay</li>
  <li>payments made as a part of being Armed Forces Reservists</li>
  <li>other retainer payments; and</li>
  <li>payments that are not related to qualifying employment generated whilst on <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland</li>
</ul>

<p>3.67	You must notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> team of any of these payments using the Non-<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland Earnings Notification Form  Non-<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S EENF and send to the Department’s <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> Operational Support Team Central Inbox: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:prap.support@dwp.gov.uk">prap.support@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>3.68	The Non-<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland Earnings Notification Form  Non-<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.S EENF can be found in Annex E on Jaggaer.</p>

<p>3.69	In circumstances where an outcome payment has been triggered, the Participants record on <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> will have automatically closed. For you to continue working with the Participant and help them into employment, you will need to consider whether a re-referral is required.</p>

<p>3.70	You will need to consider the following with the Participant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>length of time you have already supported the Participant i.e. is the 6 months coming to an end</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the customer need ongoing support?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the customer agree to a re-referral?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there any further support available you could offer the Participant to support them into employment?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3.71	If, after considering all of the above and the Participant and you agree to continue to support the Participant, you will need to contact a Work Coach at the local JCP to request a re-referral to be made.</p>

<p>3.72	If the Participant and you do not agree to continue the support,  you will need to complete an Exit Report. Further details can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/job-entry-targeted-support-jets-in-scotland-provider-guidance/chapter-6-programme-completers-and-early-exits">Chapter 6: Programme Completers and Early Exits</a>.</p>

<p>3.73	Once a re-referral has been made, all <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> actions will need to be actioned as per the usual process. For further information please see the Re-Referral Process.</p>

<p>3.74	In the rare occurrence that someone starts <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland, having just moved to Scotland and had recently been participating in the Work and Health programme (England or Wales), please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:jetsscotland.policy@dwp.gov.uk">jetsscotland.policy@dwp.gov.uk</a>.  In some circumstances an overlap in tracking can occur and we may need to take actions to rectify</p>

<h2>Participant contact after start on programme</h2>

<p>3.75	The Provider will engage with the Participant (by telephone/video conference or any other method permitted by the Contract) every 10 (ten) Working Days as a minimum, to discuss the Participant’s wellbeing, Action Plan and job goals (“Booked Meeting”). The frequency of the Booked Meetings can be amended if the Participant prefers a different arrangement as per the <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr>. Failure to do so will result in failing the <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr>.</p>

<p>3.76	Any change in the frequency of contact should be documented by the Provider and Participant’s records should be updated.</p>

<p>3.77	If the Participant misses a booked meeting and the Provider is not contacted by the Participant with an explanation as to why, the Provider will attempt to contact the Participant within 2 (two) working days with a view to resolve any issues as per the <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr>. Failure to do so will result in failing the <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Inappropriate referrals</h2>

<p>3.78	We recognise that there may be instances where someone is referred to the <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland programme when they should not have been. For example, a Participant’s who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do not meet mandatory or voluntary eligibility criteria will be removed from provision. This enables them to access other, more appropriate support and removes the risk of the department paying for ineligible Job Outcomes</li>
  <li>Do not meet the mandatory eligibility criteria but meet the voluntary eligibility criteria will be given the choice whether to continue taking part in <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland</li>
  <li>Meet the eligibility criteria but do not meet the suitability criteria, except taking part in another Contracted Employment Provision (<abbr title="Contracted Employment Provision">CEP</abbr>) will be given the choice whether to continue taking part in <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland</li>
  <li>Meet the eligibility criteria but do not meet the suitability criteria because they are taking part in another <abbr title="Contracted Employment Provision">CEP</abbr> will be removed from the <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland, to enable them to continue taking part in the first provision</li>
</ul>

<p>3.79	We recognise that there may be instances where errors are made during a claimant’s referral to <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where potential Participants have been referred to <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland more than once but have not started, the first referral is deemed correct. Subsequent referrals are deemed inappropriate</li>
  <li>Where Participants have been referred to <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> in Scotland more than once and have started, the referral with the (earliest) start date is deemed correct. Referrals with no/later start dates are deemed inappropriate</li>
  <li>where you identify that a referral may have been sent incorrectly. For example, where the opportunity type is a mandatory referral but the referral check box indicates a voluntary referral. In these circumstances you should contact the work coach to confirm referral status. Where the work coach confirms the referral was erroneous you should take the below actions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Re-Referral Process</h2>

<p>3.80	A Participant can be considered for re-referral, subject to their Jobcentre work coach’s re-assessment on whether a re-referral is the most suitable option</p>

<p>3.81	To be eligible to be considered for re-referral, all of the following criteria must be met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the Participant still meets the eligibility and suitability criteria</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an eligible employment or self-employment Outcome Payment must not have been payable from previous participation on <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> Scotland</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>299 calendar days must have lapsed since the Participant previously started on provision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Participant has not been re-referred to <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> Scotland previously</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3.82	There is an exception to bullet point 3 above. When any non-qualifying earnings have triggered an outcome and ended the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> journey, but the participant still needs support, the customer can be re-referred without having to wait for day 299 – this is because the customer will have been removed from <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> altogether and tracking of outcomes will not apply. For further information please see “Awareness of an Ineligible Payment”</p>

<h2>Action Planning – minimum requirements</h2>

<p>3.83	Following the initial/first appointment with the Participant, you should begin high level initial action planning activity.</p>

<p>3.84	You are required to complete a full Action Plan, which has been agreed by you and the Participant, within 10 (ten) working days of the Participant’s start date. Ensure evidence of all interactions are recorded, dated, signed and held for all Participants, in line with the customer journey detailed in your tender. Where you are unable to obtain a Participant signature, during COVID, annotate the Action Plan with COVID-19. However, for the majority of the time signatures should be obtained electronically where they cannot be obtained in person. Providers should follow government guidelines on restrictions and customer’s preferences/needs when considering any Face to Face activity.</p>

<p>3.85 The initial meeting will allow the Participant and the Provider to start the Action Plan. A first draft of the Action Plan must be created at the initial meeting and signed by the Participant and the Provider on the day of the initial meeting. This Action Plan will be developed over the next 10 working days after the initial meeting. The Action Plan must be issued to the Participant and a copy retained by the Provider and forms part of the evidence of a Start on provision.</p>
