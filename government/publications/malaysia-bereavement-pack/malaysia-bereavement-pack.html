<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>This information is not meant to be definitive, nor is it to be taken as a substitute for independent legal advice. Neither Her Majesty’s Government nor its staff take any responsibility for the accuracy of the information, nor accept liability for any loss, costs, damage or expense that you might suffer as a result of relying on the information. Some of the information may not be relevant to your circumstances. The language used is intended to be general and factual and is not meant to cause offence.</p>

<h2>Bereavement in Malaysia: introduction</h2>

<p>When a relative or friend dies abroad, the different procedures, laws or language can cause additional distress. You may be uncertain about what to do or who to contact.
This country specific information is designed to help you through some of the practical arrangements you may need to make. It supplements the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coping-with-death-abroad">general information on death abroad produced</a> by the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office, which applies to all countries.</p>

<p>Please note, as each country has its own laws and customs when a death occurs, it may not be possible to make the arrangements that you prefer, or at the time you would like.</p>

<h2>How to contact the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office</h2>

<p>There is a lot of information below, but you may have questions. You can speak to someone by phone 24/7, any day of the year by contacting the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London on 0207 008 5000.</p>

<p>If you are not in the UK, you can find the contact details of the nearest <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies">British embassy, high commission or consulate</a>.</p>

<p>The priority of the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office is to provide assistance to British nationals overseas who need the most help. The level and type of assistance they can offer is tailored to the individual circumstances of each case.</p>

<h2>Next of kin</h2>

<p>The next of kin of the person who died will usually need to make decisions and practical arrangements. The next of kin can sometimes appoint another person to act on their behalf.</p>

<p>If you are not the next of kin, they will need to be informed. If required, the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office can help you do this.
There is no legal definition of next of kin in the UK. Please note that if there is a disagreement over who is the next of kin, or the person who died did not choose a next of kin, this can cause additional complications.</p>

<p>In Malaysia the next of kin is usually defined as a spouse, sibling, friend or employer.</p>

<p>Same-sex partners are not recognised under Malaysian law as next of kin.</p>

<h3>Release of information to next of kin</h3>

<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office will try to obtain as much information as possible after your relative or friend has died abroad. Some of this may be only available to next of kin. Consular Officers may be able to obtain this themselves, or they may put you in touch directly with the authorities overseas. They may be able to provide you with details of others who can advocate on your behalf such as lawyers, charities, or other organisations.</p>

<p>If the death has been reported to the Royal Malaysian Police the British High Commission will be notified through diplomatic channels.</p>

<p>However, you may also be notified about the death directly by someone else, for example a doctor, or the hospital.</p>

<p>If the death requires further investigation or a coroner’s enquiry, the authorities will release information to next of kin only. Post-mortem, toxicology, and coroner’s reports can be requested by next of kin; these documents are not released to the British High Commission.</p>

<h2>Insurance</h2>

<p>It is very important to check if the person who died had insurance. If they had insurance, contact the insurance company as soon as possible. They may have a list of approved funeral directors to help you make arrangements, or be able to cover some of the costs.</p>

<p>You may need the insurance policy number and the associated 24-hour medical emergency contact number to do this. If the travel insurance company confirm that there is a current policy, you should not appoint your own funeral director or be pressured by local funeral agencies to do so. It will be the insurance company that will appoint the funeral director both locally and in the UK.</p>

<p>If the person who died did not have insurance, the next of kin will usually have to appoint a funeral director and will usually be responsible for all costs. The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office cannot help with these costs.</p>

<h2>Appointing a funeral director</h2>

<p>If you decide to bring the deceased to the UK for the funeral or cremation, you may only need to appoint an international funeral director. The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office produces a <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-funeral-directors-in-the-uk">list of international funeral directors based in the UK</a>.
If you decide to hold a funeral or cremation in Malaysia, you can find a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/malaysia-list-of-funeral-directors">list of funeral directors in Malaysia</a>.</p>

<p>Local funeral directors are usually appointed by insurance providers or the family’s next of kin. The funeral director will require details of the deceased, contact details of the next of kin, and where the deceased’s remains are kept.</p>

<p>The next of kin should provide an authorisation letter to the funeral director, who will then be able to handle all aspects of the funeral arrangements on their behalf. This would cover the recovery of the remains from the hospital morgue, the registration of the death through the National Registration Department, obtaining the death certificate, and the burial/cremation arrangements, and if required repatriation.</p>

<p>Some hospitals may contact the next of kin to arrange the release of the remains as soon as possible, if a funeral director has not been appointed.</p>

<h2>Registering the death and obtaining a death certificate</h2>

<p>You will need to register the death with the local authorities in the country where the person died. Sometimes a funeral director can do this for you. You will usually need documents about you and the person who has died, which include information such as full name, date of birth and passport number.</p>

<p>The local authorities will need to be told if the person suffered from an infectious condition such as hepatitis or HIV so they can take precautions against infection.</p>

<p>The deceased will be tested for Covid-19, and if positive there may be different procedures around burial/cremation and repatriation.</p>

<p>You don’t need to register the death with the UK authorities. The local death certificate can usually be used in the UK for most purposes, including probate. If it is not in English, you will need to obtain and pay for an official translation. Local funeral directors can register a death on behalf of next of kin.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.jpn.gov.my/en/" rel="external">Malaysian National Registration Department (NRD)</a> is required to issue a death certificate within 24 hours of the death being reported.</p>

<p>The death certificate issued will written in both Malay and English, though some information may be written only in Malay.</p>

<p>In most cases, the death certificate will indicate the cause of death. However where a post mortem examination is required, it may state “pending further investigation”, and once the results are released a new death certificate can be applied for.</p>

<h2>Consular death registration</h2>

<p>You do not have to register the death of a British national that occurs overseas with the UK authorities. You can sometimes apply for a consular death registration. This is not mandatory and cannot be used instead of a death certificate from the country where the person died. It is only available in some countries. If you wish to do this, you can find more information on <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/register-a-death">registering a death and apply online</a>.</p>

<h2>Post mortem examinations (autopsies)</h2>

<p>Post-mortems are normally performed when the cause of death is unknown, unnatural, sudden or violent. Post-mortems are carried out by Government Medical Officers instructed by the police. Consent is not required by next of kin for a post-mortem to take place.</p>

<p>During a post-mortem, small tissue and organ samples may be taken for testing, without the consent of the next of kin. You will not automatically be told if this happens.</p>

<p>Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office cannot stop or interfere with the process.</p>

<p>If you want a copy of the post-mortem report, you must apply through hospital records departments and pay a fee.</p>

<h2>Mortuary facilities</h2>

<p>Mortuary facilities are available in general hospitals in Malaysia and in some funeral houses. Separate facilities are available for Muslims.</p>

<h2>Burial, cremation, repatriation</h2>

<h3>Burial &amp; cremation</h3>
<p>The next of kin of the person who has died will usually need to decide between a local burial, cremation or bringing the person home, which is known as repatriation. Your funeral director will usually be able to explain the options available, the costs, and help you make arrangements. The British High Commission can provide a list of local funeral directors on request.</p>

<p>Some hospitals may ask for a letter of no objection, in order for the remains to be released to the funeral director or next of kin. You may also need a letter of no objection in order to make burial/cremation and repatriation arrangements. The British High Commission is able to provide a letter of no objection, you will be ask to provide supporting documents in order for the letter to be issued.</p>

<p>Muslims are usually buried on the same day of the death occurring according to religious custom. Please contact the nearest mosque for advice on organising a burial according to Islamic rites.</p>

<h3>Repatriation</h3>

<p>It is advisable to seek professional advice from a local funeral director, who may have more experience dealing with overseas repatriation. The funeral company will liaise with the airline to arrange an appropriate flight.</p>

<p>The funeral company will also liaise with the appointed funeral company in the 
United Kingdom, to ensure the casket is received upon arrival and to assist the family or friends in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Some families may consider cremation, to then take the ashes back to the UK. It is advisable to seek professional advice from a local funeral director on the requirements for air travel whilst carrying ashes.</p>

<p>Please note if a local burial or cremation takes place, then an inquest in the UK will not be possible. For more information on inquests, see the information on UK coroners and inquests.</p>

<h2>Return of personal belongings</h2>

<p>If the person who died had insurance, please check with the insurance company if this covers the return of their personal belongings.</p>

<p>In some cases the funeral director may be able to assist with returning the deceased’s personal belongings. Please liaise with the funeral director to discuss options on how to do this. Alternatively you may wish to appoint a local lawyer to assist.</p>

<p>Please note, the British High Commission cannot take responsibility for the personal belongings of the person who died.</p>

<h2>Steps to take in the UK</h2>

<p>You can find more information on the steps to take in the UK online. This includes information on arranging the funeral, telling the government about the death, UK pensions and benefits, and dealing with the estate of the person who died. There is a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/when-someone-dies">step-by-step guide about what to do when someone dies</a>.</p>

<h2>Cancelling a British passport</h2>

<p>In order to avoid identity fraud, the passport of the person who died should be cancelled with Her Majesty’s Passport Office (HMPO). To do this, you will need to complete a “D1 form”.</p>

<p>Access the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/what-to-do-with-a-passport-when-the-passport-holder-has-died">form and instructions on where to send the passport</a>.</p>

<p>If you plan to repatriate the person who died to the UK, you may require their passport to do this. In these circumstances, you should cancel the passport after they have been repatriated.</p>

<p>The British High Commission can assist you in this process if required.</p>

<h2>Child deaths</h2>

<p>If a death has not occurred from natural causes, the Royal Malaysian Police may decide to hold a full investigation. There are no separate procedures for deaths involving children.</p>

<h2>Deaths in road traffic accidents</h2>

<p>If a death has not occurred from natural causes, the Royal Malaysian Police may decide to hold a full investigation. There are no separate procedures for deaths involving road traffic accidents.</p>

<h2>Deaths investigated as murder or manslaughter</h2>

<p>If the local police have confirmed that they are investigating the death as a murder or manslaughter a dedicated team within the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office will be available to provide support, including by referring you to a specialised organisation. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/helping-british-people-abroad-murder-and-manslaughter">find more about how the FCDO can help with murder and manslaughter abroad</a>.</p>

<p>You should note that if the deceased is repatriated to parts of the UK a coroner or procurator fiscal may decide to hold an inquest. See the section on UK Coroners and inquests below.</p>

<p>If the death is regarded as suspicious, the police will investigate in full. If a perpetrator is identified, they will be charged by the Public Prosecutor and normally detained until the trial hearing. The time from arrest to trial can be lengthy and in some complicated cases can take years.</p>

<h2>UK coroners and inquests</h2>

<p>If you repatriate the person who died to England and Wales, there may be an inquest. The decision on when to hold an inquest is made by Her Majesty’s Coroner. Please note, an inquest will usually only happen in certain situations, for example, when someone has died in suspicious, unnatural, and violent circumstances or whilst in detention. If the person who died is cremated and only their ashes are brought home, there will not be an inquest.</p>

<p>If you repatriate the person who died to Scotland, the Procurator Fiscal may decide to call for a Fatal Accidents or Injuries Inquiry.</p>

<p>If you repatriate the person who died to Northern Ireland, there will be no coronial inquest or further inquiry.</p>

<p>Please note, Procurators Fiscal and Coroners do not have jurisdiction in another country, nor do they seek to apportion blame to a named individual.</p>

<p>You can find more information on Coroners and the Procurator Fiscal in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coping-with-death-abroad">FCDO guide on death abroad</a>.</p>
