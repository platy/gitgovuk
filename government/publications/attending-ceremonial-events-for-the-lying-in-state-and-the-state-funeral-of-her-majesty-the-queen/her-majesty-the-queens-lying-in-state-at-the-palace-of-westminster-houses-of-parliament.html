<p>During the Lying-in-State period, Her Majesty The Queen’s closed coffin rests on a raised platform, which is called a catafalque, inside Westminster Hall in the Palace of Westminster (also known as the Houses of Parliament). Members of the public attending will file past the catafalque to pay their respects.</p>

<p>Her Majesty The Queen’s Lying-in-State at the Palace of Westminster opens to the public at 5pm on Wednesday 14 September. It will be open 24 hours a day until it closes at 6.30am on Monday 19 September.</p>

<p>The BBC’s red button service will provide a live feed from Westminster Hall and ITV and Sky will be running extensive coverage. An <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.royal.uk/" rel="external">online book of condolence</a> is also available for people to add personal messages.</p>

<p>If you wish to attend the Lying-in-State in person, please note that there will be a queue, which is expected to be very long. You will need to stand for many hours, possibly overnight, with very little opportunity to sit down as the queue will be continuously moving.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>Please make sure you read this guidance before starting your journey to attend the Lying-in-State.</p>
</div>

<p>Large crowds are expected, and there are likely to be delays on public transport and road closures around the area. You should check ahead, plan accordingly and be prepared for long queues. Find out <a class="govuk-link" href="#gettolondon">how to get to London</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#findqueue">how to get to the queue</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#joinqueue">how to join the queue</a>.</p>

<p>Visitors will go through airport-style security and there are tight restrictions on what you can take in. Only small bags are permitted. There is more information in the section below on <a class="govuk-link" href="#whattobring">what you should and should not bring</a>.</p>

<h2>The queue route</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Queueing time</strong></p>

<p>Please note that the queue is expected to be very long. You will need to stand for many hours, possibly overnight, with very little opportunity to sit down, as the queue will keep moving.</p>

<p>Please consider this before you decide to attend or bring children with you.</p>

<p>The queue may close early to ensure as many visitors as possible can enter the Palace before the Lying-in-State period comes to an end.</p>

<p>Step-free and accessible options will be available for those who need them. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="#accessibility">accessibility</a> section for more information.</p>
</div>

<p>The queue will start where Albert Embankment meets Lambeth Bridge in Central London, on the south side of the River Thames. From Albert Embankment, the queue will continue along the south bank of the Thames.</p>

<p>Public transport, walking or cycling are the best ways to get to the queue.</p>

<p>Public transport within London will be extremely busy during this period. If you can, you may wish to consider walking to join the queue. For those who cannot, please plan your onward journey carefully, allow more time than usual and check <a class="govuk-link" href="https://tfl.gov.uk/status-updates/major-works-and-events/travel-advice-for-the-mourning-period" rel="external">Transport for London’s latest travel information</a>.</p>

<p>If you have difficulty finding the back of the queue, make your way to the published queue route. There will be stewards along the queue route. The stewards will tell you where the back of the queue is at that time, and the best way to join the queue.</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>If you need to use the accessible queueing scheme, plan your travel to the accessibility kiosk.</strong></p>

<p>The accessibility kiosk should only be used by people who need to use the accessible queueing scheme. You do not need to visit the kiosk for a step-free route; there will be step-free access along the main queue route. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="#accessibility">accessibility</a> section for more information.</p>
</div>

<h2>How to join the queue</h2>

<p>When you reach the back of the queue, you will be given a coloured and numbered wristband. This is a record of when you joined the queue, however please note that having a wristband does not guarantee your entry to the Lying-in-State.</p>

<p>Wristbands are specific to each person joining the queue, and are strictly non-transferable. You must keep this wristband on at all times as it will be checked along the route.</p>

<p>Your wristband also allows you to leave the queue for a short period to use a toilet or get refreshments, then return to your place in the queue. Public toilets, drinking water and first aid stations are available at designated locations along the queue route.</p>

<p>Before entering the Palace of Westminster, everyone will be subject to an airport-style <a class="govuk-link" href="#security">security search</a>. There are restrictions on <a class="govuk-link" href="#whattobring">what you can take in and bag sizes</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a large bag that you are not permitted to take into the Palace of Westminster, stewards will direct you to the <a class="govuk-link" href="#bagdrop">bag drop facility</a> before you enter the security search point. You will not lose your place in the queue, but it may increase your queuing time.</p>

<p>Step-free routes and an accessible queueing scheme are available for those who need them. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="#accessibility">accessibility</a> section for more information.</p>

<h2>What you should and should not bring</h2>

<p>There is a strict bag policy in operation. You are only permitted to bring <strong>one small bag</strong> per person into the Palace of Westminster. It must be smaller than 40cm x 30cm x 20cm, with one simple opening or zip so you can move quickly through the security check.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/161360/BAG_Restictions_GovUK_960x640-07__1_.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>If you have to bring a larger bag, you will need to leave it in the bag drop facility. Stewards will direct you to the bag drop facility before you enter the security search point. Items are left at your own risk.</p>

<p>Capacity at the bag drop facility is limited and there is no guarantee that there will be space at the facility. Waiting for bag storage space to become available will increase your queuing time.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="#bagdrop">bag drop facility</a> section for more information</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Remember to bring:</strong></p>

<h2>Bag drop facility</h2>

<p>If you have a large bag with you, stewards will direct you to the bag drop facility before you enter the security search point. You will not lose your place in the queue, but it may increase your queuing time.</p>

<p>Capacity is limited, and there is no guarantee that there will be space at the facility. Waiting for bag storage space to become available will increase your queuing time.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/161775/LIS_map_-_bag_drop.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>When you deposit an item, you will be given a bag drop wristband. A corresponding tag will be placed on your item so you can collect it after exiting the Palace of Westminster.</p>

<p>Items that you wish to deposit at the bag drop will be subject to an airport-style scan, and may be refused for safety, size or security reasons. It will be at the discretion of staff whether to accept your bags or other items. Illegal items will be dealt with by the police.</p>

<p>If you leave a bag in the bag drop you must collect it immediately after exiting the Lying-in-State. Remember to keep hold of your wristband, as you will need it to collect your item. Follow the exit signs to Westminster Bridge and then Archbishop’s Park.</p>

<p>All items are left at your own risk. Uncollected items may be disposed of.</p>

<h2>Security and searches</h2>

<p>To keep everyone safe, security measures are in place at the Lying-in-State. Please follow instructions given by the police and stewards.</p>

<p>The police may conduct security searches along parts of the queue.</p>

<p>Before entering the Palace of Westminster you will go through an airport-style security search point.</p>

<p>Restrictions on bags and other items will be strictly enforced. <a class="govuk-link" href="#prohibited">Prohibited items</a>, including drinks and other liquids, will be confiscated at the search point and disposed of.</p>
