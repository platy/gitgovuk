<p>During the Lying-in-State period, Her Majesty The Queen’s closed coffin rests on a raised platform, which is called a catafalque, inside Westminster Hall in the Palace of Westminster (also known as the Houses of Parliament). Members of the public attending will file past the catafalque to pay their respects.</p>

<p>Her Majesty The Queen’s Lying-in-State at the Palace of Westminster opens to the public at 5pm on Wednesday 14 September. It will be open 24 hours a day until it closes at 6.30am on Monday 19 September.</p>

<p>If you wish to attend the Lying-in-State, please note that there will be a queue, which is expected to be very long. You will need to stand for many hours, possibly overnight, with very little opportunity to sit down as the queue will be continuously moving.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Details about the route for the Lying-in-State queue will be added to this guidance at 10pm on Tuesday 13 September.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Large crowds are expected, and there are likely to be delays on public transport and road closures around the area. You should check ahead, plan accordingly and be prepared for long queues.</p>

<p>Visitors will go through airport-style security and there are tight restrictions on what you can take in. Only small bags are permitted. There is more information in the section below on <a class="govuk-link" href="#whattobring">what you should and should not bring</a>.</p>

<h2>Where, when and how to queue</h2>

<p><strong>Details about the route for the Lying-in-State queue will be added to this guidance from 10pm Tuesday 13 September.</strong></p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Queueing time</strong></p>

<p>Please note that the queue is expected to be very long. You will need to stand for many hours, possibly overnight, with very little opportunity to sit down, as the queue will keep moving.</p>

<p>Please consider this before you decide to attend or bring children with you.</p>

<p>The queue may close early to ensure as many visitors as possible can enter the Palace before the Lying-in-State period comes to an end.</p>

<p>Step-free and accessible options will be available for those who need them. The <a class="govuk-link" href="#accessibility">section on accessibility</a> will provide more information.</p>
</div>

<h2>What you should and should not bring</h2>

<p>There is a strict bag policy in operation. You are only permitted to bring <strong>one small bag</strong> per person into the Palace of Westminster. It must be smaller than 40cm x 30cm x 20cm, with one simple opening or zip so you can move quickly through the security check.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/161360/BAG_Restictions_GovUK_960x640-07__1_.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>If you have to bring a larger bag, you will need to leave it in the bag drop facility, which you will be directed to. However, capacity is limited and there is no guarantee that there will be space at the facility.</p>

<p>Items are left at your own risk. Waiting for bag storage space to become available will increase your queuing time.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="#bagdrop">bag drop facility</a> section for more information</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Remember to bring:</strong></p>

<ol class="steps">

<p><strong>Suitable clothing for the weather conditions.</strong> This might include warm, protective clothing or an umbrella in cold or wet weather, or sunscreen if you might need it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Food and drinks to consume in the queue.</strong> There are limited places to buy refreshments along the route. Any food items and liquids must be consumed or disposed of before you enter the security search point outside the Palace of Westminster. Clear water bottles are permitted, but must be emptied of their contents before you enter the security search point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mobile phone charger.</strong> You are likely to be in the queue for a long time, so consider bringing a small portable power bank to use if you need to charge your phone.</p>

<h2>Bag drop facility</h2>

<p>A bag drop facility is available but capacity is limited, and there is no guarantee that there will be space at the facility.</p>

<p>Waiting for bag storage space to become available will increase your queuing time.</p>

<p>Further information on the bag drop facility will be added shortly.</p>

<h2>Security and searches</h2>

<p>To keep everyone safe, security measures are in place at the Lying-in-State. Please follow instructions given by the police and stewards.</p>

<p>The police may conduct security searches along parts of the queue.</p>

<p>Before entering the Palace of Westminster you will go through an airport-style security search point.</p>

<p>Restrictions on bags and other items will be strictly enforced. <a class="govuk-link" href="#prohibited">Prohibited items</a>, including drinks and other liquids, will be confiscated at the search point and disposed of.</p>

<p>If there is a security incident or you spot a suspicious item, alert the stewards or the police and follow their instructions.</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>

<p>Step-free access will be available for those who need it. More information about the route for the Lying-in-State queue will be provided at 10pm on Tuesday 13 September.</p>

<p>The security search point and Palace of Westminster have step-free access.</p>

<p>Guide dogs, hearing dogs and other official assistance dogs are permitted within the Palace of Westminster. No other animals are permitted.</p>

<h2>Conduct and behaviour</h2>

<p>Please respect the dignity of this event and behave appropriately. You should remain silent while inside the Palace of Westminster.</p>

<p>Stewards and police officers will patrol the queue. Antisocial or inappropriate behaviour (including queue-jumping, excessive consumption of alcohol or drunken behaviour) will not be tolerated and you will be removed from the queue.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">

</ol>
</div>

</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h2>Exiting the Lying-in-State</h2>

<p>As you leave the Palace of Westminster, you should move away from the exit straight away so that you do not prevent others from exiting. This will help everyone to keep the queue moving.</p>

<p>You will be asked to remove your wristband when you exit.</p>

<p>If you have left a bag or other item at the <a class="govuk-link" href="#bagdrop">bag drop facility</a>, you must collect your item straight after your visit.</p>

<p>When you leave the Palace of Westminster, follow the signs and directions given by stewards to return to the bag drop facility and collect your bag or item.</p>
