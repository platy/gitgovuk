<h2>About the State Funeral and Committal Service processions</h2>

<p>On Monday 19 September, Her Majesty The Queen’s State Funeral will take place. There will be ceremonial processions in London and Windsor. All processions and services will be broadcast on national television and radio.</p>

<p>At 10.44am, Her Majesty’s coffin will travel from the Palace of Westminster (Houses of Parliament) to Westminster Abbey for the State Funeral. This is a very short journey, and will not be part of the public procession.</p>

<p>Her Majesty The Queen’s State Funeral will take place at Westminster Abbey at 11am. There will be a 2-minute silence at the end of the State Funeral service, at around 11:55am.</p>

<p>Following the State Funeral service, the procession through London will commence. Her Majesty’s coffin will travel in procession from Westminster Abbey to Wellington Arch (Hyde Park Corner).</p>

<p>The procession will travel along Broad Sanctuary, Parliament Square, Whitehall, Horse Guards Parade, Horse Guards Road, The Mall, and Constitution Hill.</p>

<p>At Wellington Arch, the coffin will be transferred to the State Hearse to travel to Windsor. As the State Hearse departs Wellington Arch, the Parade will give a Royal Salute and the National Anthem will be played.</p>

<p>Her Majesty’s coffin will then be carried by the State Hearse along South Carriage Drive to the Albert Memorial, where it will depart for Windsor.</p>

<p>At 3:10pm, the State Hearse will travel in procession along Albert Road and the Long Walk, to St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle. A Committal Service for Her Majesty The Queen will take place at 4pm in St George’s Chapel.</p>
