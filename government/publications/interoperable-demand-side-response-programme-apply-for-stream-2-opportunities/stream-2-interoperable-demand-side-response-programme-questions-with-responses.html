<p>This page covers responses to Competition clarification questions received for Stream 2 of the Interoperable Demand Side Response (<abbr title="Interoperable Demand Side Response">IDSR</abbr>) Programme.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> General</h2>

<p><strong>1.1 Will the Interoperable Demand Side Response Programme Information Event session be recorded and available to listen to again?</strong></p>

<p>The event was not recorded. However, the slides can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/interoperable-demand-side-response-programme">Interoperable Demand Side Response webpage</a>.</p>

<p><strong>1.2. Will the How to Apply information event content be shared more broadly beyond the webinar?</strong></p>

<p>The How to Apply information event recording and slides can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/flexibility-innovation">Flexibility Innovation Programme webpage</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Scope</h2>

<p><strong>2.1. How does <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> envision this programme aligning with <abbr title="Publicly Available Specification">PAS</abbr> 1879, and Smart Charge Point Regulations Phase 1 (30 June) and Phase 2 - in development?</strong></p>

<p>Alignment to the principles of <abbr title="Publicly Available Specification">PAS</abbr> 1879 is a requirement of the Stream 1 competition. Aspects of the Streams 2 and 3 competitions will require alignment to the principles of <abbr title="Publicly Available Specification">PAS</abbr> 1879. Please see the relevant requirements in the corresponding Competition Guidance Notes for more detail on each Stream’s competition requirements.
The Smart Charge Point Regulations are part of a wider policy area, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/regulations-electric-vehicle-smart-charge-points">please refer to the regulations for further details</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2.2. Can you confirm that the OpenADR protocol will be compulsory for Stream 2 projects?</strong></p>

<p>Stream 2 seeks to support the development and demonstration of energy smart appliances to deliver interoperable demand side response via the GB smart metering system. In terms of <abbr title="Publicly Available Specification">PAS</abbr> 1878 requirements, as a minimum, OpenADR is required (building on Annex D and Annex F).</p>

<p>For further details on the OpenADR requirements for Streams 1, please refer to Section 1.5 – Competition Requirements in the corresponding Competition Guidance Notes.</p>

<p><strong>2.3. Are there other codes/standards that this programme will consider beyond <abbr title="Publicly Available Specification">PAS</abbr> 1879? BSC code modification P375 (‘Metering behind the Boundary Point’) is going live shortly and is accompanied by metering Code of Practise (<abbr title="Code of Practise">CoP11</abbr>) which are needed for settle distributed flexibility in the Balancing Mechanism.</strong></p>

<p>The standards in scope of the programme are <abbr title="Publicly Available Specification">PAS</abbr> 1878, <abbr title="Publicly Available Specification">PAS</abbr> 1879 and the Standalone Auxiliary Proportional Controller (<abbr title="Standalone Auxiliary Proportional Controller">SAPC</abbr>) smart metering specification. The programme does not require demonstration of other standards, such as <abbr title="Code of Practise">CoP</abbr> 11, or other requirements not in scope of these standards.</p>

<p>Energy smart appliances (<abbr title="Energy smart appliances">ESAs</abbr>) will also need to meet all over-arching relevant regulations (for example, product safety, radio equipment) (Streams 1 and 2). It is for ESA manufacturers to determine which standards/codes/ etc. they need to use to meet these obligations.</p>

<p>For further details on requirements for all Streams please refer to the corresponding requirements/specifications section in the relevant Competition Guidance Notes.</p>

<p><strong>2.4. Are we envisioning that this demand side response (<abbr title="Demand side response">DSR</abbr>) would be implemented by Distribution Network Operators (<abbr title="Distribution Network Operators">DNO</abbr>)/ Distribution System Operators (<abbr title="Distribution System Operators">DSO</abbr>) given the focus on grid stability? If so, is there regulatory changes which are being considered to facilitate <abbr title="Distribution Network Operators">DNO</abbr> based <abbr title="Demand side response">DSR</abbr>, and or is there a particular framing expected of the projects?</strong></p>

<p><abbr title="Publicly Available Specification">PAS</abbr> 1878 does not cover the deployment and functional configuration of the wider <abbr title="Demand side response">DSR</abbr> environment (for example, communication between <abbr title="Demand Side Response Service Provider">DSRSP</abbr> and Transmission System Operator (TSO/DSOs), which is out of scope of this Programme.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Demand side response">DSR</abbr> systems built using the GB smart metering system technical framework (Stream 2), the connections between the <abbr title="Standalone Auxiliary Proportional Controller">SAPC</abbr>, ESA, Data Communication Company (<abbr title="Data Communication Company">DCC</abbr>) and <abbr title="Data Communication Company">DCC</abbr> User are in scope.</p>

<p><strong>2.5. OpenADR wasn’t mentioned in Stream 2. Why is it popping up now?</strong></p>

<p>Stream 2 seeks to support the development and demonstration of energy smart appliances to deliver interoperable demand side response via the GB smart metering system. In terms of <abbr title="Publicly Available Specification">PAS</abbr> 1878 requirements for Stream 2, as a minimum, OpenADR is required (building on Annex D and Annex F of <abbr title="Publicly Available Specification">PAS</abbr> 1878).</p>

<p>For further details on the specific OpenADR requirements, please refer to Section 1.5 – Competition Requirements in the Stream 2 Competition Guidance notes.</p>

<p><strong>2.6. Will the testing phase of the products look to install any in real homes or just a lab environment?</strong></p>

<p>Please refer to Section 1 – Competition Overview of the Competition Guidance Notes where the detail of the Competition Phases is outlined.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Eligibility</h2>

<p><strong>3.1. Are we able to submit an application for Streams 1 and 2, or can one company only submit one application?</strong></p>

<p>Projects consortium member(s) (including lead applicants) can apply into multiple Competition Streams if their applications demonstrate clearly how they intend to meet the relevant specifications.</p>

<p>Please refer to Section 3.2 – Application in the Competition Guidance Notes for further guidance on submitting multiple applications.</p>

<p>Please note – projects submitting multiple applications will need to submit a separate application for each Stream they wish to apply to.</p>

<p><strong>3.2. Is the competition open to non-UK domiciled companies?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, however over 50% of the Project’s activities (as measured by eligible Project costs) must be conducted in the UK.</p>

<p>Please refer to Section 5 – Eligibility for Funding in the corresponding Competition Guidance Notes.</p>

<p><strong>3.3. Are collaborative applications required or just encouraged?</strong></p>

<p>This should be considered appropriately based on the needs of the application.</p>

<p>For Streams 1 and 2, projects are expected to be delivered through a consortium approach. Please refer to Section 1.4 – Delivery Approach for further information.</p>

<p>Whilst there are expectations outlined in the guidance, collaborative applications are not a mandatory requirement for any of the Competition streams.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Funding</h2>

<p><strong>4.1. On page 55 of the Stream 1 guidance notes it says: “Please note: Project team contribution in kind are not permitted under this Competition.” What does “Project team contribution in kind” mean? Does “contribution in kind” mean non-paid labour costs (volunteering)? E.g. https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/contributions-in-kind</strong></p>

<p>Contribution in Kind is defined as being services, materials or labour, provided free of charge by the lead contractor, consortium member or sub-contractor for the benefit of the project being applied for. Examples are generally either time of an individual being supplied at zero cost or goods/materials being made available to the project at zero cost.</p>

<p>For further guidance on each Stream please refer to the corresponding competition guidance.</p>

<p><strong>4.2. Is the up to £1.5 million per project for Phase 1 or for all three project phases?</strong></p>

<p>A maximum expected grant value of £1.5 million excluding VAT will be available per project. This grant funding includes funding for Phases 1, 2 and 3 (assuming continuation to Phases 2 and 3 – subject to Stage Gate review conditions outlined in Section 1.6 – Phase Progression of the corresponding Competition Guidance Notes).</p>

<p>Please refer to Section 4 – Funding Levels and Aid Requirements of the Competition Guidance Notes for Streams 1 and 2 for further detail.</p>

<p><strong>4.3. Can you explain more in detail or by example what are the dependencies on funding? If <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> funds £1.5 million does each entities need to equally match this amount?</strong></p>

<p>Please refer to Section 4.2 – Grant Intensity Guidelines of the corresponding Competition Guidance Notes for details.</p>

<p><strong>4.4. Is there a project size limit for single company applications?</strong></p>

<p>Please see the answer to questions 4.2 and 4.3 above.</p>

<p><strong>4.5. What evidence needs to be submitted regarding labour costs? Would it be time sheets and rate sheets for all time spent on the project, or is anything further required?</strong></p>

<p>Please refer to Appendix 4 (Streams 1 and 2)  - Completion of Cost Breakdown Form within the corresponding Competition Guidance Notes for clarity on evidence required.</p>
