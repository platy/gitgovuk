<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Rent under a MRO-compliant tenancy</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>I do not agree with the POB’s proposed MRO rent. What can I do?</h2>

<p>You and the Pub-owning Business (POB) must first try to reach an agreement on the MRO rent. Where you cannot agree, you can ask an Independent Assessor (IA) to determine the market rent. You must <strong>notify</strong> the POB in writing that you intend to do this.</p>

<p>Changes were made to the <strong>time limits</strong> for making a referral to an IA when the Pubs Code was amended from 1 April 2022. The time limit for referral to an IA will depend on whether your Market Rent Only (MRO) event (the event giving you the right to the MRO option) was before or after 1 April 2022. Please check the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/market-rent-only-mro-rights?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=govuk-notifications-topic&amp;utm_source=7f9370af-8fc9-43fc-996f-3b4d41b2f936&amp;utm_content=immediately">What Tied Tenants Need to Know – Market Rent Only Rights factsheet</a> on our website.</p>

<p><strong>If the arbitrator decides the alleged failure has occurred:</strong></p>

<p>The arbitrator must explain, in writing, why the failure has occurred. Then, having regard to the nature of the failure, the arbitrator must do one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>substitute</strong> a figure for the market rent and explain why. That substituted figure is <strong>final</strong>
</li>
  <li>direct the IA to make a <strong>second determination</strong> of the market rent in light of the arbitrator’s explanation as to why the failure has occurred</li>
  <li>make <strong>another determination</strong> the arbitrator considers appropriate, which may in exceptional cases be for the appointment of <strong>another IA</strong> to assess the market rent</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the arbitrator directs the IA to make a <strong>second determination</strong> of the market rent, the IA must do this <strong>within 21 days</strong>, starting the day of the arbitrator’s direction.</p>

<p>Where the arbitrator appoints <strong>another IA</strong> to assess the market rent, the IA must determine the market rent <strong>within 21 days</strong> of the arbitrator’s appointment.</p>

  <li>
<strong>appoint another IA</strong> to determine the market rent (the arbitrator will make this appointment within <strong>14 days</strong> of the matter being referred)</li>

  <li>the determined rent is <strong>not the market rent</strong>
</li>
  <li>the IA in making their determination has not had regard to the <strong>Schedule 3 documents</strong> provided to them</li>
