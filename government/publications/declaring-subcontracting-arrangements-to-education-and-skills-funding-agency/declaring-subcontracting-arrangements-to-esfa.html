<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>ESFA contracts and funding rules require ESFA funded post-16 providers to declare their subcontracting arrangements to us as a minimum twice a year. We introduced this approach to make sure we knew what our supply chain looked like at any point in time and to know the type and value of provision subcontracted.</p>

<p>Further to the ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.education.gov.uk/education-and-skills-funding-agency/subcontracting-post-16-education-and-training-with/supporting_documents/Reforms%20to%20subcontracting%20education%20for%20learners%20over%2016%20government%20consultation.pdf" rel="external">reforms to subcontracting education for learners over 16’ government consultation</a> and subsequent <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/896647/consultation-response-_Reforms_to_subcontracting_education_for_learners_over_16.pdf" rel="external">response</a>, ESFA as a funding body, must be confident that we know which organisations are in receipt of that money, on as live a basis as possible.</p>

<p>All in-scope providers must make a declaration as and when requested.  We will communicate our declaration opening windows in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/esfa-update">ESFA update</a>. This includes making ‘nil declarations’ if they do not subcontract.  Providers make their subcontractor declarations by using the ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">manage your education and skills funding’ (MYESF) service</a>.</p>

<p>Providers are also required to update their declaration, by MYESF whenever they make any change to their subcontracting arrangements This includes adding or removing subcontractors, or changing the information of a previously submitted declaration.</p>

<p>ESFA takes its role of protecting public funds seriously. Any fraudulent behaviour such as failure to declare a subcontracting arrangement, making a false declaration or abuse of position will may result in ESFA taking action to recover funds and where necessary report any suspected criminal activity to the appropriate authority.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>All providers, across all post-16 funding streams are required to report their subcontractor arrangements from 1 August to 31 July.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Providers in scope</h2>

<p>Providers are in scope if they have an active ESFA contract/agreement in post-16 delivery. This includes AEB, traineeships, apprenticeships, ESF and 16 to 19 programmes. Providers must have received at least one Individualised Learner Record (ILR) payment in the relevant funding year.  A ‘nil declaration’ should be made if a provider does not subcontract.</p>

<p>The subcontracting of Advanced Learner Loans (ALL) is not permitted.  If we identify subcontracting of all or part of your ALL delivery, we will recover the funds.</p>

<p>Schools who do not subcontract are exempt from making a return, however if you are a school and you do subcontract you must confirm this by making a return.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Definitions</h2>

<p>A subcontractor is a separate legal entity or an individual that has an agreement (called a subcontract) with you to deliver any element of the education and training we fund. A separate legal entity includes companies in your group, other associated companies and sole traders. An individual could include a person who is a sole trader, self-employed or employed by an agency unless those individuals are working under your direct management and control in the same way as your own employees.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>EEP activity</h2>

<p>If you subcontract 16 to 19 provision, you must declare subcontracting of any employability, enrichment and pastoral (EEP) activity.</p>

<p>All ESFA funded provision, including EEP activity, is a funded part of a study programme. Therefore, a third party delivering any activity is determined to be a subcontractor. The arrangement must meet our subcontracting controls guidance, and the lead provider must include the third party in their subcontracting declaration.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Qualification hours</h3>

<p>Qualification hours (planned learning hours) directly relate to the student’s study programme, meaning they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are timetabled, organised or supervised by the institution</li>
  <li>take place within the institution’s normal working pattern</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Non-qualification hours</h3>

<p>Non-qualification hours cover EEP activity.&nbsp; These hours must be timetabled, organised or supervised by the institution.</p>

<p>Non-qualification hours can include time spent on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>working towards internally developed, assessed and awarded qualifications in the funded institution</li>
  <li>gaining experience, including activities to give young people the skills they need to live more independently and be integrated within their community</li>
  <li>tutorial time</li>
  <li>work experience other work-related activities</li>
  <li>paid or unpaid volunteering, community activities or enrichment activities organised and quality assured by, or on behalf of, the institution</li>
  <li>activities such as the Duke of Edinburgh Award that might lead to an award, but is not listed on the ESFA list of qualifications approved for 14 to 19 funding</li>
  <li>enrichment activity, such as personal and social development</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Declaring EEP activity</h3>

<p>If EEP activity is included in your 16 to 19 provision, you must declare this by selecting non-qualification hours and tell us how much you are paying your subcontractor.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Process</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>All providers must declare their subcontracting arrangements for the period 1 August to 31 July through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">MYESF</a>. As stated in the funding rules, providers must tell us if they are using other organisations to provide any training on their behalf.</p>
</div>

<p>Providers are required to report, as a minimum, twice a year.  At the start of the period, providers are required to submit their forecasted delivery and keep this updated as an when things change throughout the year.  At the end of the period, providers should submit their actual delivery.</p>

<p>If providers do not subcontract but receive direct funding from ESFA, they are still required to make a nil declaration. It is a requirement for AEB, including traineeships and ESF provision to request prior permission to start subcontracting for the first time. For further details on this process see here.</p>

<p>Providers will need one of the following MYESF roles to complete and submit a declaration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contract authoriser</li>
  <li>contract manager</li>
  <li>data returns and claims authoriser</li>
</ul>

<p>Providers can check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/settings" rel="external">user roles and permissions in MYESF</a>.  Any questions, can be submitted via an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen&amp;consentMessage=yes" rel="external">ESFA online enquiry form</a>.</p>

<p>Providers will need to know:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the names of their subcontractors</li>
  <li>how much money they will have paid their subcontractor from 1 August to 31 July</li>
  <li>which funding stream the provider is subcontracting</li>
  <li>the number of learners or apprentices</li>
  <li>where the training will take place</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to this information, there is an additional contractual subcontracting requirement for providers who subcontract to publish their policy for subcontracting delivery on their website. We now require providers to provide us with a link to this policy as part of the subcontractor declaration (excluding employer providers who only deliver the apprenticeship funding stream). If this is not received as part of your declaration ESFA will contact you to provide the link separately and if this is still not received, further action may be taken.</p>

<p>Providers must notify us via  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">MYESF</a> whenever there is a change to subcontracting arrangements.</p>
