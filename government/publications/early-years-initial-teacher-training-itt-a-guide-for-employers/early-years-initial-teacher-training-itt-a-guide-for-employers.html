<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Trainees must complete an early years initial teacher training (<abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr>) course to become an early years teacher.</p>

<p><abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> provides opportunities to gain practical skills and theoretical knowledge to demonstrate the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-teachers-standards">Teachers’ Standards (Early Years)</a>. Successful completion of the training leads to the award of early years teacher status.</p>

<h2>How your employee can apply</h2>

<p>If you have a graduate employed in your early years setting, encourage them to apply. They can apply directly to an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-initial-teacher-training-itt-providers-and-school-direct-early-years-lead-organisations">early years <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> provider</a> offering the graduate employment based route for September 2022.</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>

<p>Funding is available to train graduates already employed in an early years setting.</p>

<p>Training providers receive the funding and retain the course fee. The remaining funding is given to you, the employer, to cover some of your costs - for example, supply costs or salary enhancement - in supporting the trainee employed by you to complete their course.</p>

<p>Find out more from the following guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/early-years-initial-teacher-training-2023-to-2024-funding-guidance">early years initial teacher training funding guide</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>International students</h2>

<p>International students can be offered funded <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> places as long as the applicant meets:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all the academic entry criteria for the <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> course</li>
  <li>the relevant immigration permissions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Academic entry criteria</h3>

<p>Applicants must have achieved the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a standard equivalent to a grade 4 (or C) in GCSE English, maths and a science subject</li>
  <li>a first degree<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> from a UK higher education institution, or an equivalent qualification</li>
</ul>

<p>International students can be awarded early years teacher status (<abbr title="early years teacher status">EYTS</abbr>) in the usual way on completion of an <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> course.</p>

<h3>Immigration permissions</h3>

<p>Every international <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> student must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have the right to study or work in the UK</li>
  <li>hold the relevant visa before they start their <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> course</li>
</ul>

<p>This is in line with the standard practice for all international students undertaking any course in an English university.</p>

<p>Refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/recruit-trainee-teachers-from-overseas-accredited-itt-providers">guidance for <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> providers on how to recruit trainee teachers from overseas</a> for additional information. The ‘Support for candidates’ section of this guidance is not applicable to <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr>.</p>

<p>Potential international students should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa">check their eligibility for a visa</a>.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>

<p>The following research reports show that the quality of early years provision is higher when practice is led by specially trained graduates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://epi.org.uk/publications-and-research/early-years-qualifications-and-outcomes/" rel="external">Early years workforce qualifications and children’s outcomes</a> found that there is a positive association between the presence of degree-qualified staff and children’s outcomes. The strongest effects were seen for children in settings where a staff member held qualified teacher status (QTS), followed by those holding early years teacher status (<abbr title="early years teacher status">EYTS</abbr> – achieved through <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr>), with smaller effects for staff holding early years professional status (EYPS).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/evaluation-of-the-graduate-leader-fund-final-report">Evaluation of the graduate leader fund: final report</a> found that settings which employed a graduate leader with early years professional status (the predecessor of early years teacher status) made significant improvements in quality for preschool children (aged 30 months to 5 years) compared with settings that did not. Improvements were most evident where those with early years professional status worked directly, and led practice, in a room with children.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/longitudinal-study-of-early-years-professional-status-an-exploration-of-progress-leadership-and-impact-final-report">Longitudinal Study of Early Years Professional Status: an exploration of progress, leadership and impact final report</a> found that early years professional status had created professionals who were confident about taking on a leadership role in settings. 80% of early years professionals felt that gaining early years professional status had increased their ability to carry out improvements in their settings.</p>

      <p>A first degree comprises 300 higher education (HE) credit points, of which 60 must be at level 6 of the Qualifications and Credit Framework (QCF). Applicants with a foundation degree will need to supplement this qualification with at least 60 credits at level 6 (HE level 3) in order to attain an equivalent single qualification.&nbsp;<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
