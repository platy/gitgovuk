<h2>Annex 5 (regulation 15)</h2>

<h3>Additional advice on the prevention of exposure to asbestos</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Any crew member who is, or is believed to be, working regularly in the vicinity of known asbestos, or in an area where the presence of asbestos is suspected, to which he might in consequence be exposed should be told of its location and should be instructed by the employer to report immediately to him any defects (such as cracks or flaking) or any deterioration in the condition of the asbestos. On receiving any adverse comment on the condition of asbestos in any location, the employer should inspect the site immediately (or, if this is not practicable, as soon as possible) and make a written report of his findings and of the remedial measures taken in accordance with this Notice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the condition of any asbestos on board ship is or may be defective the following steps should be taken:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>(a) All crew members should be informed and access to the site must be restricted to as few crew members as possible.</p>

<p>(b) Any work or other activity at the site must be carried out in conformity with the advice given in the paragraphs below. The advice given in this MGN should be explained to all those carrying out the work.</p>

<p>(c) If circumstances permit, the defective site must be covered or sealed in order to minimise the risk of dust inhalation.</p>

<p>(d) Repair and maintenance work by crew members must only be undertaken if, for safety reasons, this is absolutely necessary. Every consideration should be given to having the work undertaken in port by qualified personnel.</p>

<p>(e) Any place where there is, or is thought to be, airborne asbestos should be reported to the owner or managers of the ship as appropriate where these are not the employer.</p>

<p>(f) Where repairs etc. involving asbestos are to be done by shore-based personnel in the UK, the repairer should be informed as soon as possible of the nature and extent of any asbestos work anticipated, and, if possible, of the type of asbestos. This will help him plan the work so as to satisfy any legal requirements such as the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2006 which cover land based workers in the UK even when they are working on a ship. In the UK, where the work involves asbestos insulation or coating, a contractor must hold a licence under the same Regulations. It is particularly essential that persons removing asbestos know how to ensure that asbestos fibres are not carried outside the affected area, eg. by getting into the ducting systems. Wherever possible repair work etc involving shore based personnel should be done in the UK or in a country enforcing equivalent health and safety standards.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Where, exceptionally and for whatever reason, the amount of asbestos in the air is high it should be continually monitored and the level of asbestos adjacent to the face of anyone breathing that air should not exceed the limit value set out in paragraph 3.1 of the main body of this MGN, when measured as a time weighted average. No one should breathe air containing a level of asbestos above that limit. If the dust level is or could be above that limit
respiratory equipment and full protective clothing must be worn. However it has to be recognised that on a ship, it may not be practicable to identify the type of asbestos encountered or to monitor asbestos in the air. Moreover on a ship the concentration of the dust may change rapidly during repairs. Therefore where asbestos dust is likely to be present protective procedures must be observed as follows:</li>
</ol>

<p>(a) (i) Suitable approved protective clothing and equipment should be worn by all persons entering the affected area. Employers must ensure that suitable clothing and equipment is supplied, properly maintained, regularly inspected and repaired, decontaminated or replaced as necessary, and that employees likely to be at risk are given appropriate instructions in the use of protective clothing and equipment (Merchant Shipping and Fishing Vessels (Personal Protective Equipment) Regulations 1999 (SI 1999/2205)) (See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/msn-1870-mf-personal-protective-equipment-standards">MSN 1870</a>).</p>

<p>(ii) Respiratory protective equipment type approved for the purpose by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and full protective clothing which gives adequate protection against asbestos dust must be worn by any person when he is likely to be at risk. This is normally marked with the CE marking of the EU. For some limited activities, such as examining the condition of asbestos lagging, halfmask or disposable respirators conforming to BS EN 149 or BS EN 405 may provide adequate protection. However full face high efficiency dust respirators capable of providing protection to at least 1000 times the appropriate control limits for asbestos, conforming to BS EN 136 and filter BS EN 143 or its equivalent, are normally required if there is any risk of a concentration of airborne asbestos and should be worn whenever the level of exposure is in doubt. (See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/msn-1870-mf-personal-protective-equipment-standards">MSN 1870</a>). The protective clothing should comprise suitable footwear and pocketless overalls, headgear and gloves, all made of materials to which the dust will not readily cling. The overalls should be close-fitting at the neck, ankles and wrists. Disposable overalls may be used provided they exclude asbestos dust and conform to BS EN 340.</p>

<p>(iii) The wearer of a respirator should ensure that there is good contact between the mask and the wearer’s face. Beards and spectacles, for example, prevent the mask from sealing effectively. Therefore persons who cannot obtain a good seal with a full face mask must either use a powered respirator with blouse or, preferably, keep away from areas containing airborne asbestos fibres.</p>

<p>(iv) The breathing apparatus supplied on the ship for fire-fighting should not be used in connection with asbestos dust unless the overriding hazard is a fire.</p>

<p>(b) Once work has started, the protective clothing and equipment should not be worn outside the affected area.</p>

<p>(c) When work in the area is finished, and the area is tidied up the clothing and equipment should be freed of as much dust as possible—using, if available, a vacuum cleaner (and filters) recommended by the HSE for this purpose; other vacuum cleaners should not be used. The vacuum cleaner should be cleaned before the protective clothing is taken off. Clothing which has or has had dust on it should be carefully removed, and placed in a dust tight container. After the clothing is in the container, shoes/boots and the respirator should be cleaned with a damp cloth. The respirator can only then be removed from the operator’s face. The cloth and the respirator filter should be disposed of appropriately.</p>

<p>(d) Parts of the body exposed whilst working with asbestos should be immediately and thoroughly rinsed and then washed after removal of contaminated clothing.</p>
