<h2>Annex 4 (regulation 11)</h2>

<h3>Taking of samples to determine whether asbestos is present</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Wherever possible, only a specialist company should take samples; but the following advice is given so that ships’ officers can monitor such work, or, if absolutely necessary (for example when loose asbestos is discovered) do it themselves, subject to the taking of the necessary precautions required by the Asbestos Regulations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Samples should be taken only if there is a real need to do so—eg where a damaged item is believed to contain asbestos, or a machine is believed to put asbestos dust into the air, or projected refurbishment of part of a vessel or its machinery may put suspect material into the air.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sampling will generate airborne fibres; so persons sampling should be equipped with suitable protective clothing, including masks e.g. FFFP3 disposable. All personnel not involved should be excluded from the area whilst sampling is being carried out. Where a sample is taken from lagging or an insulation board, etc. the damaged material should be thoroughly sealed, and, in all cases, any debris or dust remaining should be properly removed in accordance with national regulations applicable to the place where the vessel is at the time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Samples of material;</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>(a) Asbestos material may be encountered in two forms: first, where the mix of materials will be the same throughout—such as tiles or insulation board; and, second, where the mix of materials may vary through the items to be sampled—for example, sprayed coatings or pipe and boiler lagging.</p>

<p>(b) Where the material is the same throughout, one or two representative samples each about 5 cm square are normally sufficient for analysis.</p>

<p>(c) With material such as lagging, there can be variations in the mix used in the same area—both along the length of each piece of insulation, and through the depth of insulation at each point. Blue asbestos can be present as an impurity, and may not be evenly distributed. Samples should therefore be taken as follows. Take a core, of about 5 cm square in section, through the ` insulation so as to include everything from the outer surface to the surface of the underlying unit. It is advisable that at least two samples should be taken from each boiler, calorifier or pipe run. Preferably one sample should be taken for each 3 metres of pipe insulation, etc. Extra samples should also be taken.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Samples of Dust; Where the dust in question has been generated at one particular place, and has collected at one particular spot, a ‘‘handful’’ sample should be obtained, if possible. Where the dust may have been generated from more than one place, or has been spread over an area of deck, etc. a number of “handful” samples should be taken, if possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where more than one sample has been obtained, it is important that the samples are clearly and unambiguously identified as to the place from which they came, and that there is no possibility of cross-contamination between the samples. Each sample should be put into its own clear plastic bag. This should be sealed with adhesive tape to avoid the possibility of any dust escaping during transit. The sealed bag should be clearly marked with the sample number or other identifying details. The sample should then be sealed into a further plastic bag using adhesive tape.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A note should go with the sample(s) giving their details, together with the name, address and telephone number of the person to whom the results are to be reported, the name of his company and ship, and any other relevant information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Asbestos analysis laboratories can do this work and a list of such laboratories can be obtained from the:-</p>

  <li>
    <p>Samples should be sent only to a recommended laboratory, who may charge for the analysis. Samples should not be sent to an MCA Marine Office or to any other part of the Department for Transport.</p>

  <li>
    <p>For vessels operating outside the UK advice should be sought from the local Maritime Administration or the local Port Health authority.</p>
