<h2>Annex 3 (regulation 10)</h2>

<h3>Measures to be taken to prevent exposure to asbestos</h3>

<p>(1) Where the limit value, set out in paragraph 2.2(b) of the main body of this MGN, is exceeded, the employer must identify the reasons for the limit value being exceeded and take appropriate measures to remedy the situation as soon as possible.</p>

<p>(2) The employer must prevent work from continuing in the affected area until adequate measures have been taken for the protection of the workers concerned.</p>

<p>(3) In order to check the effectiveness of the measures mentioned in paragraph (1), the employer must immediately carry out a further determination of the asbestos-in-air concentration.</p>

<p>(4) Where exposure cannot be prevented by other means and where achieving compliance with regulation 8 or the limit value makes necessary the wearing of individual protective breathing equipment. This must not be permanent and the employer must keep work requiring the wearing of such equipment to the strict minimum necessary for each worker.</p>

<p>(5) Where in the case of activities such as ship breaking, removal of asbestos, repair and maintenance it is foreseeable that the limit value will be exceeded despite the use of technical preventive measures for limiting asbestos in air concentrations, the employer shall determine the measures intended to ensure protection of the workers while they are engaged in those activities, and in particular–</p>

<p>(a) the employer must issue suitable respiratory and other personal protective equipment to workers and ensure that it is worn,
(b) the employer must put up warning signs indicating that it is foreseeable that the limit value will be exceeded, and
(c) the employer must prevent the spread of dust arising from asbestos outside the ship or site of activity.</p>

<p>(6) During periods of work which require the use of individual protective breathing equipment, the employer must make provision for breaks appropriate to the physical and climatological conditions and, where relevant, in consultation with the workers and/or their representatives.</p>

<p>(7) Guidance on respiratory and personal protective equipment is contained in Merchant Shipping Notice <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/msn-1870-mf-personal-protective-equipment-standards">MSN 1870 (M+F)</a> and Annex 5 of this MGN.</p>
