<h3>The medical examination – what to expect</h3>

<p>These examinations will take place at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/information-for-victims-of-rape-and-sexual-assault/www.medicinalegal.gov.co/">Medicina Legal</a>.

  <li>pregnancy test</li>
  <li>morning after pill: if the victim has fallen pregnant, medical staff can provide information on terminating the pregnancy</li>
  <li>post-exposure prophylaxis treatment</li>
  <li>possible sample-taking</li>
</ul>

<p>The hospital will usually collect the clothes and if/when they liaise with the police this will be handed in to them. Assistance to victims of rape and sexual assault is free of charge in Colombia.</p>

<p>The British Embassy can offer a list of English-speaking private doctors. A policy is now in place which means that victims should not be asked to repeat their account or personal information multiple times, which can lead to re-victimisation.</p>

<p>HIV PEP medication needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. The NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28 day treatment on return to the UK. Emergency contraception needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective.</p>

<p>If you have had medication administered overseas, you may wish to keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication, so that you let your local health provider know when you return home.</p>

<h3>Police investigations in Colombia – what to expect</h3>

<p>The local police will not take you to the scene of crime to identify and arrest the person. The identification process of the suspect will be made by a physical description and a photo album identification.</p>

<p>In normal circumstances, judicial cases go through a lengthy process that can last up to 3 years. The victim does not need to remain in Colombia for this period. If the police make an arrest, they will take the suspect before the public prosecutor and the hearings will start within a few months. However, to note that the identification process that may take longer than expected.</p>

<p>The victim will not be expected to go in front of the public prosecutor to make a statement. However, they can appoint a legal representative to act on their behalf whilst they are outside of Colombia. Their lawyers will have access to the victim/case notes at this stage.</p>

<p>Pro bono (free or low cost) service is difficult to find in Colombia, but the British Embassy can share a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/colombia-list-of-lawyers">list of lawyers</a> in country who may be able to. You will be allowed to leave the country once the case is filed.</p>

<p>Without a lawyer you will still be entitled to be kept informed of the case, but Lawyers will have the local contacts at the Prosecutor’s Office that will facilitate this process. Moreover, local lawyers are aware of what due process in Colombia means, usual processing times and will be able to advice accordingly.</p>

<p>A policy is now in place which means that victims should not be asked to repeat their account or personal information multiple times, which can lead to re-victimisation. The victim may drop charges after they are filled, but the charge of rape is an automatic state prosecution In Colombia that will not be dropped unless you state that the allegations were false. In this case, an investigation may be opened against you for false accusations.</p>

<p>The alleged assailant may press counter charges claiming false accusations. The court will order the offender to pay compensation for any injuries or losses, after they have been convicted in a criminal court or as a result of civil action.</p>

<p>There is a State-funded compensation scheme to cover physical or psychological injuries suffered as a result of a violent crime, but only if the events occurred within the internal conflict context. This may apply to foreign nationals as well.</p>

  <li>If the perpetrator is found not guilty, you can appeal to this decision.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Compensation</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The courts can order the offender to pay compensation for any injuries or losses, either after they have been convicted in a criminal court or as a result of civil action.</li>
  <li>There is a State-funded compensation scheme to cover physical or psychological injuries suffered as a result of a violent crime, but only if the events occurred within the internal conflict context. This may apply to foreign nationals as well.</li>
</ul>
