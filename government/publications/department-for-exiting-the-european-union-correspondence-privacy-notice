<p>Privacy notices explain in more detail how the Department will handle your data in specific circumstances. The purpose for which we are processing personal data is to respond to letters, emails or other communications from members of the public, Parliamentarians, and representatives of organisations.</p>

<p>This notice sets out how we will use your personal data, and your rights. It is made under
Articles 13 and 14 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose for which we are processing your personal data is to respond to letters, emails
or other communications from members of the public, parliamentarians, and representatives
of organisations.</p>

<h3 id="the-data">The data</h3>

<p>We will process the following personal data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your name</li>
  <li>address</li>
  <li>email address</li>
</ul>

<p>We will also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>collect details of any concerns raised in your correspondence</li>
  <li>process any other information you volunteer about yourself</li>
</ul>

<p>We may also process special category data or data about criminal convictions if you
volunteer such information. Special categories of personal data include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>data about racial or ethnic origin</li>
  <li>political opinions</li>
  <li>religious or philosophical beliefs</li>
  <li>trade union membership</li>
  <li>genetic data</li>
  <li>biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, health, or sex life or sexual orientation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="legal-basis-of-processing">Legal basis of processing</h3>

<p>The legal basis for processing the personal data is that processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the data controller.</p>

<p>In this case, that is being accountable and transparent about the functions and policies for
which the department is responsible.</p>

<p>Where special category data or data about criminal convictions is volunteered by a correspondent, our legal basis for processing it is that it is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest for the exercise of a function of the Crown, a Minister of the Crown, or a government department.</p>

<p>The substantial public interest is being accountable and transparent about the functions and policies for which the department is responsible.</p>

<p>In relation to constituency correspondence, the processing consists of the disclosure of personal data to an elected representative or a person acting with the authority of such a representative. It is in response to a communication to the controller from that representative or person which was made in response to a request from an individual. The personal data is
relevant to the subject matter of that communication; and the disclosure is necessary for the purpose of responding to that communication.</p>

<h3 id="recipients">Recipients</h3>

<p>Your information may be shared with other public bodies where it is necessary in order to provide a full answer to you, or where it is necessary to transfer correspondence to a more appropriate body for answer.</p>

<p>Where your correspondence relates to a party political matter, we will pass it to the relevant political party for a response.</p>

<p>Where your correspondence relates to a constituency matter, we will pass it to the relevant
constituency office for a response.</p>

<p>Your information may be shared with your Member of Parliament where they are writing on
your behalf.</p>

<p>As personal data will be stored on our IT infrastructure it will also be shared with our data processors who provide email, and document management and storage services.</p>

<h3 id="source-of-information">Source of information</h3>

<p>Where we did not receive your personal data from you, it was received from your MP, or by another person writing in on your behalf, or by another correspondent.</p>

<h3 id="retention">Retention</h3>

<p>Personal information in correspondence will usually be deleted 3 calendar years after the correspondence or case is closed or concluded.</p>

<p>Public correspondence may however be kept if it is sufficiently significant that it should be retained for the historical record.</p>

<h3 id="your-rights">Your rights</h3>

<p>You have the right to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>request information about how your personal data are processed, and to request a
copy of that personal data</li>
  <li>request that any inaccuracies in your personal data are rectified without delay</li>
  <li>request that any incomplete personal data are completed, including by means of a
supplementary statement</li>
  <li>request that your personal data are erased if there is no longer a justification for them
to be processed</li>
  <li>in certain circumstances (for example, where accuracy is contested) to request that
the processing of your personal data is restricted</li>
  <li>object to the processing of your personal data</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="international-transfers">International transfers</h3>

<p>As your personal data is stored on our IT infrastructure, and shared with our data processors, it may be transferred and stored securely outside the European Union. Where
that is the case it will be subject to equivalent legal protection through the use of Model Contract Clauses.</p>

<h3 id="complaints">Complaints</h3>
