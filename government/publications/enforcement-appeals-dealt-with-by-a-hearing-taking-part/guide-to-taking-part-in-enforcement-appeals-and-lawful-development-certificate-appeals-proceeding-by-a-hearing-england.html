<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>1.1. This guide explains how, if you are interested in the outcome of an appeal, you can make your views known.</p>

<p>1.2. Please note – there are separate guides for enforcement appeals and lawful development certificate appeals that are proceeding by the written representations or inquiry process. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/organisations/planning-inspectorate">access all our guides through GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>1.3. If you need this guidance in large print, in audio format or in Braille, please contact our Customer Support Team on 0303 444 5000.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Who decides an appeal and what are the rules?</h2>

<p>2.1. Nearly all appeals are decided by our Inspectors, a very small percentage are decided by the Secretary of State - these tend to be the very large or contentious breaches of planning control.</p>

<p>2.2. For:</p>

<p>(a) an appeal against an enforcement notice (section 174 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990);</p>

<p>(b) an appeal against the refusal or non-determination of an application for a certificate of lawful use or development (section 195 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990);</p>

<p>(c) an appeal against a listed building enforcement notice (section 39 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act;</p>

<p>the hearing is held under:</p>

<p>The Town and Country Planning (Enforcement) (Hearings Procedure) (England) Rules 2002 – Statutory Instrument 2002/2684.</p>

<p>2.3. The Business and Planning Act 2020 now provides greater flexibility, allowing appeal procedures to be combined. If we have decided initially that an appeal should follow the hearings procedure, we may subsequently also consider whether a ‘combined procedure’, with some issues dealt with by written representations might be appropriate. If a ‘combined procedure’ is decided upon, how the combined procedure should operate is at our discretion on a case by case basis.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>How you find out about the appeal</h2>

<p>3.1. If there is an appeal the local planning authority (LPA), usually your local council or National Park Authority, should write to everyone who it thinks is affected, to tell them about the appeal.</p>

<p>3.2. This is the minimum publicity requirement. Your LPA may give appeals more publicity and will probably put information on its website. It may also publish details of the hearing in a local newspaper if it thinks it is necessary.</p>

<p>3.3. If you have already written to the LPA about the site or building:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it will normally write to tell you about the appeal within 2 weeks of us accepting it; and</li>
  <li>when the arrangements have been made for the hearing it will normally let you know when and where it will take place</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>What you can do</h2>

<p>4.1. If you have already contacted the LPA about the site or building it may send us your representations. But it does not have to do this. If you want the Inspector to take your views into account you should send us your representations about the appeal.</p>

<p>4.2. You must make sure that we receive your representations within 6 weeks of the starting date for the appeal. The LPA should have told you the deadline. There is a timetable for the hearing procedure in the annexe to this guide. If it is decided that a combined procedure would be appropriate, further written representations may be invited from the parties, if considered necessary, within a specified timetable.</p>

<p>4.3. The time limits for sending representations to us are important, and everyone taking part in an appeal must follow them. <strong>If you send us representations after the end of the time limits, we will not normally accept them. Instead we will return them to you. This means that the Inspector will not see them and so will not be able to take them into account.</strong></p>

<p>4.4. When you send us your representations you should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your name and address;</li>
  <li>the Planning Inspectorate appeal reference number (this will start APP/…);</li>
  <li>the address of the appeal site;</li>
</ul>

<p>and, for an appeal against an enforcement notice, say either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘I support the LPA in issuing the enforcement notice’ and explain whether it is for the same reasons as given by the LPA or, if not, explain your own reasons; or</li>
  <li>‘I support the appellant in appealing against the enforcement notice’ and explain why;</li>
</ul>

<p>and, for an appeal about an application for a lawful development certificate, say either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘I support the LPA in refusing the application’ and explain whether it is for the same reasons as given by the LPA or, if not, explain your own reasons; or</li>
  <li>‘I support the appellant in appealing against the LPA’s refusal’ and explain why.</li>
</ul>

<p>4.5. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/" rel="external">make your representation online using the search facility</a> or you can write to or email us. The LPA should have told you our Case Officer’s contact details. Our Case Officer is responsible for the administration of the appeal.</p>

<p>4.6. If you send us your representations in a letter, unless your handwriting is very clear it would help if you are able to have your comments typed. Please use <strong>black</strong> ink. Please note that we do not acknowledge receipt.</p>

<p>4.7. We will copy your representations to the appellant and to the LPA where they will be available for anyone to see them.</p>

<p>4.8. However if we consider your representations contain inflammatory, discriminatory or abusive comments, we will send them back to you before the Inspector or anyone else sees them. If you take out the inflammatory, discriminatory or abusive comments, you can send your representations back to us; <strong>but</strong> you must send them back before the time limit ends.</p>

<p>4.9. We do not accept anonymous representations, but you may ask for your name and address to be withheld. If you ask us to do this you should make sure that your representations do not include any other information which may identify you. We will copy your representations, with your name and address removed, to the parties, and they will be seen by the Inspector who may give them less weight as a result.</p>

<p>4.10. If you indicate that you do not want us to copy your representations to the appellant and the LPA, we will return them. They will not be seen by the Inspector and, therefore, will not be taken into account. This is because the Inspector can only take into account representations which have been copied to the appellant and the LPA and are available to be seen.</p>

<p>4.11. If you own the land and you do not appeal against <strong>an enforcement notice</strong> but someone else does appeal against it, in law you will have the status of an ‘interested person’. This does not entitle you to receive a copy of all the representations made by the appellant and other interested people (though you would be able to see such representations at the LPA’s offices).</p>

<p>4.12. However, in those circumstances, you may wish to request to be considered as an ‘interested owner’. This status is given at our discretion. It means that we will give you similar treatment as to an appellant. You will be able to attend any hearing or local inquiry, or be present when the Inspector visits the site. You will also be able to see and comment on any written representations made by the appellant, the LPA, and any other interested people, during the progress of the appeal. It is important you notify us to request this at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>What is considered?</h2>

<p>5.1. The Inspector can only take into account information and evidence that is relevant to the appeal. This could cover a wide range of issues, but those that apply are usually set out in the LPA’s reasons for issuing the enforcement notice or in the decision notice in the case of a lawful development certificate appeal.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>If you decide to send documents to support your representations</h2>

<p>6.1. Please note that we are unable to return any documents or photographs.</p>

<p>6.2. Please</p>

<ul>
  <li>use a font such as Arial or Verdana in a size of 11 point or larger;</li>
  <li>use <strong>A4</strong> paper wherever possible;</li>
  <li>number the pages of the documents;</li>
  <li>make sure photocopied and scanned documents are clear and legible;</li>
  <li>use black and white for documents unless colour is essential;</li>
  <li>put any photographs (both originals and photocopies should be in colour), maps, plans, etc, in a <strong>separate appendix</strong> and cross-reference them within the main body of the document;</li>
  <li>print documents on both sides of a page. You should use paper of good enough quality that something printed on one side of the page does not show through to the other side;</li>
  <li>ensure that the scale and orientation of any maps and plans are shown clearly. If you are sending maps or plans by email or through GOV.UK you <strong>MUST</strong> tell us the paper size;</li>
  <li>do not send original documents unless we specifically ask for them.</li>
</ul>

<p>6.3. For further information please see Annexe F of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/enforcement-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Enforcement appeals – England”</a>
or Annexe D of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/certificate-of-lawful-use-or-development-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Certificate of lawful use or development appeals – England”</a>.</p>

<p>6.4. Both of these documents/annexes contain the same information about “Communicating electronically with us” and sending documents through GOV.UK or by email.</p>

<p>6.5. You may wish to familiarise yourself with the content of the relevant “Procedural Guide” depending on whether you are interested in an enforcement appeal or a lawful development certificate appeal.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Audio/video evidence</h2>

<p>7.1. We will return any audio/video evidence sent to us in advance of the hearing. You may send a written summary which will be seen by the Inspector, the appellant, and the LPA. Please send this within the 6 week deadline for comments. Also you may ask the Inspector at the hearing if he or she is willing to accept the audio/video evidence and allow it to be played at the hearing.</p>

<p>7.2. It is your responsibility to contact the LPA to find out whether it has suitable equipment at the venue to access the evidence, or if it will allow you to use your own. The equipment must be suitable to play the evidence so that everyone can see/hear it.</p>

<p>7.3. If the evidence is accepted by the Inspector it will become part of the hearing evidence and will be retained by the Inspector. You will need to have 2 additional copies of the audio/video evidence available as if the Inspector allows it to be played these copies will be given to the LPA and the appellant.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Before the hearing</h2>

<p>8.1. Local people are encouraged to take part in the hearing process. Local knowledge and opinion can often be a valuable addition to the evidence given by the appellant and the LPA.</p>

<p>8.2. Before going to the hearing, if you want to see what the appellant and the LPA have written, you should be able to see copies of the appeal documents at the LPA’s offices. The LPA’s and the appellant’s hearing statement should be available 6 weeks after the appeal start date.</p>

<p>8.3. Depending on whether you oppose or support the appeal you may wish to consult the LPA or the appellant to find out what their position will be at the hearing to help you decide whether your position can be satisfactorily represented by them.</p>

<p>8.4. Hearings are open to members of the public, and although you do not have a legal right to speak, the Inspector will normally allow you to do so. If you want to speak at a hearing, you need to think about what you want to say and how you want to say it. Some people prefer to make, or read out, a brief statement giving their views. If there are several people with the same views, it is a good idea for one person to speak on behalf of the others.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Hearing venue</h2>

<p>9.1. We ask the LPA to arrange the hearing venue. Hearings are usually held in LPA offices, village halls or community centres. We have set out the facilities that a hearing venue should include. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/setting-up-a-venue-for-a-public-inquiry-hearing-or-examination">access our document “The venue and facilities for public inquiries and hearings” on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Virtual events</h2>

<p>10.1. During the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic it has not been possible to hold events such as hearings that require people to attend in person. We have therefore developed virtual events that allow participants to take part from their own home, office or other location. The purpose of the hearing is unchanged – to enable appeal parties and Interested Parties to give their views and for the Inspector to robustly test the evidence being presented. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/planning-inspectorate-virtual-events-guide-to-participating">guide to participating in a Planning Inspectorate virtual event</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>People with disabilities</h2>

<p>11.1. We want to hold all hearings in buildings with proper facilities for people with disabilities. If you, or anyone you know, want to go to the hearing and you have particular needs, please contact the LPA to confirm that it can make proper arrangements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Openness and transparency</h2>

<p>12.1. Hearings are open to journalists and the wider public, as well as interested people. Provided that it does not disrupt proceedings, anyone will be allowed to report, record and film proceedings including the use of digital and social media. Inspectors will advise people present at the start of the event that the proceedings may be recorded and/or filmed, and that anyone using social media during or after the end of the proceedings should do so responsibly.</p>

<p>12.2. If you want to record or film the event on equipment larger than a smart phone, tablet, compact camera, or similar, especially if that is likely to involve moving around the venue to record or film from different angles, you should contact us and the LPA in advance to discuss arrangements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>What happens at the hearing?</h2>

<p>13.1. The hearing is an inquisitorial process led by the Inspector who identifies the issues for discussion based on the evidence received and any representations made.</p>

<p>13.2. The Inspector will open the hearing by explaining what the appeal is about. He or she will then go through some routine points, and explain how he or she intends to proceed and will ask who wants to speak.</p>

<p>13.3. The order in which people speak at a hearing on any topic that needs to be discussed will be tailored to the individual appeal and who is at the hearing. The Inspector will usually outline the main issues and any other matters to be discussed at the hearing. It will always take the form of a structured discussion led by the Inspector. The Inspector will ensure that the hearing is orderly so everyone involved can have a fair hearing.</p>

<p>13.4. Repeating arguments at the hearing that you have already made in written comments or which someone has already said does not help the Inspector, or make the point more relevant. However, there should be no ‘surprises’ and ‘new’ evidence should not be presented at this time as it could result in the Inspector having to adjourn the hearing so that such evidence can be properly considered and answered. You should have set out your main concerns in your representation sent at the 6 week stage.</p>

<p>13.5. If you make comments, or have any questions, you must put them through the Inspector.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>Inspector’s questions</h2>

<p>14.1. At any stage during proceedings the Inspector may ask questions. Questions may be put to all those who give evidence, including interested people.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span>Discussion of planning conditions</h2>

<p>15.1. If the appellant has pleaded that planning permission should be granted for the alleged development (as described on the enforcement notice) the hearing will usually include a discussion about the conditions which may be imposed if the development is granted planning permission. The fact that conditions are discussed does not mean that the appeal will be allowed and planning permission granted or that, if allowed, conditions will be imposed.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span>Closing statements</h2>

<p>16.1. Finally (so far as dealing with evidence about the case is concerned) there are usually closing statements which are an opportunity for the appellant and the LPA to sum up their case. The appellant will always be allowed to speak last at this point in proceedings.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span>Application for appeal costs</h2>

<p>17.1. The Inspector will then hear any applications for costs. All parties to an appeal are normally expected to meet their own expenses.</p>

<p>17.2. There is <a class="govuk-link" href="/guidance/appeals">guidance about costs awards in the Department for Communities and Local Government’s planning practice guidance</a>.</p>

<p>17.3. It is important that you read this because it explains how, when and on what basis you can make an application or have an application made against you.</p>

<p>17.4. Costs may be awarded in response to an application for costs by one of the parties. Also costs may be awarded at the initiative of the Inspector.
of the Inspector.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">18. </span>Site visit</h2>

<p>18.1. Once any claim for costs has been heard the Inspector will make arrangements for the site visit. The Inspector will make it clear if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it would be helpful to carry on the discussion on the site and so will not close the hearing until after the site visit; or</li>
  <li>it appears that all discussion has been completed and the hearing will be closed before going to the site. In this circumstance there will be no further discussion of the merits/facts of the appeal at the site.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">19. </span>The decision</h2>

<p>19.1. When made, the decision will be published and can be viewed using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/" rel="external">search facility</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">20. </span>Feedback, complaints and challenges</h2>

<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>

<p>20.1. We welcome feedback about people’s experience of dealing with us. This can be provided to us at any time. Please send these to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:feedback@planninginspectorate.gov.uk">feedback@planninginspectorate.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Complaints</strong></p>

<p>20.2. If after the decision on an appeal has been published, we receive a complaint against an Inspector’s decision or the Inspector or the way we administered a case it is dealt with by the Customer Quality Team who are independent of the teams who process cases. All complaints are investigated thoroughly and impartially. Further information on our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/organisations/planning-inspectorate/about/complaints-procedure">complaints procedure</a> is available on the GOV.UK website.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>

<p>20.3. To be successful, you would have to show that:
* an error had been made in law; or
* we did not follow the proper procedures and that your interests may have been harmed.</p>

<p>20.4. If your challenge is successful, the Court will return the appeal to us for it to be decided again. This does not necessarily mean that the original decision will be changed or reversed. For further information please see Annexe H, “How can a decision be challenged?” of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/enforcement-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Enforcement appeals – England”</a> or Annexe G of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/certificate-of-lawful-use-or-development-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Certificate of lawful use or development appeals – England”</a>.</p>

<p>20.5. <strong>In enforcement appeals:</strong> a High Court challenge can only be made by the appellant, the local planning authority or any other person with a legal interest in the land. If you have a legal interest in the land, to challenge an enforcement decision you must first get the permission of the Court. However, if the Court does not consider that there is an arguable case, it can refuse permission. Applications for permission to make a challenge must be received by the Administrative Court within 28 days of the date of the decision, unless the Court extends this period.</p>

<p>20.6. <strong>In lawful development certificate appeals:</strong> a High Court challenge can be made by a person aggrieved by the decision if they have sufficient interest in it. This could include interested people as well as appellants, local planning authorities and landowners. A challenge to a decision in the High Court must be made within 42 days (6 weeks). This period cannot be extended.</p>

<p>20.7. <strong>Other aggrieved people:</strong> may apply for judicial review by the Courts. The claim form must be filed with the Administrative Court not later than 6 weeks after the grounds to make the claim first arose. The Administrative Court can tell you more about how to do this – its contact details are at paragraph 20.4 below.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">21. </span>Complaints about a decision made by administrative staff</h2>

<p>21.1. If you wish to complain about a decision made by administrative staff during the processing of an appeal should write to our Case Officer giving clear reasons why you think we should review our decision.</p>

<p>21.2. For decisions made by administrative staff during the processing of an appeal there is no statutory right to challenge that decision in the High Court. However it is possible to make an application for judicial review of such a decision. For further information please see Annexe H “How can a decision be challenged” of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/enforcement-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Enforcement appeals – England”</a> or Annexe G of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/certificate-of-lawful-use-or-development-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Certificate of lawful use or development appeals – England”</a>.</p>
