<p>Today’s Global Pandemic Preparedness Summit marks a vital step in making possible the 100 Days Mission: the ambition to have safe and effective vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics within 100 days of an epidemic or pandemic threat being identified. If this mission is achieved, it could prevent future pandemics before they start, saving millions of lives. This mission was put forward by the UK under its Presidency of the Group of 7 (<abbr title="Group of 7">G7</abbr>) in 2021 and has been welcomed by leaders of the <abbr title="Group of 7">G7</abbr> and Group of 20 (<abbr title="Group of 20">G20</abbr>) and backed by representatives of the life sciences industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Close working between the UK government, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (<abbr title="the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations">CEPI</abbr>) and the life sciences industry has been critical in the response to COVID-19 and has enabled the development of safe and effective vaccines in unprecedented timeframes. Meeting the 100 Days Mission requires ongoing partnership across the public and private sectors, in addition to other critical enabling factors within the global health architecture, such as improved pathogen surveillance and immediate information, biosample and data sharing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We – the UK government, <abbr title="the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations">CEPI</abbr> and the associations representing vaccine manufacturers, as well as the broader biotech and biopharmaceutical industry, commit our support for <abbr title="the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations">CEPI</abbr>’s mission: to support the development of vaccines against emerging infectious disease and enable equitable access to those vaccines during outbreaks. We commit to taking forward specific steps needed to deliver on the 100 Days Mission.  &nbsp;</p>

<p>Specifically:&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The UK government aims – in keeping with its Life Sciences Vision published in July 2021 – to deliver a research and development network, accessible to industry, to speed up the development and delivery of novel vaccines. The UK Vaccines Taskforce has been an exemplar of government and industry working together to accelerate vaccine development.&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations">CEPI</abbr>’s 5-year strategy aims to make the development of vaccines against emerging pathogens within 100 days a reality, because the quicker a safe, effective and globally accessible vaccine is developed and deployed, the quicker an incipient pandemic can be contained and controlled. Achieving the 100 Day Mission, through <abbr title="the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations">CEPI</abbr>’s innovative programme of access-focused research and development, would give the world a fighting chance of defusing the threat of future pathogens with pandemic potential.&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Associations representing vaccine manufacturers, as well as the broader biotech and biopharmaceutical industry (<abbr title="Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry">ABPI</abbr>, <abbr title="the BioIndustry Association">BIA</abbr>, <abbr title="Biotechnology Innovation Organization">BIO</abbr> and the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network (<abbr title="the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network">DCVMN</abbr>) and IFPMA – <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ifpma.org/resource-centre/global-pandemic-preparedness-summit-cepi-replenishment" rel="external">see the full statement</a>) commit to:&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>investing in research and development on target pathogens with epidemic and pandemic potential and to build a portfolio of promising candidate vaccines, treatments and technologies&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>working to reduce manufacturing complexities and developing new manufacturing methods to adapt and quickly expand manufacturing capacity for new vaccines to address future public health emergencies</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>producing high-quality evidence, at speed, on the efficacy and safety of our products, both prior to and during pandemic conditions, and maintaining the highest levels of quality and ethical standards, transparency and accountability, therefore contributing to a strengthened global clinical trial infrastructure</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The work of the life sciences industry is critical to enabling the 100 Days Mission – in developing new vaccine technology, modernising and increasing vaccine manufacturing, supporting clinical trials infrastructure and collaboration and in enabling equitable access. We welcome the supportive statements by companies to deliver on the recommendations of the 100 Days Mission, set out below this statement.</p>

<h2>Further individual statements of support from companies&nbsp;</h2>

<h3>AstraZeneca&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The story of the vaccine is one of unprecedented collaboration. Our landmark partnership with Oxford University enabled us to pool world-renowned expertise in vaccinology with large scale manufacturing in the very early stages of the pandemic. The result was that through a network of 25 partners, we were able to accelerate production of the vaccine over the course of a few months, a process that normally takes years.</p>

<p>This provides a template for the future and demonstrates the importance of public private investment in creating sustainable regional manufacturing operations as well as the need for a simplified regulatory environment. The pandemic has also spurred phenomenal scientific innovation. At AstraZeneca, alongside the vaccine, we have developed a long-acting antibody COVID-19 therapy to protect vulnerable populations. These COVID-19 medicines form a central part of our new Vaccines and Immune Therapies unit, which is focused on finding ways to address infectious diseases. This unit builds on everything we have learnt from our response to COVID and put us in a strong position to tackle any future pandemics.&nbsp;</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>GSK&nbsp;</h3>

<p>GSK has advocated for <abbr title="the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations">CEPI</abbr> since its inception in 2017  and we continue to support <abbr title="the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations">CEPI</abbr>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>GSK was an active contributor to the UK <abbr title="Group of 7">G7</abbr> Pandemic Preparedness Partnership (PPP) and 100-days mission.  &nbsp;</p>

<p>GSK has maintained pandemic readiness with our supply of pandemic adjuvanted influenza vaccines and activated our adjuvant supply for coronavirus partnerships. We are in the final stages with several partners, including Medicago, Sanofi and <abbr title="the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations">CEPI</abbr> supported SK Bioscience, on the development and licensure of 3 protein-based COVID-19 vaccines using GSK’s pandemic adjuvant.  In addition, our monoclonal antibody sotrivimab, developed with Vir, was approved under <abbr title="Emergency Use Authorization">EUA</abbr> in 2021.  &nbsp;</p>

<p>We intend to extend our pandemic readiness with a broad array of technologies. We will also look to support skills development and <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> programs in Africa by leveraging our global health partnerships and longstanding experience in manufacturing and clinical research in Africa, notably our Malaria and <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> vaccine trials and phase IV collaborations in sub-Saharan Africa. </p>

<h3>Johnson &amp; Johnson  &nbsp;</h3>

<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson strongly supports the goals of the UK’s Global Pandemic Preparedness Summit and the ambitions of the 100 Days Mission. Over the past 25 years we have made substantial investments in cutting-edge <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> capabilities and platform technologies to bring forward vaccines and therapeutics that help prevent disease, save lives, and combat epidemics, as shown by our accelerated Ebola and COVID-19 vaccine programmes.

<p>Effective collaboration is central to improved global health security and the successful protection of vulnerable communities from urgent threats like COVID-19 and persistent challenges, like HIV and tuberculosis. These collaborations should be the new normal and support improvements in <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr>, clinical trials infrastructure, global regulatory frameworks, and digital technologies. As manufacturing capacity expands, life-course immunisation will be a vital component of improved readiness to maintain vaccine production between pandemics that will be the basis for scale-up in an emergency. We are committed to a world in which epidemics and pandemics no longer threaten humanity. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Moderna&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Moderna is announcing its global public health strategy through 2 new initiatives aimed at advancing mRNA vaccines for the prevention of infectious diseases, which support the ethos of the 100 Days Mission. </p>

<p>First, Moderna is announcing a commitment to expand its global public health portfolio to 15 vaccine programs targeting priority pathogens identified by <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> and <abbr title="the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations">CEPI</abbr> that threaten global health, advancing these vaccines into clinical studies by 2025. Second, to accelerate research with the aim of advancing additional vaccines, Moderna is launching a new program, mRNA Access, a new collaborative that will offer researchers around the world the use of Moderna’s mRNA technology to explore new vaccines against emerging or neglected infectious disease in their own labs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Novo Nordisk Foundation&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Strengthening epidemic preparedness is a key pillar in the Novo Nordisk Foundation’s (NNF) forthcoming 2030 strategy. A broad portfolio of translational research activities are envisaged, and initial mission-driven initiatives will focus on developing new anti-viral drugs, or new vaccines against viral and bacterial targets. With regards to the latter, the NNF has recently begun developing plans for a Center for Infectious Disease Research and Vaccine Design in Denmark.</p>

<p>The ambition for this initiative is to establish a critical mass that conducts discovery, translational research and clinical trials on vaccines against diverse respiratory pathogens that have epidemic potential or promote the spread of anti-microbial resistance.</p>

These scientific communities are delivering ground-breaking work to tackle local public health challenges, as well as global issues such as the current increase in drug-resistant pathogens. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Pfizer&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The pandemic taught us that we can accomplish great things when we are united by a common purpose. The virus knows no geographic borders. It doesn’t discriminate based on race, religion, gender, financial condition or political affiliation. So, to defeat it, we need to be united. &nbsp;</p>

<p>That’s why we forged partnerships with industry peers, health authorities and experts around the world as we worked to protect the health and safety of our communities, and to find medical and scientific solutions to this crisis. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The dedication and accomplishments of our scientists and our partners in both the private and public sectors are nothing short of inspiring. We are all forever changed by what the crisis has demanded from each of us, and we look forward to continued collaborations with stakeholders across the global healthcare ecosystem as we work to help the world be better prepared for the next global health crisis. We believe this sense of purpose, spirit of collaboration, degree of confidence and deeper pride in our work will extend well beyond the pandemic as we serve the needs of patients around the world. </p>

<h3>RD Therapeutics&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>

<p>RD Therapeutics actively supports the 100 Days Mission and <abbr title="the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations">CEPI</abbr>’s agenda. We are fully committed to enabling equitable access to vaccines through the development and commercialisation of a temperature and humidity-stable, oral delivery platform (QuickStrip<sup>TM</sup>) for vaccines. The goals of the QuickStrip<sup>TM</sup> platform are to decrease time to market, increase reach, eliminate the need for medical professional administration and cold-chain transportation (reducing CO2 emissions), and enhance ease of use, hence making mass distribution quicker and more efficient.</p>

<p>The RDT development program focuses on incorporating late-stage or approved vaccines using LNP mRNA, viral vector, or alternatives, into our proprietary delivery platform. QuickStrip<sup>TM</sup> manufacturing will begin in Phase 2 for new vaccines and a cohort of subjects in Phase 3 will provide the additional efficacy data for required rapid roll-out to key geographic regions. Our approach will eliminate the non-clinical testing requirements of a new vaccine, expediting availability to significantly enhance market penetration and cover unmet medical needs in developing countries – a critical element in controlling or preventing a global pandemic. </p>

<h3>Sanofi </h3>

<p>Sanofi commits to playing an important role in responding to future pandemics via 3 key levers.</p>

<p>First, innovation through investment in state-of-the-art mRNA technology with the launch of Centers of Excellence to accelerate end-to-end <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> of next-generation vaccines and drive a new era of response capability.  Second, taking our diversified industrial footprint to the next level through Evolutive Vaccine Facilities that are setting a new standard for biologics manufacturing flexibility and speed.  Third, public – private partnership excellence in respiratory disease surveillance through the Global Influenza Hospital Surveillance Network, over 100 hospitals in 20 countries collecting and sharing clinical, virological and virus genome sequencing data. Leveraging existing domestic assets and artificial intelligence expertise, this resilient network is set to expand for pandemic preparedness.</p>

<p>A reminder for all:  success of a pandemic response through these investments requires unencumbered access to pathogens to be able to be prepared and respond.  &nbsp;</p>
