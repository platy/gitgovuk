<h2>Using the checklist</h2>

<p>This checklist is for ‘Independent Auditors’ undertaking self-assessment compliance audits under Affordable Homes Programme and Shared Ownership and Affordable Homes Programme contracts. Applies when schemes were not delivered through strategic partnership contracts.</p>

<h2>What this checklist is for</h2>

<p>This checklist is to ensure that requirements and funding conditions for <abbr title="Affordable Homes Programme">AHP</abbr> Contracts have been met according to the Capital Funding Guide (<abbr title="Capital Funding Guide">CFG</abbr>).</p>

<p>All audits are undertaken online through the Compliance Audit system. This document is for information only and is not intended to be used to record or submit information regarding any audit. All questions will require a yes or no answer and additional explanatory text to clarify the full details.</p>

<p>The numbers below will not correspond with the numbers of the questions presented in the audit compliance system for individual schemes selected for audit.</p>

<h2>General questions</h2>

<p>1: Has a comprehensive scheme file (or equivalent) been provided containing all relevant documents as set out in the <abbr title="Capital Funding Guide">CFG</abbr>?</p>

<p>If no, please provide details of what documents are missing.</p>

<h4>Auditor notes</h4>

<p>Check for documentation omissions, for example: dated valuation, consultants appointment etc.</p>

<h4>Attachments</h4>

<p>Attachments are required only to support specific audit findings or to evidence any mitigating circumstances. There is no requirement to upload complete scheme file as a matter of course.</p>

<p>For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-funding-guide/6-programme-management">section 7.3.4 in the Capital Funding Guide - 6. Programme Management: Reporting and audit requirements</a>.</p>

<p>2: Does key cost data (acquisition and works costs only) entered in the system, along with any updates, match scheme file evidence at the time of each grant claim?</p>

<h4>Auditor notes</h4>

<p>Check final cost information in system against supporting filed evidence to confirm accuracy of data entry and eligibility of costs. Record detail, for example, dates and payments from screen data.</p>

<p>System should match the cost figures known at time of scheme handover or final claim; and the evidence on file should support the figures entered into the system. Once costs are finalised (which could be months later) differences can be recorded in the Scheme Comment on the system.</p>

<p>Data should be kept up to date and accurate at all stages of development, so far as is reasonably practicable.</p>

<p>For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-funding-guide/6-programme-management">section 3 in the Capital Funding Guide - 6. Programme Management: Scheme administration and data collection</a>.</p>

<p>3: Was planning permission subject to any conditions that would make development ineligible for grant funding?</p>

<p>If so, please provide details.</p>

<h4>Auditor notes</h4>

<p>For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-funding-guide/6-programme-management">section 7.2 in the Capital Funding Guide - 9. Procurement and Scheme Issues: Planning Permission and Building Regulations</a>.</p>

<p>4: Where required, were other specified consents obtained for the relevant works?</p>

<p>If no, please explain the reasons, or write “No other specified consents applied” as appropriate.</p>

<h4>Auditor notes</h4>

<p>Check if other consents apply and if they were obtained - for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>party wall award</li>
  <li>listed building consent</li>
  <li>permission to demolish</li>
  <li>Environment Agency remediation plan</li>
</ul>

<p>5: Where there is documented evidence of factors that may adversely affect mortgageability, have relevant expert reports been obtained and where applicable has necessary warranty been documented?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NHBC Buildmark certification/equivalent</li>
  <li>valuation</li>
  <li>structural report</li>
  <li>site investigation</li>
  <li>solicitor’s report</li>
</ul>

<p>If no, please explain the reasons, or write “There is no documented evidence of factors that may adversely affect mortgageability” as appropriate.</p>

<h4>Auditor notes</h4>

<p>Check filed documentation, noting which documents have been seen and their date. House builder warranties or Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) cover notes must be available on completion.</p>

<p>This question applies equally to both look-back and in-year schemes.</p>

<h4>Attachments</h4>

<p>Attachments are required only to support specific audit findings or to evidence any mitigating circumstances.</p>

<p>For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-funding-guide/8-procurement-and-scheme-issues">section 2.2. in the Capital Funding Guide - 9. Procurement and Scheme Issues: Procurement</a>.</p>

<p>6: Where there are variations to agreed submitted standards, have these been authorised by Homes England?</p>

<p>If no, please explain the reasons, or write “No variation requests” as appropriate.</p>

<h4>Auditor notes</h4>

<p>Check files against submitted and agreed standards in the Investment Management System (<abbr title="Investment Management System">IMS</abbr>) to ensure that any variations have been agreed by Homes England.</p>

<p>Please specify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>documentation seen</li>
  <li>authoriser</li>
  <li>date of authorisation</li>
  <li>details of agreement (including reasons for variation)</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-funding-guide/6-programme-management">section 3 in the Capital Funding Guide - 6. Programme Management: Scheme administration</a>.</p>

<h2>Development questions</h2>

<p>7: For owned and leased properties, has the provider obtained secure legal interest in the name of the grant recipient? As defined in the grant agreement and the <abbr title="Capital Funding Guide">CFG</abbr> - <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-funding-guide/9-finance">see 10. Finance: section 3.1</a>.</p>

<p>For Affordable Homes Programme, the provider must obtain secure legal interest prior to first grant claim.</p>

<p>If no, please provide details.</p>

<h4>Auditor notes</h4>

<p>For owned properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check exchange/completion dates of purchase contracts</li>
  <li>check for solicitor based evidence that completion has taken place at the agreed sum and confirmation is dated post completion. Are completion certificates or proof of ownership dated before first grant claim?</li>
</ul>

<p>For lease properties, check for solicitor’s written confirmation that any letter is legally binding and the term of the lease is in accordance with published guidance.</p>

<p>For lease and repair properties, ensure the lease covers a minimum five-year term. Was a lease signed on agreed terms before first grant claim? If not, confirm in comments section if there was a legally binding letter confirming agreement to lease.</p>

<p>For Empty Homes, ensure grant recovery rules fully applied and check that solicitor has confirmed a grant recovery mechanism within the lease.</p>

<p>Please note that, where the first grant claim is an acquisition tranche, the provider will need to have the freehold or long leasehold interest, not merely a conditional interest, prior to drawing down grant.</p>

<p>For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-funding-guide/9-finance">section 3.1 in the Capital Funding Guide - 10. Finance: Grants claims and payments</a>. This includes guidance as to the definition of secure legal interest and provisions covering where providers do not own the land.</p>

<p>8: Does the land or property have either of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Good title’ as defined in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-funding-guide/8-procurement-and-scheme-issues">section 5.3 in the Capital Funding Guide - 9. Procurement and Scheme Issues</a>
</li>
  <li>Defective title indemnity insurance in favour of the grant recipient, with a limit of indemnity equal to at least firm scheme grant for the site.</li>
</ul>

<p>Checks to include freehold, leasehold and any empty homes.</p>

<h4>Auditor notes</h4>

<p>Checks to include freehold, leasehold and any empty homes. Check solicitor’s report on title or lease if one has been prepared, and a copy of the Land Registry extract.</p>

<p>Please note that, where an acquisition grant claim is being made, the provider must have either the freehold or long leasehold interest prior to drawing down grant. A conditional interest and/or indemnity insurance would be insufficient.</p>

<p>For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-funding-guide/8-procurement-and-scheme-issues">section 5.3 in the Capital Funding Guide - 9. Procurement and Scheme Issues</a>.</p>

<p>9: Have all of the following been achieved prior to Start on Site claim:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the main building contract or works order has been signed and dated</li>
  <li>contractual possession of the site has passed to the contractor</li>
  <li>start on site works have commenced</li>
</ul>

<p>If any requirements have not been met, please provide details</p>

<h4>Auditor notes</h4>

<p>Check site possession date recorded in signed and dated building contract. If contract dates do not reconcile, record detail and reason.</p>

<p>Homes England requires assurance that the contractor has entered a legally binding contract covering whole of the works required for the development. Therefore, a letter of intent, even where it creates a legal obligation to carry out part of the works or works up to a particular value, is not acceptable.</p>

<p>Where the building contract is signed by a legal entity other than the grant recipient, for example a development company, this may be acceptable where the entity is a wholly controlled subsidiary. The IA should establish whether the grant recipient has sufficient oversight of the entity’s board and control over its business decisions.</p>

<p>Where the first grant claim is an acquisition tranche, (please consider whether this applies for profit) the grant recipient will need to have the freehold or long leasehold interest, not merely a conditional interest, prior to drawing down grant.</p>

<p>For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-funding-guide/9-finance">section 3 in the Capital Funding Guide - 10. Finance: Grants claims and payments</a>.</p>

<p>10: Is or was there adequate insurance in place during development to cover the scheme/site for the full cost of the works during development?</p>

<p>Please provide full details of the insurance arrangements and clarify the adequacy of the arrangements for grant recipient and/or build contractor.</p>

<h4>Auditor notes</h4>

<p>Arrangements such as a group insurance that covers a portfolio value rather than specific property may be sufficient, where they provide adequate insurance cover for the full replacement value.</p>

<p>Where the provider is a developer and isn’t retaining ownership, the Deed of Adherence means that this question can be answered by the landlord.</p>

<p>Please note, Homes England expects the insurance arrangements to cover all of the required circumstances set out in the <abbr title="Capital Funding Guide">CFG</abbr>.</p>

<p>For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-funding-guide/8-procurement-and-scheme-issues">section 3.4 in the Capital Funding Guide - 9. Procurement and Scheme Issues: Scheme types and requirements</a>.</p>

<p>11: Is there a valid valuation report for the site/property acquired, undertaken by a valuer with an appropriate Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) qualification?</p>

<p>If no, please provide details.</p>

<h4>Auditor notes</h4>

<p>Refer to the list of requirements on the Compliance Audit web page.</p>

<p>Please note that a red book valuation is required even for historic purchases, where these are “acquisition and works” schemes. A valuation is not required for “works only” schemes.</p>

<p>Validity periods may vary according to changes in RICS guidance and individual practices. IAs must ascertain whether the valuation was valid at exchange of contracts.</p>

<p>Written confirmation that an out of date valuation remains valid would be sufficient provided that it is an official letter from the valuer, for example on headed paper and/or bearing company stamp.</p>

<p>For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-funding-guide/6-programme-management">section 7.3.4 in the Capital Funding Guide - 6. Programme Management: Reporting and audit requirements</a>.</p>

<h2>Post-development questions</h2>

<p>12: Does submitted scheme data match with <abbr title="Investment Management System">IMS</abbr> approved scheme data and data held on scheme or site file at PC claim?</p>

<h4>Auditor notes</h4>

<p>Check <abbr title="Investment Management System">IMS</abbr> submission against building contract details, scheme approval and PC approval.</p>

<p>Data should be kept up to date and accurate at all stages of development, so far as is reasonably practicable.</p>

<p>For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-funding-guide/6-programme-management">section 3 in the Capital Funding Guide - 6. Programme Management</a>.</p>

<p>13: Was the Practical Completion certificate issued before the date of final (Practical Completion) grant claim?</p>

<p>If no, please explain the reasons.</p>

<h4>Auditor notes</h4>

<p>Check certificate date against final cost and Practical Completion final claim date and that it corresponds to the building contract.</p>

<p>Check that the <abbr title="Capital Funding Guide">CFG</abbr> definition of Partial Possession and Practical Completion met prior to final grant claim.</p>

<p>For more information, read:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-funding-guide/6-programme-management">section 4.2.7 in the Capital Funding Guide - 6. Programme Management: Milestones</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-funding-guide/9-finance">section 3.6 in the Capital Funding Guide - 10. Finance: Grant claims and payments</a></li>
</ul>

<p>14: Is adequate insurance in place to cover the completed scheme or site for its full replacement value?</p>

<p>If no, please explain the reasons.</p>

<h4>Auditor notes</h4>

<p>Arrangements such as a group insurance that covers a portfolio value rather than specific property may be sufficient, where they provide adequate insurance cover for the Full Replacement Value.</p>

<p>Where the provider is a developer and isn’t retaining ownership, the Deed of Adherence means that this question can be answered by the landlord.</p>

<p>Homes England expects the insurance arrangements to cover all of the required circumstances set out in <abbr title="Capital Funding Guide">CFG</abbr>.</p>

<p>For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-funding-guide/8-procurement-and-scheme-issues">section 3.4 in the Capital Funding Guide - 9. Procurement and Scheme Issues: Scheme types and requirements</a>.</p>

<p>15: For Affordable Rent, Social Rent, Rent to Buy and Specialist Rent properties - do expected rents or rents being charged meet the requirements set out in the <abbr title="Capital Funding Guide">CFG</abbr>?</p>

<p>If no, please explain the reasons, or write “not an Affordable Rent, Social Rent, Rent to Buy or Specialist Rent scheme” as appropriate.</p>

<h4>Auditor notes</h4>

<p>For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-funding-guide/4-housing-for-rent">the Capital Funding Guide - 4. Housing for Rent</a>.</p>

<p>16: For Affordable Rent, Social Rent, Rent to Buy and Specialist Rent properties - do rent figures and tenures entered in the system correspond to all the rents charged at point of final grant claim?</p>

<p>If not yet let, then do they match the expected rent and tenure?</p>

<p>If no, please explain the reasons, or write “not an Affordable Rent, Social Rent, Rent To Buy or Specialist Rent scheme” as appropriate.</p>

<h4>Auditor notes</h4>

<p>Please check and specify in the comments box the weekly and the annual rent per tenancy agreement and then compare with the rents recorded in <abbr title="Investment Management System">IMS</abbr>.</p>

<p>If a difference is identified, please state the reason and the percentage of discrepancy.</p>

<p>Please note that Providers are required to enter weekly rents into <abbr title="Investment Management System">IMS</abbr>, which are then converted into annual rents in slightly different ways depending on the programme and tenure, hence it is important to apply correct conversion method to justify the reason for variance (if any).</p>

<p>For each variant figure, if there are multiple rent levels on the scheme, provide rents on the system and actual rents.</p>

<p>For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-funding-guide/4-housing-for-rent">the Capital Funding Guide - 4. Housing for Rent</a>.</p>

<p>17: Were all necessary planning consents obtained by Practical Completion?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>was detailed planning permission granted prior to initial grant claim?</li>
  <li>were all reserved matters/conditions precedent signed off by the planners prior to the completion of the scheme?</li>
</ul>

<p>If no, please explain the reasons, or write “No planning consents were required or reserved matters/conditions precedent” as appropriate.</p>

<h4>Auditor notes</h4>

<p>Providers may use the ‘deemed discharge’ route to confirm that planning conditions are no longer outstanding.</p>

<p>Ensure all necessary consents have been obtained by practical completion stage of the site.</p>

<p>If not, seek evidence that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>steps have been taken to obtain them</li>
  <li>the delay is only due to late issue by the Local Planning Authority</li>
  <li>there is no known reason why consents won’t be given or issued</li>
</ul>

<p>In the event of planning consent not being granted before audit, note the detail of planning condition discharge outstanding (if applicable) and attach planning approval notice for reference.</p>

<p>For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-funding-guide/8-procurement-and-scheme-issues">section 7.2 in the Capital Funding Guide - 9. Procurement and Scheme Issues: Planning Permission and Building Regulations</a>.</p>

<p>18: Were all the final certifications required under building regulations obtained by the grant recipient prior to scheme practical completion grant claim?</p>

<p>If no, please explain the reasons.</p>

<h4>Auditor notes</h4>

<p>Check all certification dates are prior to scheme practical completion grant claim. If building regulations sign off has not been achieved at time of audit, note the regulation to be discharged and reason for non-discharge.</p>

<p>For more information, read:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-funding-guide/6-programme-management">section 4 in the Capital Funding Guide - 6. Programme Management: Milestones</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-funding-guide/9-finance">section 3.6 in the Capital Funding Guide - 10. Finance: Grant claims and payments</a></li>
</ul>

<p>19: Where the provider has entered into a management agreement with a managing agent, is it satisfied that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the agent is viable</li>
  <li>its aims are compatible with those of the provider</li>
  <li>appropriate capacity, experience and resources are available, in line with responsibilities</li>
</ul>

<p>If no, please explain the reasons, or write “No management agreement” as appropriate.</p>

<h4>Auditor notes</h4>

<p>Check filed evidence and <abbr title="Investment Management System">IMS</abbr> submission to substantiate.</p>

<p>For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-funding-guide/6-programme-management">section 6.3 in the Capital Funding Guide - 6. Programme Management: Management arrangements</a>.</p>

<p>20: Do the management agreement terms allow the provider to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>retain overall responsibility for scheme financial control</li>
  <li>monitor property condition and occupancy</li>
  <li>let rented homes on a written tenancy agreement between the provider and the occupant</li>

<h2>Care and Support Specialised Housing Fund questions</h2>

<h4>Auditor notes</h4>

<p>Ensure supporting filed evidence.</p>

<p>It is generally expected that all schemes funded under <abbr title="Care and Support Specialised Housing Fund">CASSH</abbr> will be individual dwellings with their own front door. Please note Shared Accommodation was not allowed in phase one of the <abbr title="Care and Support Specialised Housing Fund">CASSH</abbr> programme. However, under phase two schemes for people with mental health needs or learning difficulties who would more suitably be housed in a shared home with care will be considered by exception. It is not expected that these homes will be large multi-unit buildings.</p>

<h2>Additional questions</h2>

<p>34: Were all the requirements within the relevant grant agreement complied with?</p>

<h4>Auditor notes</h4>

<p>Check grant agreement between Homes England and Provider, which should be in place and completed prior to the drawdown of funds. While it is good practice to keep a copy on file, the record on the System of it having been signed is sufficient evidence that a contract is in place.</p>
