<p>This government is committed to driving up and levelling up education standards so that children and young people in every part of the country acquire the knowledge, skills and qualifications they need to progress.</p>

<p>Central to this is making sure that we have great teachers in every classroom. We are making England the best place in the world to become a great teacher through giving every teacher, particularly those in the most disadvantaged areas, access to world-class training and professional development opportunities throughout their career.</p>

<p>To support this, we published a new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-training-itt-core-content-framework"><abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> core content framework</a>, which sets out the fundamental knowledge, skills and teaching opportunities that all new entrants to the profession need.</p>

<h2>Changes to <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Since September 2020, new teachers have been entitled to at least 3 years of evidence-based professional development and support.</p>

<p>They start with <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>, based on the core content framework, which is followed by a 2-year induction underpinned by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework">early career framework</a>.</p>

<p>Work began on the initial phases of the review in early 2020, but these efforts were paused so that the government and <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> sector could focus on the challenges caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We announced in January 2021 that work on the review had resumed, with a focus on making further improvements across the sector.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> review aims</h2>

<p>The review considered how the <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> sector can provide consistently high-quality training, in line with the core content framework, in a more efficient and effective market.</p>

<p>The aim of the review was to make well informed, evidence-based recommendations on how to make sure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all trainees receive high-quality training</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> market maintains the capacity to deliver enough trainees and is accessible to candidates</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> system benefits all schools</li>
</ul>

<h2>Expert advisory group</h2>

<p>The review was led by Ian Bauckham, CEO of Tenax Schools trust, with the support of officials and a small expert group including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Professor Sam Twiselton, Director of Sheffield Institute of Education, Sheffield Hallam University</li>
  <li>Richard Gill, Chair of the Teaching Schools Council, CEO of The Arthur Terry Learning Partnership</li>
  <li>Reuben Moore, Executive Director of Programme Development, Teach First</li>
  <li>John Blake, Head of Public Affairs and Engagement, and former Head of Curriculum Design, Ark</li>
</ul>

<h2>Report and consultation</h2>

<p>The expert advisory group worked closely with the sector during the review to help shape the recommendations of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-training-itt-market-review-report"><abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> market review report</a> which was published in July 2021.</p>

<p>The department sought views on the recommendations of the report through a public consultation. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/initial-teacher-training-itt-market-review">Government’s response</a> to the expert advisory groups recommendations and the consultation feedback is now available.</p>

<h2>Accreditation</h2>

<p>All providers wishing to offer <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> that leads to qualified teacher status from 2024 must undergo an accreditation process.</p>

<p>Applicants will be able to apply for accreditation in one of at least 2 application rounds taking place in 2022 which will finish well in advance of the 2023 to 2024 recruitment cycle.</p>

<p>For more information on how to become an accredited provider of <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> and the support available, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/initial-teacher-training-itt-accreditation">Initial teacher training (<abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>): accreditation and support</a>.</p>
