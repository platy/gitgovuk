<h2>Enhancing the chargepoint user experience through design</h2>

<p>Car and van emissions are responsible for almost a fifth (19%) of the United Kingdom’s (UK) domestic greenhouse gas emissions.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>

<p>To meet our climate change objectives of net zero by 2050, we need to reduce emissions from road vehicles.</p>

<p>Government has set ambitious targets for all new cars and vans to be zero emission at the tailpipe by 2035.</p>

<p>To support industry and motorists in making the switch to cleaner vehicles, we have pledged a package of measures, including funding to rollout electric vehicle chargepoint infrastructure across the UK.</p>

<p>The availability and experience of this infrastructure is paramount to the widespread adoption of electric vehicles.</p>

<p>Our intention is to have one of the best infrastructure networks in the world, where everyone benefits from the transition to zero emission transport.</p>

<p>In partnership with the Royal College of Art and PA Consulting, the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (OZEV) unveiled a user-centric chargepoint design concept at COP26. The concept prioritises ease-of-use, inclusivity and accessibility.</p>

<p>These design considerations were identified and refined through engagement with the public, industry, local authorities and design experts, including Historic England and the Design Council.</p>

<p>They build on learnings from the chargepoint design concept project and are intended to help organisations installing chargepoints think through the role design can play in ensuring a positive experience for both consumers and those using the wider environment (such as pedestrians).</p>

<h2>Design considerations</h2>
<p>The following design considerations are suggestions for those installing chargepoints.</p>

<h3>Recognisability of the chargepoint and user interfaces</h3>

<h4>Visual status</h4>
<p>Signal to users if a chargepoint is available and operational, taking the surrounding environment into consideration. For example, avoiding light pollution for residents, businesses and wildlife.</p>

<h4>Online status</h4>
<p>Chargepoint operational status and availability should be accessible remotely.</p>

<h4>Information</h4>
<p>Clear and accessible information, for example, charging speed, readable at all times and during different weather conditions.</p>

<h4>User guidance</h4>
<p>Instructions on how to use the chargepoint, such as initiating and paying for charging.</p>

<h4>Feedback prompts</h4>
<p>Visual and audible cues indicating, for example, acceptance of payment, start, progress and completion of charging.</p>

<h3>Paying for charging</h3>

<h4>Payment options</h4>
<p>Ease of payment through the inclusion of non-proprietary, non-smartphone payment with additional options available as appropriate for the market.</p>

<h4>Price information</h4>
<p>Use a simple pricing unit consistent with the wider market (such as pence/kWh). Clearly identify the cost to the consumer when payment is bundled with parking or other services.</p>

<h4>Open access</h4>
<p>Consumers should have ad-hoc access without subscribing or registering to a charging network.</p>

<h3>Cable and socket management</h3>

<h4>Tethered versus untethered cables</h4>
<p>Tethered cables can help with ease-of-use but won’t be appropriate for all circumstances.</p>

<p>Consider the inclusion of a socket in addition to the tethered cable, enabling consumers to use their own cables.</p>

<p>For low profile chargepoints, such as those in lampposts, sockets alone will likely be more suitable.</p>

<h4>Storage for tethered cables</h4>
<p>Appropriate cable management will prevent trip hazards and cable protection will reduce vandalism, such as a retracting system.</p>

<h3>Accessible design</h3>

<h4>Cables and sockets</h4>
<p>For tethered chargepoints, ensure an ergonomic design of the plug handle and minimise resistance for the user to extend and manoeuvre the cable.</p>

<p>Cables need to be a suitable length to reach the varying locations of sockets on different vehicle models.</p>

<h4>Height and location</h4>
<p>Ensure the height and location of the chargepoint, cable, socket, and information are accessible for a range of users, including those in wheelchairs.</p>

<h4>Safety in use</h4>
<p>Consider risks for all users in accessing and using the chargepoint, providing sufficient space to accommodate a range of vehicles and user mobility needs.</p>

<h4>Night design</h4>
<p>Help users feel safe at night and aid their navigation by illuminating the chargepoint and surrounding area.</p>

<h3>Production, maintenance and end-of-life</h3>

<h4>Sourcing and processes</h4>
<p>Certify that suppliers use environmentally conscious and ethical approaches in material sourcing and manufacturing.</p>

<h4>Maintenance and repair</h4>
<p>Chargepoints should be designed to allow regular maintenance and repair. Minimising the need for non-standard training and tooling will likely increase uptime and reduce costs.</p>

<h4>Reliability</h4>
<p>Ensure chargepoint uptime is a minimum of 99% per annum to instil user confidence.</p>

<h4>Upgrades</h4>
<p>A modular design and the ability to upgrade will likely extend the usable life of the chargepoint.</p>

<h4>Reuse and recycling</h4>
<p>To maximise the environmental benefits, consider the chargepoint’s end-of-life and ability for reuse or recycling.</p>

<h3>Installation and setting</h3>

<h4>Disruption</h4>
<p>Where possible, reduce disruption to the surrounding environment during installation.</p>

<h4>Adaptable design</h4>
<p>Variations of the chargepoint’s aesthetic design will allow wider deployment, respecting the distinct or historic characteristics of the surrounding environment.</p>

<h4>Branding</h4>
<p>Individual operators will likely wish to configure the chargepoint’s design to represent their own brand.</p>
