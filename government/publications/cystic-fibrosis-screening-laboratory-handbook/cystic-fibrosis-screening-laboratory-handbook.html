<p>This handbook is for laboratories that provide an NHS newborn blood spot (<abbr title="NHS newborn blood spot">NHS NBS</abbr>) screening service for cystic fibrosis (<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr>) in the UK. It defines a framework for the pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical steps in the newborn screening process to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>support newborn screening laboratories to provide the screening service</li>
  <li>improve consistency across the screening programme</li>
  <li>provide guidance on achieving good quality by application of standards and audit</li>
</ul>

<h2>Screening for <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr>
</h2>

<p>All babies across the UK are offered a blood test to identify <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> as part of the <abbr title="NHS newborn blood spot">NHS NBS</abbr> screening programme. Screening for <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> aims to identify babies with a classical <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> diagnosis before they develop symptoms, to enable the early initiation of high-quality care.</p>

<h3>About <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr>
</h3>

<p><abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> is a heterogeneous disorder with a large number of different gene variants affecting the putative gene (the <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (<abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr>) gene) and has a range of different clinical phenotypes. For further information, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cysticfibrosis.org.uk/what-is-cystic-fibrosis" rel="external">Cystic Fibrosis Trust website</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31570318/" rel="external">research on the future of <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> care</a>.</p>

<p>Whilst babies with a clear <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> diagnosis represent the majority of true positives, identification of babies with an inconclusive diagnosis after a positive <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> result is an increasingly recognised outcome. This leads to uncertainty for both families and healthcare professionals.</p>

<p>The approach to the care of these babies is evolving with increased experience and reporting of outcomes. Babies with an unclear diagnosis after <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening are designated as ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> Screen Positive, Inconclusive Diagnosis’ (CFSPID). There is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33257262/" rel="external">international guidance on the care of these babies</a>. It is important that strategies are based, whenever possible, on evidence of benefit for the child and family. To default CFSPID babies to a full <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> care pathway is not appropriate, but it is equally important that the potential risks that these babies face are recognised and addressed.</p>

<h3>General organisation of <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening</h3>

<p><abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> screening is fully integrated within the existing <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening programme and based on the same screening laboratory populations. The initial screening test (the assay of immunoreactive trypsinogen (<abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr>)) uses blood collected on the standard <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening sample collection card (see section 9.1). Quality assurance (<abbr title="quality assurance">QA</abbr>) and performance management arrangements follow the same general principles as those for other newborn screening programmes.</p>

<p>With <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr>, as for other blood spot screening conditions, the screening laboratory is a major communication hub. The laboratory sends screening results to child health records departments (<abbr title="child health records departments">CHRDs</abbr>)/child health information services (<abbr title="child health information services">CHISs</abbr>), which send negative results to the parents/carers. Over 99% of results are ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> not suspected’ and are generated promptly. However, in some cases, screening may not be completed until the baby is over a month old.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> screening programme requires partnership working between the screening laboratory and molecular genetics laboratory.</p>

<p>Some parents/carers may decide that they do not want their baby to be screened for some or all of the conditions covered by <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr>. Screening can be declined for <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr>, sickle cell disease and congenital hypothyroidism individually, but the 6 inherited metabolic disorders (<abbr title="inherited metabolic disorders">IMDs</abbr>) can only be declined as a group. Details of these <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/newborn-blood-spot-screening-programme-overview">6 inherited metabolic disorders</a> are available.</p>

<p>The sample taker completes the blood spot card to indicate which conditions have been accepted or declined, as outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/newborn-blood-spot-screening-sampling-guidelines"><abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening sampling guidelines</a>.</p>

<h2>The screening protocol</h2>

<p>The UK screening protocol is intended to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maximise the early detection of <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> across all populations so that pre-symptomatic treatment can be initiated to reduce the long-term morbidity associated with the condition if untreated</li>
  <li>minimise the need for second heel pricks, and any other causes of diagnostic delay</li>
  <li>minimise detection of unaffected heterozygotes</li>
  <li>minimise recognition of babies with CFSPID</li>
  <li>allow for the fact that a clear diagnosis is not always possible</li>
</ul>

<h3>The standard protocol</h3>

<p><abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> analysis is performed on a single spot from an initial dried blood sample followed by a one or 2-stage genetic analysis of the <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> gene on all samples with confirmed <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> concentrations above a defined cut-off. Subsequent action depends on the results of the genetic analysis.</p>

<p>This protocol is summarised diagrammatically in Figure 1 below. No alternative to this protocol is recommended.
A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cystic-fibrosis-screening-laboratory-handbook">text description of Figure 1</a> is available.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151993/CF_screening_algorithm.svg"></div></figure>

<h4>Definition of the cut-off values</h4>

<p>As of January 2021, the national cut-off values for the AutoDELFIA analyser are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cut-off A = 52 µg/L</li>
  <li>cut-off B = 62 µg/L</li>
</ul>

<p>As of April 2022, the national cut-off values for the Genetic Screening Processor (<abbr title="Genetic Screening Processor">GSP</abbr>) analyser are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cut-off A = 46 µg/L</li>
  <li>cut-off B = 56 µg/L</li>
</ul>

<p>These cut-off values are subject to regular review based upon continued data collection from the laboratories.</p>

<p>The value used for cut-off A is based on selecting an average of 1.5% of all results for repeat <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> analysis. It is set to 10µg/L below cut-off B.</p>

<p>Cut-off B, used to select samples for further genetic analysis, has been defined based upon experience in East Anglia using a 2-stage <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr>-<abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> screen over a 17 year period that showed a 99.5th centile cut-off for the initial sample gave an overall sensitivity of 97% (Heeley and others, 1999)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>For further information about the rationale of the cut-off values, see section 5.1 below.</p>

<h4>The first screening specimen</h4>

<p>Samples are initially assayed in singleton.</p>

<p>Consider babies in whom the <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> concentration is &lt; cut-off A in the initial screening sample to have a negative screening result for <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr>. Report them as ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> not suspected’.</p>

<p>Re-assay samples with results ≥ cut-off A in duplicate from the same card but on a different spot(s) to give a more definitive result. This is to minimise effects of volumetric variability of the punched discs, day-to-day variation in <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> assay calibration, and to detect possible sample misidentification.</p>

<p>Take the average of the 3 results.</p>

<p>Review the set of triplicate results for consistency as poor analytical performance can produce different results. Spuriously high results can occur with faecal contamination or blood spot layering and spuriously low results can occur if there is a missing spot or poor sample.</p>

<p>Further action therefore requires an assessment of agreement between results. The following sections provide guidance only and laboratories should use discretion for each individual set of results.</p>

<h4>Review of triplicate mean results</h4>

<p>For babies in whom the triplicate mean <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> concentration in the initial screening sample is &lt; cut-off B, and provided there is no suspicion of a ‘missing spot’, issue a ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> not suspected’ result.</p>

<p>If the average of the 3 results is ≥ cut-off B *, assess the results for consistency before proceeding further.</p>

<p>The pathway for handling <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> results from the first screening specimen is summarised diagrammatically in Figure 2 below. No alternative pathway is recommended. A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cystic-fibrosis-screening-laboratory-handbook">text description of Figure 2</a> is available.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/126742/Figure_2._Handling_of_IRT_results_from_the_first_screening_specimen_v0.03.svg"></div>
<figcaption><p>Figure 2: handling of IRT results from the first screening specimen</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>Regard a set of 3 results as discrepant if they meet any one of the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a coefficient of variation (standard deviation/mean) ≥ 0.25</li>
  <li>one or more individual results being ≥ 30% above or below the average of all 3</li>
  <li>the ratio of the highest result to the average of the other 2 results ≥ 1.5</li>
</ul>

<p>For sets of 3 results considered to be discrepant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if there is a single high result (≥ cut-off B *) with the other 2 results &lt; cut-off B *, and provided that there is no uncertainty about sample identification, ignore the single high result and issue a ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> not suspected’ report</li>
  <li>if 2 results are ≥ cut-off B * and the average of all 3 results ≥ cut-off B* but &lt; 120 µg/L, proceed to genetic analysis as per the screening protocol</li>
  <li>if the average of all 3 results is ≥ 120 µg/L, request a repeat sample on the grounds that this is likely to be sample contamination (only if a repeat sample can be taken before the baby is 21 days old, otherwise an immediate referral is indicated)</li>
</ul>

<p>*If the sample was taken on day 21 or later then apply cut-off A.</p>

<p>Assaying further samples from a card with discrepant results is unlikely to completely resolve the issue.</p>

<h4>Insufficient sample: no re-assay possible</h4>

<p>If it is not possible to punch any further discs from the card (for example, for a single result ≥ cut-off A), request that a repeat specimen is taken as soon as possible due to insufficient sample.</p>

<h4>Only one re-assay possible</h4>

<p>If only 2 <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> results can be obtained (so after the initial analysis, only one further spot from the card is possible) then proceed as follows. If the average of both results is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>&lt; cut-off B *, report as ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> not suspected’</li>
  <li>‘≥ cut-off B *, proceed to genetic analysis; widely discrepant results may require a repeat specimen taken as soon as possible– laboratory staff should use judgement on this.</li>
</ul>

<p>*If the sample was taken on day 21 or later then apply cut-off A.</p>

<h3>The second specimen (repeat <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> test)</h3>

<p>Requests for second blood samples for <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> testing are via locally agreed pathways defined as part of the newborn screening responsibilities. Laboratories should request that the repeat blood spot sample is collected on day 21 (by day 24; this allows for day 21 to fall on a weekend when a special visit is not warranted).</p>

<p>The second dried blood spot specimen is for <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> testing only. It is recommended practice <strong>not</strong> to repeat other screening tests on this specimen.</p>

<p>The sample taker should explain to parents/carers that further tests need to be done for cystic fibrosis. An <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/repeat-blood-spot-test-for-cystic-fibrosis-information-sheet">information sheet for parents about the repeat blood spot test for <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr></a> is available on GOV.UK. The results of genetic analysis are not given out at this stage as this may result in premature disclosure to the parents/carers before the definitive screening result is known. Confirm the repeat request in writing to the appropriate health professional(s).</p>

<p>If there is a delay and a second sample has not been taken by 8 weeks of age, it is too late for <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> testing to be carried out reliably (see section 2.3 below).</p>

<h4>Actions to be taken on the repeat <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> test</h4>

<p>The following actions are undertaken on the repeat sample depending on the reason for its request.</p>

<p><strong>If one <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variant is detected</strong> – assay the repeat sample for <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> in duplicate. Report babies with an average of results ≥ cut-off A as ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> suspected’ and refer to a <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> specialist. Report babies with an average of results &lt; cut-off A as ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> carrier’. No referral is required. A health professional contacts the parents/carers to discuss the screening results.</p>

<p><strong>If no <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variants are detected and the initial <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> ≥ 120 µg/L</strong> – assay  the repeat sample for <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> in duplicate. Report babies with an average result ≥ cut-off A as ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> suspected’ and refer to a <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> specialist. Otherwise, issue a ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> not suspected’ result.</p>

<p>For information about the reporting and communication of results, see section 7.3 below.</p>

<h3>Late sampling</h3>

<p>Blood spot <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> concentration is increased in most babies with <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> in the first few weeks of life. However, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/85057/" rel="external">early research on blood spot screening</a> and on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2187173/" rel="external">age-related decline in <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr></a> indicates <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> becomes unreliable as an indicator of <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> at around 8 weeks. This decline in <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> has implications for the reliability of <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> screening if samples are taken outside the specified time windows. It is therefore important that appropriate cut-off values are applied to the times at which samples are taken.</p>

<p>This means that <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> screening cannot be undertaken or completed for babies who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have arrived in the UK after 56 days (8 weeks) of age</li>
  <li>have not, for whatever reason, had their first screening sample collected by 56 days (8 weeks) of age</li>
  <li>require a second (day 21) blood spot sample for <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> assay but do not have it taken at the correct time – for example, because the sample collection was delayed or the sample was lost in transit</li>
</ul>

<p>The following guidance applies in these situations.</p>

<h4>Late first samples</h4>

<p>For samples taken before day 21, apply cut-off values as for samples that have not been delayed.</p>

<p>For samples taken when the baby is aged between 21 days (3 weeks) and 56 days (8 weeks) inclusive, apply cut-off A as the decision point for genetic analysis.</p>

<p>Do not test any samples taken after 56 days (8 weeks) for <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr>. Procedures should be in place for laboratories to identify these samples.</p>

<p>If a first (routine screening) sample is taken after day 56 (8 weeks) and is unavoidably tested, then the laboratory staff should proceed as follows. If the <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>&lt; cut-off A, report as ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> – not screened (baby too old &gt;8 weeks age)’</li>
  <li>≥ cut-off A (average result), report as ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> suspected’ and refer the baby to a <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> clinician; send a blood spot sample at the same time for genetic analysis, and give advice to the family health visitor and/or midwife about the reason for referral so that this can be explained to the parents/carers</li>
</ul>

<p>The pathway for handling late first <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> samples is summarised diagrammatically in Figure 3 below. No alternative pathway is recommended. A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cystic-fibrosis-screening-laboratory-handbook">text description of Figure 3</a> is available.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/126743/Figure_3._Handling_of_late_first_IRT_samples_v0.07.svg"></div>
<figcaption><p>Figure 3: handling of late first IRT samples</p></figcaption></figure>

<h4>Late or absent second samples</h4>

<p>For second samples taken on or before day 56 (8 weeks) of age, apply cut-off A per the <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> screening protocol.</p>

<p>Babies aged over 56 days (8 weeks) are too old for <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> screening to be carried out reliably. Do not collect the second sample.</p>

<p>If a second sample is not received because the baby aged over 56 days (8 weeks), report as ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> suspected’ and refer the baby to the <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> clinical team for follow-up.</p>

<p>If a second sample is taken after day 56 (8 weeks) of age, do <strong>not</strong> analyse it for <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr>. Report as ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> suspected’ and refer the baby to the <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> clinical team for follow-up.</p>

<p>If a second sample is taken after day 56 (8 weeks) of age and has been unavoidably analysed, report as ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> suspected’ and refer the baby to the <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> clinical team for follow-up regardless of the <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> concentration.</p>

<p>In these situations, laboratory staff should provide information to the <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> clinical team about the reason for referral so an explanation can be given to the parents/carers.</p>

<p>Report babies that have transferred out of the UK and are still awaiting the collection of a repeat first or second <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> sample as ‘screening incomplete’. A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cystic-fibrosis-screening-not-complete-template-letter">‘cystic fibrosis screening not complete’ template letter</a> is available on www.GOV.UK</p>

<h3>Action following genetic analysis</h3>

<h4>Babies with 2 <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variants detected</h4>

<p>Babies with <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variants detected in both copies of the gene (either a homozygote or compound heterozygote) have a presumptive positive diagnosis of <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr>. Report them as ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> suspected’ and refer to a <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> paediatric service for immediate evaluation (clinical assessment and sweat test).</p>

<h4>Babies with one <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variant detected</h4>

<p>Most babies with only one <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variant detected will be unaffected carriers but there is a risk that they carry a second <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variant not detected by the panel of <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variants tested. They are therefore tested again (second <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr>) on a repeat dried blood spot sample. Laboratories should request that this second <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> sample is collected on day 21 (by day 24; this allows for day 21 to fall on a weekend when a special visit is not warranted). For further information, see section 2.2 above.</p>

<h4>Babies with no detected <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variants</h4>

<p>Babies with no detected <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variants (by the initial panel of 4 <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variants) are divided into 2 groups depending on the initial <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> result:</p>

<ul>
  <li>those with first <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> &lt; 120 µg/L – report as ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> not suspected’</li>
  <li>those with first <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> ≥ 120 µg/L – a second <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> test is undertaken on a repeat dried blood spot specimen; laboratories should request that this second <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> sample is collected on day 21 (by day 24, this allows for day 21 to fall on a weekend when a special visit is not warranted) – for further information see section 2.2 above</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information on genetic analysis, see section 6 below.</p>

<h3>Sibling testing</h3>

<p>Older siblings (of a baby with confirmed <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> diagnosed from newborn screening) may be at risk of <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr>. Any testing is at the discretion of the clinician, with the family’s consent.</p>

<p>For any subsequent siblings of the index newborn, the clinical team offers expedited genetic analysis of cord blood sample together with the mother’s blood sample.</p>

<p>Newborn screening should be undertaken as normal. ’Early’ screening for siblings (prior to day 5, counting day of birth as day 0) is not recommended. The blood spot sample should be collected on day 5 for all babies regardless of medical condition, milk feeding and prematurity. This is to enable detection of abnormal results and initiation of appropriate treatment.</p>

<h3>Family history and other risk factors</h3>

<p>Babies are regarded as high risk if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>present with meconium ileus</li>
  <li>have shown echogenic bowel in-utero</li>
  <li>are known to be at risk due to family history</li>
</ul>

<p>They should be investigated independently according to clinical circumstances as well as being screened in the normal way.</p>

<p>If a genetics centre has carried out genetic testing before routine screening, it is helpful if they advise the screening laboratory of the results. This may avoid unnecessary duplication of follow-up or diagnostic testing. It will also help avoid any confusion arising from a ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> not suspected’ screening result (from <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> analysis) which might cause concern for the family.</p>

<h3>Unscreened babies</h3>

<p>These include babies who were never part of the <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> screening process, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>babies born abroad</li>
  <li>babies not tested because screening was offered too late (&gt; 8 weeks)</li>
  <li>babies for whom screening was declined (by the parents/carers)</li>
</ul>

<p>For any subsequent requests for <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> screening from the parents/carers, the family health visitor should explain to the family why their baby has not been screened for <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr>.</p>

<p>Screening laboratories should inform the baby’s GP if screening for <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> is incomplete. A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cystic-fibrosis-screening-not-complete-template-letter">‘cystic fibrosis screening not complete’ template letter</a> is available.</p>

<p>The family health visitor should inform the GP of any subsequent requests for screening from the parents/carers.</p>

<p>Such babies should not routinely be offered any testing and should only be referred on a clinical basis if required. If the family or GP has any concerns, a referral for assessment (which may include sweat testing) by the local designated <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> team is appropriate.</p>

<h3>Previously screened babies where subsequent results differ</h3>

<p>A raised <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> ≥ cut-off A on a sample taken after day 21 where there is a previous <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> not suspected result should be dealt with as described in the following situations.</p>

<h4>Discrepant <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> result</h4>

<p>Suspect contamination and request a further repeat if there is sufficient time to obtain a specimen up to and including day 56. See section 2.1 above.</p>

<h4>Non-discrepant <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> result ≥ cut-off A with previous <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> &lt; cut-off B and ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> not suspected’ reported</h4>

<p>Send for genetic analysis. Subsequent action depends on the results of the genetic analysis. If:</p>

<ul>
  <li>one or more <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variant is detected, refer and report as ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> suspected’</li>
  <li>no <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variants are detected (sample taken at ≤ 56 days), request a repeat sample</li>
  <li>no <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variants are detected (sample taken at &gt; 56 days), refer and report as ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> suspected’</li>
</ul>

<h4>Non-discrepant <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> result ≥ cut-off A with previous <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> ≥ cut-off B, no <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variants detected, and ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> not suspected’ reported</h4>

<p>This shows a persistently raised <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr>. Refer and report as ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> suspected’.</p>

<h2>Laboratory quality and performance</h2>

<h3>Screening laboratory</h3>

<p>Laboratories undertaking <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening must use processes accredited in accordance with ISO 15189 for Medical Testing Laboratories by a competent accreditation testing service, for example <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukas.com/accreditation/standards/medical-laboratory-accreditation/" rel="external">UKAS</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening is provided within the organisational structure of the <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening programme and undertaken by specialist newborn screening laboratories already providing screening programmes.</p>

<p>There should be written agreed procedures describing the working arrangements between the screening laboratory and their referral laboratory.</p>

<p>There should be documented local policies and standard operating procedures describing the whole screening process including pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical processes. Where appropriate these will include reporting results, and referral and follow-up arrangements for presumptive positive cases and carriers, as specified in laboratory handbooks. Provide processes in line with relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/standards-for-nhs-newborn-blood-spot-screening"><abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> national standards</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/newborn-blood-spot-screening-programme-supporting-publications#cystic-fibrosis-(cf)"><abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> guidance</a>. Processes should be reviewed periodically taking into account audit data, accumulating results, technical developments and local changes in healthcare provision.</p>

<h3>Molecular genetics laboratory</h3>

<p>In general, each screening laboratory should send samples to a single molecular genetics laboratory. Molecular genetics laboratories may receive samples from more than one screening laboratory.</p>

<p>Screening laboratories may contract for this service any molecular genetics laboratory that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is capable of meeting the performance standards (specified below)</li>
  <li>uses ISO 15189 accredited processes</li>
  <li>is part of one of the 7 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/genomics/genomic-laboratory-hubs/" rel="external">Genomic Laboratory Hubs</a> (a nationally commissioned genomics laboratory in England)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overall performance and timeliness</h3>

<p>Laboratory services should be configured to enable <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> newborn screening to be completed in time for all babies with positive screening results to have their first clinic appointment by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>day 28 for babies in whom 2 <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variants have been detected</li>
  <li>day 35 for babies who have needed a second sample <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> measurement</li>
</ul>

<p>Analysis for <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> should be performed frequently enough to generate a screening test result (including any retest results, where required, to be confirmed in duplicate), no later than 4 working days from receipt of an adequate sample. Definitive results from genetic analysis must be available on or before the 4th working day from receipt of the sample within the genetic laboratory.</p>

<p>Report <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> suspected results to the appropriate clinical team within 1 working day of becoming available. Do not issue intermediate reports (those showing increased <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> in the initial sample without follow-up results).</p>

<p>Ideally, parents/carers should not be informed of a positive screening result on a Friday or Saturday, to make sure that the clinical assessment and sweat test can be arranged for the day after the results.</p>

<h3>Internal quality and performance monitoring</h3>

<p>Laboratories should participate in audit at local, regional and national levels, to assess the effectiveness of the national screening programme. They should publish the results and performance of their newborn blood spot screening programme within an annual report.</p>

<p>There must be a documented risk management policy for the laboratory aspects of the <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> screening programme as part of an overall pathway risk assessment. This should describe the steps in the testing protocol where failures could occur and the procedures that have been implemented to minimise the risk of their occurrence.</p>

<h3>External quality assessment</h3>

<p>Laboratories should participate in an approved external quality assurance (<abbr title="external quality assurance">EQA</abbr>) scheme (for example <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ukneqas.org.uk/" rel="external">The United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Service (<abbr title="UK National External Quality Assurance Service">UK NEQAS</abbr>)</a>). The <abbr title="external quality assurance">EQA</abbr> scheme assesses laboratories on the precision and accuracy of analytical steps.</p>

<p>Following agreement from the <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening programme, the laboratory must release reports on screening performance (including external quality assurance and accreditation assessments) to agencies with a legitimate interest in the quality and safety of the programme on behalf of the public.</p>

<h2>Pre-analytical factors</h2>

<h3>Specimen requirements</h3>

<p>Blood spot sampling should be undertaken according to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/newborn-blood-spot-screening-sampling-guidelines">Guidelines for newborn blood spot sampling</a>. Specimens should be dispatched to the laboratory within 24 hours of taking the sample. They must be kept in a dry environment at room temperature or refrigerated at 4°C before analysis. Storage after analysis should follow the guidelines provided by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/newborn-blood-spot-screening-code-of-practice-for-the-retention-and-storage-of-residual-spots">code of practice for the retention and storage of residual newborn blood spots</a>.</p>

<p>Venepuncture or venous/arterial sampling from an existing line is an alternative method to collect the blood spot sample. This is providing the sample is not contaminated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (<abbr title="ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid">EDTA</abbr>)/heparin and the line is cleared of infusate. Anticoagulants may affect the assay. Capillary tubes (plain or heparinised) must not be used to collect blood samples.</p>

<h4>Blood spot stability</h4>

<p><abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> was shown to be relatively unstable in early studies (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2863277/" rel="external">Heeley and others, 1982</a>; <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15971591_Use_of_a_dried_blood_spot_in_immunoreactive-trypsin_assay_for_detection_of_cystic_fibrosis_in_infants" rel="external">Kirby and others, 1981</a>) and there are few published studies using modern methods of <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> analysis. In 2006, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (<abbr title="Centres for Disease Control and Prevention">CDC</abbr>) showed that <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr>-enriched blood added to a filter paper matrix was stable when stored with desiccant for 1 year at either -20°C or 4°C, and 30 days at ambient temperature. Only 75% of <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> remained in dried blood spots stored at ambient temperature for up to one year (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/16792830" rel="external">Li and others, 2006</a>). However, dried blood spots in this study were prepared by lysing blood before the addition of <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> and recovery studies demonstrated that <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> degrades more quickly in whole blood. A further <abbr title="Centres for Disease Control and Prevention">CDC</abbr> study using whole blood with intact cells (thus more closely mimicking newborn DBS samples) showed that samples stored at 37°C in low-humidity environments retained 83% of <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> for 30 days, whereas in a high humidity environment only 47% was retained (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21963384/" rel="external">Adam and others, 2011</a>).</p>

<p>Samples received in the laboratory more than 14 days after the sample was taken are therefore deemed unsuitable for testing. Request a repeat sample as soon as possible in line with the blood sampling guidelines. Test the original sample following the standard algorithm and refer the baby if a screen positive result is obtained.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>For CF, it is important to be aware that samples taken when the baby is aged over 56 days (8 weeks) should <strong>not</strong> be analysed (see section 2.3 above).</p>
</div>

<h3>Non-analytical factors affecting the screening result</h3>

<h4>Potential for false negative results</h4>
<p>Several factors (in addition to late testing – see section 2.3 above) are known to lower blood <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> concentration in babies with <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr>, leading to false negative screening results.</p>

<h4>Meconium ileus:</h4>
<p>Some babies with <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> and meconium ileus are likely to give negative screening results when tested during the first week of life, though <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> concentrations may become clearly abnormal a week or 2 later. It is unclear whether surgery itself is responsible or whether it is the concomitant lack of enteral feeding. In any case, <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> should be strongly suspected in any baby with meconium ileus irrespective of the screening result. Neonatal units should have appropriate investigation protocols in place (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cysticfibrosisjournal.com/article/S1569-1993(17)30809-3/fulltext" rel="external">Sathe and Houwen, 2017</a>).</p>

<h4>Blood transfusion:</h4>
<p>The effects of blood transfusion on <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> are unclear but could result in a false negative <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> result. A repeat sample should therefore be taken after a minimum of 72 hours has elapsed. As white cells are removed prior to blood transfusion, misleading results with genetic analysis are unlikely (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2e93/aa9dfbd2fd8eff897c8b4b1f9fba53f3b22f.pdf?_ga=2.67557911.701645235.1603901661-1936300393.1603901661" rel="external">Brauner and others, 1997</a>).</p>

<h4>Viral infection:</h4>
<p>Viral infection leading to acute gastroenteritis or respiratory illness may also be associated with a false negative screening result (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/128/2/e446" rel="external">Dunn and others, 2011</a>).</p>

<h4>Prematurity:</h4>
<p>The performance of the <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> assay for premature babies is less clear and there is potential for both false positive and false negative results (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4228057/" rel="external">Cortes and others, 2014</a>; <a class="govuk-link" href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/3709565" rel="external">Bourguignon and others, 1986</a>; <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15971591_Use_of_a_dried_blood_spot_in_immunoreactive-trypsin_assay_for_detection_of_cystic_fibrosis_in_infants" rel="external">Kirby and others, 1981</a>; <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23949094/" rel="external">Heidendael and others, 2014</a>).</p>

<p>It is not practicable to adopt alternative diagnostic approaches routinely in these last 2 groups of babies. Always bear in mind in mind that not all cases of <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> will be detected on newborn screening and any child showing appropriate symptoms should be investigated accordingly.</p>

<h4>Potential for false positive results</h4>

<p>Elevated <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> levels have been reported in association with congenital infections, renal failure, bowel atresias and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. False positives also occur in children who are very sick on paediatric intensive care unit (<abbr title="paediatric intensive care unit">PICU</abbr>) who do not specifically have any bowel or renal problems. High <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> levels can occur in babies with a variety of chromosomal abnormalities particularly trisomies 13 and 18 (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19246252/" rel="external">Castellani and others, 2009</a>).</p>

<p>Other causes of raised <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> include ΔF508 carriers, hypoxic insult to pancreas, congenital heart disease, spina bifida, gastroschisis, viral infections and galactosaemia.</p>

<p>The standard screening protocol should be followed in all of these situations. If <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variants are not found, laboratory staff should explain to the clinician looking after the baby that the raised <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> may be a secondary phenomenon and consider whether or not further investigation is required (for example, repeat <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> or sweat test).</p>

<h2>The <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> assay</h2>

<p>Assay <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> in the blood spot using a methodology that has been demonstrated to be fit-for-purpose and approved by the <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening programme. Where possible, the reagents and instrumentation should be CE marked. The laboratory should follow the procedures detailed in the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<p>Include internal quality control samples at 3 <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> levels with each analysis batch. Each laboratory should assign acceptable ranges for these samples.</p>

<h3>Rationale for <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> cut-off values</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>The sensitivity and specificity of screening are crucially dependent on the performance of the IRT assay. In particular, if cut-off B is set too low, too many samples will be sent for genetic analysis and there will be a disproportionate increase in the number of carriers detected; if it is too high then CF cases may be missed.</p>
</div>

<p>Unfortunately, this is a particularly difficult assay to control as human blood contains a variety of trypsinogen species which react differently with the various antibodies used for immunoassay. Additionally, the <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> species increased in neonates with <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> has different properties from that present normally in neonatal blood (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0925616494900337" rel="external">Dhondt and Farriaux, 1994</a>).</p>

<p>For these reasons, it is not possible to deliver the quality assurance required for newborn screening solely by means of an <abbr title="external quality assurance">EQA</abbr> scheme with circulated blood spots, particularly as there are marked matrix effects.</p>

<p>The 99.5th centile for <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> is used to select samples for subsequent genetic analysis and consequently to help determine which patients will be referred for clinical investigation as a ‘condition suspected’ case. Comparing data from several UK laboratories reveals significant variation in the population distribution of <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> values with different kit lots (lot variation should not exceed +/-8%) as well as systematic inter-laboratory variations due to differences in instrumentation (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10545-007-0573-3" rel="external">Pollitt and Matthews, 2007</a>) and possibly ethnicity.  In order to determine the 99.5th centile in a reliable way, it is estimated that &gt;12,000 samples must be analysed, but even in laboratories with large workloads this is not possible in a reasonable time frame.</p>

<h3>National cut-off for <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Due to concerns about obtaining sufficient data and varying the cut-off frequently, a new approach came into effect from 1 April 2020 to define a ‘national’ cut-off based on retrospective data analysis from several laboratories over a longer period of time. It was agreed that this would be subject to regular review based upon continued data collection from laboratories on a quarterly basis (for the current values, see section 2.1 above). Note that these cut-offs may not apply in the same way in the Republic of Ireland laboratory (Dublin) who screen at day 3 of life and in the Scottish laboratory (Glasgow) who screen at day 4.</p>

<h2>Genetic analysis</h2>

<p>Genetic analysis must be performed using an ISO 15189 accredited process.</p>

<h3>Sample requirements, identity and transport</h3>

<p>There is no requirement for a measured amount of blood, so the residual blood from a spot that has already had a disc punched out is likely to be sufficient.</p>

<p>There must be a tracking system to ensure that dried blood spot samples sent for genetic analysis are identified unequivocally. The card should not normally leave the screening laboratory.</p>

<p>Samples must be securely identified. The simplest method is to cut an irregularly shaped strip from the blood spot card (with the blood at one end), and on the blank section of the strip write patient identifiers including at least 2 from the baby’s date of birth, surname and NHS number. The irregularly shaped strip can then be matched with the card if subsequently required. With increasing automation and an electronic IT system, a bar-code sample identifier is desirable.</p>

<p>Appropriate timely transport arrangements to the genomics laboratory must be organised and the laboratory made aware of the imminent arrival of a screening specimen(s). Sample receipt by the genomic laboratory should be acknowledged back to the screening laboratory.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2-stage </span> analysis</h3>

<p>Genetic analysis is carried out in 2 stages to minimise the detection of homozygotes for the ‘milder’ alleles (<abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variants associated with adult onset <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr>-related disorders rather than classic <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr>) and the number of carriers detected.</p>

<p>The first stage establishes whether the baby has any of the 4 most common <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variants in the English population associated with severe disease. Nomenclature complies with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://varnomen.hgvs.org/" rel="external">Human Genome Variation Society Guidelines</a> to ensure consistent and precise nomenclature. These 4 variants are as detailed below.</p>

<p><abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> reference sequences: cDNA – LRG_663t1 (NM_000492.3); protein – LRG_663p1 (NP_000483.3)</p>

<p><strong>Note 1</strong>: Depending on the technology used, the c.1519_1521delATC, p.(Ile507del), (ΔI507) variant may also be detected.</p>

<p><strong>Note 2</strong>: Depending on the technology used, the c.1657C&gt;T, p.(Arg553Ter), (R553X) variant may also be detected.</p>

<p>The first 3 variants are also described according to the protein change so p.Gly551Asp indicates that the glycine at amino acid residue 551 is predicted to change to aspartic acid. c.489+1G&gt;T is an intronic variant in the canonical splice site and thus has no directly associated amino acid change. The numbering indicates the 1st nucleotide (+1) after nucleotide 489 (which is at the last nucleotide of the exon).</p>

<p>This first stage detects over 80% of disease-causing variants in the UK population.</p>

<p>There are several technologies, including a range of commercial kits, available for detection of these 4 <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variants. It is essential that in the first stage of genetic analysis, no variants other than the ones specified above are co-incidentally detected.</p>

<p>The second stage covers a wider range of <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variants and is applied, using the original sample, in all cases where a single variant is detected in the heterozygous state at the first stage.</p>

<p>The panels used are specified by the <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> Screening Advisory Board and reviewed periodically in the light of technical developments and on-going evaluation of the programme.</p>

<h3>Reporting results</h3>

<p>Samples with no detected <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variants may be reported to the screening laboratory by list with appropriate specimen identifiers.</p>

<p>For any sample showing one or more <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variants, the genomic laboratory must supply the screening laboratory with a formal report, largely limited to a factual description of the findings (variants tested for and results). Standard advice on family studies, such as referring the baby to a <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> centre for follow-up, is inappropriate in the screening context as these options are incorporated in the protocol. Send copies (not transcriptions) of the genetic analysis report with the screening laboratory’s report or referral letter to the baby’s consultant or GP as appropriate.</p>

<h3>Next steps</h3>

<p>Following the genetic analysis, the screening laboratory should proceed according to the screening protocol (see section 2.4 above).</p>

<h2>Reporting and communication of results</h2>

<h3>Reporting to <abbr title="child health records departments">CHRDs</abbr>/<abbr title="child health information services">CHISs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Screening laboratories and <abbr title="child health records departments">CHRDs</abbr>/<abbr title="child health information services">CHISs</abbr> should use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/status-codes-for-the-newborn-blood-spot-nbs-screening-programme">national status codes and subcodes</a> to record the outcomes of <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening. Ideally, the laboratory sends screening results to <abbr title="child health records departments">CHRDs</abbr>/<abbr title="child health information services">CHISs</abbr> and the newborn blood spot failsafe solution (<abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>) using electronic messaging. Status codes should also be used for reporting to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Reports of all screening results should have a generic disclaimer attached, stating: <br>
These tests are screening tests; no screening test is 100% reliable. <br>
Such a disclaimer is particularly relevant to CF because of the potential for falsely high or low IRTs from other non-CF causes (see section 4.2 above).</p>
</div>

<h3>Newborn blood spot failsafe solution (<abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>)</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> is an IT system that identifies babies born in England who have missed <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening. It is in use by all maternity units across England. The system also records repeat requests and screening outcomes to support failsafe processes.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/newborn-blood-spot-screening-failsafe-solution-user-guide/nbsfs-operational-level-agreements-for-laboratory-users"><abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> user guide</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/newborn-blood-spot-screening-failsafe-solution-user-guide/nbsfs-operational-level-agreements-for-laboratory-users"><abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> operational level agreements</a> provide more information about how to use the failsafe system.</p>

<h3>Communicating results</h3>

<h4>
<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> not suspected</h4>

<p>‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> not suspected’ results should be communicated to the parents/carers by <abbr title="child health records departments">CHRDs</abbr>/<abbr title="child health information services">CHISs</abbr> by 6 weeks of age. If a ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> not suspected’ result is generated following collection and analysis of a repeat sample for a very high first <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> (&gt; 99.9th centile) then the family should be informed promptly (ideally within 24 hours of the laboratory obtaining the second <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> result) as they are likely to have raised anxiety levels due to a repeat sample being needed.</p>

<h4>Probable <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> carrier, low likelihood of <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Again, the family will likely have raised anxiety levels because a repeat blood spot sample was needed. The sample taker should have explained the reason for the repeat and when to expect the result. The family should be informed by a healthcare professional of the ‘probable <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> carrier’ result promptly, ideally within 24 hours of the laboratory obtaining the second <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> result. Where possible, the screening laboratory should have a screening nurse specialist  contact the family health visitor (or preferably a designated health visitor if there is an appointed lead health visitor for giving screening results to families) by phone. They should also send confirmation of the result to the family in writing.</p>

<p>The laboratory should also inform the baby’s GP of the result in writing. A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cystic-fibrosis-probable-carrier-template-letter">‘cystic fibrosis: probable carrier’ template letter</a> is available. The communication with the GP should include a link to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/positive-screen-for-cystic-fibrosis-carrier-description-in-brief">‘cystic fibrosis carrier’ leaflet</a> as well as information about which healthcare professional has been informed of the final result and will be communicating it to the parents/carers.</p>

<p>The designated health visitor or alternative healthcare professional (who must be trained for the purpose) will visit the family to inform them of the result and give them the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/positive-screen-for-cystic-fibrosis-carrier-description-in-brief">‘cystic fibrosis carrier’ leaflet</a>. The healthcare professional that gives the carrier result to the family should complete and return the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cystic-fibrosis-carrier-follow-up-form">‘cystic fibrosis screening: carrier of <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> gene’ follow-up form</a> to the newborn screening laboratory within 24 hours of the visit.</p>

<p>Each laboratory should have an agreed arrangement for the communication and follow-up of ‘probable <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> carrier’ results. This should be in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clinical-referral-national-standard-protocol-for-cystic-fibrosis">‘managing positive results from cystic fibrosis screening’ guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>The screening protocol is designed to pick up as few carrier babies as possible and therefore should not be regarded as a reliable means of detecting <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> carrier babies.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> suspected</h4>

<p>‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> suspected’ results require follow-up/clinical referral. The laboratory should refer babies with positive screening results for <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> the same or next working day following confirmation of a positive result. The screening laboratory should report the screen positive result by phone and in writing to the regional <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> centre. For information on the regional <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> centres, please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cysticfibrosis.org.uk/what-is-cystic-fibrosis/cystic-fibrosis-care/specialist-cystic-fibrosis-care/paediatric-specialist-cf-centres" rel="external">Cystic Fibrosis Trust website</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cystic-fibrosis-presumed-positive-template-letter">‘Cystic fibrosis: presumed positive’ template letters</a> are available for the screening laboratory to notify the designated clinician and the baby’s GP of the ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> suspected’ result. The regional <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> centre will usually be responsible for liaising with a more local <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> clinic (as required by local arrangements). The referral notification should include a link to the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clinical-referral-national-standard-protocol-for-cystic-fibrosis">‘managing positive results from cystic fibrosis screening’ guidelines</a>. This initiates the clinical referral of screen positive cases.</p>

<p>An appropriately trained healthcare professional  should communicate the ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> suspected’ result  as soon as possible to the parents/carers. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cystic-fibrosis-suspected-description-in-brief">‘cystic fibrosis suspected’ leaflet</a> can support healthcare professionals to have this conversation. Early contact enables them to start their baby’s treatment as soon as this can be arranged.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>It is imperative that the GP understands that the result has been communicated directly to the regional CF Centre (who will contact the parents/carers), and that the letter they (the GP) have received is for information only.</p>
</div>

<p>Each screening laboratory should have an agreed arrangement for the follow-up and referral of all ‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> suspected’ cases, which should be in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clinical-referral-national-standard-protocol-for-cystic-fibrosis">‘managing positive results from cystic fibrosis screening’ guidelines</a>.</p>

<h2>Programme monitoring and data collection</h2>

<h3>Programme standards</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/standards-for-nhs-newborn-blood-spot-screening"><abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening programme standards</a> are used to assess the <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening process. The standards are a set of measures that have to be met to make sure screening is safe and effective. All health care professionals involved in the <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening pathway have a part to play in meeting these standards.</p>

<p>Laboratories should submit standards data to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening programme on an annual basis. The annual data collection template is shared with the screening laboratories via email each year, with instructions for completion and submission. Data submissions must be accurate, timely and complete. This enables performance monitoring and programme evaluation.</p>

<h3>Monitoring clinical outcomes</h3>

<p>Request clinical information from clinical referral centres on each presumptive positive case. Complete the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cystic-fibrosis-presumed-follow-up-form">presumptive positive follow-up form</a> for each case and submit the form to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening programme. It is the responsibility of the designated clinician at the clinical referral centres to ensure that these forms are completed and returned to their respective laboratory directors. The regional <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> centre should also be informed about diagnostic outcome to facilitate regional and national audit.</p>

<p>Follow-up information is also required on all cases reported as <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> carriers. For each case, send the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cystic-fibrosis-carrier-follow-up-form"><abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> carrier follow-up form</a> to the relevant health professional (specialist health visitor/counsellor) for completion. The anonymised data from the form should comprise part of the annual screening standards data submission by the screening laboratory to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening programme.</p>

<p>Follow-up information is also required on all cases with an inconclusive test result. The newborn screening laboratory should complete the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cystic-fibrosis-inconclusive-test-follow-up-form"><abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> inconclusive test follow-up form</a> and send it to the baby’s midwife or health visitor (also send a copy to the baby’s GP).</p>

<h3>Babies diagnosed with <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> not identified through newborn screening</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If a screening laboratory director, clinical team or molecular laboratory director is made aware of a CF case (born after 01 April 2007) that has not been detected via the CF screening programme, it is very important that information on the case is reported to the NBS screening programme.</p>
</div>

<p>The clinical team should gather the details in conjunction with the screening laboratory director using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notification-of-cystic-fibrosis-cf-diagnosis-not-identified-through-screening">‘<abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> diagnosis not identified through screening’ form</a>. The laboratory director should collate and anonymise the data, and send it as soon as possible to <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening programme at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:phe.screeninghelpdesk@nhs.net">phe.screeninghelpdesk@nhs.net</a>. All form fields shaded in grey should be removed prior to submitting the form.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>There should be no patient identifiable data on the ‘CF diagnosis not identified through screening’ form.</p>
</div>

<p>Data on these cases are collated on an annual basis as an important part of the audit and evaluation of the <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> screening programme.</p>

<h3>Screening safety incidents</h3>

<p>All safety concerns and incidents must be reported and managed in accordance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/managing-safety-incidents-in-nhs-screening-programmes">‘managing safety incidents in NHS screening programmes’ guidance</a>. This guidance details the accountabilities for reporting, investigating and managing NHS screening programme safety incidents. It covers the management of screening programme:</p>

<h2>Background to screening for <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Screening for <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> was formally introduced as a national newborn screening programme in England in April 2001. Screening was already taking place in Wales, Northern Ireland and some parts of England. Screening started in Scotland in February 2003 and became universal across the UK in October 2007.</p>

<p>The programme seeks to balance the interests of families where a child is identified as having <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> versus the interests of the large majority of families where children are unaffected. The programme was also designed to minimise the number of <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> carriers unavoidably detected.</p>

<h3>Scientific background to the screening protocol</h3>

<p>Newborn screening for <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> is founded on the work of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/85057/" rel="external">Crossley and others (1979)</a>, who showed that <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> in blood is significantly increased in affected newborns. Screening programmes based on <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> measurement from a dried bloodspot sample were introduced in East Anglia in 1980 and subsequently elsewhere in the UK. A raised <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> level is sensitive for identifying <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> but has poor positive predictive value (<abbr title="positive predictive value">PPV</abbr>) and therefore <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> programmes require a second ‘tier’ test to improve <abbr title="positive predictive value">PPV</abbr>. In early programmes, this was traditionally <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> in a second blood sample collected at 2 to 4 weeks of age. A 2-stage <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> procedure has the disadvantage of requiring a relatively high number of second samples, which increase the anxiety generated by screening, and the presumptive diagnosis is made relatively late.</p>

<p>Once the <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> gene was identified in 1989, the option of genetic analysis became possible to replace the second-tier <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> assay. Initially, in 1990, only the most common <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variant, ΔF508 (now known as c.1521_1523delCTT p.Phe508del) was used, but more recently panels with a larger number of <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> gene variants have been used globally.</p>

<p>Over 2000 variants have been identified associated with <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> and around 400 occur at sufficient frequency to determine their characterisation (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28129811/" rel="external">Farrell and others, 2017</a>; <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28129809/" rel="external">Sosnay and others, 2017</a>).</p>

<p>For the UK programme, the initial panel used for babies with a raised <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> measurement contains the 4 commonest <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variants in the UK population. If one variant is recognised, an expanded panel is used. In cases where only one variant is recognised using both the initial and expanded panel, a second <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> measurement is undertaken at day 21. If this is lower than a pre-defined cut-off the baby is classified as a probable carrier. Babies with a raised second <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> are referred for a clinical assessment and sweat testing. The limited initial panel and repeated <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> measurement at day 21 are unique aspects of the UK programme.</p>

<p>Because of the limited initial panel, a safety net is employed in the UK protocol. If the first <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> is extremely high (&gt;99.9th centile), but there is no variant recognised on the limited 4-variant panel, then a second dried blood spot sample is collected at day 21. Babies with a raised second <abbr title="immunoreactive trypsinogen">IRT</abbr> are referred for clinical assessment and sweat testing. This aspect of the UK protocol recognises babies with <abbr title="cystic fibrosis">CF</abbr> who have unusual <abbr title="cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">CFTR</abbr> variants (disproportionately babies from a non-European background), but has a poor positive predictive value compared to other parts of the protocol (around 10 to 20 babies are referred for sweat testing for each positive diagnosis).</p>
