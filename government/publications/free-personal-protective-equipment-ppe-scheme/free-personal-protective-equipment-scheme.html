<h2>Legal basis</h2>

<p>The primary legislation used to invoke this scheme were section 2 and section 2A of the National Health Service Act 2006.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>The objective of the scheme is to protect those providing health and social care services and those using their services from coronavirus (COVID-19). The Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="The Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) is committed to ensuring those providers have reliable access to the personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) that is needed to ensure good infection control, limiting the spread of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The UK authorities consider that ensuring that health and social care providers, community pharmacies and public sector organisations have access to <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for COVID-19 infection control in the volume required is vital in controlling the spread of COVID-19, and in turn the impact on public health, the economy, and social wellbeing.</p>

<p>Based on guidance from the World Health Organization (<abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>) and other bodies and agencies expert in epidemiology and infection control, enhanced and revised infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) guidance for the use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in health and social care services, community pharmacies and public sector organisations was introduced in early March 2020.</p>

<p>This official guidance was issued jointly by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="The Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Public Health Wales (PHW)</li>
  <li>Public Health Agency (PHA) Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>Health Protection Scotland (HPS) and National Services Scotland</li>
  <li>Public Health England (PHE)</li>
  <li>NHS England</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> guidance and requirements aim to control the spread of COVID-19 through preventing cross-infection and other forms of contamination. The guidance and requirements, among other things, require significantly increased use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for COVID-19 infection control, including the use of different types of medical or clinical grade <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> from those used before the outbreak.</p>

<p>Failure to comply with this guidance may leave health and social care providers exposed to investigation and sanctions by, for example, the Health and Safety Executive, the Care Quality Commission or other agencies responsible for the regulation of health and social care providers, including a revocation of provider registration, and could have an impact on commissioning decisions made by the NHS and local authorities.</p>

<p>Against this background, with the wholesale market struggling to respond to the increase in demand for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> created by the pandemic, and to ensure the viability of services in the face of soaring costs, government took a central role in the procurement and supply of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> required for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> infection control to health and care settings.</p>

<p>As part of this role, <abbr title="The Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> purchased a significant stock of COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. Such stock was for COVID-19 use by those working in the health and social care sector and their patients, clients or other consumers of the services, to ensure safe working conditions, to protect them from infection and, should they be infected, to mitigate the spread of the disease. This stock was centrally funded and provided free of charge to eligible health and care providers. <abbr title="The Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> originally committed to providing this COVID-19-related <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> free of charge until 31 March 2021.</p>

<p>The government has since extended the provision of free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for all health, social care and public sector workers to support their COVID-19 needs, first until the end of June 2021 and then again until the end of March 2022. This also applies to NHS trusts and primary care settings. The first extension, until the end of June 2021, was made in anticipation of high COVID-19 infections rates remaining through April to June 2021, with demand for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> also remaining high in response as well as due to new demands coming online such as mass testing and the vaccine roll out.</p>

<p>The free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> provision was reviewed again in April 2021 and extended until 31 March 2022. Similar to the first extension, pressures on the health and social care sector were expected to remain high through the year, with the risk of new variants emerging and potential new waves; there was particular concern about the impact of winter 2021. <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> guidance was also not expected to change during this time and therefore demand for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to remain high. The decision was consequently taken to extend for a longer period to ensure health and care workers would have the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> they needed to keep safe through the latest wave of COVID-19 and to see them through the winter.</p>

<p>While the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> supply chain has now stabilised, our aim is to make sure that health and social care workers continue to receive the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> they need. Continued government intervention in the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> market has limited other actors in this part of the market.&nbsp;However, while COVID-19 infection rates remain high, the free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> scheme remains necessary to minimise disruption during this period and ensure health and care workers, and those using their services, are protected.</p>

<h2>Beneficiaries</h2>

<p>The beneficiaries of the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> scheme are health and social care providers, community pharmacies and public sector organisations providing services as part of the state’s prerogative.</p>

<p>The health and social care activities covered by the scheme are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>NHS trusts<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>general medical practice activities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>dental practice activities (including orthodontic activities)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>residential care activities (both adult and child)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>social work activities without accommodation (but not including child daycare activities, which do not involve an element of social care)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>other health activities, specifically, optometry, activities of nurses performed in general practice, including within the community, and activities of dental paramedical personal such as dental hygienists, including, for the avoidance of doubt, hospices</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the scheme includes community pharmacies.</p>

<p>Healthcare providers and community pharmacies are eligible if they are remunerated by the state. Adult and child social care providers are always eligible.</p>

<p>Finally, the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> scheme covers public sector organisations providing services as part of the state’s prerogative, such as police services and the prison service.</p>

<h2>Budget</h2>

<p>The value of the free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> scheme for the period 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022 is around £2,025,122,000.</p>

<h2>Functioning</h2>

<p>The aid takes the form of free distribution of clinical or medical grade <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, consisting of gloves, masks, eye protection, respirators, aprons and gowns to eligible beneficiaries.</p>

<p>NHS trusts are supplied via an auto-replenishment model through the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> Dedicated Supply Channel. All other eligible beneficiaries can access free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> via the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> portal.</p>

<p>See guidance and further information about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ppe-portal-how-to-order-covid-19-personal-protective-equipment" class="govuk-link">accessing free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr></a> and the <a rel="external" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/infection-control/ppe/" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> portal</a>, including order limits for individual sectors and the products available to each sector.</p>

<p>Eligible health and social care providers, community pharmacies and public sector organisations providing services as part of the state’s prerogative can request to be included in the scheme. They can order <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> with <abbr title="The Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>, which will provide them with regular supplies of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, based on modelled requirements and set order limits, allocated according to the size of the beneficiary, the estimated number of interactions between the beneficiary and each patient or service user, the types of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and the number of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> changes per day required by the guidance. These are then checked against estimated pre-COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> usages by sector or type of service in line with other infection control guidance.</p>
