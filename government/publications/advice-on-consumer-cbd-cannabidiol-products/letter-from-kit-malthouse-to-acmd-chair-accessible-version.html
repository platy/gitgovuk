<p>Dear Owen,</p>

<p>Advice on consumer CBD (Cannabidiol) products</p>

<p>As you are aware, tackling drug misuse and the harms that it causes remains a top
priority for this Government. The Home Office is keen to draw on ACMD advice on
the issue of CBD products which are not medicines. There has been a proliferation of
such products available online and on the high street in recent years. While as an
isolated substance, CBD is not a controlled drug, there is recent evidence that many
of the products available contain controlled cannabinoids and that it is difficult to
isolate pure CBD. The Government currently has no plans to look at the status of
CBD itself under drug legislation.</p>

<p>There is currently not a legal framework in place specifically exempting CBD
products from control under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, and with this in mind, the
Government wishes to explore the possibility of creating a specific exemption in the
Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 (‘the 2001 Regulations’) for CBD products which
contain no more than a defined trace percentage of controlled cannabinoids.
Primarily THCV, Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC and CBN and the cannabinoid Δ<sup>9</sup>THCA-A. We are
interested to hear if you believe other controlled cannabinoids require consideration
too.</p>

<p>The Government is minded to amend the 2001 Regulations to permit CBD products
that contain no more than a defined trace percentage of certain controlled
cannabinoids as an impurity. Additionally, we are minded to amend the definition of
an “exempt product” under the 2001 Regulations to give effect to the intent
surrounding its introduction, being to only exempt products used for scientific or diagnostic purposes which contain an extremely small amount and proportion of
controlled drugs, but unambiguously excludes consumer products and any products
intended for human consumption, other than in scientific research. We request the
ACMD to provide advice on how the exempt product definition in the Misuse of Drugs
Regulations may be amended to apply only to diagnostic equipment or for scientific
research, as originally intended.</p>

<p>In terms of this trace amount, we propose that the defined trace percentage in CBD
products be set at a level which will be between 0.01% and 0.0001% by weight per
controlled cannabinoid. The precise level will be determined following further
scientific testing advice. Given the current limited availability of reference chemicals,
we consider that analytical capability is likely to be best focused on the quantification
of THCV, Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC, CBN and Δ<sup>9</sup>THCA-A rather than all controlled cannabinoids that
could be permitted to be present in trace amounts. The Government intends to work
further with the forensic science sector to assist in determination of the method of
testing and precise definition of the trace amount. The 0.01-0.0001% per named
controlled cannabinoid level (or lower) is proposed on the basis of evidence and will
be subject to further confirmation on our part that responsible producers are able to
produce CBD to this level of purity, and it is within the capabilities of the forensic
science sector to quantify consistently and affordably.</p>

<p>In order to keep the level of controlled cannabinoids in CBD products down to an
unavoidable trace level, we would ask that the ACMD considers the maximum dose
for any non-negligible effect for THCV, Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC and CBN and the cannabinoid
Δ<sup>9</sup>THCA-A. We are seeking further scientific testing advice on analytical capability to
test for a cannabinoid content of 0.01-0.0001% by weight or lower per specified
cannabinoid. In particular, we would ask that the ACMD considers whether such
products would be liable to be abused or have ill effects, and whether the controlled
substances could, in practice, be recovered from such products.</p>
