<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide is part of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/all-our-health-personalised-care-and-population-health">‘All Our Health’</a>, a resource which helps health professionals prevent ill health and promote wellbeing as part of their everyday practise. The information below will help front-line health and care staff use their trusted relationships with patients, families and communities to promote the benefits of physical activity.</p>

<p>We also recommend important actions that managers and staff holding strategic roles can take.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/all-our-health-personalised-care-and-population-health">View the full range of ‘All Our Health’ topics</a></p>

<h2>Access the physical activity e-learning session</h2>

<p>An interactive <a class="govuk-link" href="https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/Component/Details/571297" rel="external">e-learning version of this topic</a> is now available to use.</p>

<p>The Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (<abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>) and Health Education England’s ‘e-Learning for Healthcare’ have developed this content to increase the confidence and skills of health and care professionals, to embed prevention in their day-to-day practise.</p>

<h2>Why promote physical activity in your professional practice?</h2>

<p>Physical inactivity is associated with 1 in 6 deaths in the UK and is estimated to cost the UK £7.4 billion annually (including £0.9 billion to the NHS alone).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, our population is around 20% less active than in the 1960s. If current trends continue, it will be 35% less active by 2030.</p>

<p>Many people don’t realise that physical activity has significant benefits for health, both physical and mental, and can help to prevent and manage over 20 chronic conditions and diseases, including some cancers, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and depression.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Health benefits of physical activity" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/54654/Health-benefits.png"></div></figure>

<p>Around 1 in 3 (34%) of men and 1 in 2 (42%) of women are not active enough for good health.</p>

<p>Men are more likely to report being active at the recommended level than women.</p>

<p>Physical activity varies with age and life stage. People tend to get <a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/physical-activity/data#page/6/gid/1938132899/pat/6/par/E12000004/ati/102/are/E06000015/iid/93014/age/298/sex/4" rel="external">less active with age, especially in older years</a>.</p>

<p>And people with disabilities or long-term conditions are twice as likely not to be active enough for good health.</p>

<p>However, one in four people would be more active if advised by a healthcare professional so this presents a unique opportunity for you to support people to be more active.</p>

<p>The UK Chief Medical Officers’ Guidelines recommend each week adults do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at least 150 minutes moderate intensity activity, 75 minutes’ vigorous activity, or a mixture of both</li>
  <li>strengthening activities on two days</li>
  <li>reducing extended periods of sitting</li>
</ul>

<h2>Core principles for healthcare professionals</h2>

<p>This ‘All Our Health’ physical activity information has been created to help all health professionals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand specific activities and interventions that can prevent physical inactivity</li>
  <li>think about the resources and services available in your area that can help people get active</li>
</ul>

<h2>Taking action</h2>

<h3>If you’re a front-line health professional:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>speak to your patients about the benefits of physical activity and risks of inactivity, referring them to information or services if necessary</li>
  <li>read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2018/01/08/its-good-to-talk-making-the-most-of-our-conversations/" rel="external">blogs about brief advice, motivational interviewing and health coaching</a> to help you have non-judgemental conversations tailored to individual patients</li>
  <li>find out about the resources and services in your area that can help people get active, such as local referral pathways, including exercise/activity on referral schemes</li>
  <li>make yourself familiar with local physical activity options, for example local <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.walkingforhealth.org.uk/" rel="external">Walking for Health schemes</a>
</li>
  <li>read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2018/01/08/health-and-care-professionals-your-lifestyle-referrals-can-create-a-force-for-change/" rel="external">blogs about the type of local services that may be available and how to find them</a>
</li>
  <li>familiarise yourself with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/physical-activity-guidelines-infographics">key physical activity messages</a> and understand where to access trusted advice for your patients – we recommend <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/livewell/fitness/Pages/Fitnesshome.aspx" rel="external">NHS Choices</a> which has information for adults, older people, children and people with disabilities</li>
  <li>promote physical activity campaigns like Change4Life (information for children) and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/" rel="external">Better Health</a> (for adults aged 40 to 60)</li>
  <li>offer online activities or health apps such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/apps" rel="external">Better Health’s ACTIVE10</a> which encourages 10 minutes of brisk walking every day or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/apps" rel="external">‘Couch to 5k’</a> which helps people take up running</li>
  <li>become a physical activity role model; increasing your own activity levels will improve your own health and make it easier for you to discuss physical activity with other people</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you’re a team leader or manager:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>ensure the teams you manage are aware of physical activity services and interventions in your local area</li>
  <li>promote a team culture where staff know that they should talk to their patients about healthy lifestyles – ‘Making Every Contact Count’ initiatives should include physical activity</li>
  <li>create a culture where all staff understand the benefits of measuring their impact and demonstrating the value of their work</li>
  <li>consider working within your own organisation, or with local businesses, to promote active workplaces</li>
  <li>encourage high-level, executive staff to act as physical activity role models</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you’re a senior or strategic leader:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>work to ensure physical activity is promoted prominently within commissioned healthcare services</li>
  <li>include physical activity in health and wellbeing boards’ Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA)</li>
  <li>consider the physical activity needs of the local workforce to create a culture change towards a more active workforce</li>
  <li>look at the education and training needs of the workforce, to equip them to deliver high-quality physical activity advice and interventions</li>
  <li>encourage high-level, executive staff to act as physical activity role models</li>
</ul>

<h2>Understanding local needs</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://khub.net/documents/31798783/32394974/Physical+Activity+Data+Sources.pdf/c0ec997a-c14c-4d4b-9094-f764c105582a" rel="external">Physical Activity Data Sources</a> document provides information on what can be found in each data source, including geographical areas reported (including national, regional and local authority), demographics of respondents (age, sex, ethnicity, sexuality, socio-economic status, religion, disability) and frequency of updates to the data.</p>

<p>The 2 main sources of national level physical activity data are the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://digital.nhs.uk/catalogue/PUB30169" rel="external">Health Survey for England (<abbr title="Health Survey for England">HSE</abbr>)</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sportengland.org/research/active-lives-survey/" rel="external">Active Lives Survey (<abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Health Survey for England">HSE</abbr> is used by central government to monitor trends in the national physical activity estimates, with most recent data available from <abbr title="Health Survey for England">HSE</abbr> 2016. Data from <abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr> is used for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/public-health-outcomes-framework" rel="external">Public Health Outcomes Framework</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/physical-activity" rel="external">Physical Activity</a> tools to support local monitoring of performance against the government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sporting-future-a-new-strategy-for-an-active-nation">Sport Strategy</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-physical-activity-guidelines">Chief Medical Officer guidelines</a>, with <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> producing physical activity estimates for each local authority in England.</p>

<h2>Measuring impact</h2>

<p>As a health professional there are a range of reasons why it makes sense to measure your impact and demonstrate the value of your contribution. This could be about sharing what has worked well in order to benefit your colleagues and local people, or help you with your professional development.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/general-practice-physical-activity-questionnaire-gppaq">general practice physical activity questionnaire (GPPAQ)</a> is a simple, validated screening tool to assess adult physical activity and the associated risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality within primary care.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rsph.org.uk/our-work/policy/measuring-public-health-impact.html" rel="external">Everyday Interactions measuring impact toolkit</a> provides a quick, straightforward and easy way for health care professionals to record and measure their public health impact in a uniform and comparable way.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rsph.org.uk/our-work/policy/measuring-public-health-impact/physical-activity.html" rel="external">physical activity impact pathway</a> is recommended for healthcare professionals to record and measure actions undertaken as part of routine care which impact on physical activity levels.</p>
