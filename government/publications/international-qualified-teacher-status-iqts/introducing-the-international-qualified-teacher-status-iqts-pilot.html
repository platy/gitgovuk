<h2>A new international teaching qualification</h2>

<p>In February 2021, the government launched a public consultation which introduced proposals for a new international teaching qualification called international qualified teacher status (<abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr>). <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> was announced as part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-education-strategy-2021-update">International Education Strategy 2021 Update</a> to help export excellence in teacher training.</p>

<p>In August 2021, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/introducing-international-qualified-teacher-status-iqts">government response</a> was published. <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> is now in its pilot phase (launched spring 2022), and is being taught by <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>-approved <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> providers, working in partnership with excellent schools and in-school mentors around the world. Candidates are now being enrolled on <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> courses starting in autumn 2022.</p>

<p>The Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) is developing plans to roll the qualification out to a broader base of English initial teacher training providers.</p>

<p>This document sets out the policy framework and the government’s plans for <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr>. It contains information for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>candidates for <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>training providers wishing to offer <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>schools wishing to offer an <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> placement</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Aims of <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr>
</h2>

<p><abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> is a new, UK government-backed international teaching qualification which will be recognised by <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> as equivalent to English qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>) (via an amendment to regulations). Accredited English initial teacher training (<abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>) providers will offer <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> to trainees all over the world. It will lead to the automatic award of English <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> on successful completion.</p>

<p><abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> aims to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>provide opportunities for accredited English <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> providers to expand into the growing international teacher training market</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make high quality training accessible around the world and allow trainees to benefit from evidence-based <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>support schools outside the UK to recruit, retain and develop local talent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>increase the global pool of quality teachers and support global mobility within the teaching profession</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> is built on evidence-based English methods and standards of teacher training, with contextualisation for the wide variety of settings trainees may be in.</p>

<h3>Information for candidates for <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Candidates will complete the <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> training programme without needing to visit the UK. From the start of the academic year 2023 to 2024, <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> will also be available as a part-time course.</p>

<p>Training will be given in English and consist of a year of study alongside teaching practice in schools, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>tuition from the <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> English teacher training provider, taught largely using remote working technology</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>face-to-face mentoring at the candidate’s placement school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>regular feedback and rigorous assessment</p>

<h2>Course content</h2>

<p>The government has created a framework for <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> built on the core elements of initial teacher training in England. <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> providers are expected to design and develop their programmes around this framework.</p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ensuring programmes are designed to allow trainees to meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-qualified-teacher-status-teachers-standards"><abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> Teachers’ Standards</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensuring curricula encompass the full entitlement as described in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-training-core-content-framework-for-iqts"><abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> Core Content Framework</a>, are appropriate for the subject, phase and age range, and are contextualised for the local environment in which trainees are teaching</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>The pilot year will be used to test, learn from and iterate the framework to ensure the success of the wider roll-out of <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> from 2023.</p>

<h2>Information for schools outside the UK wishing to offer an <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> placement</h2>

<p>To maintain the same high standards as English <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>, it is a requirement for <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> teacher training providers to partner with excellent schools outside the UK.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> has designed <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> to be a high-quality professional teaching qualification with the flexibility to adapt to the trainees’ local context.</p>

<p><abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> placement schools provide candidates with practical hands-on experience in the classroom and support and feedback from an in-school mentor.</p>

<p>The benefits for your school of becoming an early adopter of the <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> training programme include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>improved retention and continuous professional development for your existing staff through <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> training or mentoring</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>additional resource when you take on <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> trainees</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>new teaching talent in your region and a network of professionals sharing resources, best practice and expertise</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>local <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> graduates who are then available for recruitment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enhanced leadership for your school in your region</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As a partner school working with an <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> training provider, you would need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>give trainees the required classroom experience (a minimum of 120 days)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>train an experienced member of your staff to mentor trainees in school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>work closely with the <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> training provider to maintain standards</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>supply feedback to <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> to help improve <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> for future candidates</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>allow trainees to be observed in school as part of the provider assessment process</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>How <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> leads to English <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>
</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will recognise <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> as equivalent to <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>, subject to the will of Parliament, via an amendment to regulations.

During their induction, they will be assessed against English Teachers’ Standards.</p>

<h2>Quality assurance</h2>

<p><abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> will be underpinned by strong quality assurance mechanisms to ensure all trainees receive a high quality experience and maintain standards.</p>

<p>These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>delivery of <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> programmes by accredited English <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> providers only</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> monitoring and evaluation of <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> providers in their first year of offering <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr></p>

    <p>regular inspection of <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> providers after their first year by <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>-approved <abbr title="international qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> inspectorates</p>
  </li>
