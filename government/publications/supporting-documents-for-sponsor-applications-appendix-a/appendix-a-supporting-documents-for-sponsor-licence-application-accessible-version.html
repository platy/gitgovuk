<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document is for organisations that want to apply for a sponsor licence on the Worker, Temporary Worker or Student routes. It is an appendix to the full policy guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/sponsorship-information-for-employers-and-educators#workers-and-temporary-workers:-guidance-for-sponsors">sponsoring a Worker or Temporary Worker</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/student-sponsor-guidance">sponsoring a Student</a>. It lists the documents you must provide to support your application for a sponsor licence.</p>

<p>In most cases, you must provide at least 4 documents (or, where stated, 4 combinations of documents). You may not need to send 4 documents if you are a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>public body recognised by the UK Government, such as a local authority</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>company listed on the London Stock Exchange Main Market</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Supporting evidence</h3>

<p>The following tables list all of the information we will need to check and tell you whether you need to send any documents. The easiest way to work out which documents you need to send is to read through each of the following tables, starting with table 1.</p>

<p>Note: you must provide extra information if you are applying for a <a class="govuk-link" href="#skilled-worker">Skilled Worker and/or T2 Minister of Religion licence</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#table1">Table 1</a> sets out some limited circumstances when you may not have to send 4 documents. If you are an organisation of the type listed in this table, you need only send the documents described, and, in some cases, you may not need to send any documents at all, unless there are documents listed in tables 2 to 4 that are specifically required for the route in which you are applying. If you are not listed in table 1, you should then look at table 2.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#table2">Table 2</a> sets out all the documents which you must send if you are a start-up (trading for less than 18 months), franchise, charity, or are subject to regulation, inspection or monitoring. We describe these as ‘mandatory’ based on the kind of organisation you are. It also sets out some other documents we will accept from you in addition to those which are mandatory. Once you have identified any documents in table 2 that you must send us, you should then look at table 3.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#table3">Table 3</a> sets out all of the documents which are mandatory based on the route in which you are applying. If you have not identified 4 documents to send to us after looking at tables 1, 2 and 3, you must then look at table 4.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#table4">Table 4</a> sets out all other documents you can send if you still need to make your total number of documents up to a minimum of 4.</p>

<p>You must make sure you have read the full <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/sponsorship-information-for-employers-and-educators#workers-and-temporary-workers:-guidance-for-sponsors">Workers and Temporary Workers: guidance for sponsors</a> and/or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/student-sponsor-guidance">Student sponsor guidance</a> on GOV.UK before you apply for your sponsor licence. The guidance has examples which explain how to put together the right documents to send to us to validate your sponsor licence application.</p>

<p>Once you have applied online for your licence, you must send the following documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the submission sheet, signed and dated by your authorising officer (all pages must be sent)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all of the mandatory documents listed on the submission sheet</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You should scan or take pictures of your supporting documents and send them to the email address given on the submission sheet.</p>

<p>Files can be in PDF (preferred), JPEG or PNG format. File titles should be descriptive and no more than 25 characters long. To minimise file sizes, we recommend scanning in black and white or greyscale, not colour. Pictures taken by phone can be saved as Small or Medium size files. You should carefully check the quality of all scans or pictures before sending.</p>

<p>If you are unable to provide the submission sheet and supporting evidence electronically, you can contact us using the contact details given on the submission sheet.</p>

<p>Any affidavits or statutory declarations you send must have been witnessed by a qualified, independent person – for example, a solicitor, Notary Public, Justice of the Peace, Commissioner for Oaths, or (in Scotland only) a Councillor.</p>

<p>Any documents or other evidence that we ask to see that are not in English or Welsh must be accompanied by a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/certifying-a-document">certified translation</a>. The translator or translation company must confirm in writing on the translation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>that it’s a ‘true and accurate translation of the original document’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the date of the translation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the full name and contact details of the translator or a representative of the translation company</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In all cases we reserve the right to request original documents or certified copies.</p>

<p>Original documents will be returned by Royal Mail Signed For delivery to the address of the Authorising Officer stated in the online sponsor application. Certified copies sent by post must meet the requirements set out in the sponsor guidance.</p>

<p>For your sponsor licence application to be valid, you must send us all of the documents within 5 working days of the date on which you submitted your online sponsor licence application.</p>

<p>If any of the mandatory items are missing or incorrect, your application will be invalid. Invalid applications are rejected and the application fee is refunded.
If any documents specified in this appendix, other than mandatory documents, are missing from your application, or if we require any additional documents, we will contact you by email.</p>

<p>We will give you 5 working days to send those documents to us. If you do not send them to us within 5 working days, we will refuse your application and your fee will not be refunded.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Online checks</h3>

<p>As you work though the tables, you may find that we could do an online check to obtain the information we need but will need some help from you to locate the relevant web page. If this is the case, you must tell us the in your covering email, or in a covering letter, the address of the website where the information can be found. For example, if you are a care home in England, you must provide evidence of your registration with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/" rel="external">Care Quality Commission (CQC)</a>. If that registration is in a different name to the one you have given on your licence application, you will need to tell us what name you are registered under in your covering email or in a covering letter, and provide any relevant supporting evidence to show that you are the same organisation. We will then be able to look you up on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/" rel="external">CQC</a> website.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Security and contact information</h3>

<p>Security is important to us. You should give the names of all the people who have access to the email address supplied with your online sponsor licence application. You should also provide a landline telephone number, if you have one. If you do not have a landline, please indicate this in your response.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Skilled Worker and/or T2 Minister of Religion: additional information</h2>

<p>If you are applying for a licence to sponsor workers on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-sponsor-a-skilled-worker">Skilled Worker</a> and/or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-sponsor-a-minister-of-religion-or-religious-worker">T2 Minister of Religion</a> routes, you must provide the information below (as well as the documents from the following tables) or your application will be rejected.</p>

  <li>
    <p>what sector you operate in</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>what are your opening/operating hours</p>

  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must indicate which jobs are currently vacant and for which you intend to assign a CoS.

If you identified this person as a result of a recruitment process, you should include copies of advertisements placed to recruit for the job, details of any applicants and why they were not suitable for the job. You should confirm whether the person is already working for you.</p>

<p>If you have not advertised the job and the person you wish to employ is not currently working for you, you should confirm how you identified that this person was the most suitable for the job.</p>

<p>If you have already identified a person, including if they are an overseas national already working for you, and intend to assign a CoS to them, you should provide the following details of the person:</p>

<ul>
