<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The recovery premium grant is part of the government’s package of funding to support pupils whose education has been impacted by coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>It is a time-limited grant providing over £300m of additional funding for state-funded schools in the 2021 to 2022 academic year and £1bn across the 2022 to 2023 and 2023 to 2024 academic years.</p>

<p>It is focused on pupil premium eligible pupils and pupils in specialist settings such as special schools, special units and pupil referral units (<abbr title="pupil referral units">PRUs</abbr>). This is because of the additional impact of the pandemic on these students.</p>

<p>However, schools can use it to deliver evidence-based approaches for supporting any pupil based on an assessment of individual need.</p>

<h2>Eligible schools</h2>

<p>All schools that are eligible for pupil premium are eligible for recovery premium. This includes the following types of schools:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mainstream primary, secondary and all through local authority-maintained schools, academies and free schools serving children aged 4 to 15</li>
  <li>local authority-maintained special schools</li>
  <li>special academies and free schools</li>
  <li>non-maintained special schools</li>
  <li>pupil referral units</li>
  <li>alternative provision academies and free schools</li>
  <li>local authority-maintained hospital schools and academies</li>
</ul>

<p>We will also provide funding to local authorities for eligible pupils they have placed in independent special schools, where the local authority pays full tuition fees.</p>

<h2>Pupil eligibility and funding rates 2021 to 2022</h2>

<h3>Pupil eligibility</h3>

<p>Recovery premium allocations will be based on pupil premium eligibility:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pupils who are eligible for free school meals (<abbr title="free school meals">FSM</abbr>), including eligible children of families who have no recourse to public funds (<abbr title="no recourse to public funds">NRPF</abbr>)</li>
  <li>pupils who have been eligible for free school meals at any point in the last 6 years</li>
  <li>children looked after by local authorities - referred to as looked-after children (<abbr title="looked-after children">LAC</abbr>) and children previously looked after by local authorities - referred to as previously looked-after children (PLAC)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Funding rates</h3>

<p>Recovery premium allocations will be calculated on a per pupil basis, based on the following rates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£145 per eligible pupil in mainstream education</li>
  <li>£290 per eligible pupil in other types of eligible school and special educational needs units in mainstream schools</li>
</ul>

<p>We have included a minimum payment that we refer to as a ‘floor’ to ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an eligible primary school will not receive less than £2,000</li>
  <li>an eligible secondary, or all-through school, will not receive less than £6,000</li>
</ul>

<p>As with pupil premium, funding for looked-after children will be paid to the local authority and should be managed by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pupil-premium-virtual-school-heads-responsibilities">virtual school head</a> in consultation with the child’s school.</p>

<p>See the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-recovery-premium-funding">coronavirus (COVID-19) recovery premium allocations and conditions of grant 2021 to 2022</a> for further information.</p>

<h2>Pupil eligibility and indicative funding rates 2022 to 2023</h2>

<h3>Pupil eligibility</h3>

<p>For mainstream schools, pupil eligibility will be the same as in 2021 to 2022.</p>

<p>For other eligible schools, and special educational needs units in mainstream schools, recovery premium allocations will be based on all pupils registered at the school.</p>

<h3>Funding rates</h3>

<p>Recovery premium allocations will be calculated on a per pupil basis, based on the following indicative rates:</p>

<p>Mainstream education:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£145 per eligible pupil in primary schools</li>
  <li>£276 per eligible pupil in secondary schools</li>
</ul>

<p>Other eligible schools, and special education units in mainstream schools:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£290 per pupil in primary education</li>
  <li>£552 per pupil in secondary education</li>
</ul>

<p>We have included a minimum payment that we refer to as a ‘floor’ to ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an eligible primary school will not receive less than £2,000</li>
  <li>an eligible secondary, or all-through school, will not receive less than £6,000</li>
</ul>

<p>Funding for looked-after children will be paid to the local authority and should be managed by the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pupil-premium-virtual-school-heads-responsibilities">virtual school head</a> in consultation with the child’s school.</p>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-recovery-premium-funding-allocations-and-conditions-of-grant-2022-to-2023">coronavirus (COVID-19) recovery premium allocations and conditions of grant 2022 to 2023</a> for further information.</p>

<h3>Payment schedule</h3>

<p>The recovery premium for 2021 to 2022 and 2022 to 2023 will be paid in 4 instalments on the following schedule:</p>

<h4>Academic year 2021 to 2022</h4>

<p>Payments will be sent to local authorities on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>30 September 2021</li>
  <li>31 December 2021</li>
  <li>29 April 2022</li>
  <li>30 June 2022</li>
</ul>

<p>Payments will be sent to academies (and free schools) on:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h4>Academic year 2022 to 2023</h4>

<h2>Using recovery premium funding</h2>

<p>Schools should spend this premium on evidence-based approaches to support pupils. In line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/evidence-summaries/pupil-premium-guide/" rel="external">Education Endowment Foundation’s pupil premium guide</a>, activities should include those that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>support the quality of teaching</li>
  <li>provide targeted academic support</li>
  <li>deal with non-academic barriers to success in school, such as attendance, behaviour and social and emotional support</li>
</ul>

<p>Like the pupil premium, schools can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>spend the recovery premium on a wider cohort of pupils than those who are eligible for the funding</li>
  <li>direct recovery premium spending where they think the need is greatest</li>
</ul>

<p>For further information, read our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pupil-premium-effective-use-and-accountability">using pupil premium</a>.</p>

<p>The recovery premium conditions of grant for the 2022 to 2023 academic year state that schools must not use the grant to meet their portion of the costs of tuition provided through the National Tutoring Programme (<abbr title="National Tutoring Programme">NTP</abbr>). Schools should meet those costs from their existing sources of income, such as core funding and pupil premium. Recovery premium is additional funding to provide further education recovery support on top of the subsidised <abbr title="National Tutoring Programme">NTP</abbr> offer.</p>

<p>Funding for looked-after children should be managed by the local authority virtual school head. They should work with schools, including the designated teacher, to decide how to use the funding effectively to support looked-after children.</p>

<h2>Reporting and accountability</h2>

<p>Schools must show they are using their recovery premium effectively:</p>

<ul>
  <li>by reporting on their use of recovery premium as part of their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pupil-premium-effective-use-and-accountability#strategy-statements">pupil premium strategy statement</a>
</li>
  <li>through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/" rel="external">inspections by Ofsted</a> - inspectors may discuss plans schools have to spend their recovery premium funding</li>
  <li>by declaring that they have spent the funding in line with the conditions of grant and can demonstrate this upon request - a tick-box declaration will be added to the 2022 to 2023 year-end statement for <abbr title="National Tutoring Programme">NTP</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
