<p>The Climate Finance Accelerator (<abbr title="Climate Finance Accelerator">CFA</abbr>) is a £10 million technical assistance programme funded by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/international-climate-finance">International Climate Finance (<abbr title="International Climate Finance">ICF</abbr>)</a>, through the UK government’s Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy (<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Climate Finance Accelerator">CFA</abbr> is part of the UK’s efforts to support climate action at scale by providing practical ways to help governments in middle income countries finance and deliver their climate commitments under the Paris Agreement.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Climate Finance Accelerator">CFA</abbr> works with middle income countries to help them achieve their national climate plans and Nationally Determined Contributions (<abbr title="Nationally Determined Contributions">NDCs</abbr>), from the bottom up. It does this by helping to identify challenges and blockages that prevent finance from flowing at the volume and speed required to have a meaningful impact on their climate ambitions.</p>

<p>By bringing together project proponents, finance providers (including experts from the City of London) and policymakers, the <abbr title="Climate Finance Accelerator">CFA</abbr> seeks to enable a collaborative approach to unlocking a steady flow of funding for climate projects at scale and create a pipeline of ‘investment ready’ low carbon projects, thereby strengthening countries’ ambitions to limit global warming to 1.5°C. The programme will have several co-benefits, such as supporting green recovery efforts from <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>-19 through inclusive approaches to sustainable development, improved gender equality, and building resilience to climate impacts.</p>

<h2>Participating countries</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> funded 3 pilot activities to test the <abbr title="Climate Finance Accelerator">CFA</abbr> approach, which took place between 2017 and 2020, and involved Nigeria, Colombia, and Mexico. These confirmed demand for the <abbr title="Climate Finance Accelerator">CFA</abbr> and informed the decision to scale-up the concept into a £10 million <abbr title="International Climate Finance">ICF</abbr> programme.</p>

<p>The full programme will operate in 8 countries:</p>

<p>The programme is being delivered by in-country local delivery partners, part of an alliance led by PwC, with support from Ricardo, and independent experts. Delivery is overseen by a steering group, convening external experts from across the global finance community. The programme commenced in November 2020 and is due to run until at least November 2024.</p>

<h2>The challenge</h2>

<p>Climate mitigation projects in middle-income countries face several challenges in accessing funding at scale:</p>

<ul>
  <li>project proposals may not be ‘investment-ready’</li>
  <li>there is low visibility of available low carbon investment opportunities among the investment community</li>
  <li>there may be policy and regulatory barriers</li>
  <li>an improved understanding of project finance, blended finance opportunities, and low-carbon technologies may also be required</li>
</ul>

<p>The programme seeks to understand and address these challenges, and to improve the flows of climate finance, through the following process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifying low carbon projects which can help meet a country’s <abbr title="Nationally Determined Contribution">NDC</abbr> and bringing them together with private financiers to identify and prioritise financing propositions</li>
  <li>developing the commercial structure of these projects to the stage where they can attract primary finance, initially in local capital markets</li>
  <li>securing this primary finance, which in many instances will involve blended finance products capable of funding projects at scale</li>
  <li>for projects of a certain scale and from relevant sectors (such as renewable energy, buildings, transport), refinancing these projects into green bonds and similar investment instruments that are attractive to global capital markets</li>
</ul>

<h2>The <abbr title="Climate Finance Accelerator">CFA</abbr> Process</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Climate Finance Accelerator">CFA</abbr> in-country process comprises of 4 phases of activities:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Scoping phase</h3>

<p>This phase starts with a mapping of the context, priorities, and climate finance ecosystem in the country to identify the key barriers to a fully functioning climate finance supply chain.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> In-country workshop</h3>

<p>Based on the results of the scoping phase, a call for proposals will be run to identify low carbon projects relevant to the country’s <abbr title="Nationally Determined Contribution">NDC</abbr>, of interest to investors, and considered financeable. The projects should also deliver co-benefits such as poverty reduction, improved gender equality, and building resilience to climate impacts.</p>

<p>Capacity building will be undertaken with these project proponents so that they can meaningfully engage with financial experts.</p>

<p>A 3-day workshop will then be held to connect project proponents with potential local investors and policymakers. The key objectives of this workshop are both to secure financing for projects, and to identify measures that could reduce the blockages that prevent the mobilisation of climate finance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> London event</h3>

<p>Following the in-country event, country delegations from up to 3 <abbr title="Climate Finance Accelerator">CFA</abbr> countries at a time, including project proponents and government representatives, will engage with finance professionals from the City of London at a 4-5 day workshop. They will work on the set of low carbon project proposals with the aim of making them commercially viable. This also provides an opportunity to identify measures that could improve the enabling environment for the mobilisation of climate finance in respective countries.</p>

<p>The London workshop is intended to share the world-leading expertise of the City of London and expose participants to the requirements and priorities of international capital markets. The workshop will also help London-based institutions to recognise investment opportunities in participant countries, which may be new markets for them.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> In-country <abbr title="Climate Finance Accelerator">CFA</abbr> process</h3>

<p>This stage will develop an ongoing, locally embedded, <abbr title="Climate Finance Accelerator">CFA</abbr> process to facilitate the continued identification and development of low carbon projects and bring them forward for consideration by potential finance providers.</p>

<p>Recommendations will also be made for policy and regulatory changes that could help unlock greater flows of finance. The ongoing process will be country-driven, determined by the nature of the climate finance landscape in each country and will take different forms depending on demand. In all cases, the intention will be to create a business plan for the ongoing process that will allow it to continue to operate once <abbr title="Climate Finance Accelerator">CFA</abbr> programme support has ceased.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Climate Finance Accelerator">CFA</abbr>  conference and capacity building materials</h3>

<p>At the end of the <abbr title="Climate Finance Accelerator">CFA</abbr> process, a <abbr title="Climate Finance Accelerator">CFA</abbr> conference will be organised, bringing together participants across the 8 countries to present their programme achievements and reflect on lessons learnt.</p>

<p>Knowledge products will be developed and disseminated throughout the programme, to help deliver the activities and capture lessons learnt. These will include materials that should be useful to project developers and governments globally.</p>
