<p>Dear primary care teams,</p>

<p>I am writing to you to give my sincere thanks for all the work you have done, and continue to do, on the COVID-19 vaccination programme.</p>

<p>Primary care teams are at the heart of our nation’s pandemic response, and I am grateful for the tremendous efforts primary care has made over the past year to deliver a world-leading vaccination programme under the strains and pressures of a global pandemic.</p>

<p>I want to personally thank all the staff in primary care for the way you have stepped up to this enormous challenge to protect our nation. You have worked tirelessly to vaccinate our most vulnerable, including those in care homes, whilst maintaining essential services for patients that need your care.</p>

<p>Delivering the vital protection our country needs through an expanded vaccination programme, including over the Christmas period, undoubtedly presents a significant challenge, but one I am confident the NHS will meet. In recognition of the role primary care teams will play in this, the NHS has set out a series of measures to support local vaccination services including additional financial support.</p>

<p>Your continued care for your patients is outstanding and I want to thank you again for your ongoing support in delivering this expanded vaccination programme, which will allow us to move out of this pandemic. It is the best way to protect people and save tens of thousands of lives.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>Sajid Javid.</p>
