<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This guidance relates to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/follower-notices-and-accelerated-payments--2">follower notices and accelerated payments</a>. It supports the measures set out in the Finance Act (<abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr>) 2014 (Part 4) and the National Insurance Contributions Act (<abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr>) 2015 (sections 4 and Schedule 2) (<abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015).</p>

<p>Where this guidance refers to an accelerated payment, it also means an accelerated partner payment, and where it refers to an accelerated payment notice, it also means a partner payment notice — except where specifically mentioned.</p>

<p>Finance Act 2015 extends the scope of Finance Act 2014 (Part 4) to situations involving a loss or other amount which has been claimed or surrendered as group relief.</p>

<h3>Changing the economics of avoidance</h3>

<p>The government set out in its consultations ‘Raising the Stakes on Tax Avoidance’ (August 2013) and ‘Tackling Marketed Tax Avoidance’ (January 2014), its aims to change the economics of entering into tax avoidance schemes and to change the behaviours of people and promoters in relation to tax avoidance.</p>

<p>Following that consultation process, the measures on follower notices and accelerated payments were introduced by legislation enacted in <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014 and <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015. The objective of the legislation is to ensure that tax in dispute in relation to the use of an avoidance scheme sits with the Exchequer during a dispute.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1 Follower </span> notices (FA2014, Part 4, Chapter 2)</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Background</h3>

<h4>1.1.1 Little incentive to follow</h4>

<p>When faced with a large number of very similar cases, it is often most efficient for HMRC to investigate ‘representative cases’, taking those cases to litigation, if necessary.</p>

<p>If HMRC is successful in that litigation, unpaid tax or National Insurance contributions is recovered in those cases. However, there has been little incentive for others using the same or essentially similar arrangements (known as ‘followers’) to accept the court’s findings, and pay any underpaid tax or National Insurance contributions to HMRC.</p>

<h4>1.1.2 Drive to accelerate litigation</h4>

<p>The follower notice rules are designed to improve the rate at which avoidance cases are resolved where the point at issue has, in HMRC’s view, already been decided in another person’s case.</p>

<p>When a judicial ruling is made by the court or tribunal that potentially resolves a large number of cases, many ‘followers’ agree to settle, but some do not. They argue that small differences in the arrangements mean that the decision does not apply to them. This leads to further litigation, adding months or years to the time taken to resolve their dispute.</p>

<p>A person who is a ‘follower’ will now be given a follower notice. If they do not settle their dispute (known as ‘taking corrective action’), they will be at risk of a penalty.</p>

<h4>1.1.3 Tax or National Insurance contributions  in dispute to be paid to HMRC</h4>

<p>Alongside the ‘follower’ rules are the accelerated payment rules, which require recipients of an accelerated payment notice to pay the disputed tax or National Insurance contributions  to HMRC. So, if a person is given a follower notice and an accelerated payment notice and decides not to settle their dispute as requested by the follower notice, they will be required to pay the disputed tax or National Insurance contributions  to HMRC under the accelerated payment rules.</p>

<p>Accelerated payments will also apply to avoidance arrangements which are within the Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes (<abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr>) rules or are given with a counteraction notice under the General Anti-Abuse Rule (<abbr title="General Anti-Abuse Rule">GAAR</abbr>). See Section 2 of this guidance ‘Accelerated payments’.</p>

<h4>1.1.4 Part 4 Finance Act 2014 and National Insurance Contributions Act 2015</h4>

<p>The legislation introducing these rules was announced in the 2014 budget and enacted in Part 4 of the Finance Act 2014 (<abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014). Part 4 was applied to National Insurance contributions  with effect from 12 April 2015 by the National Insurance Contributions Act 2015 (<abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015).</p>

<h4>1.1.5 The National Insurance Contributions Act 2015 (<abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015)</h4>

<h4>Class 4 and Class 2 collected through Self Assessment</h4>

<p>Class 4 National Insurance contributions  are assessed and collected along with income tax via the Self Assessment regime. These contributions are also subject to the Self Assessment enquiry regime. Section 16 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (<abbr title="Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992">SSCBA</abbr>) has been amended by <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015 so that Part 4 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014 applies to Class 4 National Insurance contributions, with necessary modifications (section 4(3) and Part 3 of Schedule 2 to <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015).</p>

<p>From the tax year 6 April 2015 to 5 April 2016, most Class 2 National Insurance contributions  will also be assessed and collected through Self Assessment, and subject to its enquiry regime. New section 11A of <abbr title="Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992">SSCBA</abbr> (and equivalent legislation for Northern Ireland), introduced by <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015, ensures that Part 4 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014 applies to Class 2 National Insurance contributions, with necessary modifications (section 2 and Schedule 1 <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015).</p>

<p>Where this guidance deals with how Part 4 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014 applies to tax, it includes Part 4 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014 as applied with necessary modifications to these classes of contributions collected through Self Assessment.</p>

<h4>Class 1, 1A, 1B National Insurance contributions  and Class 2 National Insurance contributions  not collected through Self Assessment</h4>

<p>For Class 1, 1A, 1B and Class 2 National Insurance contributions  that are not collectible through the Self Assessment system, <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015 gives effect to part 4 of <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014 and makes modifications to that part so that it applies to both tax and National Insurance contributions.</p>

<p>These classes of contributions are defined in <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015 as “relevant contributions” (paragraph 22 of Schedule 2).</p>

<p>Where this guidance deals with how Part 4 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014 is modified by Part 1 of Schedule 2 to <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015, it applies to relevant contributions (see annex 1 of this guidance for definitions).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Follower notices</h3>

<h4>1.2.1 Overview</h4>

<p>A follower notice can be given to a person who has used an avoidance scheme that has been shown in another person’s litigation to be ineffective. The follower notice tells the person that they may be liable to a penalty of up to 50% of the tax or National Insurance contributions  in dispute if they do not amend their return or settle their dispute.</p>

<p>A ‘person’ is as defined in Schedule 1 to the Interpretation Act 1978, and includes ‘a body of persons corporate or unincorporated’, as well as individuals.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> When a follower notice may be given</h3>

<p>HMRC may give a follower notice to a person if all of the conditions A to D are met.</p>

<h4>1.3.1 Condition A</h4>

<p>Condition A is met if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for tax, a tax enquiry is in progress into a return or a claim made by a person in relation to a relevant tax; or the person has made a tax appeal in relation to a relevant tax, but the appeal has not been determined by the tribunal or court, or abandoned or otherwise disposed of (‘tax’ includes Class 4 National Insurance contributions) — it also includes Class 2 National Insurance contributions for the tax year 6 April 2015 to 5 April 2016 and later years</li>
  <li>for National Insurance contributions, a relevant contribution dispute is in progress (see section 1.4 and annex 1 of this guidance); or a person has made a National Insurance contributions appeal in relation to a relevant contribution, but the appeal has not been determined by the tribunal or court, or abandoned or otherwise disposed of</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an important step in the process. It means that HMRC cannot issue a follower notice unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for tax, one of the following applies<br>
— an enquiry has been opened into a return<br>
— an appeal has been made against a closure notice, assessment, or determination, (for example, a determination under regulation 80 of the Income Tax (Pay As You Earn) Regulations 2003)</li>
  <li>for National Insurance contributions, one of the following applies<br>
— a relevant contributions dispute is in progress (see section 1.4 and annex 1 of this guidance)<br>
— an appeal has been made against a National Insurance contributions decision (annex 1 of this guidance gives a definition of a National Insurance contributions decision and a National Insurance contributions appeal)</li>
</ul>

<p>The person should, therefore, already be aware that their tax or National Insurance contributions arrangements are being challenged.</p>

<h4>1.3.2 Condition B (for tax)</h4>

<p>Condition B is met for tax if the return, claim or appeal is made on the basis that a particular tax advantage (‘asserted advantage’) results from particular tax arrangements (‘chosen arrangements’). ‘Tax’ includes Class 4 National Insurance contributions. It also includes Class 2 National Insurance contributions for the tax year 6 April 2015 to 5 April 2016 and later years.</p>

<p>The term ‘tax arrangements’ is defined as arrangements where it is reasonable to conclude that the obtaining of a tax advantage is the main, or one of the main, purposes of the arrangements. For example a person has claimed a loss of £100,000, based on a set of transactions where one of the main purposes of the transactions was to generate that loss — rather than for them to participate in a commercial operation.</p>

<h4>1.3.3 Condition B (for National Insurance contributions)</h4>

<p>Condition B is met for National Insurance contributions  if the appeal is made on the basis that a particular National Insurance contributions  advantage (‘asserted advantage’) results from particular National Insurance contributions  arrangements (‘chosen arrangements’). Condition B is also met if, in a relevant contributions dispute (see section 1.4 and annex 1 of this guidance for definition), a person disputes liability for relevant contributions on that same basis, regardless of whether the person notified HMRC of the dispute on that basis.</p>

<p>The modifications ensure that “tax arrangements” includes “National Insurance contributions arrangements”. That is, arrangements where it is reasonable to conclude that the obtaining of a National Insurance contributions  advantage is the main, or one of the main, purposes of the arrangements.</p>

<h4>1.3.4 Condition C</h4>

<p>Condition C is met if HMRC is of the opinion that there is a judicial ruling which is relevant to the chosen arrangements.</p>

<h4>1.3.5 Condition D (for tax)</h4>

<p>Condition D is met for tax if no previous follower notice has been given to the same person, by reference to the same tax advantage, tax arrangements, judicial ruling and tax period; unless the previous notice has been withdrawn.</p>

<h4>1.3.6 Condition D (for National Insurance contributions)</h4>

<p>Condition D is met for National Insurance contributions  if no previous follower notice has been given to the same person, by reference to the same National Insurance contributions  advantage, National Insurance contributions  arrangements, judicial ruling and tax period; unless the previous notice has been withdrawn.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span> Relevant contributions dispute (Paragraph 6 of Schedule 2 to the <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015)</h3>

<h4>1.4.1 Giving follower notices for National Insurance contributions</h4>

<p>For tax, follower notices can only be given where there is either an open tax enquiry or an open appeal.</p>

<p>Whilst there is a National Insurance contributions  equivalent of an open appeal (against a National Insurance contributions  decision), there is no direct equivalent of a tax enquiry for National Insurance contributions. Because of this, the <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015 introduces the concept of a ‘relevant contributions dispute’ (annex 1 gives a definition). Creating this concept allows HMRC to give a follower notice in circumstances where there is a dispute about a National Insurance contributions liability, but before an appealable National Insurance contributions  decision has been issued.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span> Giving follower notices for tax and National Insurance contributions at different times</h3>

<p>There are time limits for issuing tax assessments and determinations but not for issuing National Insurance contributions  decisions.</p>

<p>Because of this, HMRC may issue tax assessments or determinations sooner than they issue National Insurance contributions  decisions in relation to the same avoidance scheme used. This could mean that a tax appeal may be in place before there is a relevant contributions dispute or an appeal against a National Insurance contributions  decision.</p>

<p>Where there is an appeal against a tax assessment or determination and HMRC considers that National Insurance contributions  are also due, they may give the person a follower notice for tax before they give the follower notice for National Insurance contributions. Once there is a relevant contributions dispute or National Insurance contributions  appeal, HMRC may then give the person a follower notice for National Insurance contributions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span> Judicial ruling</h3>

<h4>1.6.1 When a judicial ruling is relevant</h4>

<p>A judicial ruling is a ruling of a court or tribunal.</p>

<p>It is ‘relevant’ to the chosen arrangements if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it involves consideration of tax or National Insurance contributions  arrangements (sections 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 or annex 1)</li>
  <li>the principles laid down or reasoning given in the ruling would, if applied to the chosen arrangements, deny the asserted advantage or part of that advantage</li>
  <li>it is a final ruling</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.6.2 When the judicial ruling is final</h4>

<p>A judicial ruling is final if it is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a ruling of the Supreme Court</li>
  <li>a ruling of any other court or tribunal where<br>
— no appeal may be made against the ruling<br>
— if any appeal may be made against the ruling, the time limit has expired and no application was made or permission was refused<br>
— if permission to appeal has been granted, or was not required, no appeal has been made within the time limits<br>
— if an appeal was made, it was subsequently abandoned or disposed of before the appeal was determined</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.6.3 Ruling does not set a precedent</h4>

<p>It is important to note that a ruling can be final at any stage in the legal appeal process, including the First-tier Tribunal, if it is not appealed further. It does not, therefore, have to set a ‘precedent’ in the strictly legal sense that a judgment of a senior court of record (Upper Tribunal/High Court and above) would.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.7 </span> What is a relevant ruling</h3>

<h4>1.7.1 Intention of legislation</h4>

<p>The intention of the legislation is to tackle behaviour by those who use avoidance schemes; primarily schemes marketed to a large number of people. Those schemes can have small variations — for example, the avoidance may be based around a different type of asset in different variants, or may be set up slightly differently depending on whether an individual, company or partnership is involved.</p>

<p>This does not mean that follower notices will automatically be given to users of variants: each case will be considered by a senior HMRC panel (see section 1.19 of this guidance for more details about the governance process).</p>

<h4>Example 1:</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>A tax avoidance scheme designed to generate losses in relation to a specific trading asset is defeated in the Tribunal on the basis that, by the nature of the scheme and structure, there is not a genuine trade. The decision is a final ruling. There are 25 other users of this scheme, who all implemented identical (but for the amount of the loss claimed) transactions. It is anticipated that all 25 of those users would be ‘followers’ and could be given a follower notice if they chose not to settle in response to the Tribunal decision.
<br><br>
There are also 30 users of a very similar scheme, which differs only in the trading asset used. It is very likely that, subject to careful consideration of all the facts and circumstances, these 30 could also be given follower notices.
<br><br>
There are a further 20 users of a loss-generating scheme that uses a different structure; with different financing and a greater degree of participation and risk for the partners. HMRC’s primary argument may still be that there is not a genuine trade, but it becomes a much more finely balanced decision whether the first judicial ruling above could be treated as ‘relevant’ to this one, as the facts and context have now diverged to a greater extent.</p>
</div>

<h4>1.7.2 Principles and reasoning</h4>

<p>The legislation does not mean that a follower notice can, for example, be issued to any case involving a ‘trading or non-trading’ argument, solely because there has been a judicial ruling on that point. The reasoning and principles behind that ruling must be scrutinised to consider whether or not they can be applied to the potential ‘follower cases’. That is, the question that must be considered is: ‘the tribunal found that this person was not trading because…’. The reasoning that follows ‘because’ must then be examined in relation to the follower cases.</p>

<p>This will include considering carefully the context of the ruling and whether it is reasonable to apply the same reasoning to the context of the follower cases. It is not about extracting a wide general principle from a case and then applying that to other cases where the context and facts are substantially different.</p>

<p>If a later case was to significantly change the effect of the relevant judicial ruling, HMRC will reconsider whether any follower notices that have been given (and any associated accelerated payment notices) should still be maintained, withdrawn or modified.</p>

<h4>1.7.3 Marketed avoidance</h4>

<p>Although the legislation does not exclusively apply to widely marketed schemes, the definition of ‘relevant’ makes it much less likely that it will apply outside that context.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the legislation could apply to a judicial ruling which determines a case against one person, and there is only one or a small number of others that are potential followers. In these cases, facts would have been gathered about each potential follower to establish their similarity to the relevant judicial ruling, and whether the same principles or reasoning can apply to deny the tax or National Insurance contributions advantage.</p>

<p>The important point is to consider critically the principles or reasoning in the ruling to see if it can reasonably apply to the follower cases.</p>

<h4>1.7.4 Application to other cases</h4>

<p>To decide whether the principles or reasoning in a judicial ruling are applicable to other cases, it will be necessary to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure that the judicial ruling itself relates to tax or National Insurance contributions  arrangements, where there is a main tax or National Insurance contributions purpose</li>
  <li>identify the principles and reasoning in the judicial ruling</li>
  <li>evaluate the facts of the other cases with reference to the evidence currently held by HMRC</li>
  <li>consider any additional information; for example other judicial rulings in the same area of tax or National Insurance contributions</li>
  <li>apply the principles and reasoning in the judicial ruling to the facts of the other cases</li>
  <li>decide whether (and, if so, to what extent) the asserted tax or National Insurance contributions  advantage is denied as a consequence</li>
  <li>be of the opinion that there is no scope for a reasonable person to disagree that the earlier ruling denies the advantage</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.8 </span> What judicial rulings can be used to give follower notices</h3>

<p>Judicial rulings must be final before they can be considered to set down principles and reasoning to be applied to follower cases. ‘Final’ means that the case has either not been appealed further or has been decided by the Supreme Court. Thus a ruling can be final at First-tier Tribunal level if it is not appealed to the Upper Tribunal. See section 205(4) of <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014.</p>

<p>Before any follower notice is given in relation to a relevant judicial ruling, a senior HMRC governance panel will consider whether it is appropriate to apply the principles or reasoning established by the ruling. As explained below, the issue of a follower notice is also subject to time limits.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.9 </span> Normal time limits</h3>

<h4>1.9.1 Time limits (section 204(6) <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014)</h4>

<p>A follower notice must be given within 12 months, beginning with the later of the day:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on which the relevant judicial ruling is made (condition C)</li>
  <li>that the return or claim, or notification of dispute in relation to a relevant contribution dispute, was received by HMRC</li>
  <li>that the tax or National Insurance contributions appeal was made</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.10 </span> Content of a follower notice (section 206 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014)</h3>

<h4>1.10.1 Identify the judicial ruling</h4>

<p>The follower notice must identify the relevant judicial ruling and explain why it is relevant.</p>

<h4>1.10.2 Other content</h4>
<p>The follower notice must also explain how to make representations, the circumstances in which a penalty may be reduced for co-operation, and the maximum penalties that HMRC may charge if corrective action is not taken. It must also explain that the penalty can be reduced by the quality of co-operation received by HMRC from the person.</p>

<h4>1.10.3 Explain the consequences</h4>

<p>The follower notice does not require corrective action to be taken, but explains that, if the necessary corrective action is not taken, the person may be charged a penalty under section 208 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014. (See 1.12 and 1.15 below.)</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.11 </span> Representations</h3>

<h4>1.11.1 Grounds for representations</h4>

<p>The person can disagree with a follower notice by making representations to HMRC. Representations must be made in writing and can be on the basis that one or more of 3 circumstances applies. The circumstances are that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>condition A, B or D was not met (1.3 of this guidance)</li>
  <li>the judicial ruling is not one which is relevant to the arrangements (for example one that HMRC’s opinion under condition C is incorrect)</li>
  <li>the notice was not given within the time limit</li>
</ul>

<p>To enable HMRC to fully consider the matter and come to a conclusion, any representations made should give as much information as possible about the grounds on which they are made.</p>

<p>There is no right of appeal to the Tribunal against a follower notice.</p>

<h4>1.11.2 Time limit for representations</h4>

<p>Representations must be made in writing to HMRC within 90 days of the date the notice was given.</p>

<h4>1.11.3 HMRC response</h4>

<p>HMRC must consider the representations and either confirm the follower notice (with or without amending it) or withdraw the notice. HMRC must notify the person of their decision.</p>

<p>The representations will be considered by an independent HMRC officer who is unconnected with the team that issued the follower notice, and with the governance panel that decided the judicial ruling relied upon was relevant. Section 1.19.2 contains more information on governance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.12 </span> Corrective action</h3>

<h4>1.12.1 Where there is a tax enquiry or a tax or National Insurance contributions  appeal</h4>

<p>After a follower notice is given, a person has 90 days to take corrective action in respect of the denied advantage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where there is a tax enquiry, by amending their return or claim to counteract the denied advantage</li>
  <li>where there is a tax or National Insurance contributions appeal, by taking all necessary action to enter into a written agreement with HMRC to relinquish the denied advantage</li>
</ul>

<p>The person must also notify HMRC that they have taken corrective action, and tell them the amount of the denied advantage and, if different, the additional amount of tax or National Insurance contributions  due and payable.</p>

<h4>1.12.2 Where there is a relevant contributions dispute in progress</h4>

<p>Where a relevant contributions dispute is in progress (section 1.4 and annex 1 of this guidance gives a definition), a person has 90 days to take corrective action in respect of the denied advantage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where the denied advantage can be counteracted, by making a payment to HMRC, by making a payment to HMRC and notifying them that they have done so</li>
  <li>where the denied advantage cannot be counteracted, by making a payment to HMRC, by taking all necessary action to enter into a written agreement with HMRC for the purpose of counteracting the denied advantage</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.12.3 Confirmed notice</h4>

<p>Where representations have been made and the notice is confirmed (with or without amendment) the time limit to take corrective action is the later of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the date for taking corrective action that was shown in the follower notice</li>
  <li>30 days after the day on which the person is notified of HMRC’s decision following representations</li>
</ul>

<p>Section 208(8)(b)(ii) FA2014 allows 30 days beginning with the date that HMRC notifies the person of their decision. In practice, HMRC also allows additional time for postage.</p>

<h4>Example 2:</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>A person was given a follower notice on 1 September 2014 and makes representations to HMRC on 1 November 2014.
<br><br>
An independent HMRC officer considers the representations and confirms the follower notice on 10 December 2014.
<br><br>
The date for taking corrective action is the later of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>29 November 2014 (the date for taking corrective action that was shown in the follower notice)</li>
  <li>8 January 2015 (30 days after HMRC notifies their decision, plus extra time for postage)</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, the person has until 8 January 2015 to take the necessary corrective action.</p>
</div>

<h4>1.12.4 The person can choose how to proceed</h4>

<p>The person has a choice about how to proceed. The decision to settle or continue the dispute is entirely theirs, but they take that decision in the light of the penalty consequences if the dispute continues. The legislation does not in any way deny the person access to their full appeal rights to the courts and tribunals about the substantive liability (whether the tax or National Insurance contributions arrangements give the result which the person believed they did).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.13 </span> Open appeal — written agreement</h3>

<h4>1.13.1 Appeal in progress</h4>

<p>If the person chooses to settle or concede the dispute where there is an open appeal in progress, they are required to take all necessary steps to enter into a written agreement with HMRC to give up the advantage that their arrangements sought to obtain. A form will be issued for use in most cases and will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>acceptance that the judicial ruling is relevant to their arrangements</li>
  <li>agreement that the effect is that the tax or National Insurance contributions  advantage arising from the arrangements is denied</li>
  <li>agreement to withdraw the appeal in relation to the arrangements within 14 days of the agreement — if the appeal covers matters in addition to the tax or National Insurance contributions arrangements, then it only has to be withdrawn to the extent it relates to those arrangements</li>
  <li>confirmation that any additional tax or National Insurance contributions due as a result of giving up the tax or National Insurance contributions advantage will be (or has been) paid by the required date</li>
  <li>signature by the person or properly authorised person who can sign on behalf of the person (for example, a director)</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.13.2 Multiple grounds of appeal</h4>

<p>Where a person makes an appeal on multiple grounds, they must take all necessary steps to give up the tax advantage which the follower notice says must be counteracted. The person is not required to give up any grounds of appeal that relate to an alternative tax advantage, grounds of appeal which do not relate to a particular tax advantage.</p>

<p>Where there are multiple grounds of appeal in favour of the same tax advantage, they are not required to give up their grounds of appeal unless the follower notice says they must be counteracted.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.14 </span> Penalty — calculating the denied advantage (the penalty base)</h3>

<h4>1.14.1 Basis of penalty</h4>

<p>If corrective action is not taken by the deadline for taking it (which may have been extended if representations were made), the person will incur a penalty. The legislation sets out the basis for how the penalty will be calculated (sections 208 and 209 and Schedule 30 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014).</p>

<p>The amount of the penalty is calculated by reference to the ‘denied advantage’ (the penalty base). The denied advantage is defined as being the amount of the ‘asserted advantage’ which is denied when the principles or reasoning laid down in the relevant ruling are applied to this person’s circumstances. The ‘asserted advantage’ is the tax or National Insurance contributions  advantage which would result from the use of the particular scheme used, if it achieved its aim.</p>

<p>Therefore, if the asserted advantage is £10,000, and the principles and reasoning in the relevant ruling mean that none of that advantage can be claimed by the person, then the denied advantage is £10,000. The penalty will be calculated by reference to £10,000.</p>

<p>It will not always be the case that the denied advantage and the asserted advantage are the same amount. The principles or reasoning laid down in the relevant ruling may only remove part of the asserted advantage; or it may be that parts of the advantage resulting from a scheme are not disputed as they rely on an accepted relief or allowance.</p>

<p>The ‘denied advantage’ may be easy to calculate in some cases, and may apply to a single period or return. However, there will be cases which are more complicated to calculate — for example, deferred losses. This could mean that the penalty base may be a different amount to the amount of tax or National Insurance contributions  which is in dispute for a specific return.</p>

<h4>1.14.2 Schedule 30</h4>

<p>Schedule 30 to <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014 applies for calculating the value of the denied advantage for follower penalties.</p>

<h4>1.14.3 Value of denied advantage</h4>

<p>The value of the denied advantage is usually the additional amount due or payable in respect of the tax or National Insurance contributions that would be due following corrective action; that is the amount due if the avoidance scheme fails. However, this can be more complex where losses are involved, or where tax would have been deferred.</p>

<h4>1.14.4 Amounts to include</h4>

<p>The amount of the denied advantage includes any amount of tax or National Insurance contributions  that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the person has not yet paid</li>
  <li>has been repaid to the person by HMRC and is now no longer due to have been repaid</li>
  <li>was shown on the return or claim to be repayable and could have been repaid by HMRC, had the arrangements achieved the asserted advantage</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.14.5 Ignore group relief</h4>

<p>When the value of the denied advantage is calculated, group relief should be ignored, and also any relief under section 458 CTA 2010 (loans to participators: relief in respect of repayment), which is deferred under section 458(5).</p>

<h4>1.14.6 Losses</h4>

<p>For direct tax, the value of the denied advantage involving losses is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the additional tax that would be chargeable following corrective action (as regards the part of the denied advantage used to reduce the amount of tax)</li>
  <li>10% of the part of the loss not used (if any)</li>
</ul>

<p>If the denied advantage creates or increases a loss for a group of companies, group relief may be taken into account.</p>

<h4>Example 3:</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>A singleton (non-group) company</h4>

<p>Company A has profits of £20m and a created loss for the year of £30m.
<br><br>
Losses to carry forward are £10m.
<br><br>
The denied advantage is £5.2m ((losses used to reduce the amount of tax £20m x 21% = 4.2m) + (loss not used £10m x 10% = £1m))</p>
</div>

<h4>Example 4:</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>A group company</h4>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">—</th>
      <th scope="col">Company A</th>
      <th scope="col">Company B</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Profits £m</td>
      <td>20</td>
      <td>30</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Created loss £m</td>
      <td>(30)</td>
      <td>nil</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Group relief £m</td>
      <td>nil</td>
      <td>(10)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>PCTCT £m</td>
      <td>nil</td>
      <td>20</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The denied advantage is £6.3m (£30m x 21%).
<br><br>
This is comprised of £20m loss utilised in the year by Company A, plus £10m loss by group relief to Company B.</p>
</div>

<h4>1.14.7 Denied advantage is a loss that will not be used</h4>

<p>To the extent the denied advantage results in a loss, the value of the denied advantage is nil if there is no reasonable prospect of the loss being used to reduce a tax liability. ‘No reasonable prospect’ will have to be assessed on a case by case basis, taking all the relevant circumstances of the person into account.</p>

<h4>1.14.8 Denied advantage is a deferral of tax</h4>

<p>To the extent the denied advantage is a deferral of tax, the value of the denied advantage is one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>25% of the amount of the deferred tax for each year of the deferral</li>
  <li>25% per year of the deferred tax for each separate period of deferral of less than a year</li>
  <li>if less, 100% of the amount of the deferred tax</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example 5</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>A person engages in a tax avoidance scheme which defers tax of £100,000 due in 2010, so that they pay it over the following 5 years.
<br><br>
25% of the amount of deferred tax, multiplied by 5 for the number of years of deferral, equals 125% of the deferred tax.
<br><br>
As the maximum penalty base is 100%, the penalty will be charged on £100,000.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.15 </span> Penalties</h3>

<h4>1.15.1 Corrective action not taken – general</h4>

<p>If corrective action is not taken in respect of the denied advantage before the specified time, the person is liable to a penalty. However, it is important to note that the penalty is not due until it is assessed (section 211 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014).</p>

<h4>1.15.2 Corrective action not taken – open tax enquiry</h4>

<p>Where the penalty has arisen in the course of an open tax enquiry, HMRC will normally assess the penalty after the conclusion of the enquiry. For example, after the issue of a closure notice in direct tax cases. At that stage the figure of understated tax that forms the basis of the penalty will have been calculated for the purpose of the closure notice.</p>

<h4>1.15.3 Corrective action not taken – relevant contributions dispute in progress</h4>

<p>Where the follower notice was issued while a relevant contributions dispute was in progress (for definitions, see section 1.4 and annex 1 of this guidance), but no corrective action has been taken, HMRC will normally assess the penalty after the relevant contributions dispute has been completed, in one of the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HMRC issues a National Insurance contributions decision in relation to the person’s liability for the disputed National Insurance contributions</li>
  <li>the person accepts that National Insurance contributions are due and pays the disputed contributions in full</li>
  <li>HMRC and the person reach an agreement in writing as to the person’s liability for the disputed contribution and amounts of those agreements are paid</li>
</ul>

<p>The figure that forms the basis of the penalty will have been calculated for the purpose of issuing the National Insurance contributions decision or will be based on the contributions paid when the dispute is either conceded or settled.</p>

<h4>1.15.4 Corrective action not taken – open appeal</h4>

<p>In cases where the penalty has arisen when the tax or National Insurance contributions are under appeal, the penalty will normally be assessed before the amount of tax or National Insurance contributions is finally determined.</p>

<h4>1.15.5 Corrective action not taken – early assessment of penalty</h4>

<p>Neither of the situations in 1.15.2 or 1.15.3 prevents an earlier assessment of the penalty if the circumstances require, but the important requirement is that figures of tax or National Insurance contributions  are available to form the basis of the penalty and therefore earlier assessment is likely to happen only very exceptionally.</p>

<p>Where there has been an assessment of tax or National Insurance contributions which is under appeal, the amount of the assessment is already known, so a penalty may be assessed before the amount of tax or National Insurance contributions is finally determined.</p>

<h4>1.15.6 Rate of penalty</h4>

<p>The maximum penalty is 50% of the value of the denied advantage. The minimum rate, taking into account the full availability of reduction for co-operation, is 10%. The penalty rates are different for partnerships (section 1.18.7 gives more information).</p>

<h4>1.15.7 Reduction of penalty for co-operation</h4>

<p>Providing the penalty has not yet been assessed and the person has co-operated with HMRC in relation to the follower notice, then HMRC may reduce the penalty to reflect the quality of that co-operation.</p>

<h4>1.15.8 Co-operation considered</h4>

<p>A person is only considered to have co-operated with HMRC in relation to the follower notice if they have co-operated in one or more of the following ways. By having:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provided reasonable assistance to HMRC in quantifying the advantage</li>
  <li>counteracted the denied advantage (but at a time after the specified time for corrective action)</li>
  <li>provided HMRC with information enabling HMRC to take corrective action</li>
  <li>provided HMRC with information enabling HMRC to enter into an agreement with them (to counteract the denied advantage)</li>
  <li>allowed HMRC to access tax records to ensure the denied advantage is counteracted</li>
</ul>

<p>The penalty must not be reduced to less than 10% of the value of the denied advantage.</p>

<h4>1.15.9 Part of advantage remaining</h4>

<p>The penalty will be calculated on the remainder of the denied advantage only, if before the specified time for corrective action in the follower notice, the person does one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>amends a return or claim to counteract part of the denied advantage</li>
  <li>pays the tax or National Insurance contributions  that HMRC considers are due for payment, and notifies HMRC they have done so (where the denied advantage can be counteracted by making a payment to HMRC</li>
  <li>takes all necessary action to enter into an agreement with HMRC to relinquish part of the denied advantage</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example 6:</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>A person has been given a follower notice in relation to a complex scheme which depends on a number of transactions to produce a cumulative tax advantage. 
<br><br>
Having reconsidered the scheme, the person accepts that a part of it does not achieve the intended tax advantage, so amends their return only to the extent of that part. 
<br><br>
They continue to maintain the success of the remaining parts of the scheme.
<br><br>
The amendment to the return was before the due date of the notice.
<br><br>
Any penalty is only calculated on the tax advantage which is still being claimed as at the due date. Thus the penalty base will be reduced from the original amount for the scheme to the amended amount still on the return or in any appeal.</p>
</div>

<h4>1.15.10 Amount of reduction available for co-operation</h4>
<p>The legislation does not specify what amounts are available for the different types of co-operation. HMRC have developed guidance for the amount of reduction available based on what they consider will support the purpose of the legislation. The amount of reductions available, shown below, are not binding on HMRC and may change over time as HMRC’s policy changes.
Where a type of co-operation is relevant to the follower notice, but the person does not need to do anything, HMRC will give the maximum reduction available for that type.</p>

<h4>1.15.11 Reductions available where there is an open appeal</h4>
<p>The table below sets out the maximum reductions HMRC have can give to each type of co-operation shown at 1.15.8 where the follower notice was given for an open tax appeal (an appeal case).</p>

<h4>1.15.13 Reduction for taking corrective action late</h4>
<p>A person can help reduce the amount of penalty HMRC may charge if they take corrective action before HMRC issues the ‘notice of penalty assessment’.</p>

<p>The amount the penalty can be reduced by decreases based on how late the person takes corrective action. It assumes that the nature and extent of corrective action have been met in full.</p>

<p>If the nature and extent of corrective action have not been met in full, then the reduction available will be reduced to reflect this.</p>

<h4>1.15.14 Calculating the penalty</h4>

<p>Stage 1: Identifying the penalty range</p>

<p>The penalty range is the difference between the maximum and minimum penalty percentages that HMRC can charge. The maximum is 50% of the denied advantage and the minimum is 10% of the denied advantage. This gives a penalty range of 40 (50% minus 10%).</p>

<p>Stage 2: Working out the reduction to the penalty range for the quality of co-operation</p>

<p>The term ‘quality of co-operation’ describes the level of co-operation given. The penalty range of 40 can be reduced by anything up to 100% for the quality of co-operation.</p>

<p>Stage 3: Reducing the maximum penalty percentage</p>

<p>Once HMRC has worked out the reduction for the quality of co-operation based on the type of co-operation shown at 1.15.8, they apply this to the penalty range.</p>

<p>Stage 4: Working out the penalty percentage rate</p>

<p>To work out the penalty percentage rate, HMRC will deduct the figure established at stage 3 from the maximum penalty percentage. The example below shows the 4 stages.</p>

<h4>Example 7</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>A follower notice was given in an appeal case and the person took corrective action 16 weeks late.</p>

<p>They did not need to help HMRC in quantifying the advantage (type a). This is because HMRC’s assessment specified the amount of the advantage, and the person gave HMRC the information required. Because the person did not need to do anything for this co-operation type a, HMRC give the full reduction of 20%.</p>

<p>The person was 16 weeks late in taking corrective action so HMRC give a reduction of 25% as set out in the table at 1.15.13.</p>

<p>The person allowed HMRC access to information allowing them to enter into an agreement to counteract the denied advantage (co-operation type d), so HMRC give the full reduction of 10%.</p>

<p>Applying the 4 stages set out above:</p>

<p>Stage 1: The penalty range is 40.</p>

<p>Stage 2: The reduction for co-operation is 40%.</p>

<p>Stage 3: Apply the reduction for co-operation to the penalty range. This gives the penalty reduction of 16%, which is 40% of 40.</p>

<p>Stage 4: Deduct the penalty reduction of 16% from the maximum penalty of 50%. This gives a penalty of 34%.</p>

<p>In this case, the follower notice penalty for taking corrective action late is 34% of the denied advantage.</p>
</div>

<h4>1.15.15 Assessment of the penalty</h4>

<p>HMRC must notify the person who is liable for the penalty and state the tax period in respect of which the penalty is due.</p>

<h4>1.15.16 Penalty due date</h4>

<p>The penalty is due and payable 30 days after the person is notified of it.</p>

<h4>1.15.17 Notification</h4>

<p>The date by which HMRC must notify the penalty:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the follower notice was issued whilst an enquiry was open or a relevant contributions dispute was in progress, is no later than 90 days after the enquiry or relevant contributions dispute is completed (paragraph 1.15.3)</li>
  <li>if the follower notice was issued whilst an appeal is pending, is no later than 90 days beginning with the earliest of the day on which<br>
— the person takes corrective action<br>
— a final ruling is made on the tax or National Insurance contributions  appeal<br>
— the appeal, or any further appeal is abandoned or disposed of (to the extent it relates to the asserted tax or National Insurance contributions advantage) before it is determined by the court or tribunal</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example 8a:</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>HMRC completes the compliance check into a person’s use of an avoidance scheme and issues a closure notice.
<br><br>
If the person has been given a follower notice and not taken the corrective action by the due date, then they are liable to a penalty. Having now concluded the check and issued the closure notice, HMRC must issue any penalty assessment within 90 days.
<br><br>
Any such penalty assessment will take into account the degree of co-operation provided by the person.</p>
</div>

<h4>Example 8b:</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>In a situation with an open appeal where a follower notice has been given, the person has not taken corrective action within the time limits; there are 3 potential time limits:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The person decides to take the corrective action and withdraw the appeal and accept that the relevant ruling applies. HMRC must assess any penalty within 90 days of the date that corrective action is taken.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The case has gone to the Court of Appeal, for example, and the person loses and does not appeal further. HMRC must assess any penalty within 90 days of the date the ruling was made.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The person decides to abandon their appeal and concede. HMRC has 90 days from the date that the case is formally acknowledged as abandoned by the court to assess any penalty.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
</div>

<h4>1.15.18 Enforceable penalty — tax follower notice (section 211(4) <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014)</h4>

<p>The penalty due for not complying with a follower notice relating to tax (not National Insurance contributions) is treated in the same way as an assessment to tax and therefore will be enforced as if it were an assessment to tax. Section 1.16.2 of this guidance gives details about interest charged on a penalty.</p>

<h4>1.15.19 Enforceable penalty — National Insurance contributions  follower notice (paragraph 20 Schedule 2 <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015)</h4>

<p>The penalty due for not complying with a National Insurance contributions  follower notice is recovered in the same way as unpaid relevant contributions (annex 1 gives a definition). It is not treated in the same way as an assessment to tax.</p>

<p>For the purposes of a Court determining whether civil proceedings can be adjourned; the penalty assessment is treated as if it were a National Insurance contributions  decision as to whether the person was liable for the penalty. The effect is that if there is an appeal against the penalty assessment, the Court must adjourn any civil proceedings taken to recover the penalty until the appeal is finally determined.</p>

<h4>1.15.20 Supplementary penalty assessment (section 213 FA2014)</h4>

<p>A supplementary penalty assessment may be issued if the value of the denied advantage was understated. In a case where the advantage was overstated, and a penalty has already been paid, the excess penalty will be repaid with interest.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.16 </span> Appeal against a penalty</h3>

<h4>1.16.1 Penalty appeals (section 214 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014)</h4>

<p>A person may appeal against a decision that a penalty is payable and against the amount of the penalty. The appeal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>must be made within 30 days of the day the penalty was notified — the penalty is treated as notified when the penalty notice is delivered to the person</li>
  <li>is treated in the same way as an appeal against an assessment of the tax or National Insurance contributions  decision is concerned, whether the penalty was assessed on tax or National Insurance contributions (but see section 1.15.14 which gives information about adjourning civil proceedings to recover the penalty where there is an appeal against a National Insurance contributions decision)</li>
</ul>

<p>The grounds for an appeal can, in particular, include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the same grounds as for making representations</li>
  <li>that it was reasonable in all the circumstances for the person not to have taken the corrective action</li>
</ul>

<p>If the tribunal upholds the appeal against the penalty on the grounds that conditions A, B, C or D (section 1.3 of this guidance) were not satisfied, this would result in the follower notice being cancelled, together with any associated accelerated payment notice if that latter notice was only issued because of the follower notice. If required, HMRC will then, as appropriate, repay any amounts, plus interest, to the person.</p>

<p>If the tribunal upholds the appeal against the penalty solely on the grounds that it was reasonable for the person to proceed, this outcome does not overturn the follower notice itself.</p>

<h4>1.16.2 Interest due on penalty</h4>

<p>A person is not required to pay a penalty before an appeal against the assessment of the penalty is determined. However, interest, where appropriate, runs from the original due and payable date of the penalty.</p>

<h4>1.16.3 Appeal against a penalty</h4>

<p>The legislation gives the tribunal the power to affirm or cancel HMRC’s decision, or to substitute an alternative decision.</p>

<p>This is fairly broadly drawn. Section 214 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014 sets out some grounds on which the tribunal can consider and uphold an appeal, but these grounds are not intended to be exhaustive.</p>

<p>It means that the tribunal could, for example, discharge the penalty because the tribunal does not agree that the decision cited by HMRC as the basis for a follower notice was ‘relevant’, even though HMRC was ultimately successful in the substantive litigation. The relevance or otherwise may only have emerged during the tribunal’s consideration of the substantive appeal.</p>

<h4>1.16.4 Person is successful in substantive litigation</h4>

<p>Where the person is successful in the substantive litigation, the penalty will be discharged as it is a tax-geared penalty and there will be no disputed tax to form the basis of the penalty. It should not normally be necessary for the penalty appeal to be heard by the tribunal in such instances.</p>

<p>Whilst the penalty does not have to be paid pending litigation, a person may pay it to prevent interest accruing on it. Any amount of penalty already paid will be repaid with interest in those circumstances. In addition, tax may be repayable, together with interest, to the person.</p>

<h4>1.16.5 Reasonable in all the circumstances</h4>

<p>The purpose of a follower notice is to discourage a person from pursuing their dispute in avoidance cases once their scheme has been shown, in another person’s litigation, to be ineffective. When a person is given a follower notice, they are told that they can carry on with their dispute, but they will risk facing a financial penalty if they do not succeed with it.</p>

<p>To avoid a penalty, it is not enough for the person to simply believe they might be right. Where a person decides not to take corrective action, it must be reasonable, in light of all the circumstances, for them not to do so.</p>

<p>Whether a person’s actions are ‘reasonable in all the circumstances’, depends on the facts of the matter and the legislative context. An action which, when viewed in context, frustrates the purpose of the legislation, is unlikely to be viewed as reasonable in all the circumstances.</p>

<p>It is not enough for a person to simply decide to wait and see what the results of the litigation are, and not take corrective action in the meantime. Any decision not to take corrective action should be a properly informed and reasonable choice.</p>

<p>When HMRC consider the ‘facts of the matter’, this will include the person’s individual circumstances and any factors they have, or should have, taken into account in deciding whether to take corrective action.</p>

<p>There are 2 examples below, where a person has decided not to take corrective action. These are for illustrative purposes of what may be considered reasonable in all the circumstances. Each case is decided on its own merits, based on the facts of each individual’s case.</p>

<h4>Example 9a</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Person A receives a follower notice and is told by the scheme promoter that they should not take corrective action. The promoter does not provide a full explanation as to why this is the case.</p>

<p>Person A is charged a penalty for not having taken corrective action. They appeal and tell HMRC that the promoter told them not to take corrective action.</p>

<p>HMRC do not accept that it was reasonable in all the circumstances to rely on the promoter’s suggestion and not take corrective action.</p>

<p>HMRC reject the appeal and the penalty is upheld.</p>

<p>Person A may take their appeal to the independent tribunal.</p>
</div>

<h4>Example 9b</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Person B receives a follower notice and takes advice from an independent tax professional. The tax professional tells them that there is a fundamental flaw in HMRC’s reasoning which means the relevant judicial ruling would not apply to the specific circumstances of their use of tax arrangements. They provide a full explanation as to why this is the case.</p>

<p>Person B is charged a penalty and they appeal against it. They provide HMRC with the independent advice they received and explain why they chose not to take corrective action.</p>

<p>HMRC accept that, based on the personal knowledge and belief of person B, it was reasonable in all the circumstances to rely on the independent advice in coming to a decision not to take corrective action.
HMRC uphold the appeal and withdraw the penalty.</p>

<p>It may not be reasonable for a person to rely on advice from the promoter of a scheme or one of their associates. This is especially the case where the opinion given does not explain why the relevant judicial ruling would not apply or is not based on an analysis of the person’s individual circumstances.</p>

<p>When HMRC are deciding whether it was reasonable in all circumstances for a person not to take corrective action, it will help them if the person gives them copies of the advice or correspondence which formed the basis of their decision. The advice or correspondence would need to relate to the decision made at the time corrective action should have been taken.</p>
</div>

<h4>1.16.6 Reasonable in all the circumstances and reasonable excuse</h4>

<p>It may be reasonable in all the circumstances for a person not to have taken corrective action where (both of the following apply):</p>

<ul>
  <li>their failure to take corrective action was not deliberate</li>
  <li>they have a reasonable excuse for the failure to take corrective action</li>
</ul>

<p>In certain circumstances, the legislation defines what reasonable excuse may include. Find more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-appeals/reasonable-excuses">reasonable excuse</a>.</p>

<h4>1.16.7 Aggregate Penalties (section 212 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014)</h4>

<p>The penalty for failure to take corrective action after receipt of a follower notice is based on the ‘denied advantage’ (being the amount of the tax or National Insurance contributions  advantage that the person has tried to obtain that is actually denied by the application of the relevant judicial principle or reasoning).</p>

<p>The person may also become liable to a penalty under other legislation, for example on the grounds that their return was incorrect because of deliberate action on their part.</p>

<p>The follower notice penalties legislation is restricted so that the total penalties in relation to the same tax or National Insurance contributions liability do not, in aggregate, exceed the maximum of certain of these other penalties.</p>

<p>The aggregate penalty amounts charged must not exceed the ‘relevant percentage’, if 2 or more penalties are determined by reference to the same amount of tax or National Insurance contributions and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>one is for failure to comply with a follower notice</li>
  <li>one or more are incurred under<br>
— Schedule 24 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2007 — penalties for errors<br>
— Schedule 41 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2008 — penalties for failure to notify<br>
— Schedule 55 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2009 — penalties for failure to make returns</li>
</ul>

<p>The relevant percentage will usually be the maximum percentage chargeable under the other penalty if that exceeds 100%. In other cases, the maximum aggregated penalty will be 100%.</p>

<h4>1.16.8 Aggregate penalties – National Insurance contributions  (section 212 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014 and paragraphs 14 and 15 Schedule 2 NIC Act 2015)</h4>

<p>The modifications made by <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015 ensure that the penalties to be taken into account for the purposes of section 212 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014 include those incurred for failure to make a Class 1 National Insurance contributions  return under:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Schedule 55 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2009, as applied by paragraph 21G of Schedule 4 to the Social Security (Contributions) Regulations 2001 with effect from 6 October 2014</li>
  <li>section 98A <abbr title="Taxes Management Act">TMA</abbr> 1970, as applied by paragraph 22(7) of Schedule 4 to the Social Security (Contributions) Regulations 2001 for tax years up to and including 6 April 2013 to 5 April 2014</li>
</ul>

<p>When considering the total of the aggregate penalties as described in section 1.16.6 of this guidance, if one or more of penalties are incurred under section 98A <abbr title="Taxes Management Act">TMA</abbr> 1970, the aggregate amounts charged must not exceed the ‘relevant percentage’ described in section 1.16.6 of this guidance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.17 </span> Late appeals against a final judicial ruling (section 216 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014)</h3>

<h4>1.17.1 Late appeals</h4>

<p>It may be the case that HMRC has given follower notices based on a tribunal or court decision that had not initially been appealed within the time limit, and had therefore become ‘final’ for this purpose. Where a person subsequently applied for and obtained leave to make a late appeal, (section 49 <abbr title="Taxes Management Act">TMA</abbr> 1970 and regulation 9 of the Social Security Contributions (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999) the process for follower notices is suspended while the late appeal into that decision is heard.</p>

<h4>1.17.2 Penalty not due</h4>

<p>This means that any penalty assessed will not be due and payable during this time, and any accelerated payment will not be due for payment if the payment notice is based solely on the follower notice requirement of condition C (sections 1.3.4 and 2.2.6 of this guidance). If the late appeal is determined in favour of the person, any follower notice given on the basis of that decision will be discharged and any penalties paid or accelerated payments made as a result of that notice repaid with interest.</p>

<h4>1.17.3 Leave to appeal out of time granted</h4>

<p>This applies where the final judicial ruling is the subject of an appeal where the court or tribunal has granted leave to appeal out of time.</p>

<p>If a follower notice has been given identifying the original ruling (now subject to a late appeal), HMRC must notify the recipient of the notice as soon as practicable.</p>

<h4>1.17.4 Follower notice suspended</h4>

<p>If a follower notice has been given identifying the original ruling (now subject to a late appeal), HMRC must notify the person as soon as practicable.</p>

<p>The follower notice is suspended until HMRC notifies the person that either the appeal has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>resulted in a judicial ruling which is a final ruling</li>
  <li>been abandoned or otherwise disposed of</li>
</ul>

<p>If the new final ruling is not a judicial ruling which is relevant to the chosen arrangements then the follower notice ceases to have effect.</p>

<h4>1.17.5 Notice remains effective</h4>

<p>In any other case where leave to appeal is not granted, and HMRC are successful and the principles and reasoning previously identified are still relevant, the follower notice continues to have effect after the end of the period of suspension. It is treated as if it were in respect of the new final ruling resulting from the appeal.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.18 </span> Partnerships (Schedules 31 and 32 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014)</h3>

<h4>1.18.1 Overview</h4>

<p>Special rules for members of partnerships can be found in Schedules 31 and 32 to <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014. These rules essentially reflect the general tax treatment of partnerships. In summary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a partnership follower notice for a partnership tax arrangement will be given to the representative partner, or their successor in that capacity, on behalf of the partnership as a whole</li>
  <li>that follower notice can then apply to generate a partner payment notice to each member of the partnership individually</li>
  <li>the members can also be given a follower notice, accelerated payment notice, or both in respect of a scheme in their personal capacity, for example where a claim made personally relates to the tax affairs of the partnership but is not derived directly from the partnership return (for example, a personal loan interest claim)</li>
  <li>in those instances these will relate directly to their own tax return, which will include their share of the partnership profits and gains</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.18.2 Special rules for Stamp Duty Land Tax (<abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr>) and Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings (<abbr title="Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings">ATED</abbr>)</h4>

<p>Specific partnership rules apply for <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> and <abbr title="Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings">ATED</abbr> to reflect the particular treatment of partnerships in relation to those taxes.</p>

<h4>1.18.3 Partnership follower notice</h4>

<p>The follower notice for a partnership is called a partnership follower notice. It is not materially different to a follower notice in content or purpose, but is given to the representative partner rather than to all the partners. There is provision in the law to give the partnership follower notice to a successor of the representative partner where necessary.</p>

<p>These rules only apply to partnerships required to deliver a partnership return under rules in section 12AA <abbr title="Taxes Management Act">TMA</abbr> 1970.</p>

<p>Rules applicable to <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> and <abbr title="Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings">ATED</abbr> are set out in sections 230 and 231 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014 and guidance is at sections 3 and 4 of this guidance.</p>

<h4>1.18.4 Representative partner</h4>

<p>The representative partner is the person who is required to deliver the partnership return under section 12AA(2) or (3)<abbr title="Taxes Management Act">TMA</abbr> 1970. It is the responsibility of the representative partner to take the corrective action, if agreed to by the partners, in response to the partnership follower notice.</p>

<h4>1.18.5 Partners are responsible for penalties</h4>

<p>Whilst it is the representative partner’s responsibility to take the corrective action on behalf of the partnership, any follower notice penalty which arises will be the responsibility of all the partners to pay.</p>

<h4>1.18.6 Partnership denied advantage</h4>

<p>The calculation of the penalty is based on the denied advantage, which will be calculated by reference to the amount by which the partnership return would be amended to negate the effects of the relevant judicial ruling. Therefore, the denied advantage for a partnership is a profit/loss figure rather than being the tax or National Insurance contributions  advantage figure. This is why the corresponding penalty rates for partners are different to those for non-partners.</p>

<p>This gives the total penalty for the partnership as a whole, which needs to be apportioned across the partners by reference to their individual share in the partnership. Normally this would be by reference to their share in the profits or losses of the partnership.</p>

<h4>1.18.7 Maximum penalty rate for partnerships</h4>

<p>The rate of the penalty is modified by these rules from a maximum 50% to a maximum of 20% to be shared across the partners. Similarly the minimum amount of penalty, following any reduction for co-operation, is 4%.</p>

<h4>1.18.8 Penalty aggregation applies</h4>

<p>Penalty aggregation rules apply to partners as they would for non-partners.</p>

<h4>1.18.9 Representations</h4>

<p>Representations can be made by the representative partner if they disagree with the partnership follower notice.</p>

<h4>1.18.10 Partnership appeals</h4>

<p>Only the representative partner can appeal against the calculation of the total penalty and the fact of the penalty. The representative partner cannot appeal against the calculation of the share of the penalty for an individual partner.</p>

<h4>1.18.11 What if an individual partner wants to withdraw</h4>

<p>Only the representative partner (often known as the ‘nominated’ partner) can take the corrective action. Therefore, individual partners who would like to withdraw from the scheme transactions may still face a share of the follower penalty if the other partners do not agree to take the corrective action and instruct the representative partner to do so.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.19 </span> Governance</h3>

<h4>1.19.1 Selection of the follower cases</h4>

<p>Decisions over the giving of follower notices are taken by a senior HMRC panel, the Work Flow Governance Group. This panel considers the principles and reasoning established by final judicial rulings, the context within which those principles arose and how those principles apply in other situations.
The panel are independent from the teams who investigate cases. It considers both existing final cases which may be relevant, as well as new cases which will arise from time to time.</p>

<h4>1.19.2 Review of representations</h4>

<p>Representations made by a person about the giving of a notice are considered by an independent Appeals and Reviews Team. This team is not part of the investigating or case team or connected to the governance panel.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2 Accelerated </span> Payments</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Overview</h3>

<h4>2.1.1 Remove cash flow advantage</h4>

<p>There is no inherent presumption that tax or National Insurance contributions  in dispute should sit with the person, rather than the Exchequer. Under current rules, a person who can self assess the claimed tax or National Insurance contributions  advantage from an avoidance scheme can hold the money in dispute while the dispute is resolved. This can take a considerable time as these schemes are often highly complex and a considerable amount of information needs to be obtained from scheme users and advisers, and litigation may be required to resolve the dispute.</p>

<h4>2.1.2 Repayments can already be retained</h4>

<p>In certain circumstances, the disputed tax already rests with HMRC until the dispute is resolved. For example, where a person has to claim a repayment the Exchequer can retain the money while the dispute proceeds. The accelerated payment proposals bring the vast majority of remaining tax or National Insurance contributions  avoidance cases into line with this position.</p>

<h4>2.1.3 Legislation</h4>

<p>Legislation was announced in the Budget 2014 and enacted in Part 4 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014. The legislation was extended to National Insurance contributions with effect from 12 April 2015 by the National Insurance Contributions Act 2015.
Schedule 18 to <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2015 contains provision about the relationship between accelerated payments and group relief.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Conditions for an accelerated payment (section 219 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014)</h3>

<h4>2.2.1 Certain conditions must be satisfied</h4>

<p>Accelerated payment notices may be given to a person who has used an avoidance scheme and where one or more certain conditions are satisfied. Those conditions are that they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have been given a follower notice (section 1 of this guidance)</li>
  <li>have used a <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr> notifiable arrangement</li>
  <li>are subject to a <abbr title="General Anti-Abuse Rule">GAAR</abbr> counteraction notice</li>
</ul>

<p>The accelerated payment notice tells the person that they must pay the specified amount which equates to the tax or National Insurance contributions  in dispute as a result of their use of the avoidance scheme.</p>

<h4>2.2.2 When an accelerated payment notice may be given (section 219 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014)</h4>

<p>HMRC may give an accelerated payment notice to a person if all 3 conditions A to C are met.</p>

<h4>2.2.3 Condition A</h4>

<p>For tax, a tax enquiry is in progress into a return or claim made by a person in relation to a relevant tax; or a person has made a tax appeal in relation to a relevant tax, but the appeal has not been determined by the tribunal or court, or abandoned/disposed of.</p>

<p>For relevant National Insurance contributions, a relevant contributions dispute is in progress, (section 2.3 and annex 1 of this guidance); or a person has made a National Insurance contributions  appeal in relation to a relevant contribution, but the appeal has not been determined by the tribunal or court, or abandoned/disposed of.</p>

<p>This is an important step in the process. HMRC cannot give an accelerated payment notice unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>for tax<br>
— an enquiry has been opened into a return<br>
— an appeal has been made against a closure notice, assessment, or determination, (for example, a determination under regulation 80 of the Income Tax (Pay As You Earn) Regulations 2003)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for National Insurance contributions<br>
— a relevant contributions dispute is in progress (section 2.3 and annex 1 of this guidance)<br>
— an appeal has been made against a National Insurance contributions  decision (annex 1 gives a definition of National Insurance contributions decision and National Insurance contributions appeal)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The person should, therefore, already be aware that their tax or National Insurance contributions  arrangements are being challenged.</p>

<p>Once the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enquiry is opened (tax), or a relevant contributions dispute is in progress (National Insurance contributions) (section 2.3 and annex 1 of this guidance), and not closed</li>
  <li>appeal is made and not determined by the Tribunal or Court to which it is addressed, or otherwise settled</li>
</ul>

<p>there is no time limit within which HMRC must give an accelerated payment notice.</p>

<p>Where an enquiry is open or a relevant contributions dispute is in progress and the amounts of unpaid tax or National Insurance contributions  have not already been established, HMRC will take necessary steps to obtain information from the person or their advisers to enable an accurate figure to be established.</p>

<p>The amount due in the accelerated payment notice will normally be the amount included in the closure notice, determination, assessment or National Insurance contributions  decision.</p>

<h4>2.2.4 Condition B</h4>

<p>The return, claim or appeal is made on the basis that a particular tax or National Insurance contributions advantage (the asserted advantage) results from particular arrangements (the chosen arrangements). This includes an appeal against a section 8 decision (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/decision-and-appeals-for-national-insurance-contributions-and-statutory-payments/dansp12000">decisions and appeals for National Insurance contributions and Statutory Payments manual <abbr title="Decisions and Appeals for National Insurance Contributions and Statutory Payments">DANSP</abbr></a> for more information).</p>

<p>Condition B is also met if, in a relevant contributions dispute, a person (section 2.3 and annex 1 of this guidance) disputes liability for National Insurance contributions  on the basis that a particular National Insurance contributions  advantage (the asserted advantage) results from particular arrangements (the chosen arrangements), regardless of whether the person had originally notified the dispute as to the liability on that particular basis.</p>

<h4>2.2.5 Condition C</h4>

<p>There are 3 circumstances within condition C, any one or more of which is sufficient to allow the giving of an accelerated payment notice, provided that conditions A and B are also satisfied.</p>

<p>More than one of the following may be relevant and each must be specified in the accelerated payment notice if relevant:</p>

<h4>2.2.6 Condition C, requirement 1: Follower notice</h4>

<p>HMRC has given a follower notice (section 1 of this guidance) in relation to the same return, claim or appeal and by reason of the same tax or National Insurance contributions  advantage and chosen arrangements.</p>

<h4>2.2.7 Condition C, requirement 2: <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr>
</h4>

<p>The chosen arrangements are <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr> arrangements.</p>

<h4>2.2.8 Condition C, requirement 3: <abbr title="General Anti-Abuse Rule">GAAR</abbr>
</h4>

<p>A <abbr title="General Anti-Abuse Rule">GAAR</abbr> counteraction notice has been given in relation to the same tax or National Insurance contributions  advantage (or part of), in a case where the stated opinion of at least two of the members of the sub-panel of the <abbr title="General Anti-Abuse Rule">GAAR</abbr> Advisory Panel concluded that entering into the arrangements was not a reasonable course of action.</p>

<h4>2.2.9 The <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr> requirement</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr> requirement requires 2 conditions to be satisfied:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the arrangements have been given a <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr> scheme reference number (<abbr title="Scheme Reference Number">SRN</abbr>) under the <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr> legislation (section 311 of <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2004)</li>
  <li>the person has made a return asserting a tax or National Insurance contributions  advantage based on those arrangements</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the requirement for there to be an open enquiry, relevant contributions dispute in progress (section 2.3 and annex 1 of this guidance) or appeal must be met. HMRC cannot give an accelerated payment notice on the basis of the <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr> requirement when the disclosure is made, unless there is also an open enquiry, relevant contributions dispute in progress, or appeal at that point in time in relation to those disclosed arrangements.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that there must have been a disclosure that has given rise to an <abbr title="Scheme Reference Number">SRN</abbr>. HMRC cannot give an accelerated payment notice unless there has been a disclosure or HMRC has successfully taken action under Part 7 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2004 or equivalent National Insurance contributions legislation (the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/nimmanual/NIM58000.htm" rel="external">National Insurance Manual</a> gives more detail) to enforce a disclosure.</p>

<p>Only those <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr> SRNs which are published by HMRC on a list (to be updated from time to time) will be within the scope for receiving an accelerated payment notice (section 2.2.13 of this guidance).</p>

<h4>Example 10:</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>A person has gross income of £150,000 and claims a loss arising from an arrangement disclosed under DOTAS of £50,000. The person completes and submits a Self Assessment tax return on that basis, showing taxable income of £100,000 (subject to any other reliefs and allowances available). In this case, tax on £50,000 is the tax advantage referred to in the legislation.</p>
</div>

<p>If part of the relief claimed under the <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr> disclosed arrangement is not considered to arise from an avoidance scheme, the tax advantage for these purposes will exclude that part of the total amount.</p>

<h4>Example 11:</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Of the £50,000 referred to in example 8, £30,000 is considered to arise from a claim to relief in line with the relevant legislation and £20,000 is considered to arise from tax avoidance. In this case, tax on £20,000 is the tax advantage.</p>
</div>

<h4>2.2.10 Does a <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr> <abbr title="Scheme Reference Number">SRN</abbr> have to be notified by the person</h4>

<p>Where a person is obliged by the law to notify HMRC of the <abbr title="Scheme Reference Number">SRN</abbr>, but fails to do so, the legislation still applies providing the two criteria are satisfied (section 2.2.9 of this guidance).</p>

<h4>2.2.11 Not in possession of a <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr> number</h4>

<p>It is not open to a person to object to an accelerated payment notice simply on the grounds that they have not been given the <abbr title="Scheme Reference Number">SRN</abbr> by whoever was required to do so by the <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr> legislation. The legislation simply requires that the person’s return has been made on the basis of a tax or National Insurance contributions  advantage arising from arrangements that have been given a <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr> <abbr title="Scheme Reference Number">SRN</abbr>.</p>

<h4>2.2.12 Two or all 3 criteria: condition C</h4>

<p>It is possible for an accelerated payment notice to be given on the basis of two or all three of the criteria within condition C. Sections 2.13 and 2.14 of this guidance give more details about what happens in these circumstances, and the particular rules that apply.</p>

<h4>2.2.13 Publication of scheme reference numbers</h4>

<p>HMRC has published a list of <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr> SRNs. Users of schemes on that list may receive an accelerated payment notice from HMRC requiring an accelerated payment to be made.</p>

<p>HMRC updates the list at quarterly intervals.</p>

<h4>2.2.14 <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr> requirement met for tax — arrangements used to avoid tax and National Insurance contributions</h4>

<p>If the arrangement has been used to avoid tax and National Insurance contributions, the <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr> requirement will be met for both tax and National Insurance contributions  where the <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr> requirement is met for tax (section 2.2.9). This includes where the National Insurance contributions  element of the arrangements were not disclosable under the corresponding National Insurance contributions  equivalent disclosure provisions.</p>

<p>However, where the asserted advantage relates to National Insurance contributions  only, the <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr> requirement will only be met from the date that the <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr> legislation took effect for National Insurance contributions.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/nimmanual/NIM58000.htm" rel="external">National Insurance Manual</a> gives more information about <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr> legislation for National Insurance contributions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Relevant contributions dispute (paragraph 6 of Schedule 2 to the <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015)</h3>

<h4>2.3.1 Giving accelerated payment notices for National Insurance contributions</h4>

<p>For tax, accelerated payment notices can only be given where there is either an open tax enquiry or an open appeal.</p>

<p>Whilst there is a National Insurance contributions  equivalent of an open appeal (against a National Insurance contributions  decision), there is no direct equivalent of a tax enquiry for National Insurance contributions. Because of this, the National Insurance Contributions Act 2015 introduces the concept of a ‘relevant contributions dispute’ (see annex 1 for definition).</p>

<p>Creating this concept allows HMRC to give an accelerated payment notice in circumstances where there is a dispute about National Insurance contributions but before a National Insurance contributions  decision has been made and can be appealed against.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Giving accelerated payment notices for tax and National Insurance contributions  at different times</h3>

<p>There are time limits for issuing tax assessments and determinations but not for issuing National Insurance contributions  decisions. Because of this, HMRC may issue tax assessments or determinations sooner than they issue National Insurance contributions decisions in relation to the same avoidance scheme used.</p>

<p>This could mean that a tax appeal may be in place before there is a relevant contributions dispute or an appeal against a National Insurance contributions  decision.</p>

<p>Where there is an appeal against a tax assessment or determination and HMRC considers that National Insurance contributions are also due, they may give a person an accelerated payment notice for tax before they give the accelerated payment notice for National Insurance contributions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> Content of an accelerated payment notice where enquiry or relevant contributions dispute is in progress (section 220 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014)</h3>

<h4>2.5.1 Notices</h4>

<p>An accelerated payment notice must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>specify the conditions that have been satisfied — including all applicable requirements under condition C (sections 2.2.5 to 2.2.8 of this guidance)</li>
  <li>tell the person the amount to pay</li>
  <li>for tax — explain that the accelerated payment is to be treated as a payment on account of the tax in dispute</li>
  <li>for National Insurance contributions — explain that the AP is a payment of the National Insurance contributions  (paragraph 17(2) Schedule 2 <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015)</li>
  <li>tell the person the deadline for paying the accelerated payment</li>
  <li>specify the late payment penalty terms, rates and structure</li>
  <li>for tax — explain that any amounts subject to an accelerated payment notice cannot be postponed</li>
  <li>for National Insurance contributions — explain that, if HMRC has to take civil proceedings to recover the National Insurance contributions included in the accelerated payment notice, those proceedings cannot be adjourned  pending a National Insurance contributions decision or appeal (paragraph 17(5) Schedule 2 <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015) — paragraph 2.8.4 of this guidance also gives details</li>
  <li>explain how representations may be made to HMRC about an accelerated payment notice — including the time limit and what HMRC must do in response</li>
  <li>tell the person that, in the event of their successful litigation, HMRC may apply to the court or tribunal for an order not to repay the tax or National Insurance contributions  in dispute, where HMRC pursues a further appeal, in order to protect the revenue</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.5.2 Designated officer</h4>

<p>A designated officer — a senior official in HMRC — will determine the amount of the payment required in an accelerated payment notice. The payment required is the amount of the understated tax (annex 1 gives a definition) calculated to the best of the officer’s information and belief.</p>

<p>As the law currently stands, the designated officer must be satisfied, based on the information available to them, that the scheme for which the accelerated payment notice has been given is ineffective and that the understated tax will become due.</p>

<p>The information available will include that held by Customer Relationship Managers (<abbr title="Customer Relationship Managers">CRM’s</abbr>) and case teams.</p>

<h4>2.5.3 Understated tax or National Insurance contributions</h4>

<p>The understated tax or National Insurance contributions  is the additional amount that would be due and payable on the basis that the tax or National Insurance contributions  advantage has been denied.</p>

<p>In each case this will be determined by the designated HMRC officer. In follower notice and <abbr title="General Anti-Abuse Rule">GAAR</abbr> counteraction cases, the expected position would be as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>follower notices — if HMRC has given a follower notice, the amount is the same as would be required if the person were to have taken the necessary corrective action to amend the return or claim, or otherwise settle the dispute</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="General Anti-Abuse Rule">GAAR</abbr> counteraction notice — the amount will be the same as specified in the <abbr title="General Anti-Abuse Rule">GAAR</abbr> counteraction notice</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.5.4 Denied advantage</h4>

<p>The legislation for the <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr> criterion uses the term ‘so much of the asserted advantage as is not a tax advantage which results from the chosen arrangements, or otherwise’. The reference to ‘tax’ includes National Insurance contributions.</p>

<p>That is, it is the amount which the person has asserted as a tax or National Insurance contributions  advantage but which HMRC considers will not ultimately be a tax or National Insurance contributions  advantage when the enquiry, relevant contributions dispute or appeal is finally resolved.</p>

<p>In example 10 (section 2.2.9), this would be tax on the claimed loss of £50,000 (in the example where the whole amount arises from avoidance) or tax on £20,000 in example 11 (section 2.2.9).</p>

<h4>2.5.5 Requirements in condition C (section 227 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014)</h4>

<p>In the event that more than one of the requirements in condition C (sections 2.2.5 to 2.2.8 of this guidance) is met, HMRC must specify in the accelerated payment notice which of them is being applied to determine the amount of the required accelerated payment. This may have further consequences if one or more of the original conditions changes (sections 2.13 and 2.14 of this guidance).</p>

<h4>2.5.6 Content of an accelerated payment notice given pending an appeal</h4>

<p>Where an appeal is pending, an accelerated payment notice must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>specify the conditions that have been satisfied (including which of the condition C requirements are met)</li>
  <li>specify the amount of the disputed tax or National Insurance contributions</li>
  <li>for tax — explain that any tax subject to an accelerated payment notice cannot be postponed</li>
  <li>for a National Insurance contributions decision — explain that, if HMRC has to take civil proceedings to recover the National Insurance contributions  included in the accelerated payment notice, those proceedings cannot be adjourned to await the outcome of an appeal against that National Insurance contributions  decision (paragraph 18(3) Schedule 2 <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015) — if such proceedings have already been adjourned, they cease to be adjourned (section 2.8.4 of this guidance gives details of the date from which they cease to be adjourned)</li>
  <li>tell the person the deadline for paying the accelerated payment</li>
  <li>explain how representations may be made to HMRC about an accelerated payment notice, including the time limit and what HMRC must do in response</li>
  <li>tell the person that in the event of their successful litigation, HMRC may apply to the court or tribunal for an order not to repay the tax or National Insurance contributions  in dispute, where HMRC pursues a further appeal, in order to protect the revenue</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.5.7 Disputed tax or National Insurance contributions</h4>

<p>The disputed tax or National Insurance contributions  is the amount HMRC is asking the person to pay. It will be determined by a designated officer and, in most cases, it is expected to be the amount which is under appeal in relation to the avoidance arrangements which have led to the accelerated payment notice.</p>

<p>Care will be taken to distinguish what is the tax or National Insurance contributions  advantage arising from the chosen arrangements and any other amounts which may be in dispute.</p>

<h4>2.5.8 Payment dates for accelerated payment notices</h4>

<p>The time limits for making an accelerated payment depend on whether representations have been made (section 2.6 of this guidance for information about representations). If:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no representations have been made — payment is due no later than 90 days from the date the notice is given</li>
  <li>representations have been made — payment is due the later of<br>
— 30 days from when HMRC issues its decision<br>
— 90 days from the date the original notice was given</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span> Representations</h3>

<h4>2.6.1 Representations can be made</h4>

<p>The person can object to an accelerated payment notice by making representations in writing to HMRC.</p>

<h4>2.6.2 Time limit for representations</h4>

<p>The person has 90 days from the date the notice is given to send written representations to HMRC.</p>

<h4>2.6.3 Grounds for representations</h4>

<p>Representations can be made on one or more of the following grounds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>conditions A, B or C (sections 2.2.3 to 2.2.8 of this guidance) are not met</li>
  <li>the amount specified in the accelerated payment notice does not accurately reflect the amount of tax or National Insurance contributions in dispute in relation to the asserted advantage</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.6.4 How to make representations</h4>

<p>Full information about where to send a representation and what it should contain will be included on the accelerated payment notice.</p>

<p>The normal timing rules that apply to determine, for example, the date of the submission of tax returns and the date of their receipt, will apply to accelerated payment notices and representations. Representations can be made by the person’s authorised agent.</p>

<h4>2.6.5 HMRC makes decision</h4>

<p>The representations will be considered by an independent HMRC officer who is unconnected with the team which issued the accelerated payment notice.</p>

<p>If representations are made objecting to whether requirements A, B or C (sections 2.2.3 to 2.2.8 of this guidance) are met, HMRC must decide whether to confirm the accelerated payment notice (with or without amendment), or to withdraw it.</p>

<p>Section 1.18 of this guidance contains more information on governance in relation to follower notices.</p>

<h4>2.6.6 Changes to the amount specified</h4>

<p>If representations are made objecting to the amount specified in the accelerated payment notice, HMRC must decide whether a different amount ought to have been specified, and either confirm the amount in the accelerated payment notice, or amend it to specify a different amount.</p>

<h4>2.6.7 HMRC must notify outcome</h4>

<p>HMRC must notify the person of the outcome of their representations.</p>

<h4>2.6.8 Revised payment date</h4>

<p>If an accelerated payment is still payable following notification of HMRC’s decision, the person must pay the amount due by the later of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>30 days beginning with the date the decision was notified to them</li>
  <li>the deadline for payment that was shown in the accelerated payment notice</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.6.9 Accurate information essential</h4>

<p>It is important for the person and their adviser to take all steps to give HMRC full information at the earliest opportunity, so that an accurate figure can be established for the accelerated payment.</p>

<p>The accelerated payment is intended to represent only the additional amount that the person would have to pay for the period if their avoidance scheme fails. This may not necessarily be the total tax or National Insurance contributions  involved in the appeal or dispute as there may be other reliefs and allowances to take into account.</p>

<h4>2.6.10 Potential impact on contributory social security benefits</h4>

<p>The accelerated payment notice may be based on Classes 1 and 2 National Insurance contributions  that have not been paid. Such classes of National Insurance contributions  may affect entitlement to contributory social security benefits. Class 1 National Insurance contributions  paid only on earnings above the upper earnings limit do not count for contributory benefit.</p>

<h4>2.6.11 Accelerated payment allocated to worker’s National Insurance account (paragraphs 17(7) and 18(6) Schedule 2 <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015)</h4>

<p>When the accelerated payment is repaid (either in part or full), HMRC will amend the worker’s National Insurance account to show the revised National Insurance contributions due, if both the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>action was taken as set out in section 2.6.10 to amend the worker’s National Insurance account</li>
  <li>HMRC accept that some or all of the National Insurance contributions in the accelerated payment notice were not due, for example, because of a final judicial ruling</li>
</ul>

<p>The worker will not be required to repay any benefit paid before the accelerated payment (in part or full) is repaid.</p>

<h4>2.6.12 Consequential effects</h4>

<p>Where denial of the disputed tax or National Insurance contributions  advantage would have a consequential effect on other areas of the person’s returns, this will be taken into account. This could include consequential effects on other periods, for example where claims to capital allowances are involved.</p>

<h4>2.6.13 More than one set of arrangements</h4>

<p>It may be the case that a person has become involved with more than one set of arrangements that, in aggregate would, if successful, lead to their claiming more relief than their aggregate income and gains for the period. The total accelerated payment for the period would not be more than the tax or National Insurance contributions  on their total amount of income and gains for the same period, having regard to reliefs and allowances available (outside those claimed in relation to the arrangements).</p>

<h4>2.6.14 Certificates of Tax Deposit</h4>

<p>If a person has purchased a Certificate of Tax Deposit, they can redeem it against the accelerated payment in the normal way. A person in that position should contact HMRC as soon as possible to ensure that the amounts are allocated in the correct way.</p>

<h4>2.6.15 Tax enquiry in progress (section 223(3) <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014 and paragraph 17(2) Schedule 2 <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015)</h4>

<p>An accelerated payment for understated tax is treated as if it were a payment on account of the understated tax for the period. This means that, once the final liability has been decided or agreed, the accelerated payment will be set against it.</p>

<p>An accelerated payment for understated National Insurance contributions is treated as a payment of the understated National Insurance contributions and not a payment on account of the National Insurance contributions.</p>

<h4>2.6.16 Inheritance Tax</h4>

<p>If the accelerated payment relates to Inheritance Tax (IHT) and this tax is being paid by instalments, (as it is in special circumstances), then the due date for making an accelerated payment cannot be set before the due date for paying the instalment to which it relates.</p>

<h4>2.6.17 Part of understated tax paid</h4>

<p>If a person has paid any part of the understated tax before an accelerated payment notice is given, this amount will reduce the size of payment required by the accelerated payment notice.</p>

<p>Where amounts have been paid on account, but not yet allocated, or Certificates of Tax Deposit purchased, HMRC will discuss with the person how and if those may be used against the accelerated payment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.7 </span> Interest</h3>

<h4>2.7.1 Accelerated payment does not attract late payment interest</h4>

<p>Any late paid accelerated payment does not itself attract interest, but will normally be subject to a late payment penalty (section 2.12 of this guidance). However, as it is paid in relation to the disputed tax or National Insurance contributions, it will have an effect on the interest which is ultimately due and payable when the dispute is settled or agreed.</p>

<h4>2.7.2 Alleviates interest on disputed tax</h4>

<p>On receipt of the accelerated payment, interest will cease to accrue further on the disputed tax to the extent it is covered by the payment made.</p>

<h4>Example 12:</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>A person submits a Self Assessment tax return for the year ended 5 April 2009, with any tax due on 31 January 2010. The person completes their return on the basis that an avoidance scheme will succeed. An accelerated payment notice is given on 1 September 2014, which the person pays on 31 October 2014.
<br><br>
If the person is ultimately unsuccessful and their Self Assessment is amended upwards to reflect the additional tax, then interest will be due on the extra amount from 31 January 2010 (the original payable date) to 31 October 2014 (the date when the accelerated payment was paid). If the final additional amount is more or less than the accelerated payment, the interest will be adjusted accordingly.</p>
</div>

<h4>Example 13:</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>An employer uses an avoidance arrangement to pay earnings in the tax year 6 April 2009 to 5 April 2010. The employer considers that Class 1 National Insurance contributions and PAYE Income Tax are not due.<br>
<br>
An accelerated payment notice is given on 16 July 2015, which the employer pays on 5 September 2015.
<br><br>
If the outcome is that Class 1 National Insurance contributions and PAYE Income Tax are due, interest will be due from 19 April 2010 (19 April following the end of the tax year in which the National Insurance contributions  and PAYE Income Tax were due) to 5 September 2015. If the amount due is more or less than the accelerated payment, the interest will be adjusted accordingly.</p>
</div>

<h4>2.7.3 Accelerated payment attracts repayment interest</h4>

<p>If an accelerated payment is received by HMRC and later has to be partly or wholly repaid, then repayment interest at the prevailing rates will be paid to the person.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.8 </span> Postponement</h3>

<h4>2.8.1 Restriction on postponement of tax (does not include National Insurance contributions)</h4>

<p>Tax under appeal can be subject to postponement under section 55 of <abbr title="Taxes Management Act">TMA</abbr> 1970, and the equivalents for other taxes. However, any amount that is under appeal and is also included in an accelerated payment notice cannot be postponed.</p>

<h4>2.8.2 Accelerated payment notice cancels postponement of tax</h4>

<p>If the payment of tax under appeal has already been postponed, then the accelerated payment notice has the effect of cancelling the postponement of that amount. The amount included in the accelerated payment notice that was previously postponed becomes due and payable under the normal rules for the specific tax involved.</p>

<p>However, the 90-day time limit for payment under the accelerated payment rules applies, rather than any shorter payment period that might otherwise apply for the specific tax.</p>

<h4>2.8.3 Tax not in an avoidance dispute</h4>

<p>None of this affects the postponement of any amount of tax that is both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>under appeal in respect of the same tax return or claim</li>
  <li>not included in an accelerated payment notice</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example 14:</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>A person has appealed in relation to a dispute over both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an avoidance scheme involving their Income Tax liability</li>
  <li>a liability to Capital Gains Tax</li>
</ul>

<p>They have applied for, and been given, postponement of the amounts under appeal.
<br><br>
They have been given an accelerated payment notice in respect of their use of the avoidance scheme.
<br><br>
The liability to Capital Gains Tax can continue to be postponed under the existing rules, but the giving of the accelerated payment notice has the effect of cancelling the postponement of the amount relating to Income Tax.</p>
</div>

<h4>2.8.4 Adjournment of civil proceedings to recover National Insurance contributions  accelerated payment (paragraph 17(5) and 18(3) Schedule 2 <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015)</h4>

<p>The postponement provisions legislation in section 55 <abbr title="Taxes Management Act">TMA</abbr> 1970 does not apply to National Insurance contributions.</p>

<p>For National Insurance contributions, HMRC is normally prevented from recovering National Insurance contributions  where it has not issued a National Insurance contributions  decision or where there is an ongoing appeal in respect of National Insurance contributions  by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>section 117A of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (which applies to Great Britain)</li>
  <li>section 111A of the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 (which applies to Northern Ireland)</li>
</ul>

<p>This effectively postpones payment of National Insurance contributions, as civil proceedings for their recovery would be suspended until a formal decision is made and any appeal is either settled by agreement or finally determined by a tribunal or courts.</p>

<p>However, the above provisions do not apply to the recovery of accelerated payment of understated National Insurance contributions  (where there is a relevant contributions dispute) or disputed National Insurance contributions  (where there is an open National Insurance contributions  appeal).</p>

<p>The effect of the modification made in Schedule 2 of <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015 is that, if HMRC has to take civil proceedings to recover the unpaid National Insurance contributions  accelerated payment, the Court cannot adjourn the civil proceedings for either of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for HMRC to make a National Insurance contributions  decision</li>
  <li>to await the final outcome of any appeal against a National Insurance contributions  decision</li>
</ul>

<p>If such proceedings have already been adjourned, they cease to be adjourned. The date from which they cease to be adjourned depends on whether representations have been made (section 2.6 of this guidance gives information about representations). If</p>

<ul>
  <li>no representations have been made, that date is 90 days from the date the notice is given</li>
  <li>representations have been made, that date is the later of<br>
— 30 days from when HMRC issues its decision about the representations<br>
— 90 days from the date the original notice was given</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.9 </span> Civil proceedings for National Insurance contributions</h3>

<h4>2.9.1 Evidence of unpaid National Insurance contributions  accelerated payment (Paragraph 17(6) and 18(5) Schedule 2 <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015 and section 25A of CRCA 2005)</h4>

<p>If it is necessary to take civil proceedings to recover any part of a National Insurance contributions  accelerated payment, HMRC will issue a certificate of debt. The court must accept this as conclusive evidence that the amount is unpaid. The civil recovery proceedings cannot be adjourned (2.8.4 above).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.10 </span> Protection of revenue pending further appeals</h3>

<h4>2.10.1 Additional power for accelerated payment</h4>

<p>Section 56 of <abbr title="Taxes Management Act">TMA</abbr> 1970, and its equivalents for other taxes, directs that the unsuccessful party in a tribunal or court appeal must pay (in the case of the person) or repay (in the case of HMRC) the tax involved. The accelerated payments rules are not intended to override that position in the normal course of events. However, the new legislation does provide an additional, limited, power (section 2.10.2 of this guidance).</p>

<p>Section 56 of <abbr title="Taxes Management Act">TMA</abbr> 1970 applies to National Insurance contributions  by regulation 12 of the Social Security Contributions (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 (SI 1999 No 1027).</p>

<h4>2.10.2 No repayment cases</h4>

<p>Where a person has been successful in litigation in a case where an accelerated payment notice has been given, the tax or National Insurance contributions  in dispute will normally be repaid to the person unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HMRC applies to the tribunal or court in order to pursue a further appeal</li>
  <li>the relevant tribunal or court considers a risk to the Exchequer will develop if a repayment is made and gives a direction</li>
</ul>

<p>In these cases the tribunal or court may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>grant permission to withhold all or part of the repayment</li>
  <li>rule that the person must provide adequate security before being repaid</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.10.3 Genuine risk of non-payment</h4>

<p>HMRC only expects to make application to the tribunal or court in cases where HMRC considers there is a genuine risk that tax due may not be paid on the outcome of the case.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.11 </span> Repayment of accelerated payments</h3>

<h4>2.11.1 General</h4>

<p>The accelerated payment provisions in Part 4 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014 do not make any express provision for the repayment of tax when the underlying liability dispute is determined in the persons favour, but rely on the existing administrative provisions that apply to final determinations or settled appeals, and the general binding nature of the courts decisions.</p>

<h4>2.11.2 Authority for repayment of accelerated payments</h4>

<p>Where the repayment of an accelerated payment of tax and National Insurance contributions is due, there is no requirement for the person entitled to the repayment to make an application before any part of an accelerated payment is repaid.</p>

<h4>2.12 Penalty or surcharge for failure to pay an accelerated payment</h4>

<p>Much of Schedule 56 to <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2009 (late payment penalties) applies to late payment of accelerated payments. This includes the rule that where an agreement for deferred payment is made, there will not be a late payment penalty provided the person keeps to the terms of the payment arrangement (section 2.12.7 of this guidance).</p>

<h4>2.12.1 Late payment penalties where a partner payment notice has been given (paragraph 7 of schedule 32, section 226 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014 and Schedule 56 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2009)</h4>

<p>Where a partner payment notice has been given and the accelerated partner payment remains unpaid at the end of the payment period, the person is liable to late payment penalties as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on the penalty day — an amount equal to 5% of the amount unpaid</li>
  <li>5 months after the penalty day — an amount equal to 5% of any amount still unpaid at that date</li>
  <li>11 months after the penalty day — an amount equal to 5% of any amount still unpaid at that date</li>
</ul>

<p>The penalty day is the day immediately following the end of the payment period</p>

<h4>2.12.2 Late payment penalties — tax enquiry or relevant contributions dispute in progress (section 226 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014, paragraph 19 Schedule 2 <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015 and Schedule 56 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2009) (does not include partner payment notices)</h4>

<p>Where an accelerated payment notice has been given in a case where there is a tax enquiry or a relevant contributions dispute and the accelerated payment remains unpaid at the end of the payment period, the person is liable to late payment penalties as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on the penalty day — an amount equal to 5% of the amount unpaid</li>
  <li>5 months after the penalty day — an amount equal to 5% of any amount still unpaid at that date</li>
  <li>11 months after the penalty day — an amount equal to 5% of any amount still unpaid at that date</li>
</ul>

<p>The penalty day is the day immediately following the end of the payment period.</p>

<h4>Example 15:</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>An accelerated payment notice is given to the person in the amount of £100,000 on 1 October 2014. The payment is therefore due by 29 December 2014.
<br><br>
The person does not pay the accelerated payment.
<br><br>
A 5% penalty is due on 30 December 2014 (the penalty day) of £5,000.
<br><br>
A further 5% penalty of £5,000 is due on 30 May 2015 (5 months after the penalty day).
<br><br>
If the person continues not to pay, an 11 month penalty of £5,000 is charged on 30 November 2015.</p>
</div>

<h4>Example 16:</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>An accelerated payment notice is given to the person in the amount of £100,000 on 1 October 2014. The payment is therefore due by 29 December 2014.
<br><br>
The person pays £50,000 on 28 December 2014 therefore £50,000 is still outstanding.
<br><br>
A 5% penalty is due on 30 December 2014 (the penalty day) of £2,500 (£50,000 x 5%), which is then paid.
<br><br>
The person pays the remaining £50,000 on 1 April 2015.
<br><br>
The person has now fully complied with the accelerated payment notice and no further penalties for late payment are due.</p>
</div>

<h4>2.12.3 Late payment surcharges for open appeal cases — 2009 to 2010 and earlier years (section 59C <abbr title="Taxes Management Act">TMA</abbr> 1970) (does not include partner payment notices)</h4>

<p>Where an accelerated payment notice has been given in a case where there is an open appeal for the tax year 2009 to 2010 or earlier and the accelerated payment remains unpaid at the end of the payment period, the person is liable to late payment surcharges as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>28 days after end of the payment period — an amount equal to 5% of the amount unpaid</li>
  <li>6 months after the end of the payment period — an amount equal to 5% of any amount still unpaid at that date</li>
</ul>

<p>These surcharges only apply to those taxes (including Class 4 National Insurance contributions) which are already within the scope of section 59C Taxes Management Act 1970.</p>

<h4>2.12.4 Late payment penalties for open appeal cases — 2010 to 2011 and later years (schedule 56 Finance Act 2009) (does not include partner payment notices)</h4>

<p>Where an accelerated payment notice has been given in a case where there is an open appeal, late payment penalties or surcharges are assessed in the same way late payment penalties or surcharges for the underlying tax would be.</p>

<p>The penalty date will be 31 days after the due date in the accelerated payment notice.</p>

<h4>Example 17</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>A person is given an accelerated payment notice where there is an open appeal in relation to income tax for the tax year 2010 to 2011 and the accelerated payment remains unpaid at the end of the payment period. The person is liable to late payment penalties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on the penalty date — an amount equal to 5% of the amount unpaid</li>
  <li>5 months after the penalty date — an amount equal to 5% of any amount still unpaid at that date</li>
  <li>11 months after the penalty date — an amount equal to 5% of any amount still unpaid at that date</li>
</ul>

<p>As these penalties apply to those taxes (including Class 4 National Insurance contributions) which are within the scope of Schedule 56 FA2009.</p>
</div>

<h4>2.12.5 Appeals against late payment penalties or surcharges</h4>

<p>A person has the right to appeal to the tribunal against late payment penalties or surcharges.</p>

<p>The rules set out in paragraph 13 schedule 56 to the <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2009 apply to late payment penalties for accelerated payment notices where there is an open tax appeal.</p>

<p>The rules set out in paragraphs 9 to 18 (other than paragraph 11(5)) of Schedule 56 to <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2009 apply to late payment penalties for accelerated payment notices where there is an open tax enquiry.</p>

<h4>2.12.6 Enforceable penalty — National Insurance contributions  accelerated payment notice (paragraph 20 Schedule 2 <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015)</h4>

<p>The penalty due for not complying with a National Insurance contributions  accelerated payment notice is recovered in the same way as unpaid relevant contributions (annex 1 gives definitions). It is not treated in the same way as an assessment to tax.</p>

<p>For the purposes of a court determining whether civil proceedings can be adjourned, the penalty assessment is treated as if it were a National Insurance contributions  decision as to whether the person was liable for the penalty. The effect is that if there is an appeal against the penalty assessment the court must adjourn any civil proceedings taken to recover the penalty until the appeal is finally determined.</p>

<h4>2.12.7 Payment arrangements for accelerated payment notices</h4>

<p>If a person asks to enter into a payment arrangement with HMRC for an amount of accelerated payment and HMRC agrees such an arrangement for a period (the deferral period), and the arrangement is fully adhered to, then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in respect of the amount included in the arrangement</li>
  <li>from the date on which the person asked to enter into the arrangement, until the end of the deferral period</li>
</ul>

<p>the person will not become liable to the late payment penalties or surcharges that they would have become liable to if the arrangement was not in place.</p>

<p>This does not affect any late payment penalties or surcharges that the person had become liable to before they asked to enter into the payment arrangement (section 108 of <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2009 and paragraph 10 of schedule 56 to <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2009, applied by section 226(7) of <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.13 </span> Withdrawal, modification or suspension of accelerated payment notice (section 227 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014 and paragraph 21 Schedule 2 <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015)</h3>

<h4>2.13.1 Conditions</h4>

<p>Where an accelerated payment notice has been issued, HMRC may, at any time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>withdraw the notice</li>
  <li>reduce the amount of the accelerated payment when one of the requirements of condition C (sections 2.2.5 to 2.2.8 of this guidance) ceases to exist (this occurs when the notice remains effective as it is supported by another of the alternatives to condition C)</li>
  <li>reduce the amount specified in the notice (this includes where there are multiple arrangements in the same tax year and one or more is successful in litigation)</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.13.2 Excess repaid</h4>

<p>If the amount of an accelerated payment is reduced and a greater amount than this has already been paid, then HMRC will normally repay the excess with any applicable interest.</p>

<p>Similarly, if a late payment penalty or surcharge has been charged and paid, a replacement assessment for the correct penalty or surcharge will be issued and any excess repaid.</p>

<h4>2.13.3 Accelerated payment notice withdrawn and specified amount repaid</h4>

<p>If an accelerated payment notice is withdrawn, the specified amount paid plus any penalties or surcharges paid will normally be repaid with any applicable interest.</p>

<h4>2.13.4 The person wants to settle</h4>

<p>If, after receiving the accelerated payment notice, the person wants to settle the dispute with HMRC, there are a number of ways of dealing with this. For example, the person may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>agree to amend their return or claim and pay the tax or National Insurance contributions  arising — they can choose to pay the tax or National Insurance contributions either by the due date shown in the accelerated payment notice, or the normal due date for paying the tax or National Insurance contributions (if earlier)</li>
  <li>want to enter into a settlement agreement, accepting HMRC’s view of the tax results of the scheme and agree with HMRC a payment instalment plan because they cannot pay all the tax due at once</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.14 </span> Modifications to an accelerated payment notice</h3>

<h4>2.14.1 Follower notice</h4>

<p>HMRC must amend or withdraw the accelerated payment notice if it was given because a follower notice has been given, and the follower notice is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>withdrawn</li>
  <li>amended (when there has been a new relevant final judicial ruling after a late appeal)</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.14.2 <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr> arrangements</h4>

<p>If an accelerated payment notice has been given because of <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr> arrangements and these arrangements are no longer notifiable or applicable, then HMRC must reduce the amount (as appropriate) of the accelerated payment to the extent to which it was based on this requirement. For example, HMRC has withdrawn the obligation to notify the scheme.</p>

<h4>2.14.3 Condition C requirements</h4>

<p>If at least one of the condition C requirements (sections 2.2.5 to 2.2.8 of this guidance) continues to be satisfied, then the accelerated payment notice will continue to have effect. Where more than one of the condition C requirements was originally applicable and one or more no longer applies, HMRC must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>withdraw the notice to the extent it is given by virtue of those requirements</li>
  <li>notify the modification of the accelerated payment notice to show one of the remaining condition C requirements</li>
  <li>reduce the amount of the accelerated payment due if the disputed tax or National Insurance contributions  determined under the substituted requirement is less than the amount initially stated on the notice</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.14.4 Specify condition C requirement</h4>

<p>Sections 220(6) and 221(5) <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014 require HMRC to specify which condition C requirement is used as the basis of an accelerated payment notice, where more than one of those requirements could apply. In the majority of cases it is likely that the resulting accelerated payment will be the same, but it might not be.</p>

<p>Any amount found to be overpaid as a result will be repaid with any applicable interest.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.15 </span> Suspension of an accelerated payment notice</h3>

<h4>2.15.1 Late appeal</h4>

<p>If a follower notice is suspended because of a late appeal against the relevant judicial ruling, then an accelerated payment notice will also be suspended if it is based solely on the follower notice requirement of condition C (sections 2.2.5 to 2.2.8 of this guidance).</p>

<h4>2.15.2 Accelerated payment notice remains effective despite late appeal against relevant judicial ruling</h4>

<p>If another condition C (sections 2.2.5 to 2.2.8 of this guidance) requirement is still met (either <abbr title="Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes">DOTAS</abbr> arrangements or a <abbr title="General Anti-Abuse Rule">GAAR</abbr> counteraction notice) then the accelerated payment notice will not be suspended and will remain effective in relation to those conditions. In this circumstance HMRC must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>withdraw the follower notice requirement</li>
  <li>notify the modification of the accelerated payment notice to show the remaining condition C requirements</li>
  <li>reduce the amount of accelerated payment due if the disputed tax determined under the substituted requirement is less than the amount initially stated on the notice</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.15.3 Effect of suspension period (section 227(9) <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014 and paragraph 21 Schedule 2 <abbr title="The National Insurance Contributions Act">NICA</abbr> 2015)</h4>

<p>If an accelerated payment notice is suspended, the period of suspension does not count towards the periods mentioned in the following provisions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>section 223 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014</li>
  <li>section 55(8D) of <abbr title="Taxes Management Act">TMA</abbr> 1970</li>
  <li>paragraph 39(11) of Schedule 10 to <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2003</li>
  <li>paragraph 48(8C) of Schedule 33 to <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2013</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.16 </span> Partnerships — summary</h3>

<h4>2.16.1 Special rules</h4>

<p>Special rules for members of partnerships can be found in Schedules 31 and 32. These rules essentially reflect the general tax treatment of partnerships. In summary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a follower notice will be given to the representative partner, in that capacity, on behalf of the partnership as a whole</li>
  <li>that follower notice can then apply to generate an accelerated payment notice to the members of the partnership</li>
  <li>the members can also be given a follower notice or an accelerated payment notice in respect of a scheme in their personal capacity</li>
  <li>in those instances these will relate directly to their own tax return, which will of course include their share of the partnership profits and gains</li>
</ul>

<p>These points are covered in more detail below.</p>

<h4>2.16.2 Actions taken separately by partners</h4>

<p>All actions taken in respect of accelerated payments, including making representations, paying the accelerated partner payment, are undertaken separately by the individual partners. The representative partner has no role in that capacity, but may of course be involved in their own personal capacity as a partner.</p>

<h4>2.16.3 Partners accelerated payments may vary</h4>

<p>It is entirely possible for different partners to receive accelerated payment notices for different amounts, depending on other reliefs and allowances that they may have available personally.</p>

<h4>2.16.4 <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> and <abbr title="Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings">ATED</abbr> rules</h4>

<p>Specific partnership rules apply for <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> and <abbr title="Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings">ATED</abbr> to reflect the particular treatment of partnerships in relation to those heads of duty.</p>

<h4>2.16.5 Partnership notices</h4>

<p>Schedule 32 to <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014 sets out the additional special rules for partnerships. These rules apply to partnerships which are subject to <abbr title="Taxes Management Act">TMA</abbr> 1970 s12AA.</p>

<h4>2.16.6 Partner payment notice</h4>

<p>An accelerated payment notice for a partner is called a partner payment notice, and each partner of the partnership will be given an individual partner payment notice. The partner is responsible for paying the amount set out in their own notice, and will be liable for a late payment penalty if the amount is not paid by the due date (section 2.12.1 of this guidance).</p>

<h4>2.16.7 Giving a partner payment notice</h4>

<p>The rules for giving a partner payment notice are adapted to refer to partnership returns as appropriate. Apart from this they are fundamentally the same as the rules for giving an accelerated payment notice.</p>

<h4>2.16.8 Calculation of tax or National Insurance contributions advantage</h4>

<p>The contents of a partner payment notice and the calculation of the payment are very similar to an accelerated payment, with modifications for partners. The denied advantage is calculated by reference to the amount of tax or National Insurance contributions  that becomes due and payable by counteracting the tax or National Insurance contributions  advantage in the relevant claim or return of the partner.</p>

<h4>2.16.9 Partner representations</h4>

<p>There is no direct right to appeal against a partner payment notice, but each partner has the right to make written representations to HMRC on the basis that either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any of the conditions A to C (sections 2.2.3 to 2.2.8 of this guidance) are not met</li>
  <li>the amount specified in the partner payment notice is not correct</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.16.10 Notification of decision</h4>

<p>HMRC must consider the representations and notify the partner in writing of their decision — which will normally be to confirm, withdraw or modify the partner payment notice.</p>

<h4>2.16.11 Time limits</h4>

<p>Time limits for payment of the amount due on a partner payment notice are the same as for accelerated payment notices. Payment is due:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if no representations have been made, 90 days from the date the partner payment notice was given</li>
  <li>if representations have been made, the later of the original 90-day payment period or the end of a 30-day period beginning on the date HMRC confirms their decision to issue the partner payment notice</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.16.12 Late-payment penalties</h4>

<p>A late payment penalty applies to partners who do not pay by the due date (section 2.12.1 of this guidance).</p>

<h4>2.16.13 Changes to partner payment notices</h4>

<p>The rules for withdrawing, suspending and amending partner payment notices are the same as for accelerated payment notices.</p>

  <li>2 or more persons jointly and severally liable to pay the relevant tax</li>
</ul>

<p>anything required or authorised (by the follower notice and accelerated payments legislation) to be done in relation to a person, must be done in relation to all the responsible partners and persons jointly and severally liable to pay the relevant tax.</p>

<p>This in particular means that each person must be given a separate notice.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Liability</h3>

<p>Any liability to:</p>

<p>The guidance for follower notices and accelerated payments applies to <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> with the following amendments. They reflect the specific treatment of partnerships and other forms of joint ownership for <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Partners</h3>

<p>Where a partnership, or 2 or more persons acting jointly, are the purchasers in respect of the land transaction, then anything required or authorised (by the follower notice and accelerated payments legislation) to be done in relation to a person must be done in relation to all the responsible partners and persons acting jointly.</p>

<p>This means, in particular, that each person involved must be given a separate notice.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span> Effective date of transaction</h3>

<h2>
<span class="number">5 Accelerated </span> payments and group relief</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Amendments to <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014 for group relief</h3>

<p>The Finance Act 2015 (section 118 and Schedule 18) (<abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2015) amends <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014 to include new provisions relating to the restriction of the surrender of losses and other amounts for the purposes of group relief.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Who the new provisions affect</h3>

<p>The new provisions affect companies in groups who have either claimed or surrendered group relief where the loss or other amount arose from ‘chosen arrangements’, and where the relevant conditions in FA14 for giving an accelerated payment notice (<abbr title="Accelerated Payment notice">APN</abbr>) have been met.</p>

<p>Throughout this ‘group relief’ section, the term ‘<abbr title="Person">P</abbr>’ (meaning ‘person’) is used to refer to the company that has surrendered group relief.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span> When the new provisions took effect</h3>

<p>The new provisions for group relief cases in <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2015 took effect from 26 March 2015, which was the date that <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2015 received Royal Assent. It applies to <abbr title="Accelerated Payment notice">APN</abbr> issued on or after that date.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span> How the new provisions work</h3>

<p>The new provisions apply if the “surrenderable loss” of a company (<abbr title="Person">P</abbr>) includes a loss that originates from a “denied advantage”.</p>

<p>If the denied advantage consists, to any extent, of an “asserted surrenderable amount” HMRC may specify in an <abbr title="Accelerated Payment notice">APN</abbr> that some or all of that amount cannot be surrendered as group relief.</p>

<p>Annex 1 of this guidance gives definitions of the terms ‘surrenderable loss’ and ‘asserted surrenderable amount’.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span> The effect of giving an <abbr title="Accelerated Payment notice">APN</abbr> (section 225A(2) <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014)</h3>

<p>Where an amount is specified in the <abbr title="Accelerated Payment notice">APN</abbr>, this prevents the company (<abbr title="Person">P</abbr>) (where the loss or other amount arose) from consenting to a claim for group relief in respect of that amount. If consent has already been given, <abbr title="Person">P</abbr> has 90 days to withdraw the consent. Any company that has already claimed the group relief must take the necessary action to amend its return to remove the relief.</p>

<h4>Example 18:</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Company A’s ‘chosen arrangements’ result in a £2,000,000 trading loss arising in its accounting period ended 31 December 2007. The conditions for giving an APN are satisfied and HMRC disputes that the £2,000,000 trading loss has arisen. Company A has no profits and no tax to pay, even if the loss is denied to it. Company A has no other losses available to surrender as group relief.
<br><br>
Company A agrees to surrender the £2,000,000 loss as group relief to company B, which reduces company B’s taxable profits and tax payment as a result.
<br><br>
The surrenderable loss and asserted surrenderable amount are both £2,000,000 as this is the amount that HMRC considers would not be a surrenderable loss of company A if the ‘chosen arrangements’ fail to achieve their aim.
<br><br>
HMRC gives an APN to company A, which has the effect that consent may not be given to company B’s £2,000,000 group relief claim. Company A has 90 days to make representations to HMRC, but if none are made (or if following representations, the APN is confirmed), then company A must withdraw the consent and company B must amend its return in accordance with paragraph 75(6) Schedule 18 FA 1998 and pay any additional tax that arises.</p>
</div>

<h4>Example 19: Loss originates in different accounting periods</h4>

<p>It is possible that the ‘chosen arrangements’ could result in a loss that arises over more than one accounting period. In such a case each accounting period will have an asserted surrenderable amount, and separate <abbr title="Accelerated Payment notices">APNs</abbr> will need to be given for each accounting period.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Using the same basic facts in example 15, except that, instead of the £2,000,000 trading loss arising in a single accounting period, it arises over 2 accounting periods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£1,500,000 in the accounting period ended 31 December 2007</li>
  <li>£500,000 in the accounting period ended 31 December 2008</li>
</ul>

<p>Company A surrenders these amounts in full to company B in respect of each accounting period.
Whilst the total trading loss arising by use of the ‘chosen arrangements’ is still £2,000,000, APNs will need to be given for each of the accounting periods where the losses arose.</p>

<p>In the accounting period ended:</p>

<ul>
  <li>31 December 2007 the surrenderable loss and asserted surrenderable amount are both £1,500,000</li>
  <li>31 December 2008 the surrenderable loss and asserted surrenderable amount are both £500,000</li>
</ul>

<p>The following APNs would need to be given to company A, instructing that consent may not be given to company B’s group relief claims:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£1,500,000 for the accounting period ended 31 December 2007</li>
  <li>£500,000 for the accounting period ended 31 December 2008</li>
</ul>

<p>As in example 15, company A has 90 days to make any representations to HMRC.
<br><br>
Example 22 gives details of what happens when a loss is carried forward and utilised in later accounting periods.</p>
</div>

<h4>Example 20:</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Company X engages in a DOTAS notifiable arrangement that creates a non-trading loan relationship (NTLR) debit of £12,000,000 which is in dispute with HMRC. The company has unrelated loan relationship credits of £10,000,000, so the net NTLR debit in the accounting period is £2,000,000 which is surrendered as group relief. 
<br><br>
In the same accounting period company X also has trading losses of £4,000,000 and management expenses of £3,000,000. These are not in dispute with HMRC and have also been surrendered as group relief: £3,000,000 to company Y (relating to the management expenses) and £6,000,000 to company Z (identified by company X as relating to the NTLR deficit and trading loss).
<br><br>
The total surrenderable loss for the period is:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <th scope="col">Amount</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">NTLR deficit</th>
      <td>£2,000,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Trading loss</th>
      <td>£4,000,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Management expenses</th>
      <td>£3,000,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Surrenderable loss/amount</th>
      <td>£9,000,000</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The ‘asserted surrenderable amount’ is £5,000,000. This is the £2,000,000 net NTLR debit that is in dispute and the £3,000,000 management expenses that are no longer available to surrender as group relief by virtue of s105(2) CTA 2010.
<br><br>
The effect of this is that company X profits chargeable to Corporation Tax are £7,000,000 (£10,000,000 minus £3,000,000 management expenses). The trading loss of £4,000,000 remains surrendered as group relief.
<br><br>
The conditions for giving an APN are satisfied so an APN can be given for the £12,000,000 which HMRC considers would not be a surrenderable loss of company X if the ‘chosen arrangements’ do not achieve their aim. The APN would both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>show the payment due from company X based on £7,000,000 at Corporation Tax rate</li>
  <li>instruct company X not to consent to any claim for group relief in respect of the £5,000,000 asserted surrenderable amount</li>
</ul>

<p>The result is that (subject to any representations that are made and upheld) the APN given to company X produces the following effects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>company Y must amend its return and pay any additional amount that arises from the withdrawal of the £3,000,000 group relief</li>
  <li>company Z must amend its return and pay any additional amount that arises from the withdrawal of the £2,000,000 group relief</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span> Claimant company cannot or does not amend their return (section 225A(6) and (7) <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014</h3>

<p>Where there is a current tax enquiry into the tax return of the company that claimed the group relief (the ‘claimant company’), existing rules mean that, although the claimant company can amend its return to remove the group relief claimed (when the company (<abbr title="Person">P</abbr>) withdraws the consent for group relief), that amendment cannot take effect during the enquiry. This means that there is no immediate effect on the amount to pay.</p>

<p>So, where this is the case, the new provisions allow HMRC to also give an <abbr title="Accelerated Payment notice">APN</abbr> to the claimant company requiring it to pay the amount in relation to the withdrawn group relief.</p>

<p>If the claimant company return is not under enquiry and it does not take action to remove the group relief from its return, HMRC may send a tax assessment to the claimant company, requiring it to pay the amount in relation to the withdrawn group relief. Where such an assessment is sent, the claimant company cannot request postponement of the tax under section 55 of the Taxes Management Act 1970.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.7 </span> If the company disagrees with the amount specified in an <abbr title="Accelerated Payment notice">APN</abbr> (section 222 <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014)</h3>

<p>There is no right of appeal against an <abbr title="Accelerated Payment notice">APN</abbr>. However, if the company disagrees with the amount specified in the <abbr title="Accelerated Payment notice">APN</abbr>, it has 90 days beginning with the day on which the notice is given to make written representations to HMRC. The grounds on which the company can make representations are that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the conditions for issuing the <abbr title="Accelerated Payment notice">APN</abbr> have not been met</li>
  <li>the amount specified in the <abbr title="Accelerated Payment notice">APN</abbr> is incorrect</li>
</ul>

<p>HMRC will consider any such representations and either confirm the <abbr title="Accelerated Payment notice">APN</abbr> (with or without amending it) or withdraw it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.8 </span> If the asserted surrenderable amount has not yet been fully utilised</h3>

<p>There may be instances where the asserted surrenderable amount has not been fully utilised against the company’s own profits, or surrendered as group relief. In such instances, the <abbr title="Accelerated Payment notice">APN</abbr> given will instruct the company not to consent to the group relief surrender. If the company subsequently claims to utilise the losses against its own profits for a later accounting period before the dispute is resolved, a further <abbr title="Accelerated Payment notice">APN</abbr> will be given — requiring payment of the amount due.</p>

<h4>Example 21:</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>A leasing company files its 2014 return on 31 December 2015. The return includes details of a DOTAS notifiable arrangement. Because the disclosure has been discussed before the return was filed, HMRC are in a position to open an enquiry and give an APN in January 2016. 
<br><br>
The arrangement generates trade capital allowances of £10,000,000 which are disputed by HMRC. These reduce what would have been trading profits of £2,000,000 to a loss of £8,000,000. At the time the APN is given, there are no claims for group relief from other group companies.
<br><br>
The surrenderable loss is £8,000,000 — which is the unused balance of the £10,000,000 generated loss. The asserted surrenderable amount is also £8,000,000.
<br><br>
A single APN can be given to the company both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for the amount due in respect of the £2,000,000 trading profit that is now chargeable to Corporation Tax as a result of disputed £10,000,000 trade capital allowances</li>
  <li>instructing it not to consent to any claim for group relief in respect of the £8,000,000 balance</li>
</ul>

<p>As there is no current claim to group relief there is nothing to pay in respect of the £8,000,000 asserted surrenderable amount at this time.<br>
<br><br>
Where an APN is given, representations can be made within 90 days.
<br><br>
If a subsequent group relief claim is made in respect of the £8,000,000 before the dispute is resolved, this will be refused, as it is not a valid claim because an APN has already been given preventing the surrender. There is no need to give a further APN.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.9 </span> What happens following a final determination (section 227A <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014)</h3>

<p>When a dispute involving potential group relief is finally determined, and the result is that there is group relief available to be surrendered, claimant companies can make a fresh claim for the group relief. The time limit for making a claim is 30 days after the amount is determined. Other time limits that would otherwise prevent this are relaxed by section 227A(2) and (3) <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014.</p>

<p>Even if all of the asserted surrenderable amount is then available for group relief, the original claim is not automatically reactivated. Instead, revised group relief surrenders and claims would need to be made within 30 days.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.10 </span> Partnerships that include a corporate partner</h3>

<p>Schedule 32 of <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014 contains provisions where a partner payment notice (<abbr title="partner payment notice">PPN</abbr>) is given to a partnership that includes a corporate partner. Where the corporate partner’s tax position includes relief for a disputed loss, HMRC can give a <abbr title="partner payment notice">PPN</abbr> to request payment for the amount due.</p>

<p>If a partnership generates a loss, whether consent for a group relief surrender can be given is a matter involving each individual company that is allocated the loss and there is no impact on the partnership as a whole, nor on any other member of the partnership. The extent to which a company that is a member of a partnership may surrender group relief is dependent solely on its own relationship to other companies in its group.</p>

<p>Paragraphs (4A) and (6A) of Schedule 32 to <abbr title="Finance Act">FA</abbr> 2014 set this out by referring to the ‘surrenderable loss’ of the partners and to the action that the partner must take. 
Section 2.16 of the main guidance contains further detail of how partnerships are affected by follower notices and accelerated payments.</p>

<h4>Example 22:</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Partnership K LLP files its return for the tax year ended 5 April 2006 by the due date and declares a DOTAS notifiable arrangement that creates £10,000,000 trade losses in the year, which are disputed by HMRC. Each partner is allocated its share of the loss, £6,000,000 of which is given to corporate partner company G Ltd for its accounting period ended 31 March 2006. Company G Ltd utilises its share of the loss as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£1,000,000 losses are set off against other profits of company G Ltd in its accounting period ended 31 March 2006</li>
  <li>£3,000,000 losses are surrendered as group relief to a number of group companies</li>
  <li>£1,500,000 losses are carried forward and set off against profits of company G Ltd in its accounting period ended 31 March 2007</li>
  <li>£500,000 losses are not yet been utilised and are still being carried forward</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a tax enquiry into partnership K LLP but not into company G Ltd.
<br><br>
The surrenderable loss is £6,000,000 which is company G Ltd’s share of the £10,000,000 disputed trade loss of K partnership LLP.
<br><br>
Based on the claims made in company G Ltd’s return, the asserted surrenderable amount is £3,500,000. This is the £3,000,000 surrendered as group relief and the £500,000 carried forward. Even though the £500,000 has not yet been utilised, it is not excluded from the provisions.
<br><br>
A PPN can be given to company G Ltd in relation to the £6,000,000 allocated loss in dispute:</p>

<ul>
  <li>showing the payment due in relation to the tax charge on the £1,000,000 loss utilised in its accounting period ended 31 March 2006</li>
  <li>showing the payment due in relation to the tax charge on the £1,500,000 losses carried forward and utilised against profits in its accounting period ended 31 March 2007</li>
  <li>instructing it not to consent to any claim for group relief in respect of the £3,500,000 asserted surrenderable amount</li>
</ul>
