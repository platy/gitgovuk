<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide is part of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/all-our-health-personalised-care-and-population-health">All Our Health</a>, a resource which helps health professionals provide better access to health and care, and promote wellbeing as part of their everyday practice. The information below will help front line health and care staff use their trusted relationships with patients, families and communities to address the impact of vulnerabilities. We recognise that health and care staff as individuals may also experience similar issues in their personal lives.</p>

<p>This guide also recommends important actions that managers and staff holding strategic roles can take.</p>

<h3>The meaning of vulnerability and other terms</h3>

<p>To aid the understanding of this guidance we have defined some of the terms used.</p>

<h4>Vulnerability</h4>

<p>Being <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/vulnerable" rel="external">vulnerable</a> is defined as in need of special care, support, or protection because of age, disability, risk of abuse or neglect.</p>

<h4>Childhood vulnerability</h4>

<p>There is no commonly used definition of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.instituteofhealthequity.org/resources-reports/build-back-fairer-the-covid-19-marmot-review" rel="external">childhood vulnerability</a>. A child can be vulnerable to risks and poor outcomes due to individual characteristics, the impact of action or inaction by other people and their physical and social environment.</p>

<h4>Vulnerable adults</h4>

<p>The NHS defines <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teenage-mothers-and-young-fathers-support-framework">vulnerable adults</a> as any adult (person over the age of 18) unable to take care of themselves or protect themselves from exploitation.</p>

<p>Many factors can influence adult vulnerability, experiences of vulnerability in childhood may negatively impact adults in later life – particularly if someone has fewer protective factors in place, such as a supportive family or a stable household income.</p>

<h4>Vulnerable background</h4>

<p>Children and young people’s physical, emotional and mental wellbeing are significantly shaped by the social determinants of health into which they are born, live, learn and grow. Traumatic events and adverse circumstances occurring in childhood are associated with long-term impact on outcomes at population level. This does not mean that every child experiencing trauma and adversity will experience poorer outcomes. Multiple factors influence outcomes – the presence of protective factors such as a supportive family will also be key influences.</p>

<h4>Protective and risk factors</h4>

<p>A protective factor is something that decreases the potential harmful effect of a risk factor.</p>

<p>Risk factors can increase the likelihood that a person may become vulnerable, however they may be a contributing factor and not necessarily a direct cause. Risk factors are not determinative and not everyone who is identified as at risk become vulnerable.</p>

<p>Risk and protective factors can be found in every area of a child or adolescent’s life, exerting different effects at different stages of development.</p>

<p>There is a complex interrelationship between the experiences an individual child has in a family and those they experience in the wider community. Negative experiences – both at home and in the community – may mean that children are not only at greater risk of poorer outcomes because of these experiences, but also of engaging in harmful activities as they grow up which increase their risks further. This can perpetuate inequality throughout life and from one generation to the next. It emphasises the importance of addressing the risk factors which make children more vulnerable at an individual level, but also in terms of the causes of wider risk factors in families and within a community.</p>

<h4>Trauma</h4>

<p>Trauma results from an event, series of events or set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as physically or emotionally harmful, or life threatening. This has lasting adverse effects on the individual’s functioning and mental, physical, social, emotional or spiritual wellbeing.</p>

<h4>Re-traumatisation</h4>

<p>Re-traumatisation is the re-experiencing of thoughts, feelings or sensations experienced at the time of a traumatic event or circumstance in a person’s past. Re-traumatisation is generally triggered by reminders of previous trauma which may or may not be potentially traumatic themselves.</p>

<h4>Trauma informed practice</h4>

<p>Trauma informed practice is an approach which is grounded in the understanding that trauma exposure can impact an individual’s neurological, biological, psychological and social development – thus shaping a person’s world view and relationship development.</p>

<p>Being trauma informed means assuming that people are more likely than not to have a history of traumatic experiences, and that these experiences may impact on their ability to feel safe within or develop trusting relationships with services and their staff.</p>

<p>Trauma informed practice is not designed to treat trauma related difficulties. It seeks to address the barriers that those affected by trauma can experience when accessing care and services by using the six principles of trauma informed practice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>safety</li>
  <li>trust</li>
  <li>choice</li>
  <li>collaboration</li>
  <li>empowerment</li>
  <li>cultural consideration</li>
</ul>

<h2>Addressing vulnerabilities in professional practice</h2>

<p>Vulnerability, traumatic experiences, and wider inequalities can impact on people’s health and wellbeing from childhood and across the life course. As health and care professionals, having an awareness that this impact is not always visible and understanding how best to support individuals accessing services who may be vulnerable, will enable care to be provided that is accessible, appropriate and effective.</p>

<p>Many definitions of vulnerability and vulnerable populations already exist with differing perspectives or contexts depending on the setting and experiences. Groups and individuals may be impacted by multiple vulnerabilities. Vulnerability may be temporal in nature, so specific populations may be at greater risk of poor health outcomes in times of crisis. Vulnerability is complex and multifaceted – addressing vulnerabilities requires an approach that reflects this dynamic.</p>

<p>This section of the guidance promotes an understanding of vulnerabilities and their effects across the life course. The approach considers both the adversities people experience and factors likely to make them more vulnerable to poor outcomes.</p>

<h3>The impact of vulnerability</h3>

<p>The cost of late intervention is estimated at £16.6 billion a year. While not all late intervention is avoidable, there are considerable resources being spent tackling issues that could have been dealt with sooner, and at less cost to the individual and to services. Some social determinants of health make people more vulnerable – addressing these factors should also reduce health inequalities more generally.</p>

<p>A lack of awareness about the impact of vulnerability can lead to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>social exclusion</li>
  <li>a lack of support or onward referral</li>
  <li>the potential for re-traumatisation</li>
</ul>

<p>There can be a link between the experience of trauma, sometimes from childhood, and the risk of a range of poor outcomes.</p>

<p>Vulnerability is complex and multifaceted, below are examples of some of the impacts vulnerability can have on an individual:</p>

<ul>
  <li>more likely to have lower educational attainment</li>
  <li>poor mental and physical health outcomes</li>
  <li>4 times more likely to have special educational needs (SEN) than child population overall</li>
  <li>more likely to become teenage parents</li>
  <li>association between children in care and offending</li>
  <li>isolation and loneliness</li>
  <li>more likely not to be in education, employment or training</li>
  <li>more likely to live in poverty and experience developmental delays</li>
  <li>more likely to have communication difficulties</li>
  <li>youth custody disproportional health needs (mental health, alcohol, and learning disability (LD)</li>
  <li>witnessing violence – increased risk smoking, obesity, depression and sexual behaviour</li>
  <li>housing – poor respiratory and mental health</li>
</ul>

<p>The presence of protective factors can make an individual less likely to experience poor outcomes, even when risk factors are present. When seeking to reduce the number of individuals experiencing the harmful effects of vulnerable circumstances or trauma, interventions need to consider building protective factors as well as reducing risk factors.</p>

<p>Vulnerabilities have become an even more important consideration in professional practice since COVID-19, as it has highlighted existing inequalities as well as having widespread economic and social impacts. Those who were not previously identified as vulnerable, may have become so as a result of the pandemic. Increased levels of loneliness, social isolation and reduced personal resilience have impacted young people and older adults, as well as the wider population. More generally, the underlying wider community and social conditions which can make at risk groups more vulnerable, which existed before the pandemic, are likely to remain.</p>

<h3>Addressing vulnerabilities</h3>

<p>By adopting a life course approach, we can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prevent vulnerability and adverse experiences</li>
  <li>intervene early when vulnerabilities arise</li>
  <li>mitigate the negative impact of these circumstances throughout the life course by creating a healthy and supportive environment</li>
</ul>

<p>Intervention should be based on place and address the social determinants which create health inequalities.</p>

<p>Individuals will process traumatic events in different ways as a result of the interaction between their own neurobiology, previous experiences of trauma and the type of support available to them, as well as the broader social context in which they live.</p>

<h3>Risk and protective factors</h3>

<p>Risk and protective factors may be found at an individual, family or environment level and can change over time depending on factors such as age. These factors are at the core of prevention strategies.</p>

<h4>Risk factors: individual</h4>

<p>Risk factors in individuals include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>genetic or biological</li>
  <li>perinatal trauma</li>
  <li>early malnutrition</li>
  <li>behavioural and learning difficulties</li>
  <li>alcohol and substance misuse</li>
  <li>traumatic brain injury</li>
  <li>gender</li>
</ul>

<h4>Risk factors: relationship</h4>

<p>Risk factors in relationships include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>low family income</li>
  <li>poor parenting and inconstant discipline</li>
  <li>family size</li>
  <li>abuse – emotional, physical or sexual</li>
  <li>emotional or physical neglect</li>
  <li>household alcohol or substance misuse</li>
  <li>household mental health</li>
  <li>family violence</li>
  <li>family breakdown</li>
  <li>household offending behaviour</li>
</ul>

<h4>Risk factors: community</h4>

<p>Risk factors in communities include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>unsafe or violent communities</li>
  <li>low social integration and poor social mobility</li>
  <li>lack of possibility for recreation</li>
  <li>lack of infrastructure for the satisfactions of needs and interest of young people</li>
</ul>

<h4>Risk factors: society</h4>

<p>Risk factors in societies include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>socio-economically deprived communities</li>
  <li>high unemployment</li>
  <li>homelessness or poor housing</li>
  <li>a culture of violence, norms and values which accept, normalise and glorify violence</li>
  <li>discrimination</li>
  <li>difficulties accessing services</li>
</ul>

<h4>Protective factors: individual</h4>

<p>Protective factors in individuals include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>healthy problem solving and emotional regulation skills</li>
  <li>school readiness</li>
  <li>good communication skills</li>
  <li>healthy social relationships</li>
</ul>

<h4>Protective factors: relationship</h4>

<p>Protective factors in relationships include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>stable home environments</li>
  <li>nurturing and responsive relationships</li>
  <li>strong and consistent parenting</li>
  <li>frequent shared activities with parents</li>
  <li>financial security and economic opportunities</li>
</ul>

<h4>Protective factors: community</h4>

<p>Protective factors in communities include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a sense of belonging and connectedness</li>
  <li>safe community environments</li>
  <li>community cohesion</li>
  <li>opportunities for sports and hobbies</li>
</ul>

<h4>Protective factors: society</h4>

<p>Protective factors in societies include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>good housing</li>
  <li>high standards of living</li>
  <li>opportunities for valued social roles</li>
</ul>

<p>Resilience is the capacity to bounce back from adversity – protective factors increase resilience, whereas risk factors increase vulnerability.</p>

<p>Resilient individuals, families and communities are more able to deal with difficulties and adversities than those with less resilience. It is important that resilience is strengthened at both an individual and societal level.</p>

<h3>The purpose of trauma informed practices</h3>

<p>There has been growing interest around trauma informed practices as an approach to mitigate the barriers that those affected by trauma can experience when accessing care and services.</p>

<p>Trauma informed practice aims to create safety for people accessing services by understanding the effects of trauma and its close links to health and behaviour. It is not about eliciting or treating people’s trauma, but about creating a safe space that enables people to access the services they need for their health and wellbeing. By adopting this approach with everyone accessing health and care services, professionals will enhance access for all – most notably for those who may find it more difficult to get the support they need.</p>

<h2>Core principles for health and care professionals</h2>

<p>When working to address the impact of vulnerabilities, all health and care professionals should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand specific activities and interventions that can address the impact of vulnerabilities</li>
  <li>think about the resources and services available in your area that can help people who are vulnerable or have experienced trauma</li>
  <li>understand the principles of trauma informed practice</li>
</ul>

<h2>Taking action</h2>

<p>This section of the guide sets out how strategic leaders, managers and clinicians can adopt a public health informed approach to reduce inequalities and improve health and wellbeing outcomes for the most vulnerable in our communities.</p>

<p>The aim is to think about what has happened to a person instead of what is wrong, and understand how trauma might impact how a person responds to you and others and why they make the decisions they do.</p>

<p>Applying the principles of trauma informed practice can help you to build a trusting relationship with someone accessing your services.</p>

<h3>Principles of trauma informed practice</h3>

<p>Consider applying the principles of trauma informed practice.</p>

<h4>Safety</h4>

<p>The list below includes ways to apply this principle – you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>put measures in place so that individuals feel emotionally and physically safe</li>
  <li>consider the wider impact of your actions</li>
  <li>ask what they need to feel safe and how you can create a safe environment for them</li>
  <li>keep the person informed</li>
  <li>do what you say you will do when you say you will do it</li>
</ul>

<h4>Trustworthiness</h4>

<p>The list below includes ways to apply this principle – you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be transparent and do what you say you will do</li>
  <li>explain what will happen next</li>
  <li>give relaxed, unhurried attention – listen effectively</li>
  <li>not overpromise – always manage expectations</li>
</ul>

<h4>Choice</h4>

<p>The list below includes ways to apply this principle – you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>listen to what the person wants</li>
  <li>if there is a choice – give it</li>
  <li>always explain clearly and transparently what will happen next</li>
  <li>validate any concerns as understandable and normal</li>
</ul>

<h4>Collaboration</h4>

<p>The list below are ways to apply this principle – you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ask what they need</li>
  <li>be clear about what will happen and what they have control over and choice in – empower them where possible</li>
  <li>understand local services and support agencies so that you can suggest places to go to access help</li>
</ul>

<h4>Empowerment</h4>

<p>The list below are ways to apply this principle – you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>validate people’s feelings and engage with them in a non-judgemental manner</li>
  <li>listen to what they need and ensure they are signposted or referred to appropriate support</li>
  <li>not take over – encourage and empower people to take positive action themselves (with your support if they want it)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cultural consideration</h4>

<p>The list below are ways to apply this principle – you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>open non-judgemental attitude</li>
  <li>have an awareness of your own cultural values and an awareness and acceptance of cultural differences</li>
  <li>consider how you can expand your own cultural awareness – familiarise with the worldviews of cultural groups other than your own</li>
  <li>ask people about their culture to understand their preferred language, how healthcare decisions are made in their family and whether their culture prohibits any healthcare procedure or tests</li>
</ul>

<h3>Training</h3>

<p>Psychological First Aid (PFA) is a globally recommended training for supporting people during crisis and emergency situations. These 2 courses equip staff, volunteers and community members to provide practical and emotional support, as well as recognising people at risk of distress:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/psychological-first-aid-for-children-and-young-people" rel="external">PFA for those supporting children and young people</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/psychological-first-aid-covid-19/1" rel="external">COVID-19: PFA</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Supervision</h3>

<p>Staff members should consider their own wellbeing and need for support, including accessing supervision where available.</p>

<h4>Team leaders or managers</h4>

<p>Having an awareness of vulnerabilities when providing healthcare is about more than access to health or care. It is about considering the wider determinants of health, and shaping services which focus on improving the health of those who face the greatest disadvantage and are at higher risk of poor outcomes over the life course.</p>

<p>As a team leader or manager you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be aware of how health inequalities impact on people’s lived experience</li>
  <li>build protective factors and promote resilience where possible</li>
  <li>be open to consider how certain practices and policies may unintentionally increase harm – particularly to those who have experienced trauma and discrimination and take action to change these</li>
  <li>create a working culture which is respectful and inclusive of people’s diverse life histories and models to staff – an approach which is followed through in their work with individuals</li>
  <li>identify staff learning and development needs in relation to vulnerabilities and trauma informed practice – provide access to appropriate training</li>
  <li>provide a psychologically safe environment for staff by ensuring adequate supervision is available</li>
  <li>consider your own wellbeing and need for support, including accessing supervision where available</li>
</ul>

<h4>Senior or strategic leaders</h4>

<p>To shape service provision to be as accessible as possible to those at greatest disadvantage in the local population, senior or strategic leaders should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>engage in full partnership – working to achieve the best outcome for the vulnerable child or adult</li>
  <li>embed a person centred engagement and risk management approach</li>
  <li>understand the wider health and wellbeing needs of your local population using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk" rel="external">fingertips tool</a> or other available data</li>
  <li>invest in workforce development and training to embed a system of trauma informed practice</li>
  <li>consider your own wellbeing and need for support, including accessing supervision where available</li>
</ul>

<h2>Understand local needs</h2>

<p>A good understanding of needs and assets within the local area is important to develop responses and identify who might benefit from these approaches, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (<abbr title="Joint Strategic Needs Assessment">JSNA</abbr>)</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/public-health-outcomes-framework" rel="external">Public Health Outcomes Framework</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/child-health-profiles/data#page/13" rel="external">Child Health Profiles</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/healthy-ageing/data#page/3/gid/1938133280/pat/6/par/E12000001/ati/102/are/E06000047/iid/91195/age/27/sex/4/cat/-1/ctp/-1/cid/4/tbm/1" rel="external">Productive Healthy Ageing Profile</a></li>
  <li>local intelligence</li>
