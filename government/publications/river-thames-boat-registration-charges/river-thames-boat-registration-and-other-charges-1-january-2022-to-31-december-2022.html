<p>The Environment Agency (Inland Waterways) Order 2010</p>

<p>Thames Conservancy Act 1966 (S6)</p>

<p>The National navigation boat charging scheme 2022 sets out the charges for all boats, kept or used on the River Thames from 1 January 2022. It is made under the powers of the Environment Agency to fix charges in section 6 Thames Conservancy Act 1966 and under article 23 of The Environment Agency (Inland Waterways) Order 2010.</p>

<p>The scheme will increase charges by 4% in 2023 and a further 2% in 2024. Charges will then continue at the 2024 values each year until the scheme is amended.</p>

<p>This requirement extends to every part of the non-tidal River Thames between Cricklade Bridge and Teddington Lock, and the short section of the tidal River Thames between Teddington Lock and the Port of London Authority’s boundary, including backwaters and marinas.</p>

<p>All boats have to register and pay the appropriate charge unless they are exempt from charge (go to section 11).</p>

<p>Annual charges are due on 1 January of each year, and they expire on 31 December each year.</p>

<p>If a powered or unpowered enclosed boat is registered for the first time part way through a registration year, then a pro rata (reduced) charge may apply in certain circumstances (go to section 17).</p>

<p>Visitor charges (monthly, weekly and daily) are due when coming onto the waterway and they expire after the defined period of the registration. They are valid from the date and time set when registering for the period. Boats kept on Environment Agency waterways are not eligible for visitor registrations.</p>

<p>Monthly visitor charges allow a boat to be on the waterway for consecutive 31 days.</p>

<p>Weekly visitor charges allow a boat to be on the waterway for 7 consecutive days.</p>

<p>Daily visitor charges allow a boat to be on the waterway for 24 hours. They are valid for 24 hours from the time of issue, or where issued in advance, valid for 24 hours from the date and time requested at application.  Where tidal conditions prevent moving off the waterway within the valid time, the valid time shall be extended by 12 hours to allow passage on the next tide. Any extension will be managed by staff at our tidal locks.</p>

<p>Explorer charges allow a boat to be on the waterway for up to 15 non consecutive days in the annual registration period. The ‘explorer’ option is only available for privately owned unpowered open boats.</p>

<p>When registering a boat, the registered owner is responsible to pay the full charge.</p>

<p>Charges for powered boats and unpowered enclosed boats are subject to a minimum charge of £10.80.</p>

<p>Words or expressions used herein shall have the same meaning as defined in the Acts and the Order and the National navigation boat charging schemes from 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Powered boats</h2>

<p>“powered boat” means a boat which is mechanically propelled by a combustion engine, steam engine, or electric motor.</p>

<h3>Annual charges for powered boats</h3>

<p>The annual charges for powered boats are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£22.76 per complete square metre for up to and including the first 80 square metres (minimum chargeable area of 5 square metres)</li>
  <li>£12.27 per complete square metre for every additional one over 80 square metres</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to calculate the charge for powered boats</h3>

<h4>Example for a boat of 5.7m length and 2m beam</h4>

<p>Step 1: Calculate the chargeable area by multiplying the length by the beam - 5.7 m x 2 m = 11.4 m</p>

<p>Step 2: Round down the chargeable area - 11.4 m = 11 m</p>

<p>Step 3: Multiply the chargeable area by the charge per square metre - 11 m x £22.76 = £250.36</p>

<h3>Annual charges for electrically powered boats</h3>

<p>“Electrically powered” means the power to propel the boat is solely from an electric motor.</p>

<p>Electrically powered boats shall pay 75% of the appropriate annual powered boat charge set out above.</p>

<h4>How to calculate the charge for electric powered boats:</h4>

<p>Step 1: work out the area of the boat</p>

<p>Step 2: use the powered boat rates in section 1 to calculate the powered boat charge</p>

<p>Step 3: multiply the result by 0.75</p>

<p>If a powered boat is registered for the first time part way through a registration year, then a pro rata (reduced) charge may apply in certain circumstances. Go to section 17 for more details.</p>

<p>“trade exemption” means an exemption, that has been granted by the Environment Agency, to a business operating on the waterways undertaking a boat sales, brokerage or repair business. The exemption is for boats under the business’s sole control which are moored afloat as demonstrator models, as stock for sale, on brokerage or being restored, refitted or repaired.</p>

<p>New trade exemption application charge: £15</p>

<p>Annual charge for a trade exemption: £100</p>

<p>These are for the Thames only.</p>

<h3>Replacement boat registration plate</h3>

<p>When a replacement registration plate is requested by a boat owner the charge for supplying this replacement plate is £11.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span> New boats on the waterway</h2>

<p>When a powered or unpowered enclosed boat is registered for the first time part way through a registration year, a pro rata (reduced) charge may apply in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>If a boat does not qualify then the full annual charge is applicable.</p>

<p>A ‘new part year registration’ will apply if the registration of a boat is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for the first time on the waterway</li>
  <li>by a new owner following the purchase of a previously registered boat</li>
  <li>a boat which has not been kept or used on the waterway by the existing owner for the previous annual registration period</li>
  <li>by the same owner following a period on ‘trade exemption’ for repair</li>
</ul>

<h3>Calculation of new part year charge</h3>

<p>When a new part year registration occurs after the start of the annual charge period, the charge payable shall be calculated as follows;</p>

<p>Charge = Annual charge x (number of months remaining in annual registration period (including the current month)/12</p>

<p>The annual registration period ends on 31 December on the Thames.</p>

<span class="number">20. </span> Footnotes</h2>

<h4>Footnote 1: Applying multiply reductions</h4>

<p>If more than one reduction applies, the value of each one is calculated on the declining net balance.</p>

<p>For example, if the full charge is £100 and the boat is eligible for the electric and not-for-profit or charity reductions, the net payable would be £100 – 25% = £75 – 75% = £18.75. Subject to the minimum charge for powered boats and unpowered enclosed boats.</p>

<h4>Footnote 2: Applying the increase</h4>

<p>Percentages have been applied and the charges rounded down to the nearest 1p, apart from charges for registrations sold at locks which have been rounded down to the nearest 10p for operations reasons.</p>
