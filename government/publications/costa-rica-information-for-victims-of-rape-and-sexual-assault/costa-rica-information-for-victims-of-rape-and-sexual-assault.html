<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>First steps</h2>

<p>It is your choice about what you do next, but this information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>contact the national emergency number on 911 (English-speaking operators usually available)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-in-costa-rica">British Embassy in Costa Rica</a>. Embassy staff will be polite, patient, sensitive and non-judgmental, and can provide information on local police and medical procedures. Anything you tell them will be treated in the strictest confidence. They can contact your family or friends for you if you wish.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are different organisations involved. The Judicial Police (OIJ) are similar to the CID in the UK. They work closely with the Fiscalia (like the CPS in the UK) who direct the investigation and compile evidence including formal statements. The Court/Tribunal is responsible for keeping you informed of developments once an accused has been charged.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>If you want to report the incident to the Judicial Police in Costa Rica:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You should report the crime in Costa Rica before returning to the UK if you want it to be investigated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as you can, so that forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it more difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, consider taking those you were wearing to the police.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items that may retain traces of the offender such as condoms, clothing and bedclothes, and mobile phone texts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you decide to approach the Judicial Police directly, a list of offices in Costa Rica is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://sitiooij.poder-judicial.go.cr/index.php/oficinas/ubicanos" rel="external">Public Ministry website</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you approach the Judicial Police directly, you may want to ask them to inform the British Embassy, who can provide you with consular support.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tell the Judicial Police if you think you have been drugged.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Request that you get a police report, and request a translation in English.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are a victim of violence you may wish to contact the National Institute of Women (Instituto Nacional de la Mujer - INAMU). You can do so as below:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Through the 9-1-1 platform (ask the operator to transfer you to the INAMU direct line).</li>
      <li>Visiting the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/INAMU+Centro+de+Servicios+de+Atencion/@9.9315571,-84.0732716,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8fa0e364ebd54c0b:0x5a0a719a52f9bebd!8m2!3d9.9315518!4d-84.0710829?hl=en" rel="external">INAMU Women’s Delegation</a>, located at the main entrance of the National Museum, 75 meters to the south, on the Boulevard of the Judicial Circuit.</li>
      <li>Through the Regional Units of INAMU, (see contact details in the “getting further help” section below).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Emergency numbers</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When contacting 911, you will be asked for your identification (usually passport or ID number), address, contact details to receive notifications (email), details of the crime.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Calling 911 gives you access to the Judicial Police, Red Cross, the uniformed police (Fuerza Pública), the National Institute of Women (INAMU), the National Institute for the Welfare of Children (PANI), and the National Health Service (CCSS often called ‘The Caja’).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can contact the British Embassy on +506 22582025 and select “Consular Support” to discuss your options at any stage of the process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be no need for you to surrender your passport whilst any investigation is carried out.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>If you do not want to report the incident to the Judicial Police in Costa Rica</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The British embassy will still be able to support you. This includes helping you access medical services, arrange to contact your insurance company, getting in touch with your family, information on travel back to the UK and providing you with information about support in Costa Rica and the UK. They can give you lists of English-speaking lawyers and translators.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is your choice whether to report the crime. If you don’t report it, your case may not be investigated, especially if there is no forensic evidence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In certain circumstances, medical services may be obliged to report the crime to the authorities. However, it would still be your decision whether Court proceedings should go ahead or not, unless you are under 18 years old, where cases will always be investigated and taken to trial, even without a complaint.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will not undergo a forensic examination, but you will still be able to get medical attention.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Doctors are obliged to report cases of Rape and Sexual Assault against children to the Judicial Police and Fiscalía (Prosecutors). Where children are involved the investigation will be carried out with support from Patronato Nacional de la Infancia (National Children and Adolescent Welfare Institute - PANI) and the Caja Costarricense del Seguro Social (NHS equivalent).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>If you want to report the incident to the police in the UK</h2>

<p>It is possible to report the crime to police in the UK. However, it is for overseas police forces to investigate crimes in their jurisdiction. UK police forces cannot usually investigate crimes committed overseas.</p>

<p>Local police forces can decide to request assistance from the UK police, but this cannot be guaranteed and is a very lengthy process. It can therefore be very difficult to guarantee that justice can be accessed without reporting the crime locally.</p>

<p>Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/victim-of-rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad">Rape and Sexual Assault: Returning to the UK after Rape or Sexual Assault Abroad</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Reporting the crime in Costa Rica - what happens next?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Judicial Police will ask you to make a statement about the crime.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can request an officer of a particular gender although there is no guarantee one will be available. An interpreter will be provided by the local police if needed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Judicial Police will normally keep clothes and other evidence for forensic examination.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a medical evaluation has not already taken place, this will be a priority.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you consent, the Judicial Police may refer you to a local hospital or to the Public Ministry’s clinics for a forensic medical examination.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Attending a forensic medical examination – what to expect</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If the Judicial Police (OIJ) and/or Fiscalía (Prosecutor’s Office) are involved from the start, they will accompany you to the hospital for evaluation and treatment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Medical personnel will check for external injuries, and may take swabs, DNA, urine and blood tests and check for STI’s. Urgent consideration is given to antivirals in the first 72 hours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consular personnel can discuss with you any support you may need at the hospital and help in arranging that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Forensic Medical Examiner (FME), will conduct the examination. If there is no FME available out of hours, other trained medical personnel from a hospital or medical centre will be made available.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Medical Treatment</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When the victim of a Rape or Sexual Assault goes directly to the hospital first, to have injuries treated or to avoid possible infections, medical staff are required by law to contact the Judicial Police.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will enable the victim to have access to the Fiscalia and the Judicial Police. This does not mean that you must press charges but it does mean that the police will carry out an initial assessment of the case and see whether there are public interest reasons for looking into the circumstances further.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The treating physician must report immediately all cases involving children under 18 years of age, or people who lack the mental capacity to make their own decision, where the Judicial Police are not already involved.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first 72 hours after the event, victims should be offered psychosocial first aid as part of the treatment process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hospital medical staff are able to give advice on HIV medication and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), to help to prevent HIV infection.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>HIV PEP medication and Emergency Contraception need to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective (HIV PEP ideally within 6-8 hours).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The UK NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28-day PEP treatment on return to the UK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Victims of sexual assault can get free emergency contraception in any medical centre or hospital without a prescription or medical referral. Additionally, this type of medication is available in any local pharmacy, at your own cost, without prescription.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of emergency medical care to victims is covered by the State. The Judicial Police will usually be involved, at least initially, and treatments are free. This should be the case even if you decide not to proceed with a complaint.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you have been given medication while overseas, you may wish to keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication, so that you can let your doctor know about it when you return home.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Police investigations in Costa Rica – what to expect</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Judicial Police first contact will be limited to general information gathering, verifying that the case is a sexual crime and an initial verbal first account.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This verbal first account is not regarded as the Formal Police Report.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Victims are not usually asked to return to the scene of the crime or asked to make an identification of a suspect at this stage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the victim is over the age of 18, without mental disability, is not under the influence of drink or drugs or other impairment, they will be expected to make a full statement. This should be done by the Fiscalia and you should only expect to have to give one detailed account. This is usually audio recorded.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to obtain financial compensation from an offender, you should ask about filing an “accessory civil claim” (in Spanish, acción civil resarcitoria) against the offender at the same time you report the crime. You can appoint your own lawyers but, if you prefer, the public lawyers will help you to carry out the process at no cost.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the initial actions are complete, victims may return to their home country or continue their travels to another country. The remainder of the case, including evidence at trial, can be carried out virtually.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only prosecution and defence lawyers will have access to the victim’s case notes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the police make an arrest, they will take the suspect before the public prosecutor, who will then either:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>order the person to immediate trial</li>
      <li>refer the case for further investigation. The Court will either order the detention of the suspect in prison or release them on bail, pending trial.</li>
      <li>release the suspect if they believe there is insufficient evidence to prosecute.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Court procedures – what to expect</h2>

<ul>
