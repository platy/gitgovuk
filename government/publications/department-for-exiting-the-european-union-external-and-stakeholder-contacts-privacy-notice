<p>Privacy notices explain in more detail how the Department will handle your data in specific circumstances. The purpose for which we are processing personal data is to allow external contacts and stakeholders to be contacted, and have information shared where applicable.</p>

<p>This notice sets out how we will use your personal data, and your rights. It is made under
Articles 13 and/or 14 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>The purpose for which we are processing your personal data is so that we can communicate
with you.</p>

<p>The personal information is processed for the purpose of making contact with individuals for
the following business purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>making contact with suppliers about services actually or prospectively provided by
them (for example, personal information about contact persons at suppliers we use,
or about suppliers we may choose to use for occasional tasks).</li>
  <li>making contact with individuals to inform them, or seek their views, about
departmental policies or proposals, outside of a formal consultation process (for
example, contact details for people in charities or representative bodies).</li>
  <li>making contact with customers or clients about services or information provided to
them by the Department.</li>
  <li>making contact with officials in other departments or public bodies (including other
governments) to discuss policy proposals or development, communications activity,
or operational matters.</li>

<h2 id="legal-basis-of-processing">Legal basis of processing</h2>

<p>The legal basis for processing your personal data is that processing is necessary for the

<h2 id="recipients">Recipients</h2>

<p>Your personal data may be shared by us with other government bodies, including

development of government policy.</p>

<p>Your personal data may be shared by us with a GDPR-compliant, approved third party, with
the role of distributing large volumes of emails, or who provide events management services.

storage services to us.</p>

<h2 id="retention">Retention</h2>
<p>Personal data will be held in order to make contact with individuals in particular roles.
Personal data may be deleted at any time if you ask us to do so. We will contact you via
email periodically following your receipt of the initial notice to check that your contact email
address is still accurate and to remind you of the opportunity to check and/or ask us to
delete your data.</p>

<p>Where personal data was not collected by the Department, it was obtained by other
GDPR-compliant government departments and agencies.</p>

<h2 id="your-rights">Your rights</h2>

<p>You have the right to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>request information about how your personal data are processed, and to request a
copy of that personal data</li>
  <li>request that any inaccuracies in your personal data are rectified without delay</li>
  <li>request that any incomplete personal data are completed, including by means of a
supplementary statement</li>
  <li>request that your personal data are erased if there is no longer a justification for them
to be processed</li>
  <li>in certain circumstances (for example, where accuracy is contested) to request that
the processing of your personal data is restricted</li>
  <li>object to the processing of your personal data</li>
  <li>object to the processing of your personal data where it is processed for direct
marketing purposes</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="international-transfers">International transfers</h2>

<p>As your personal data is stored on our IT infrastructure, and shared with our data
processors, it may be transferred and stored securely outside the European Union. Where
that is the case it will be subject to equivalent legal protection through the use of Model
