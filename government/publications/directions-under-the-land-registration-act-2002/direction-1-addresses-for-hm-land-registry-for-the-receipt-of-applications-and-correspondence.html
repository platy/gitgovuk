<h3>Addresses</h3>

<p>b. type of customer specified in Column 1.</p>

<h3>Receipt of applications</h3>

<p>3.Applications for registration or correspondence in connection with an application must not be marked “Private and confidential” or “Private” or “Confidential”. Any applications or correspondence so marked and sent to HM Land Registry will be redirected from the address in Schedule 2 to an office listed in Schedule 1 and will be
either:</p>

<p>a. inspected, and if found to be an application for registration, or a document connected with an application for registration, returned to the address indicated in Schedule 2 for scanning, or</p>

<p>b. returned to the customer, for the application or correspondence to be sent to HM Land Registry without such marking.</p>

<p>The application will not be received for the purpose of rule 15 of the Land Registration Rules 2003 until received at the HM Land Registry address specified in Schedule 2 for the second time as a result of step 3(a), or until it is received without the markings following step 3(b) above.</p>

<p>4.Any applications sent to an HM Land Registry office address other than as specified in the table in Schedule 2:</p>

<p>a. will be redirected by the registrar to an address specified in the table in Schedule 2, and</p>

<p>b. will not be received for the purpose of rule 15 of the Land Registration Rules 2003 until received at such redirected address.</p>

<p>5.The office name to be inserted after the words “HM Land Registry” in any address shown in Schedule 2 to this direction is:</p>

<p>a. the name of the office where the customer team of the customer (if any) is located, or</p>

<p>b. if the customer does not have a customer team, the name of the office closest to the location of the customer,
in either case being one of the offices listed in Schedule 1.</p>

<p>6.If the name of any office listed in Schedule 1 is omitted from the address where indicated by “XXXXXX Office” after the words “HM Land Registry” in Schedule 2, the application will be received for the purposes of rule 15 of the Land Registration Rules 2003 when it is received at the appropriate address shown in Schedule 2.</p>
