<h2>Direction given under section 100(4) of the Land Registration Act 2002</h2>

<h3>Interpretation</h3>

<h3>Condition</h3>

<p>3.Where a conveyancer has verified a person’s identity by way of an online video call, form ID5, to which there is a hyperlink in Practice Guide 67A, must be completed in accordance with Practice Guide 67A and must accompany form ID1 or form ID2.</p>

<h3>Exceptions to the requirement to produce evidence of identity</h3>

<p>f. Exception F - the legal charge up to £10,000 to a local authority in respect of a service charge loan exception;</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>(2) where the application is in Form DS2 or Form AP1 and the lender is discharging a registered charge in Form DS1, or the application is in Form AP1 and the lender is releasing a registered charge in Form DS3, and the lender:</p>
