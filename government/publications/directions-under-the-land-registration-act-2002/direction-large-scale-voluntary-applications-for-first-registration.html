<h2>Direction given under section 100(4) of the Land Registration Act 2002 and rule 24 of the Land Registration Rules 2003</h2>

<p>On behalf of the Chief Land Registrar I direct, under section 100(4) of the Land Registration Act 2002 and rule 24(1) of the Land Registration Rules 2003 as follows:</p>

<h3><span class="number">1.Interpretation </span></h3>

<p>In this direction:</p>

<p>“land unit” means a separate area of land not adjoining any other unregistered land affected by the same application,</p>

<p>“large scale application” means an application which relates to 20 or more land units,</p>

<p>“voluntary application” means an application for first registration made under section 3 of the Land Registration Act 2002, and includes an application to register mines and minerals held apart from the surface, but excludes an application to register any of the interests referred to in section 3(1)(b), (c) and (d) (a rentcharge, franchise, and profit a prendre in gross),</p>

<p>and “large scale voluntary application” shall be construed accordingly.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.Scope </span> and Direction</h3>

<p>2.1 This direction applies only to a large scale voluntary application.</p>

<p>2.2 This direction has effect on and after 12 February 2018 and replaces the Direction of 4 January 2017 (Large Scale Voluntary Applications for First Registration).</p>

<h3><span class="number">3.Direction </span></h3>

<p>3.1 Before a large scale voluntary application is made, or where a large scale voluntary application has been delivered to HM Land Registry, the registrar will consider the need for an agreement with the applicant pursuant to this direction.</p>

<p>3.2 Where the registrar is satisfied that an agreement is required to facilitate the conduct of the business of registration, he may require an agreement in writing between the registrar and the applicant, in accordance with this direction.</p>

<p>3.3 The agreement may include provisions relating to the following:</p>

<p>a. the evidence required to identify the land clearly on the Ordnance Survey map</p>

<p>b. the deeds and other documents relating to the title that will be lodged pursuant to rule 24(1)</p>

<p>c. the form in which these documents, or any of them, are to be lodged, including whether by way of originals or certified copies, and whether in hard-copy or electronic form</p>

<p>d. a requirement for the applicant to deposit the documents including form FR1 in a secure online repository designated for this purpose by the registrar, for storage prior to processing of the application</p>

<p>e. the number of land units to be included in the application, and</p>

<p>f. the payment of the appropriate fee.</p>

<p>3.4 If the registrar requires such an agreement, he may delay the processing of the application until the agreement has been signed by or on behalf of the applicant.</p>

<p>3.5 The agreement will include a provision that an application lodged in accordance with this direction is received for the purposes of rule 15(3)(b) of the Land Registration Rules 2003 only when the registrar enters it in the day list.</p>

<h3><span class="number">4.Agreement </span></h3>

<p>Before lodging a large scale voluntary application an applicant should contact HM Land Registry as set out in Section 3 of Practice Guide 33 to discuss whether an agreement as described in paragraph 3 of this direction is needed.</p>

General Counsel and Deputy Chief Land Registrar <br>
