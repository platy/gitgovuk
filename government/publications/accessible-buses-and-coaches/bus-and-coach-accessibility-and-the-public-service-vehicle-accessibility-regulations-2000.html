<h2>Vehicles covered</h2>

<p>The Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations (<abbr title="Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations">PSVAR</abbr>) applies to all new public service vehicles (buses or coaches):</p>

<ul>
  <li>introduced since 31 December 2000</li>
  <li>with a capacity exceeding 22 passengers</li>
  <li>used to provide a local or scheduled service</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where <abbr title="Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations">PSVAR</abbr> applies</h2>

<p><abbr title="Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations">PSVAR</abbr> applies in England, Scotland and Wales and are the responsibility of the Department for Transport. Northern Ireland has introduced separate regulations. These are the responsibility of the Department for Infrastructure.</p>

<h2>Timescale</h2>

<p>All full-size single deck buses over 7.5 tonnes will be fully accessible from 1 January 2016, and all double deck buses from 1 January 2017.</p>

<p>New buses weighing up to 7.5 tonnes and coaches have been required to have wheelchair access from 1 January 2005.</p>

<p>All buses weighing up to 7.5 tonnes have been required to be fully accessible from 1 January 2015 and coaches will be fully accessible from 1 January 2020.</p>

<h2>Compliance</h2>

<p>The Department for Transport provides the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) with a specific fund to enforce the requirements outlined in the <abbr title="Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations">PSVAR</abbr>. We work with DVSA colleagues to ensure that <abbr title="Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations">PSVAR</abbr> compliance is monitored closely and that any bus or coach operator found to be in breach of these regulations is dealt with accordingly. Non-compliance with <abbr title="Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations">PSVAR</abbr> is a criminal offence (under the Equality Act 2010) and carries a fine not exceeding Level 4 on the standard scale (currently Â£2,500).</p>

<h2>Improved bus access for disabled people</h2>

<p>The powers of the Equality Act 2010 allow the government to make regulations requiring all new land-based public transport vehicles (trains, taxis, buses and coaches) to be accessible to disabled people, including those who need to remain in wheelchairs.</p>

<p>The regulations that govern access to buses and coaches are known as <abbr title="Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations">PSVAR</abbr>. <abbr title="Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations">PSVAR</abbr> has been applied to all new buses and coaches which carry more than 22 passengers and are used on local or scheduled services since 31 December 2000.</p>

<h2>Low floor buses</h2>

<p>Low floor buses have been introduced in increasing numbers. This change was promoted both by the Department for Transport, through a series of research and demonstration projects, and by our statutory advisers, the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (<abbr title="Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee">DPTAC</abbr>).</p>

<p><abbr title="Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations">PSVAR</abbr> does allow for high floor vehicles, but bus operators and manufacturers of full-size single deck and double deck buses have, by and large, opted for low floor vehicles.</p>

<p>Over one third of full-size local buses are now low floor vehicles rising to over 80% in major urban areas. Over 90% of the London fleet comprises low floor vehicles.</p>

<h2>Assistance from bus drivers for disabled people boarding</h2>

<p>The Public Service Vehicles (Conduct of Drivers, Inspectors, Conductors and Passengers (Amendment) Regulations 2002 have since 1 October 2002 required the bus driver or conductor to provide reasonable assistance to disabled people, including wheelchair users, to board and alight.</p>

<p>These regulations only apply to public service vehicles, but we strongly recommend that operators adopt those practices for all their buses.</p>

<p>There is also the REAL disability equality training programme, which has been created on behalf of the Department for Transport to improve the sectorâs confidence and skills in delivering inclusive journeys for disabled passengers. This can be found here: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/real-training-bus-and-coach-modules">REAL training: bus and coach modules - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk).</a></p>

<p>It is in the best interests both of the bus driver and the passenger if the driver is fully aware of the needs of disabled passengers and how to respond to them. However, the regulations do allow the driver to refuse to help a passenger if doing so would adversely affect their health or safety, that of other passengers, or the safety of the vehicle.</p>

<h2>Wheelchair suitability for buses</h2>

<p>The Department for Transport commissioned Ricability to produce a guide, Wheels within Wheels, which outlines what wheelchair users can expect from newer trains, coaches, buses and taxis. It has information on how passengers can find out where accessible services are running and gives tips on travelling in a wheelchair. It also lists the key dimensions of the wheelchairs currently available in the United Kingdom, and which of those will fit onto public transport.</p>

<h2>Complaints</h2>

<p>You should contact the appropriate bus operating company or, in the case of London, Transport for London.</p>

<p>If this does not prove satisfactory, then you can contact Bus Users UK, an independent body set up to ensure bus passengers have a voice with the industry. Scotland has its own Bus Users Complaints Tribunal or, for transport in London, the London Transport Users Committee.</p>

<h2>Coaches on leisure trips</h2>

<p><abbr title="Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations">PSVAR</abbr>&nbsp;only applies to new public service vehicles with a carrying capacity of more than 22 passengers that are used on local or scheduled services and have been introduced into service since 31 December 2000.</p>

<h2>Audible and visible announcements on buses</h2>

<p>Trials of audible and visual announcements on buses in Leeds during 2001 showed that their introduction on buses, whilst well received by passengers, did present some technical challenges. We are monitoring the progress of new technologies designed to address these issues and regularly review how best to ensure the wider adoption of such systems within the UK bus fleet.</p>

<h2>Bus accessibility guidance</h2>

<p>We have published this guidance for vehicle manufacturers and operators to assist in achieving compliance with the regulations. Please note, however, that this guidance does not replace, nor does it qualify the regulations in any way, and, in every case, reference should be made to the relevant provisions of the <abbr title="Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations">PSVAR</abbr> themselves to determine the precise extent of the legal requirements.</p>

<h2>Exemptions</h2>

<p>Under the Equality Act 2010, the Secretary of State of Transport may authorise, by means of a special authorisation order, the use of a regulated public service vehicle which does not comply with accessibility regulations. It is important to note that a vehicle that does not meet all the requirements of the accessibility regulations cannot be issued with an accessibility certificate.</p>

<p>Before a special authorisation order is issued it will normally be necessary for a full accessibility inspection to be carried out. A vehicle will have to comply fully with accessibility regulations apart from those items for which a special authorisation is granted.</p>

<p>Detailed guidance on applying for special authorisation orders has been produced. Manufacturers and operators are advised to read this before submitting an application for a special authorisation order.</p>

<p>Applications for medium-term exemptions (MTEs) from <abbr title="Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations">PSVAR</abbr> were recently processed by the Department.
