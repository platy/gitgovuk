<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>1.1. Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) has created the Kickstart Scheme which allows employers and gateways to bid for grant funding to create new employment opportunities for the public benefit based on eligibility criteria specified by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> (Kickstart Scheme). The Grant Recipient was successful in that process and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has awarded it a grant to support the Grant Recipient in providing employment for 16 to 24 year olds claiming Universal Credit and referred by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>1.2. This Grant Agreement sets out the terms and conditions which apply to the Grant Recipient receiving the Grant from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and the Grant Recipient have agreed that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will provide the Grant up to the Maximum Sum per Participant as long as the Grant Recipient uses the Grant in accordance with this Grant Agreement and otherwise complies with its terms.</p>

<h2>Annex 2: The funded activities</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Background/purpose of the Grant</h3>

<p>The Kickstart Scheme is designed to improve employability and the chances of sustained employment for those at risk of long term unemployment in the 16-24-year-old age group. It provides grant funding to employers to support the creation of new jobs that would not otherwise exist.</p>

<p>The Kickstart Scheme funding will support employers to provide 6 months of work for young people. It will be regular, paid work which will help young people to develop transferrable skills (such as team work) and demonstrate to future employers that they have a track record of being a reliable employee with an up-to-date reference.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Aims and objectives of the Funded Activities</h3>

<p>The Grant funding will support the Grant Recipient to provide a quality work experience to individuals at risk of long term unemployment in the 16-24-year-old age group. The work should incentivise positive behaviours from these individuals to make them more attractive to future employers and maximise their readiness to make a successful transition into long term employment, giving them the confidence and competence to succeed. As such, the Kickstart Scheme aims to reduce the scarring effect of unemployment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Funded Activities</h3>

<p>The Grant Recipient will use the Grant funding to provide 6 months of employment for Participants, including support to Participants in developing work skills and finding future employment. The activities funded with the Grant are described more fully below:</p>

<p>a. The employment opportunities created with the funding will be equivalent to jobs not funded by the Kickstart Scheme. The jobs will have the same expectation on the employee to improve and develop. The jobs should enable the employee to build up skills that will lead to sustainable employment and should be paid at the normal rate for similar jobs and with the same frequency (see note 6 below).</p>

<p>b.	The Grant funding will be used by the Grant Recipient to provide new jobs. The jobs must not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>replace existing or planned vacancies; or</li>
  <li>cause existing employees, workers, apprentices or contractors to lose work or reduce their working hours</li>
</ul>

<p>c. All Kickstart Scheme jobs must be accompanied by a written job description, setting out the purpose, start date and responsibilities of the position</p>

<p>d. All employment opportunities supported by the Grant funding must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide regular, meaningful work for the Participant, for a minimum of 25 hours per week on average each month, for 6 months (see note 5 below); and</li>
  <li>pay at least the National Minimum Wage/National Living Wage (as applicable) for the Participant’s age group, national insurance and minimum automatic enrolment contributions</li>
</ul>

<p>The Grant Recipient must make the required employer national insurance contributions for Participants and comply with its employer automatic enrolment duties with respect to Kickstart Scheme Participants. The Grant Recipient must meet its statutory duties in relation to employment rights and employer responsibilities in the workplace (for example, for health, safety and welfare) for all Kickstart Scheme Participants.</p>

<p>e. Employment opportunities offered by the Grant Recipient should not require Participants to undertake extensive training (either classroom or online) before they begin the job or at any point during the 6 months. For example, if a significant part of the job involves completing a training course or watching training videos, this would not constitute meaningful work or be equivalent to a job not funded by the Kickstart Scheme.</p>

<p>f. The Grant Recipient will use the Grant to provide employability support to Participants and help Participants to develop work skills.</p>

<ul>
  <li>employability support includes on-the-job training, work search support, transferrable skills development, mentoring, careers advice and other related support to help the Participants find sustained employment after they have completed their Kickstart Scheme jobs</li>
  <li>helping participants to develop and build work skills includes developing attendance management, timekeeping, teamwork and communication skills as appropriate</li>
</ul>

<p>g. The Grant Recipient will ensure it has regular (at least monthly) reviews with Participants to discuss performance in the role and areas for improvement.</p>

<p>Please note:</p>

<p>1. A Kickstart job is not an apprenticeship but a Participant may move to an apprenticeship whilst taking part in the Kickstart Scheme. Grant funding will cease once a Participant ceases to be involved in the Kickstart Scheme (for example, because the Participant has moved from a Kickstart Scheme job to an apprenticeship).</p>

<p>2. Once a Kickstart Scheme job is created, it can be taken up by a new Participant once the previous Participant has ceased to be employed as part of the Kickstart Scheme. A Kickstart Scheme job cannot be filled more than once by the same Participant.</p>

<p>3.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will only provide Grant funding for candidates referred to the Grant Recipient by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> selects the candidates to refer to the Grant Recipient’s Kickstart Scheme vacancies at <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s sole discretion. Any recruitment activity by the Grant Recipient will not determine which candidates <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> refers to the Grant Recipient.</p>

<p>4.	The Grant Recipient will use reasonable endeavours to fill its vacancies as quickly as possible but is not otherwise obliged to accept candidates referred by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> for its vacancies. Grant funding will only be provided once the Grant Recipient has accepted a candidate referred by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>5.	All Kickstart Scheme jobs must provide regular, meaningful work for Participants for 6 months. A job should not be designed to spread the 6 months of work over a longer period than 6 continuous months. For example, a job spread across 7 months, with a one month break from work in the middle of it, will not be providing regular, meaningful work for the Participant. The Grant Recipient must notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> if any Participant is unable to carry out regular, meaningful work at any point during the 6 month Kickstart Scheme employment (as per clause 7.2.2).</p>

<p>6.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> expects the Grant Recipient to treat the Participants fairly and no less favourably than other staff members doing similar work with similar experience who are recruited outside the Kickstart Scheme. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> does not expect Participants to be paid less or less frequently than other new joiners in a similar position simply because the Participants are part of the Kickstart Scheme. The Grant is a contribution only and may not cover the full remuneration that the Grant Recipient should pay its Participants.</p>

<h2>Annex 3: Payment schedule</h2>

<p>Subject to the Grant Recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Grant Agreement, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will make Grant payments in accordance with the following payment schedule for each Participant employed by the Grant Recipient as part of the Kickstart Scheme. The Grant funding per Participant will be paid in the following instalments:</p>

</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>A Grant instalment will usually be received by the Grant Recipient up to 11 Working Days after it has been processed by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Calculating the Total Grant:</h4>

<p>Total Grant means the total grant funding provided per Participant which includes (i) an initial instalment of £1500 and (ii) 6 further instalments based on 100% of the Relevant Wage for 25 hours a week of work by the Participant for 26 weeks, plus the associated employer National Insurance contributions and employer minimum automatic enrolment contributions.</p>

<p>Relevant Wage means the National Minimum Wage or the National Living Wage applicable to the Participant based on their age at the end of the 6 months of employment funded by the Kickstart Scheme.</p>

<p>Grant instalments are calculated on the basis of the National Minimum Wage or National Living Wage rates applicable at the time payment is made. Where a grant instalment is to be made at the end of a period that spans 2 different rates (for example, where as a result of the April uprating, a payment period spans 2020/21 rates and 2021/22 rates), that instalment will be calculated on the basis of the higher rates. For example, if a Participant starts work in a Kickstart Scheme job on 10 February 2021 and is 21 years old at the end of the 6 months of work, the Grant instalment after the first month of work should be based on 2020/21 rates, the next instalment (spanning 2020/21 and 2021/22 rates) should be based on 2021/22 rates because they are higher, and all further instalments of the Grant should be based on 2021/22 rates.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<h4>1. Leaving the Kickstart Scheme early</h4>

<p>If, prior to the expiry of the intended 6-month period, a Participant ceases or will cease to be part of the Kickstart Scheme during any month (for example, because the Participant leaves their Kickstart Scheme job or their employment is otherwise terminated), the Grant Recipient must notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> as per clause 7.2.1. This allows <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to note that the Participant is no longer involved in the Kickstart Scheme and Eligible Expenditure with respect to that Participant is ending. A final grant instalment payment will be made for that Participant on the same schedule, and subject to the same conditions, described in this Annex 3. No further grant instalments will then be paid in respect of that Participant. Please note that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Neither the first instalment nor any subsequent instalments of the Grant will be due or payable for any Participant who does not start their Kickstart Scheme job (see note 5 below).</li>
  <li>If a Participant ceases their Kickstart Scheme job without completing a full day of work, then neither the 2nd instalment nor any subsequent instalments of the Grant will be due or payable to the Grant Recipient for that Participant. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> determines that a full day of work has been completed if the <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> submission for a Participant shows that the Participant has been paid the Relevant Wage for at least 5 hours of work.</li>
  <li>By way of example:
    <ul>
      <li>if a Participant starts their Kickstart Scheme job but leaves after 3 hours of work, the Grant Recipient will receive the first Grant instalment (£1500) but will not receive any subsequent instalments of the Grant;</li>
      <li>if a Participant starts their Kickstart Scheme job but leaves after 10 hours of work, the Grant Recipient will receive the first Grant instalment (£1500) and the second Grant Instalment (one sixth of the Total Grant minus the first instalment) but will not receive any subsequent instalments of the Grant.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Grant funding term</h4>

<p>Unless <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> extends the Grant funding period (for example, under clause 7.2.2), funding is provided for a continuous 6-month period only for each Participant. There is no Grant funding for any period of employment after this 6-month period, whether this is to allow the Participant to take paid leave accrued during the 6 months or for any other reason.</p>

<h4>3. Holiday</h4>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> expects Participants will take holiday at regular intervals during the Kickstart Scheme job. Where a Participant leaves the job early in unanticipated circumstances with unused holiday entitlement, then, subject to note 2 above, the Grant Recipient may add those accrued paid leave days to the Participant’s last day of work to determine the last day of employment, which is then notified to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> as per clause 7.2.1.</p>

<h4>4. Eligible Expenditure</h4>

<p>As per clause 5, Grant funding can only be used for Eligible Expenditure. The Grant funding must be used for Funded Activities, benefitting the Participants, and must not be used for any Ineligible Expenditure or retained by the Grant Recipient.</p>

<h4>5. Starting employment</h4>

<p>The Grant Recipient must not claim the first Grant instalment for any Participant until that Participant has commenced employment with the Grant Recipient. If the Grant Recipient receives the first Grant instalment for a Participant who has not commenced, or does not commence, employment with the Grant Recipient, the Grant Recipient must immediately repay the amount of the first instalment to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, unless otherwise instructed by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in writing.</p>

<p>A Participant has commenced employment with the Grant Recipient when the Participant has successfully started their first day of work with the Grant Recipient. The following is a non-exhaustive list of events that do not constitute a Participant having commenced employment with the Grant Recipient and which do not entitle the Grant Recipient to claim the first Grant instalment:</p>

<p>(a)	induction activities that take place before the Participant’s actual start date;<br>
(b)	offering a Participant a contract of employment;<br>
(c)	pre-employment screening checks, such as a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check;<br>
(d)	allocating a predicted future start date to a Participant; and<br>
(e)	the Participant’s start date arriving but the Participant does not start work.</p>

<h2>Annex 4: Agreed outputs</h2>

<p>The Grant Recipient is required to achieve the following outputs and performance measures in connection with the Grant:</p>

<p>Agreed Outputs</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide full details of the Kickstart Scheme vacancies to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and evidence that these jobs are new jobs promptly following signing of the Grant Offer Letter</li>
  <li>make available the number of Kickstart Scheme vacancies stated in the Grant Offer Letter and use reasonable endeavours to fill the vacancies as quickly as possible</li>
  <li>provide regular, meaningful work for the Participants that will help them become more attractive to future employers and maximise their readiness to make a successful transition into long term employment. For work to be meaningful, the job must be equivalent to a job not funded by the Kickstart Scheme and must not involve significant classroom or online training</li>
  <li>provide support to help each Participant with finding future employment. This can include on-the-job training, work search support, transferrable skills development, mentoring and careers advice, and support with CV and interview preparation</li>
  <li>help to build each Participant’s work skills which can include developing attendance management, timekeeping, team work and communication skills. This will help the Participant’s employment prospects after the Kickstart Scheme job ends</li>
  <li>keep records and other evidence of how the above outputs are being achieved (for example, notes of positive feedback that the Participant receives, records of mock job interviews conducted) and provide details to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> on request</li>
</ul>

<h2>Annex 5: Proof of concept</h2>

<p>The Kickstart Scheme was designed for Participants aged between 16 and 24. There is a potential that individuals aged 25 to 29 may also derive benefit from being part of the Kickstart Scheme.</p>

<p>Individuals aged 25 to 29 registered to jobcentres in areas as determined by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> where there are an insufficient number of Participants aged between 16 to 24 available to fill the Kickstart job vacancies, will also be eligible for the Kickstart Scheme where referred by the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.  Further details will be on the <a href="https://kickstart.campaign.gov.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Kickstart Scheme campaign page</a>.</p>
