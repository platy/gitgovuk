<h2>August 2020 change to this guidance</h2>

<p>We have updated this guidance as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>extended the period to 1 September 2021 during which <abbr title="newly qualified teacher">NQT</abbr> absences related to coronavirus (COVID-19) will not contribute towards the absence limit that would extend statutory induction</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance explains the changes to the induction process for newly qualified teachers (<abbr title="newly qualified teachers">NQTs</abbr>). This includes information on absences related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.</p>

<h2>Absences related to coronavirus</h2>

<p>The vast majority of <abbr title="newly qualified teachers">NQTs</abbr> will continue to complete their induction as usual. However, we recognise  the current coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak may have an impact on the number of absences <abbr title="newly qualified teachers">NQTs</abbr> take in the coming school year.</p>

<p>We have laid regulations that, subject to parliamentary procedures, will mean that <abbr title="newly qualified teachers">NQTs</abbr> absent for reasons related to the current coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak will not have their induction period automatically extended.</p>

<p>Induction arrangements state that ad hoc absences totalling 30 days or more automatically extend induction by the aggregate number of days absent.</p>

<p>In May 2020 we laid regulations that amended existing provisions. Any absence related to the current coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, including school closures, sickness or self-isolation, that was taken before 1 September 2020 would not count towards this limit. We have now laid new regulations that will extend this provision by a year, until 1 September 2021.</p>

<p>This means that <abbr title="newly qualified teachers">NQTs</abbr> who are currently undertaking statutory induction can complete their induction as expected, provided they meet the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards" class="govuk-link">Teachers’ Standards</a>.</p>

<p>Absences totalling 30 days or more that are not related to coronavirus (COVID-19) will continue to extend the induction period.</p>

<h2>Completion of the induction period</h2>

<p>We expect the vast majority of <abbr title="newly qualified teachers">NQTs</abbr> to continue to work and complete their induction as usual.</p>

<p>Headteachers and appropriate bodies should continue to make a decision on whether an <abbr title="newly qualified teacher">NQT</abbr> has met the Teachers’ Standards, based on their performance throughout their induction.</p>

<p>This decision is still to be made at the end of the induction period, which for most would be the end of the academic year regardless of possible absence due to the current coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.</p>

<p>In line with regular reporting procedures, the Teaching Regulation Agency should be notified of the outcome of induction.</p>

<h2>Assessment points</h2>

<p>Headteachers, induction tutors and appropriate bodies should continue to refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-for-newly-qualified-teachers-nqts"><abbr title="newly qualified teacher">NQT</abbr> induction statutory guidance</a> about the assessment process.</p>

<p>The final assessment meeting should remain at the end of the induction period for the majority of <abbr title="newly qualified teachers">NQTs</abbr> and evidence should continue to be collected.</p>

<p>The Teaching Regulation Agency aims to follow existing schedules for collecting outcome data following the end of assessment. The Teaching Regulation Agency will work with appropriate bodies affected by coronavirus (COVID-19) to support them in their data returns.</p>

<h2>Deciding if the <abbr title="newly qualified teacher">NQT</abbr> has met the Teachers’ Standards</h2>

<p>Headteachers and appropriate bodies should continue to make a decision on whether an <abbr title="newly qualified teacher">NQT</abbr> has met the Teachers’ Standards throughout the period of their induction, notwithstanding absences due to coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>This may include looking at previous assessment records, discussions with the induction tutors and consideration of non-routine teaching practice during the coronavirus (COVID-19) disruption.</p>

<p>As stated in statutory guidance on <abbr title="newly qualified teacher">NQT</abbr> induction, the decision about whether an <abbr title="newly qualified teacher">NQT</abbr>’s performance against the relevant standards is satisfactory upon completion of induction should take into account the <abbr title="newly qualified teacher">NQT</abbr>’s work context.</p>

<p>It must be made on the basis of what can reasonably be expected of an <abbr title="newly qualified teacher">NQT</abbr> by the end of their induction period within the framework set out by the standards.</p>

<h2>Extending the induction period</h2>

<p>If at the end of the induction period there are concerns that an <abbr title="newly qualified teacher">NQT</abbr>, with absences related to coronavirus (COVID-19), has not achieved the standards, we would encourage appropriate bodies to exercise their discretion to recommend an extension, allowing the <abbr title="newly qualified teacher">NQT</abbr> further time and opportunity to demonstrate their ability to meet the standards.</p>
