<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In recognition of the challenging initial teacher training and induction that some newly qualified teachers (<abbr title="newly qualified teachers">NQTs</abbr>) experienced due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, all state-funded schools that have or had an <abbr title="newly qualified teacher">NQT</abbr> who completed their induction between the summer term of 2021 and the spring term of 2022 will be provided with a one-off payment to further support the development of this cohort.</p>

<h2>Expiry date</h2>
<p>Funding will be paid for the academic year 2021 to 2022 and will not continue beyond this date.</p>

<h2>What has changed</h2>

<p>This guidance previously stated that a one-off payment was available to all state-funded schools with <abbr title="newly qualified teachers">NQTs</abbr> finishing induction in summer 2021. This has been changed to all state-funded schools that have or had an <abbr title="newly qualified teacher">NQT</abbr> who completed their induction between the summer term of 2021 and the spring term of 2022.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p>All state-funded schools that have or had an <abbr title="newly qualified teacher">NQT</abbr> who completed their induction between the summer term of 2021 and the spring term of 2022 will be eligible for this funding.</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>

<p>Eligible schools will receive a one-off payment to support <abbr title="newly qualified teachers">NQTs</abbr> who completed induction between the summer of 2021 and spring 2022. This funding will be made available to cover the cost of providing these teachers an additional 5% off timetable for the 2021 to 2022 academic year so they have additional time to invest in their development.</p>

<p>This time off timetable has been designed to be used flexibly so that as many new teachers as possible can benefit from this additional support. We trust schools and their leaders to know what works best for them and their staff and to use their judgement to decide how this funding will be spent.</p>

<p>Time off timetable can be grouped together in different ways, for example, taken as whole days or half days off.  It is not statutory.</p>

<p>Funding has been calculated as equivalent to 5% off timetable every week for an <abbr title="newly qualified teacher">NQT</abbr> over the academic year 2021 to 2022 and equates to 44 hours.</p>

<p>The funding amount is calculated by taking the average salary of <abbr title="newly qualified teachers">NQTs</abbr> and will differ by region.</p>

<p>Funding will be based on school workforce census returns and the employing school’s funding region.</p>

<h2>Payments</h2>

<p>Payment will be made in arrears in the summer of 2022 based on eligible teachers recorded in the school workforce census. For this reason, it is important that your school workforce census returns are completed accurately and submitted on time in order to receive payment. Schools do not need to do anything else in order to receive this payment.</p>

<p>Schools will receive this funding as part of their normal payments from ESFA.</p>

<p>Schools who have employed <abbr title="newly qualified teachers">NQTs</abbr> who have moved school post-induction will still be eligible to receive this funding. If this is the case, email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk">continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk</a> to let us know.</p>

<p>Schools should be making the necessary payments to support these teachers from their existing budgets and recording these in line with local finance policies. Schools that are academies on 1 September 2022 will receive payment directly from ESFA. Local authorities should pass on funding to schools due to convert to academies after this date.</p>

<p>Funding for eligible teachers working part-time will be paid in full during the summer of 2022. Funding may be used to support eligible part-time teachers beyond this academic year. It is the responsibility of the school to decide how this funding is managed.</p>

<h2>Assurance</h2>
<p>We have a responsibility to make sure that public funds are properly managed in line with these grant conditions.
As payment will be made in arrears, we reserve the right to ask schools to confirm that the money has been or will be spent in the way intended. Acceptance of the funding will be taken as confirmation.</p>

<p>Before accepting any funding, schools will have the opportunity to let us know they do not want to receive this funding or notify us of any changes, if, for example, the teacher has changed school during the academic year. Email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk">continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk</a> if you do not wish to receive this funding or to notify us of any changes.</p>

<p>Schools should keep some record of this expenditure such as a receipt for classroom cover, or a timetable for the <abbr title="newly qualified teacher">NQT</abbr>(s) involved, but we will not mandate what form this record should take, and trust school leaders to use their judgement.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to conduct light-touch, proportionate assurance such as spot checks with individual schools, asking for sight of such records.</p>

<h2>Further information</h2>
<p>Books, other documents and records relating to the recipient’s accounts shall be open to inspection by the Secretary of State and by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>

<p>The Comptroller and Auditor General may, under section 6 of the National Audit Act 1983, carry out examinations into the economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which the recipient has used its resources in discharging its grant-aided activities.</p>

<p>Schools, colleges and local authorities shall provide information as may be required by the Secretary of State to determine whether they have complied with these conditions.</p>

<h2>Variation</h2>
<p>These conditions of grant may be altered at any time. Participating institutions will be notified of this through existing channels.</p>

<h2>Recovery of funding</h2>
<p>This funding is being provided under section 14 to 16 of the Education Act 2002 and we reserve the right to audit the expenditure.</p>

<p>We will seek to recover funding that has been paid in error.</p>

<p>Recoveries will be made by invoice or by offsetting the amount against subsequent payments due from <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>.</p>

<p>The recipient must notify <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> immediately through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen&amp;consentMessage=yes" rel="external">Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) enquiry form</a> if it becomes aware of any instance of error, suspected fraud or financial irregularity in the use of the funds.</p>
