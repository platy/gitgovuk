<p>In recognition of the challenging initial teacher training and induction newly qualified teachers (<abbr title="newly qualified teachers">NQTs</abbr>) have experienced due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, all state-funded schools that currently have an <abbr title="newly qualified teacher">NQT</abbr> who is due to complete induction this summer will have access to a one-off payment to further support the development of this cohort.</p>

<h2>What you’ll get</h2>

<p>All state-funded schools that currently have an <abbr title="newly qualified teacher">NQT</abbr> who is due to complete induction this summer will be eligible for a one-off payment of funding for the equivalent of an additional 5% off timetable for next academic year so these teachers have additional time to invest in their development.</p>

<p>This time off timetable is not statutory but it has been designed to be used flexibly so that as many new teachers as possible can benefit from this additional support. We trust schools and their leaders to know what works best for them and their staff. Time off timetable can be grouped together in different ways, for example, taken as whole days or half days off.</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>

<p>The funding has been calculated as an equivalent to 5% off timetable every week for an <abbr title="newly qualified teacher">NQT</abbr> over the next academic year (2021 to 2022).</p>

<p>The funding amount will be calculated by taking the average salary of <abbr title="newly qualified teachers">NQTs</abbr>, split by region.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">NQT unit cost</th>
      <th scope="col">England (excluding the London area)</th>
      <th scope="col">Inner London area</th>
      <th scope="col">Outer London area</th>
      <th scope="col">Fringe area</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Rounded <abbr title="newly qualified teacher">NQT</abbr> unit cost</th>
      <td>£1,200</td>
      <td>£1,500</td>
      <td>£1,400</td>
      <td>£1,300</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The funding ‘unit cost’ is based on 5% off timetable time (teaching time) for <abbr title="newly qualified teachers">NQTs</abbr> in the 2021 to 2022 academic year and equates to 44 hours. We have used the minimum threshold on the main pay range for the <abbr title="newly qualified teacher">NQT</abbr> time.</p>

<p>Funding will be based on school workforce census returns. Payment will be made in arrears, in the summer term of 2022, to ensure that the payments are as accurate as possible and to avoid issues around teachers having moved schools.</p>

<p>Schools will receive this funding as part of their normal payments from ESFA.</p>

<p>Schools who have employed <abbr title="newly qualified teachers">NQTs</abbr> who have moved schools post-induction will still be eligible to receive this funding. The process by which these <abbr title="newly qualified teachers">NQTs</abbr> will be identified and how payments will be made, will be confirmed in due course.</p>

<h2>Assurances</h2>

<p>As payment will be made in arrears, we will ask schools to confirm that the money has been spent in the way intended. Acceptance of the funding will be taken as confirmation.</p>

<p>In advance of accepting any funding, schools will have the opportunity to let us know they do not want to receive this funding or notify us of any changes, if, for example, the teacher changes school during the academic year.</p>

<p>We will ensure that as part of this grant payment process, there is clear communication around the terms and conditions for accepting the money and the subsequent requirements for schools related to assurance. Schools should keep some record of this expenditure - such as a receipt for classroom cover, or a timetable for the <abbr title="newly qualified teacher">NQT</abbr>(s) involved, but we will not mandate what form this record should take, and trust school leaders to use their judgement.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to conduct light-touch, proportionate assurance such as spot checks with individual schools, asking for sight of such records.</p>

<p>We will confirm how we will collect confirmation schools do not want to receive this funding, or of changes to circumstances, in the grant conditions.</p>

<h2>Early career framework development materials</h2>

<p>This funding is designed to support the development of <abbr title="newly qualified teachers">NQTs</abbr> who are due to complete their induction this summer. Funding should be used to provide this cohort with additional time to invest in their development given the disruptions they have experienced during their initial teacher training and induction as a result of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Schools will have access to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>-accredited development materials</a> based on the early career framework to use during this time off timetable. There are a range of materials available that have been designed for teachers at the start of their careers to use independently. It is not compulsory to use these materials.</p>
