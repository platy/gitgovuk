<p>This document forms part of the collection ‘Workers and Temporary Workers: guidance for sponsors’. It provides information for employers on how to sponsor a worker on the Government Authorised Exchange (GAE) immigration route.</p>

<p>This version of the guidance is valid from 11 April 2022.</p>

<h2>About this guidance</h2>

<p>This document provides information for employers on how to sponsor a worker on the Temporary Work – Government Authorised Exchange route (‘GAE route’)</p>

<p>The GAE route is for people who want to come to the UK for a temporary period for work experience, job shadowing or training, to take part in an Overseas Government Language Programme, or undertake research or a fellowship through an approved exchange scheme. GAE workers can stay in the UK for up to two years – the maximum period depends on the scheme under which they are being sponsored.</p>

<p>This route was known as the ‘T5 (Temporary Worker) Government Authorised Exchange Worker’ route before 11 October 2021.</p>

<p>For previous versions of the Rules, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/archive-immigration-rules">Immigration Rules Archive</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>GA1. Sponsoring a GAE worker: overview</h2>

<p>This section provides an overview of the Government Authorised Exchange (GAE) route and the sponsorship requirements you must meet.</p>

<h3>What is the GAE route?</h3>

<p>GA1.1. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government-authorised-exchange">GAE route</a> is a temporary work route for people who wish to come to the UK through an approved scheme that aims to share knowledge, experience and best practice. Each scheme fits into one of the following four types of programme:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#WorkExperienceProgramme">Work Experience Programme</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#ResearchProgramme">Research Programme</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#OverseasGovernmentLanguageProgramme">Overseas Government Language Programme</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#TrainingProgramme">Training Programme</a></li>
</ul>

<p>GA1.2. The individual scheme must be listed as eligible in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-government-authorised-exchange-schemes">Appendix Government Authorised Exchange schemes</a>. The role must be listed in either Table 1 or Table 2 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-skilled-occupations">Appendix Skilled Occupations</a>.</p>

<p>GA1.3. GAE workers can stay in the UK for a maximum of 12 months if coming for a scheme on the Work Experience Programme (unless a shorter maximum period is specified in Appendix Government Authorised Exchange schemes), or a maximum of 2 years in all other cases. It is not a route to settlement in the UK.</p>

<p>GA1.4. GAE Workers can bring their family members (dependent partner and dependent children) to the UK, if they meet the relevant immigration requirements for dependants.</p>

<h3>Who needs to be sponsored on the GAE route?</h3>

<p>GA1.5. You will need to sponsor any overseas national you wish to employ if they are not a ‘settled worker’ or do not otherwise have immigration permission to work for you in the UK. This includes most <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">EU, EEA</a> and Swiss nationals who arrived in the UK after 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>GA1.6. You do not have to sponsor certain categories of worker, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Irish citizens (with very limited exceptions)</li>
  <li>EU, EEA and Swiss citizens (and their eligible family members) who have been granted status under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families">EU Settlement Scheme</a>
</li>
  <li>people with indefinite leave to enter or remain in the UK (also known as ‘settlement’)</li>
</ul>

<p>GA1.7. This is not a complete list. For further information on who does, and does not, need sponsorship, see section S1 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#who-needs">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a>.</p>

<h3>What are the sponsorship requirements for the GAE route?</h3>

<p>GA1.8. If you wish to sponsor a GAE worker, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hold a valid Temporary Worker sponsor licence for the GAE route</li>
  <li>understand <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark8">what the GAE route is</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#GA3">who you can sponsor</a> on this route</li>
  <li>understand the general requirements for sponsoring workers – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a>
</li>
  <li>satisfy yourself any worker you sponsor on this route can meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="#GA4">immigration requirements</a>
</li>
  <li>assign a <a class="govuk-link" href="#GA5">valid Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)</a> to the worker pay any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visa-regulations-revised-table">relevant CoS fee</a>
</li>
  <li>have eligible ‘key personnel’ in place to manage your licence and assign CoS – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-1-apply-for-a-licence/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-1-apply-for-a-licence-accessible-version#L4">Part 1: Apply for a licence</a> for guidance on key personnel</li>
  <li>keep records for each worker you sponsor, as set in in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keep-records-for-sponsorship-appendix-d">Appendix D</a> to the sponsor guidance</li>
  <li>understand and comply with all of your sponsor duties – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance">Part 3: Sponsor duties and compliance</a>

</ul>

<h2>GA2. How to get a GAE sponsor licence</h2>

<p>This section tells you about the requirements you must meet to be eligible for Government Authorised Exchange Worker (GAE) sponsor licence.</p>

<h3>General requirements</h3>

<p>GA2.1. If you wish to sponsor a GAE worker, you must hold a valid Temporary Worker sponsor licence for the GAE route. If you do not already hold such a licence, you must apply for one by completing the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.points.homeoffice.gov.uk/gui-sponsor-jsf/Register/SponsorRegister.faces" rel="external">online application form</a>, paying the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visa-regulations-revised-table">application fee</a>, and submitting the supporting evidence specified in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supporting-documents-for-sponsor-applications-appendix-a">Appendix A</a> to the sponsor guidance.</p>

<p>GA2.2. Before applying for your licence, you should read:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-1-apply-for-a-licence">Part 1: Apply for a licence</a> for detailed information on the general requirements and the application process</li>
  <li>this section for guidance specific to the GAE route</li>
</ul>

<p>GA2.3. If you already hold a sponsor licence and it’s due to expire within the next 90 days, you should apply now to renew it. See section C5 of Part 3: Sponsor duties and compliance for guidance on renewing your licence.</p>

<h3>Specific requirements for a GAE licence</h3>

<p>GA2.4. In addition to the requirements set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-1-apply-for-a-licence">Part 1: Apply for a licence</a>, you must also meet the requirements set out in this section.</p>

<h4>Scheme specifications</h4>

<p>GA2.5. The GAE route is for individuals coming to the UK through approved schemes that aim to share knowledge, experience and best practice. The approved schemes are listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-government-authorised-exchange-schemes">Appendix Government Authorised Exchange schemes</a> to the Immigration Rules. The underlying principles of these schemes are that they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>must be endorsed by a government department; and</li>
  <li>will be administered by an overarching sponsor and not an individual employer</li>
</ul>

<p>GA2.6. To stop potential abuse of this route and the creation of small, isolated schemes, individual employers and organisations are not allowed to sponsor workers on this route, even if they are licensed as a sponsor on other routes. The only exceptions to this are where you are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a Higher Education Institution (HEI), UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), or an organisation endorsed by UKRI in their Science, Research and Academia programme, and are recruiting a:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>sponsored researcher</li>
      <li>visiting academic who will give lectures, act as an examiner or work on a supernumerary research collaboration</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a government department or one of its executive agencies</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>GA2.7. Apart from the above exceptions, the sponsor for a GAE scheme must be an overarching body which administers the exchange scheme and acts as the licensed sponsor for any workers.</p>

<p>GA2.8. We wish to avoid unnecessary proliferation of GAE schemes. While it remains possible to add new schemes, we will consider doing so only where there is a compelling case. We reserve the right not to agree proposals for new schemes, even where these have secured the support of another government department. In addition to meeting the requirements set out further below, we will only agree proposals for a new GAE scheme, or to the renewal of existing schemes, where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for new schemes, the proposed scheme meets a need that is not catered for by an existing scheme or any other provisions of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules">Immigration Rules</a>
</li>
  <li>the purpose of the scheme does not conflict with wider considerations of immigration policy</li>
  <li>the purpose and foreseeable benefits of the scheme are clearly and directly linked to a specific wider Government policy objective</li>
  <li>the scheme provides a unique opportunity for the sharing of knowledge or the delivery of workplace experience or training that cannot reasonably be accessed in the individual’s home country or usual country of residence, and the delivery of these objectives are best served by admitting overseas nationals to the UK</li>
  <li>we are satisfied that the government department endorsing the scheme will monitor the operation of the scheme and assess delivery against the scheme’s objectives – this includes reporting to us annually on the benefits that the scheme is bringing, how it is meeting its objectives, and the measures in place to guard against abuse</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step-by-step process for obtaining a GAE licence</h3>

<p>GA2.9. If you wish to seek agreement to the introduction of a new GAE scheme, you must follow the steps set out below.</p>

<h4>1. Determine who the overarching body will be</h4>

<p>GA2.10. If you want to set up a scheme under the GAE route but cannot act as the overarching body (for example, if you want a sector-wide scheme but you represent only a small part of your sector), you may need to identify an organisation that is suitable to act as the overarching body. This organisation will need to be able to comply with the sponsorship obligations set out in this document and the wider sponsor guidance.</p>

<h4>2.  Secure the endorsement of a government department for the proposed scheme</h4>

<p>GA2.11. Once you have identified a suitable overarching body, that body will need to approach the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations">relevant government department or executive agency</a> to seek its endorsement. The overarching body may wish to consult the Home Office before it does so. It will need to provide the endorsing government department or agency with full details of the scheme. The overarching body should explain, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>why the scheme is necessary</li>
  <li>what benefits the scheme will offer to your sector and to the UK</li>
  <li>what participants will do under the scheme, including:
    <ul>
      <li>details of the roles that will be filled</li>
      <li>salaries or payments that will be made to participants</li>
      <li>the skill level of the work they will do</li>
      <li>how long participants will spend in the UK under the scheme and why that period is appropriate</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>3.  Government department or agency seeks approval from the Home Office</h4>

<p>GA2.12. It will be for the endorsing government department or executive agency to make the case to us for the introduction of a new scheme. If the government department, or one of its executive agencies, endorses the scheme, their relevant Accounting Officer must send a letter of endorsement to the Head of the Migration and Citizenship Directorate at the Home Office. In addition to the criteria above, we will need to be satisfied that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it’s not the purpose of the scheme to facilitate the supply of labour – participants must not fill vacancies and must be supernumerary (that is, over and above any normal staffing requirements)</li>
  <li>
    <p>the roles available under the scheme are listed in either Table 1 or Table 2 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-skilled-occupations">Appendix Skilled Occupations</a> to the Immigration Rules</p>
  </li>
  <li>the roles available under the scheme conform to all relevant employment legislation, such as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage">National Minimum Wage</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/maximum-weekly-working-hours">maximum weekly working hours</a>
</li>
  <li>the overarching body is able to meet its sponsorship duties as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance">Part 3: Sponsor duties and compliance</a>, and will put in place measures that will protect the scheme from abuse</li>
</ul>

<h4>4.  Scheme approved</h4>

<p>GA2.13. If the scheme is approved, it will be added to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-government-authorised-exchange-schemes">Appendix Government Authorised Exchange schemes</a> in the next available update to the Immigration Rules. The Rules are routinely updated twice a year, normally in the Spring and Autumn. You cannot sponsor a worker under the scheme until it is added to Appendix Government Authorised Exchange schemes.</p>

<h3>How to keep your licence</h3>

<p>GA2.14. If you are granted a licence, you must comply with all of your sponsor duties to keep it. If you do not, we may take action against you, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>downgrading your licence rating</li>
  <li>suspending your licence</li>
  <li>revoking your licence</li>
  <li>reporting you to the police or other relevant authorities GA2.17.</li>
</ul>

<p>For details, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance">Part 3: Sponsor duties and compliance</a>.</p>

<h2>GA3. Eligible employment on the GAE route</h2>

<p>This section provides information on the types of role that are eligible for sponsorship on the GAE route. It also describes the 4 main GAE programmes.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>GA3.1. You can only sponsor a worker on the GAE route if the role they will do:</p>

  <li>is in an eligible scheme or programme</li>
  <li>meets the skill level requirement</li>
  <li>is supernumerary</li>
</ul>

<p>GA3.2. Eligible schemes and programmes are listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-government-authorised-exchange-schemes">Appendix Government Authorised Exchange schemes</a> to the Immigration Rules. There is further information about the 4 main programmes in <a class="govuk-link" href="#GA35">GA3.5. below</a>.</p>

<p>GA3.3. You cannot use the GAE to bring unskilled labour to the UK. The role must be in an occupation listed in Table 1 or Table 2 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-skilled-occupations">Appendix Skilled Occupations</a> to the Immigration Rules. These are roles which are considered to be skilled to level 3 or above on the Regulated Qualifications Framework for England or Northern Ireland (or the equivalent levels in Wales or Scotland).</p>

<p>GA3.4. You cannot use the GAE route to fill job vacancies. Workers sponsored on a GAE scheme are only allowed to fill supernumerary roles. This means that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the role must be over and above your normal staffing requirements</li>
  <li>if the person filling the role were not there, it wouldn’t be filled by anyone else</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

<p>GA4.3. This is not a full list of requirements – you must refer to the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-t5-temporary-worker-government-authorised-exchange-worker-route">Immigration Rules</a> for these.</p>

<h3>Financial requirement</h3>

<p>GA4.4. If the applicant is applying for entry clearance from outside the UK, or has been in the UK for less than one year at the date of application, they must show they have enough funds to support themselves and any family members in the UK.</p>

<p>GA4.5. If you are an A-rated sponsor, you can certify this requirement is met when you assign a CoS to them (also known as ‘certifying maintenance’). Otherwise, the applicant must provide evidence of funds as specified in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-finance">Appendix Finance</a> to the Immigration Rules.</p>

<p>GA4.6. For further information, see section S7 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a>.</p>

<h3>ATAS requirement</h3>

<p>GA4.7. When you assign a CoS on the GAE route, you must check and confirm whether the worker needs to apply for an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academic-technology-approval-scheme">Academic Approval Technology Scheme (ATAS) certificate</a> from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office before they can start (or continue) working for you.</p>

<p>GA4.8. A GAE worker will need an ATAS certificate if all of the following are true:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are also licensed as a Student sponsor</li>
  <li>the worker is not an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#Exempt-nationalities">exempt national</a>
</li>
  <li>you are sponsoring the worker in a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#Occupation-codes">relevant occupation code</a>
</li>
  <li>the work involves research at PhD level or above in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#Subject-areas">relevant subject area</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>GA4.9. If the worker needs an ATAS certificate, you should encourage them to apply for one as soon as possible, as they will need to include a copy of the certificate with their application for entry clearance or permission to stay. If they fail to do so, we will refuse their application and you may lose your sponsor licence (or licences).</p>

<p>GA4.10. For further information on the ATAS requirement, and your responsibilities in relation to it, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#ATAS-requirement">under ‘ATAS requirement’</a> in section S7 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a>.</p>

<h3>Former officially-sponsored students</h3>

<p>GA4.11. If the applicant has, in the 12 months before the date of application, received an award from a Government or international scholarship agency covering both fees and maintenance, they must provide written consent to their application from that Government or agency. If they do not, we will reject their application as invalid.</p>

<h3>Parental consent requirement</h3>

<p>GA4.12. There is no minimum age requirement for this route but if the worker you wish to sponsor is aged under 18 on the date of application, they must have written consent from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>both of their parents</li>
  <li>one of their parents, if that parent has sole legal responsibility for the applicant</li>
  <li>their legal guardian</li>
</ul>

<p>GA4.13. The written consent must confirm support for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the application for entry clearance or permission to enter or stay</li>
  <li>the applicant’s living and care arrangements in the UK</li>
  <li>if the application is for entry clearance, the applicant’s travel to, and reception arrangements in, the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>GA4.14. As the sponsor, you must have regard to your duty to safeguarding children if you are sponsoring any workers aged under 18 – see section L2 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-1-apply-for-a-licence">Part 1: Apply for a licence</a> for further information.</p>

<h3>Entry requirement</h3>

<p>GA4.15. Applicants must apply for entry clearance (a visa) to be able to come to the UK on this route. If they arrive in the UK without the relevant visa, they will be refused entry, even if they otherwise meet the requirements.</p>

<h3>Extension of permission</h3>

<p>GA4.16. Those already in the UK with permission on the GAE route can apply to extend their stay, up to the <a class="govuk-link" href="#maximumperiodpermittedbytheirscheme">maximum period permitted by their scheme</a>, if they meet the relevant requirements – this could be to continue in the same employment or to change employer or employment. See section <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">S9 of Part 2 Sponsor a worker</a> for further information.</p>

<h3>‘Switching’</h3>

<p>GA4.17. Individuals in the UK on another immigration route are not generally permitted to ‘switch’ (change route) to the GAE route from within the UK. If you wish to sponsor a worker on the GAE route but they are in the UK on another immigration route, they must normally leave the UK and apply for entry clearance.</p>

<p>GA4.18. The only exception to this is where the individual was last granted permission as a Student (formerly Tier 4), they have completed a recognised bachelor’s or postgraduate degree and are being sponsored to undertake either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a period of postgraduate professional training or work experience necessary to obtain a professional qualification or professional registration in the same professional field as that qualification</li>
  <li>an internship for up to 12 months which directly relates to the qualification</li>
</ul>

<p>provided, in both cases, they will not be filling a permanent vacancy and their employer does not intend to employ the worker in the UK once the training or work experience has ended.</p>

<h3>How long GAE workers can stay</h3>

<p>GA4.19. If the applicant makes a successful application for entry clearance on the GAE route, they will be granted for whichever is the shorter of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the period of the role on the CoS plus 14 days before and after</li>
  <li>the maximum period of time that a person on the GAE route is permitted to spend in the UK under the terms of the specific approved scheme in which the applicant has applied to participate</li>
</ul>

<p>GA4.20. If the applicant makes a successful application for permission to stay on the GAE route, they will be granted permission for whichever is the shorter of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the period of the role on the CoS plus 14 days</li>
  <li>the difference between the period the applicant has already spent in the UK since their last grant of permission on the GAE route and the maximum period of time that a person on the GAE route is permitted to spend in the UK under the terms of the specific approved scheme in which the applicant has applied to participate</li>
</ul>

<h3>Further information</h3>

<p>GA4.21. You can find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government-authorised-exchange">Temporary Work - Government Authorised Exchange visa</a> section of the GOV.UK website.</p>

<p>GA4.22. You should also refer to sections S7 to S9 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a> for further information on immigration requirements, conditions of stay, extension applications and change of employment applications.</p>

<h2>GA5. Certificate of Sponsorship for GAE workers</h2>

<p>This section tells you how to assign a valid Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) on the Government Authorised Exchange (GAE) route.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>GA5.1. If you have followed all the rules in this guidance and you wish to sponsor a worker on the GAE route, you must assign them a valid CoS, using your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/sponsor-management-system">sponsorship management system (SMS)</a> account.</p>

<p>GA5.2. Before assigning a CoS, you should satisfy yourself that the worker can meet the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="#GA4">immigration requirements</a>.</p>

<p>GA5.3. You cannot assign a CoS if you’re a B-rated sponsor, unless the worker is applying for permission to stay from within the UK and you sponsored the application which led to their last grant of permission on the GAE route. In all other cases, you must have an A-rating. For information on sponsor ratings, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-1-apply-for-a-licence">Part 1: Apply for a licence</a>.</p>

<p>GA5.4. For detailed information on what a CoS is, and how many you can assign, see section S2 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a>.</p>

<p>GA5.5. You can find detailed technical guidance on how to assign a CoS on GOV.UK: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/sponsorship-information-for-employers-and-educators#user-manuals%3A-sponsorship-management-system-(sms)">User manuals: sponsorship management system (SMS)</a> – see in particular manual 8.</p>

<h3>Fees</h3>

<p>GA5.6. You must pay a fee for each CoS you assign – see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visa-regulations-revised-table">‘UK visa fees’</a> page on GOV.UK for information on current fee levels.</p>

<h3>Use of the CoS</h3>

<p>GA5.7. Once you have assigned a CoS, the worker must use it within 3 months to apply for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>entry clearance (a visa) if they are outside the UK</li>
  <li>permission to stay if they are in the UK and eligible to extend their permission on, or switch to, the GAE route</li>
</ul>

<p>GA5.8. If the CoS was assigned more than 3 months before the date of application, we may reject the worker’s application and not consider it.</p>

<p>GA5.9. The worker must not apply for entry clearance or permission to stay more than 3 months before the start date recorded on their CoS. If they do, we will refuse their application.</p>

<p>GA5.10. We will also refuse the application if the CoS:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has been withdrawn by you or cancelled by the Home Office – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#Cancelling-or-withdrawing-a-CoS">section S6</a> of Part 2: Sponsor a worker for information on when a CoS can be withdrawn or cancelled</li>
  <li>was used in a previous application that was refused</li>
</ul>

<h3>What the CoS must confirm</h3>

<p>GA5.11. For a CoS to be valid, it must meet the requirements of paragraph GAE 5.1 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-t5-temporary-worker-government-authorised-exchange-worker-route">Appendix Temporary Work - Government Authorised Exchange</a> to the Immigration Rules.</p>

<p>GA5.12. By assigning a CoS on the GAE route, you guarantee that the worker will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be doing work, job-shadowing or training that’s <a class="govuk-link" href="#GA3">eligible for the GAE route</a>
</li>
  <li>not fill a vacancy in the workforce</li>
  <li>not establish a business in the UK</li>
  <li>not undertake work, job-shadowing or training that has not been endorsed by your sponsoring government department or approved by the Home Office</li>
  <li>not take part in work, job-shadowing or training for a period longer than permitted under the <a class="govuk-link" href="#GA35">relevant programme</a>
</li>
  <li>be doing work, job-shadowing or training that conforms to all relevant legislation, such as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage">National Minimum Wage</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/maximum-weekly-working-hours">Working Time Directive</a>
</li>
  <li>
    <p>comply with the conditions of their entry clearance or permission to stay– see the ‘Conditions of stay’ section of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a> for further information</p>
  </li>
  <li>leave the UK when their entry clearance or permission to stay expires, unless they qualify for an extension of stay or permission on another route</li>
</ul>

<p>GA5.13. The CoS must confirm all of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that you are sponsoring the worker on the GAE route</li>
  <li>the worker’s personal information (such as name, date of birth, nationality) passport details and contact details</li>
  <li>the start and end date of their employment – <a class="govuk-link" href="#Howlongyoucan">see ‘How long you can assign a CoS to a GAE worker’</a> below</li>
  <li>total weekly hours of work</li>
  <li>where the worker will carry out their employment – this should include their main work address and any other regular work addresses, if relevant</li>
  <li>whether the worker was sourced through an agent and, if so, details of that agent</li>
  <li>the job title</li>
  <li>the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#occupation-code">occupation code</a> for the role (select from the drop-down list under ‘Job type’)</li>
  <li>the main duties of the role for which the worker is being sponsored</li>
  <li>details of the worker’s salary, including any guaranteed allowances and bonuses</li>
  <li>that the role is in an eligible occupation code listed in Table 1 or Table 2 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-skilled-occupations">Appendix Skilled Occupations</a>
</li>
  <li>whether you wish to <a class="govuk-link" href="#financialrequirement">certify maintenance</a> for the worker (and, if relevant, their dependants) – you can only do this if you’re an A-rated sponsor</li>
  <li>whether the worker <a class="govuk-link" href="#atasrequirement">needs an ATAS certificate</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>How long you can assign a CoS to a GAE worker</h3>

<p>GA5.14. You can only assign a CoS up to the maximum period permitted by the <a class="govuk-link" href="#GA35">relevant programme</a>. If you are sponsoring a worker in an application for permission to stay, you should check carefully how long they have been in the UK on the GAE route.</p>

<p>GA5.15. If you assign a CoS for a period longer than that approved for your scheme, and this is used in a successful application for permission to stay, we are likely to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance-accessible-version#C10">revoke your sponsor licence</a>. We will also speak to your endorsing government department and ask them if they wish to continue endorsing your scheme.</p>

<p>GA5.16. For further information on entering start and end dates, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#start">section S3</a> in Part 2: Sponsor a worker.</p>

<h3>Reporting duties and record keeping</h3>

<p>GA5.17. Once you have assigned a CoS to a worker, you must tell us if they fail to start their employment, are absent without permission, or there are any significant changes to the nature of their work or salary, or to your organisation. For full details of your reporting and other duties, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance">Part 3: Sponsor duties and compliance</a>.</p>

<p>GA5.18. You must also keep records for each worker you sponsor as specified in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keep-records-for-sponsorship-appendix-d">Appendix D</a> to the sponsor guidance.</p>

<p>GA5.19. If you fail to meet these duties, we may revoke your sponsor licence.</p>

<p>GA5.20. You are responsible for all of the workers you sponsor under the scheme. It is important that you work closely with other bodies or organisations where your sponsored worker are placed. If you do not have enough control over your scheme – for example, if workers are not doing the work you said they would – we will take action against you. This may include <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance-accessible-version">revoking your sponsor licence</a>.</p>
