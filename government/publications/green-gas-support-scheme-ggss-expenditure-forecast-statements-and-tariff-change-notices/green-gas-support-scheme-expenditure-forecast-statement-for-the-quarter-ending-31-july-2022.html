<p>This is the quarterly Expenditure Forecast Statement for the Green Gas Support Scheme (<abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>) for the quarter ending 31 July 2022. It is based on scheme data as of the end of the quarter. It is published in accordance with Regulation 20 of The Green Gas Support Scheme Regulations 2021.</p>

<p>This quarter’s Expenditure Forecast Statement does not have the power to reduce scheme tariffs as it is published simultaneously with the Annual Tariff Review, which takes precedence over it. It is published to provide transparency. The next Expenditure Forecast Statement will be published on 1 December 2022, covering the quarter ending 31 October. A degression, if applicable, will then be active from 1 January 2023.</p>

<p>This quarter’s Expenditure Forecast, which is for spend for 12 months from 1 August 2022, is £34.48 million, which is below the expenditure forecast level that would trigger a degression. This does not reflect expected actual spend on the&nbsp;<abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>.

<h2>Expenditure forecast statement</h2>

<h3>The forecast and degression threshold</h3>

<p>The Green Gas Support Scheme Regulations 2021 require that&nbsp;<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>&nbsp;publishes a quarterly forecast of expenditure on the scheme. The Expenditure Forecast is used to assess whether a tariff degression will take place in any given quarter by comparing it to the scheme’s Expenditure Threshold.</p>

<p>Each quarterly Expenditure Forecast and Expenditure Threshold figure is for spend over 12 months from the end of the quarter. The statement for the quarter ending 31 January covers expenditure to 31 January the following year, for the quarter ending 30 April until 30 April the following year, and so on.</p>

<p>If forecasted spend exceeds the scheme’s Expenditure Threshold for a quarter, then this triggers a tariff rate degression. A degression reduces all scheme tariffs by 10% compared to the previous rates. All applications that have had a Stage 1 application approved prior to a degression will have been issued a Provisional Tariff Guarantee Notice (<abbr title="Provisional Tariff Guarantee Notice">PTGN</abbr>), which means they are guaranteed the tariff rate in place at that time should they become fully registered on the scheme.</p>

<p>If a degression is triggered, then&nbsp;<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>&nbsp;will also publish a Tariff Change Notice simultaneously with the Expenditure Forecast Statement. The new tariff rate and start date will be published by <abbr title="Office of Gas and Electricity Markets">Ofgem</abbr> on the 15 of the month following the publication of the Forecast Statement, either 15 March, 15 June, 15 September, or 15 December. The tariff change will come into force on the first day of the following month.</p>

<p>Expenditure Degression Thresholds are reviewed and can be revised annually following the&nbsp;<abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>’s Annual Tariff Review (<abbr title="Annual Tariff Review">ATR</abbr>), published by 1 September each year. ATRs which can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-gas-support-scheme-ggss-annual-tariff-reviews-and-tariff-change-notices"><abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> Annual Tariff Review page</a>. New thresholds, if they are changed, then come into force on 1 October, applying to the next quarterly assessment. Degression thresholds are published in Expenditure Forecast Statements and also on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-gas-support-scheme-budget-management"><abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>&nbsp;budget management page</a>.</p>

<p>There will be no change to Expenditure Degression Thresholds on 1 October 2022, as announced in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-gas-support-scheme-ggss-annual-tariff-reviews-and-tariff-change-notices">2022 <abbr title="Annual Tariff Review">ATR</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>&nbsp;is open to new applicants until 30 November 2025; tariff degressions cannot occur once the scheme has closed.</p>

<h3>Expenditure forecast methodology</h3>

<p>The Expenditure Forecast figures are based on expected maximum spend on all “relevant producers” as defined in the Green Gas Support Scheme Regulations 2021 (Regulation 17), meaning all producers who have applied for a&nbsp;<abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>&nbsp;tariff guarantee, not withdrawn their application nor had it rejected, and for which, at the least, there is a “pending tariff guarantee”, meaning it has passed Stage 2 of the application process.</p>

<p>Spend for each plant is calculated based on its “eligible biomethane” volume, meaning the amount of biomethane that a participant is or will be entitled to supply if the application is fully accredited. In effect, this means that the forecast is based on the full tariff amount that would be paid to a plant if it injected gas at its full eligible capacity from the expected commissioning date.</p>

<p>The spend forecast increases as more applications advance through the application process and accreditations are granted. It differs in its approach to that used to set the&nbsp;<abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>&nbsp;scheme budgets, which includes expected spend on plants regardless of whether they have yet applied and is a forecast of actual spend using Production Factors rather than taking the full value of the eligible capacity (more details available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-gas-support-scheme-budget-management"><abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>&nbsp;Budget Management page</a>).</p>

<p>The table below shows the latest expenditure forecast and previous quarters’ forecasts as compared to the current Expenditure Degression Threshold. It confirms the quarters in which degressions have been triggered.</p>

<p>This Statement’s expenditure forecast is £34.48 million, with 8 applications having passed Stage 2 of the application process. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-gas-support-scheme-ggss-expenditure-forecast-statements-and-tariff-change-notices/quarterly-expenditure-forecast-statement-for-the-green-gas-support-scheme-as-at-1-march-2022#expenditure-forecast-methodology">Expenditure forecast methodology</a>. The forecast reflects only the progression of applications, not the expected actual spend on the scheme.</p>

<h2>Scheme background</h2>

<p>The Green Gas Support Scheme (<abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>) is a government environmental scheme that provides financial incentives for the injection of biomethane from new anaerobic digestion plants into the gas grid to increase the use of green gas, thereby helping to reduce emissions. During peak years of production, biomethane plants incentivised by the&nbsp;<abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>&nbsp;are forecast to produce enough green gas to heat around 200,000 homes. We expect the&nbsp;<abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>&nbsp;to help support high quality jobs in the renewable energy sector.</p>

<p>Registered participants on the scheme will receive quarterly payments over a period of 15 years. Payments are based on the amount of eligible biomethane that a participant injects into the gas grid.</p>

<p>The scheme is open to applicants in England, Scotland and Wales for four years from 30 November 2021. It follows the Non-Domestic Renewable Heat Incentive (<abbr title="Non-Domestic Renewable Heat Incentive (NDRHI)">NDRHI</abbr>) scheme which closed to new applicants on 31 March 2021.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>&nbsp;is funded by a levy, the Green Gas Levy (<abbr title="Green Gas Levy">GGL</abbr>), which is paid by energy suppliers according to the number of meters they supply.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>&nbsp;policy is set by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>) and the scheme is administered by <abbr title="Office of Gas and Electricity Markets">Ofgem</abbr>.</p>
