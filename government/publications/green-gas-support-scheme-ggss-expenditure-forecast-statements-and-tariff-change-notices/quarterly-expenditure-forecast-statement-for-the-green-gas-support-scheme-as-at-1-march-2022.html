<p>This is the first quarterly Expenditure Forecast Statement for the Green Gas Support Scheme, published in accordance with Regulation 20 of The Green Gas Support Scheme Regulations 2021.</p>

<p>The data are based on the scheme data as at 31 January 2022. The forecast is based on the capacity of applications that have passed Stage 2 of the application process.</p>

<p>Degression will not be active for the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>’s first 6 months. The first degression expenditure threshold in regulations commences on 30 April 2022 and the first possible degression will be on 1 July 2022, following the publication of the Quarterly Expenditure Forecast Statement on 1 June 2022.</p>

<p>The Expenditure Forecast for this quarter is zero. No applications had passed Stage 2 before 31 January. This does not reflect expected actual spend on the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#expenditure-forecast-methodology">Expenditure forecast methodology</a> for more detail).</p>

<p>The next Expenditure Forecast Statement will be published on 1 June 2022 with any resulting tariff reduction coming into effect from 1 July 2022.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-gas-support-scheme-budget-management">Green Gas Support Scheme: budget management</a> page provides additional information on the budget management policies for the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Expenditure forecast statement</h2>

<h3>The forecast and degression threshold</h3>

<p>The Green Gas Support Scheme Regulations 2021 require that <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> publishes a quarterly forecast of expenditure on the scheme.</p>

<p>The Expenditure Forecast is used to assess whether a tariff degression will take place in any given quarter by comparing it to the scheme’s Expenditure Degression Threshold.</p>

<p>Each quarterly Expenditure Forecast and Degression Threshold figure is for spend over 12 months from the end of the quarter. The statement for the quarter ending 31 January covers expenditure to 31 January the following year, for the quarter ending 30 April until 30 April the following year, and so on.</p>

<p>If forecasted spend exceeds the scheme’s Expenditure Degression Threshold for a quarter, then this triggers a tariff rate degression. A degression reduces all scheme tariffs by 10% compared to the previous rates. All applications that have had a Stage 1 application approved prior to a degression will have been issued a Provisional Tariff Guarantee Notice (<abbr title="Provisional Tariff Guarantee Notice">PTGN</abbr>), which means they are guaranteed the tariff rate in place at that time should they become fully registered on the scheme.</p>

<p>If a degression is triggered, then <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will also publish a Tariff Change Notice simultaneously with the Expenditure Forecast Statement. The new tariff rate and start date will be published by Ofgem on the 15th of the month following the publication of the Forecast Statement, either 15 March, 15 June, 15 September, or 15 December. The tariff change will come into force one calendar month after the publication of the Forecast Statement.</p>

<p>Expenditure Degression Thresholds are reviewed and can be revised annually in the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>’s Annual Tariff Review, published by 1 September each year, with changes taking effect subsequently from 1 October. The degression thresholds are published in Expenditure Forecast Statements and also on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-gas-support-scheme-budget-management"><abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> budget management page</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> is open to new applicants until 30 November 2025; tariff degressions cannot occur once the scheme has closed.</p>

<h3>Expenditure forecast methodology</h3>

<p>The Expenditure Forecast figures are based on estimated spend for all “relevant producers” as defined in the Green Gas Support Scheme Regulations 2021 (s.17), meaning all producers who have applied for a <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> tariff guarantee, not withdrawn their application nor had it rejected, and for which, at the least, there is a “pending tariff guarantee”, meaning it has passed Stage 2 of the application process.</p>

<p>Spend for each plant is calculated based on its “eligible biomethane” volume, meaning the amount of biomethane that a participant is or will be entitled to supply if the application is fully accredited. In effect, this means that the forecast is based on the full tariff amount that would be paid to a plant if it injected gas at its full eligible capacity from the expected commissioning date.</p>

<p>The spend forecast increases as more applications advance through the application process and accreditations are granted. It differs in its approach to that used to set the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> scheme budgets, which includes expected spend on plants regardless of whether they have yet applied and is a forecast of actual spend using Production Factors rather than taking the full value of the eligible capacity (more details available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-gas-support-scheme-budget-management"><abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> Budget Management page</a>).</p>

<h3>This quarter</h3>

<p>This Expenditure Forecast Statement forecasts spend for 12 months from 1 February 2022.</p>

<p>Degression will not be active for the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>’ first 6 months. The first possible degression will be on 1 July 2022, following the publication of the Quarterly Expenditure Forecast Statement on 1 June 2022.</p>

<p>The table below shows the latest expenditure forecast and previous quarters’ forecasts as compared to the current Expenditure Degression Threshold. It confirms the quarters in which degressions have been triggered.</p>

<p>This Statement’s expenditure forecast is zero because no applications have passed Stage 2 of the application process (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#expenditure-forecast-methodology">Expenditure forecast methodology</a>). The forecast reflects only the progression of applications, not the expected actual spend on the scheme.</p>

<h2>Graph of scheme expenditure and thresholds</h2>

<p>The graph below shows the current scheme Expenditure Degression Thresholds. This is the first scheme Expenditure Forecast Statement and forecast expenditure for the quarter is zero. This is because no applications had passed Stage 2 of the application process by 31 January. Therefore, the chart shows only the Expenditure Degression Threshold. Expenditure forecasts will be added in future quarters when the forecast is greater than zero.</p>

<h2>Scheme background</h2>

<p>The Green Gas Support Scheme (<abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>) is a government environmental scheme that provides financial incentives for the production of biomethane from new anaerobic digestion plants to increase the proportion of green gas in the gas grid, thereby helping to reduce emissions from Great Britain’s gas. During peak years of production, biomethane plants incentivised by the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> are forecast to produce enough green gas to heat around 200,000 homes. We expect the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> to help support high quality jobs in the renewable energy sector.</p>

<p>Registered participants on the scheme will receive quarterly payments over a period of 15 years. Payments are based on the amount of eligible biomethane that a participant produces.</p>

<p>The scheme is open to applicants in England, Scotland and Wales for four years from 30 November 2021. It follows the Non-Domestic Renewable Heat Incentive (<abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr>) Scheme which closed to new applicants on 31 March 2021.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> is funded by a levy, the Green Gas Levy (<abbr title="Green Gas Levy">GGL</abbr>), which is paid by energy suppliers according to the number of meters they supply. The Levy will be collected from energy suppliers from 1 April 2022.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> policy is set by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>) and the scheme is administered by Ofgem.</p>
