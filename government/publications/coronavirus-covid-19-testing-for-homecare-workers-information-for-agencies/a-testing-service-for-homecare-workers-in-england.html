<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>NHS Test and Trace is making weekly COVID-19 testing available to all homecare workers in England.</p>

<p>All registered homecare agencies will be contacted with details of how to apply for test kits for their homecare workers. Homecare agencies will be responsible for ordering and distributing test kits to all homecare workers for them to conduct at home on a weekly basis.</p>

<p>Homecare worker testing should only be conducted on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays (if the homecare worker is able to access a priority post box with Sunday collections).</p>

<h2>Webinars</h2>

<p>For more information you can join our webinars, which will be hosted every week.</p>

<p>These live webinars will talk you through the end-to-end process for homecare worker testing and include a live Q&amp;A with the homecare testing team, who will be happy to answer your questions.</p>

<p><a href="https://event.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1405251&amp;tp_key=79f1786e36" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Sign up for the webinars</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Summary: testing for homecare workers</h2>

<h3>About the service</h3>

<p>The service involves:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>weekly testing of all homecare workers in adult social care. This includes all carers in domiciliary care organisations, homecare medicine providers and aseptic compounders</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>agency managers should order tests every 28 days for their homecare workers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>4 tests are delivered for each homecare worker to the agency, for a 28-day testing cycle</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>each homecare worker should be given 4 test kits every 28 days</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>every 7 days a care worker should take a test, register it online, and return it by post between Thursday and Sunday</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>homecare workers will receive their results in 2 to 4 days by email and text message (SMS)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Why testing is important</h3>

<p>Testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifies homecare workers who currently have COVID-19 so they are able to self-isolate if positive</li>
  <li>protects those receiving care from infection passed to them by homecare workers who are confirmed positive</li>
  <li>prevents and controls the spread of the virus by identifying asymptomatic cases</li>
</ul>

<p>We need to carry on testing and self-isolating if needed, regardless of the rollout of the vaccine programme. For the latest advice on how long to self-isolate and in what circumstances, read the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/">Self Isolation and treating symptoms</a> guidance from the NHS.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Process overview</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Agency managers register online and order kits for the homecare workers in their team to cover weekly testing for 4 weeks.</li>
  <li>Agency managers distribute kits or arrange for them to be collected.</li>
  <li>Homecare workers test themselves and return their completed kits and receive their test results shortly afterwards. This service is for homecare staff only, not the service users themselves.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Eligible organisations</h3>

<p>Your organisation is eligible if you are a Care Quality Commission (<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>)-regulated homecare organisation in England providing personal care.</p>

<p>If you believe you match this criterion and have not been contacted by NHS Test and Trace with information on ordering test kits, please call 119.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> Your involvement</h3>

<h4>Agency managers</h4>

<p>If you are the manager of a homecare agency, responsible for a team of homecare workers or you have been delegated responsibility for testing by your organisation, your key responsibilities are to:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you have any queries with any of the steps please call the national coronavirus contact centre on 119.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span> Unique organisation number</h3>

<p>NHS Test and Trace assigns all participating organisations a single <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>.</p>

<p>Agency managers will receive their <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> via the email address registered with <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>. Please make sure that the person who receives these emails understands the importance of this message and knows who to contact.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> is an 8-digit number which is exclusive to an individual organisation. This can be used to login to all online elements of the testing process.</p>

<p>Agency managers will need to use their <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://request-testing.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">ordering test kits</a></li>
  <li>contacting the national coronavirus contact centre for support (dial 119)</li>
</ul>

<p>Homecare workers will need to use their <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> for <a href="https://gov.uk/register-organisation-tests" class="govuk-link" rel="external">registering completed test kits</a> to make sure they will receive their results.</p>

<p>If you have any issues with this process, please call 119.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span> Update on registration portal</h3>

<p>Please make sure that your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> is correct when you log into the portal. There has now been a validation added to the <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> entry to confirm against our system whether or not what you have entered is valid. This will lead to fewer registration errors with test kits more likely to be registered against the right organisation number. If the <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> entered is not valid, you will be prompted by a new error message screen. If you are having issues remembering your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> you can use our online <a rel="external" href="https://organisation-number-lookup.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> look-up page</a> or call 119 if further support is required.</p>

<p>When you log into the registration portal, the âorganisation typeâ screen will now be removed. Instead, your organisation type will be linked based on your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>. This will make the registration process quicker for you.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> End-to-end process: agency managers</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Ordering test kits</h3>

<p>The agency manager is responsible for ordering test kits for the homecare workers in the team.</p>

<p>Each agency manager must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://request-testing.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">register for test kits</a>.</p>

<p>In order to apply, you will need:</p>

<ol>
  <li>your unique organisation number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>)</li>
  <li>total number of homecare workers for testing</li>
</ol>

<p>When ordering you will be asked to enter the number of residents or non-staff. You should enter zero for this.</p>

<p>Once you have placed an order, you will receive a confirmatory email from <a href="mailto:organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>The agency manager will receive an email from <a href="mailto:organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk</a> when their test kits have been dispatched, informing them of their delivery date.</p>

<p>Test kits will be delivered in boxes of 40 to the address of your homecare agency, as registered with <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>.</p>

<p>The agency manager is responsible for taking delivery of the test kits.</p>

<p>The agency manager must then order kits every 28 days for their homecare workers.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you have any issues ordering test kits, please call 119.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Communicating to your homecare workers</h3>

<p>The agency manager is responsible for communicating key information that homecare workers will need to successfully conduct testing.</p>

<p>We encourage agency managers to use existing communication channels that are best suited to your team.</p>

<p>The activities which need to take place are in the following table.</p>

<h4>Communication responsibilities for agency managers</h4>

    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Communication</th>
      <th scope="col">When to do this</th>

  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Distributing test kits</h3>

<p>Once the kits are delivered to the registered address, it is the agency managerâs responsibility to distribute them to homecare workers.</p>

<p>The agency manager should inform their team that the kits have arrived. They can either distribute the kits, or advise carers to collect 4 test kits each as soon as possible.</p>

<p>You will know how best to handle the distribution process for your team but below are some suggestions that have been put forward by homecare agencies as part of our initial research.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Homecare workers can pick up kits at the same time they pick up other materials (for example, PPE, consumables and other medical supplies)</li>
  <li>Agency managers or supervisors can hand out the kits to the group at daily/weekly meetings</li>
</ol>

<p>Ensure each care worker collects 4 kits every month so that weekly testing can continue without interruption</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Each test kit should include a pink individual Royal Mail return label. Please check that there is one in each bag provided.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Encouraging participation</h3>

<p>In order to protect your homecare workers and for the people they support, it is important that homecare workers are encouraged to complete the end-to-end weekly process of:</p>

<ol>
  <li>completing the test between Thursday and Sunday each week</li>
  <li>registering the test online</li>
  <li>returning the test through a priority post box</li>
</ol>

<p>Below are some ideas that we have seen work well to encourage participation for homecare workers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>digital tracker (for example, Microsoft Teams) so homecare workers can confirm they have tested each week</li>
  <li>a physical tracker (for example, a matrix on a team notice board with stickers for completed tests)</li>
  <li>text or WhatsApp group message reminders to test</li>
  <li>sending outlook invite placeholders to remind team members to test</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> Support available to you</h3>

<p>The Infection Control Fund (<abbr title="Infection Control Fund">ICF</abbr>), set up in May, has been extended until March 2021, with an extra Â£546 million for the care sector to take key steps to improve infection prevention and control, enabling providers to restrict staff movement in care homes and pay normal wages to staff who are self-isolating.</p>

<p>Providers may use funding from the extended <abbr title="Infection Control Fund">ICF</abbr> for reasonable administrative costs associated with organising and recording the outcomes of COVID-19 tests and where these are not being supported by other government funding streams. The decision to allow claims against the fund for these purposes would remain a choice for local authorities and no additional funding is being provided for these purposes.</p>

<p>Read more <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-infection-control-fund-round-2/adult-social-care-infection-control-fund-round-2-guidance" class="govuk-link">information on the conditions of this grant, as well as how to access funding</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> End-to-end process: homecare workers</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Collecting test kits</h3>

<p>The agency manager will inform homecare workers when test kits arrive and how they can be collected or distributed.</p>

<p>Each homecare worker should take 4 test kits, one for each of the 4 weekly testing cycles.</p>

<p>Please ensure you have postage labels for each test.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Prepare for testing by looking at guidance</h3>

<p>Before testing be sure to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read guidance for homecare workers</li>
  <li>read guidance included with your test kit</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-taking-swab-samples/how-to-use-the-self-swabbing-kit-for-a-combined-throat-and-nose-swab-video" class="govuk-link">watch the instructional video for self-swabbing</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If a homecare worker becomes symptomatic and has a kit available at home, they should test themselves in addition to the normal weekly cycle.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Using the test kits</h3>

<p>Homecare workers will conduct a combined throat and nose self-swab for the test</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-taking-swab-samples/how-to-use-the-self-swabbing-kit-for-a-combined-throat-and-nose-swab-video">Follow the instructional video on how to do a throat and nasal swab</a></p>

<p>You should only conduct your test between Thursdays and Sundays.</p>

<p>Always leave 7 days between tests where possible.</p>

<p>If possible, please continue testing while on holiday (in the UK) or off work due to an illness not related to coronavirus.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> Registering test kits</h3>

<p>Each week you should register your test after you have completed your test.</p>

<p>Correct registration of test kits is vital.</p>
</div>

<p>Numbers of registered kits are relatively small in comparison to the number of ordered kits. Please reiterate to your workers the importance of testing and correct registration. By doing this we will continue to understand the spread of the virus and be in a better position to prevent further spread.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span> Returning test kits</h3>

<p>Each test kit contains a pink pre-paid return label. Please attach this to the delivery packaging next to the security seal. If there is no label in the kit please check in the box that the kits were delivered in. If additional support is needed please call 119.</p>

<p>The test kit should be returned via a Royal Mail priority box.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.royalmail.com/services-near-you">Find your nearest priority post box and its collection times</a></p>
</div>

<p>Only use a Royal Mail priority post box. It will be labelled with the a âPriority Boxâ sign and one of the regional NHS logos. Please do not enter any Post Office with the kit.</p>

<p>To ensure samples reach the laboratories in time:</p>

<ol>
  <li>please post the kit at least one hour before the last collection time to ensure that is not missed</li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="https://www.royalmail.com/services-near-you" class="govuk-link">locate your nearest priority post box and collection times</a> in advance of testing â tests should be posted on the day they are completed</li>
  <li>some post boxes do not collect post on Sundays, and so please check if there is a collection available before testing on Sunday</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span> Receiving results</h3>

<p>The person tested will receive:</p>

<ol>
  <li>an email</li>
  <li>a text message (if a mobile phone number was provided at registration)</li>
</ol>

<p>The results will also include guidance on next steps for the person tested. We have included example guidance in the next few slides for your information.</p>

<p>Homecare workers should inform their employer of a positive result immediately so that they can protect others that the care worker may have come into contact with at work</p>
