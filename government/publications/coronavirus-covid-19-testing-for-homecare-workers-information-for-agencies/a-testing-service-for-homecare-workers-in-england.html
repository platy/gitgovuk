<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Regular asymptomatic coronavirus (COVID-19) testing is available to all homecare workers in England.</p>

<p>The guidance covers details of how providers can apply for test kits for their homecare workers. Homecare agencies will be responsible for ordering and distributing test kits to all homecare workers for them to conduct at home on a weekly basis.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>This guidance applies to staff who are asymptomatic. Anyone who is symptomatic should self-isolate immediately, order a PCR test from the government website and continue to isolate until they have received their result.</p>
</div>

<p>Homecare worker testing should only be conducted on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays (if the homecare worker is able to access a priority post box with Sunday collections).</p>

<h3>Why testing is important</h3>

<p>Testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifies whether homecare workers are likely to have COVID-19 so they can self-isolate if positive</li>
  <li>reduces the risk of those receiving care contracting the virus from those who care for them</li>
  <li>prevents and controls the spread of the virus by identifying asymptomatic cases</li>
</ul>

<p>Testing and self-isolation need to continue, regardless of the rollout of the vaccine programme. For the latest advice on how long to self-isolate and in what circumstances, read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings" class="govuk-link">management of staff and exposed residents guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Eligible organisations</h3>

<p>Your organisation is eligible if you are a Care Quality Commission (<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>)-regulated homecare organisation in England providing personal care.</p>

<p>If you believe you are eligible and have not been contacted by NHS Test and Trace with information on ordering test kits, please call 119.</p>

<h3>Unique Organisation Number</h3>

<p>NHS Test and Trace assigns all participating organisations a single Unique Organisation Number (<abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr>).</p>

<p>Agency managers will receive their <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr> via the email address registered with <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>. Please make sure that the person who receives these emails understands the importance of this message and knows who to contact.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr> is an 8-digit number that is exclusive to an individual organisation. This can be used to log in to all online elements of the testing process.</p>

<p>Agency managers will need to use their <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr> for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ordering test kits</li>
  <li>contacting the national coronavirus contact centre for support (dial 119)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please make sure that your <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr> is correct when you log into the portal. If the <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr> entered is not valid, you will be prompted by a new error message screen. If you are having issues remembering your <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr> you can use our online <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr> look-up page, or please call 119.</p>

<h3>A summary of your involvement</h3>

<h4>Agency managers</h4>

<p>If you are the manager of a homecare agency, you are responsible for a team of homecare workers or you have been delegated responsibility for testing by your organisation, your key responsibilities are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>order test kits for homecare workers</li>
  <li>communicate your agency’s <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr> to homecare workers</li>
  <li>distribute test kits to homecare workers</li>
  <li>encourage and support your homecare workers to complete weekly testing between Thursdays and Sundays</li>
</ul>

<h4>Homecare workers</h4>

<p>If you are a homecare worker who visits people with care and support needs at their homes, your key responsibilities are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>conduct tests weekly between Thursdays and Sundays</li>
  <li>register your tests as soon as you have completed them each week using your agency’s <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr>
</li>
  <li>return your test kits at a Royal Mail priority post box on the same day that you complete the test</li>
  <li>if you test positive for COVID-19, follow the guidance in the management of staff and exposed residents guidance</li>
  <li>regardless of your result, continue following all infection prevention and control (IPC) measures such as wearing personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>), washing your hands and socially distancing where possible</li>
  <li>if you develop symptoms of COVID-19, isolate at home and order a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test to conduct at home immediately. You can order a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test here.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step-by-step guide for agency managers</h2>

<h3>Ordering test kits</h3>

<p>The agency manager is responsible for ordering test kits for the homecare workers in the team.</p>

<p>Each agency manager must <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://request-testing.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/">register for test kits</a>.</p>

<p>In order to apply, you will need:</p>

<ol>
  <li>your unique organisation number (<abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr>)</li>
  <li>total number of homecare workers for testing</li>
</ol>

<p>When ordering you will be asked to enter the number of residents or non-staff. You should enter zero for this.</p>

<p>Once you have placed an order, you will receive a confirmatory email from <a href="mailto:organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>The agency manager will receive an email from <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk">organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk</a> when their test kits have been dispatched, informing them of their delivery date.</p>

<p>Test kits will be delivered to the address of your homecare agency, as registered with <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>.</p>

<p>The agency manager is responsible for taking delivery of the test kits.</p>

<p>The agency manager should then order kits every 28 days for their homecare workers.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you have any issues ordering test kits, please call 119.</p>
</div>

<h3>Distributing test kits</h3>

<p>Once the kits are delivered to the registered address, it is the agency manager’s responsibility to distribute them to homecare workers.</p>

<p>The agency manager should inform their team that the kits have arrived. They can either distribute the kits or advise carers to collect 4 test kits each as soon as possible.</p>

<p>You will know how best to handle the distribution process for your team but below are some suggestions that have been put forward by homecare agencies as part of our initial research.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Homecare workers can pick up kits at the same time they pick up other materials (for example, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, consumables and other medical supplies).</li>
  <li>Agency managers or supervisors can hand out the kits to the group at daily/weekly meetings.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ensure each care worker collects 4 kits every month so that weekly testing can continue without interruption</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Each test kit should include a pink individual Royal Mail return label. Please check that there is one in each bag provided.</p>
</div>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>To protect your homecare workers and the people they support, it is important that homecare workers are encouraged to complete:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the test between Thursday and Sunday each week</li>
  <li>registering the test online</li>
  <li>returning the test through a priority post box</li>
</ol>

<h3>Support available to you</h3>

<p>The Infection Control and Testing Fund (<abbr title="Infection Control Fund">ICF</abbr>) has been extended until March 2022, with a further £388.3 million for adult social care COVID-19 support, which will enable the sector to take key steps to manage infection prevention and control as well as access vaccines and testing.</p>

<p>Providers may use funding from the extended <abbr title="Infection Control Fund">ICF</abbr> for reasonable administrative costs associated with organising and recording the outcomes of COVID-19 tests and where these are not being supported by other government funding streams. The decision to allow claims against the fund for these purposes would remain a choice for local authorities and no additional funding is being provided for these purposes.</p>

<p>Read more <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-infection-control-fund-round-2/adult-social-care-infection-control-fund-round-2-guidance" class="govuk-link">information on the conditions of this grant, as well as how to access funding</a>.</p>

<h2>Step-by-step guide for homecare workers</h2>

<h3>Collecting test kits</h3>

<p>The agency manager will inform homecare workers when test kits arrive and how they can be collected or distributed.</p>

<p>Each homecare worker should take 4 test kits, one for each of the 4 weekly testing cycles.</p>

<p>Please ensure you have postage labels for each test.</p>

<h3>Read the instructions</h3>

<p>Before testing be sure to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read guidance for homecare workers</li>
  <li>read guidance included with your test kit</li>
</ul>

<p>If a homecare worker becomes symptomatic and has a kit available at home, they should test themselves in addition to the normal weekly cycle.</p>

<h3>Take a test</h3>

<p>Homecare workers should conduct a weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test.</p>

<p>You should only conduct your test between Thursdays and Sundays.</p>

<p>Always leave 7 days between tests where possible.</p>

<p>If possible, please continue testing while on holiday (in the UK) or off work due to an illness not related to COVID-19.</p>

<h3>Registering test kits</h3>

<p>Each week you should register your test after you have completed your test.</p>

<h4>Self-reporting step-by-step</h4>

<p>If there are any problems with registering a test kit, please call 119.</p>
</div>

<h4>Multiple registrations</h4>

<p>You can also use the record-keeping multiple registration spreadsheet to register up to 100 tests.</p>

<p>Ensure you only use the most recent version of the multiple upload spreadsheet to register COVID-19 tests for your organisation.</p>

<p>Organisations can still upload their testing data using the self-registration route. This is an additional option and does not replace the self-reporting routes.</p>

<p>You will need to read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/organisation-testing-registration-record-of-users">guidance and download the multiple registration spreadsheet</a> to record the details of people you’ve tested for COVID-19 on that day.</p>

<h3>Returning test kits</h3>

<p>Each test kit contains a pink pre-paid return label. Please attach this to the delivery packaging next to the security seal. If there is no label in the kit please check in the box that the kits were delivered in. If additional support is needed please call 119.</p>

<p>The test kit should be returned via a Royal Mail priority box.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.royalmail.com/services-near-you" class="govuk-link">Find your nearest priority post box and its collection times</a></p>
</div>

<p>Only use a Royal Mail priority post box. It will be labelled with the a ‘Priority Box’ sign and one of the regional NHS logos. Please do not enter any Post Office with the kit.</p>

<p>To ensure samples reach the laboratories in time:</p>

<ol>
  <li>please post the kit at least one hour before the last collection time to ensure that is not missed</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.royalmail.com/services-near-you" class="govuk-link" rel="external">locate your nearest priority post box and collection times</a> in advance of testing – tests should be posted on the day they are completed</li>
  <li>some post boxes do not collect post on Sundays, and so please check if there is a collection available before testing on Sunday</li>
</ol>

<h3>Receiving results</h3>

<p>The person tested will receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an email</li>
  <li>a text message (if a mobile phone number was provided at registration)</li>
</ul>

<p>Homecare workers should inform their employer of a positive result immediately and follow the management of exposed staff and residents guidance.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-than-500-million-for-social-care-to-reduce-coronavirus-transmission-over-winter" class="govuk-link">The <abbr title="Infection Control Fund">ICF</abbr> can be used to pay the wages of staff who have to self-isolate</a>.</p>

<h2>Testing within 90 days of a positive result</h2>

<p>If you have tested positive with an <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, the testing you undertake in the following 90 days may be different. Full guidance on what testing to undertake within 90 days of a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> or <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> result can be found in the management of staff guidance.</p>
