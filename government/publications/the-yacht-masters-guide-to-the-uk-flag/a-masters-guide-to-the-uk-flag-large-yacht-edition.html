<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide is for managers, masters and officers of United Kingdom registered large commercial yachts. The legal requirements, forms, etc. of other Registers including Red Ensign Group (REG) registers will vary from those of the UK. Check with your Flag state administration for specific rules for your vessel.</p>

<p>The purpose of the guide is to provide easy to use information regarding United Kingdom merchant shipping regulations and administrative procedures. UK regulations and procedures may differ from those of other Flag Administrations that you may be familiar with, this guide will help you to comply with UK requirements.</p>

<p>Detailed requirements for operating UK Flagged Large Yachts can be found in The Red Ensign Group Yacht Code (REG Code), UK Regulations, Merchant Shipping Notices, Guidance to Surveyors and various publications including the Code of Safe Working Practices, MCA SOLAS V publication and Health and Safety leaflets; this detailed information is available on the MCA’s web site at:</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/mca">https://www.gov.uk/mca</a></p>

<span class="number">1. </span> Manning and STCW Requirements</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Manning On-Board</h3>

<p>(See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.redensigngroup.org/publications/" rel="external">REG Code - Part A, Chapter 24 - Common Annex G</a>)</p>

<p>1.1.1 All commercially operated large yachts on the United Kingdom register must have a Safe Manning Document issued by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s (MCA) Seafarer Training and Certification Branch to signify that the Administration has approved the minimum manning levels for the yacht. Safe Manning Documents are issued as per <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.redensigngroup.org/media/1093/reg-yacht-code-january-2019-edition-common-annexes.pdf" rel="external">REG Yacht Code – Common Annex G3</a>. Class and other organisations are not permitted to issue Safe Manning Documents for United Kingdom ships. Further details for deck officers can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/msn-1858-mf-uk-requirements-for-deck-officers-on-large-yachts-over-24m">MSN 1858 (M)</a> as amended, for engineer officers in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/msn-1859-mf-uk-requirements-for-engineer-officers-on-large-yachts-over-24m">MSN 1859 (M)</a> and for ratings in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/msn-1862-m-uk-requirements-for-deck-ratings">MSN 1862 (M)</a>.</p>

<p>1.1.2 Applications for a Safe Manning Document should be made using the yacht specific form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-apply-for-a-safe-manning-document-for-yachts">MSF 4208</a>, this can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a> website.</p>

<p>1.1.3 Manning requirements on UK flagged yachts are the same whether registered as a pleasure vessel “private” or as a commercial vessel.</p>

<p>1.1.4 The number and categories of officers and crew stated on the Safe Manning Document signifies the minimum number required to safely take the yacht to sea. The vessel must not proceed to sea with less than this number on-board.</p>

<p>1.1.5 If due to exceptional circumstances a seafarer must be removed from the vessel and a replacement cannot join the ship in time it may be possible for the vessel to continue to operate, for a limited period, with one seafarer less than the specified safe manning. If a master plans to sail a vessel in non-compliance with the Safe Manning Document, they must request the MCA to issue an Exemption Certificate. however, the master must ensure that the remaining crew continue to comply with the Hours of Work Regulations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> United Kingdom Certificates of Equivalent Competency</h3>

<p>(See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/msn-1867-m-uk-requirements-for-the-recognition-of-non-uk-certification-leading-to-the-issue-of-a-cec">MSN 1867 (M)</a>)</p>

<p>1.2.1 All officers who do not possess a UK Certificate of Competency must hold a United Kingdom Certificate of Equivalent Competency issued by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Seafarer Training and Certification Branch.</p>

<p>1.2.2 The master must ensure that all officers who require a United Kingdom Certificate of Equivalent Competency (CEC) hold one and that they also hold the original of their national Certificate of Competency (COC). If an officer does not hold a United Kingdom Certificate of Equivalent Competency when they join the vessel then the master should check that an application for a CEC has been made. Applications are usually made by the owner/manager and if an application has been made a Confirmation of Receipt of Application (CRA) from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency may be requested. Where requested, these are sent to the manager or owner as soon as the application is received. A copy of the CRA should be retained on-board until such time as the officer’s Certificate of Equivalent Competency (CEC) arrives. A CRA permits the officer to sail for up to 3 months from the time of application for a CEC.</p>

<p>1.2.3 These procedures are important and must be followed to show any Port State Control Inspector that the Company has followed the correct procedures for the application for a United Kingdom Certificate of Equivalent Competency. This should protect the vessel from possible detention on these grounds.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> Watch Keeping Ratings / Yacht Ratings</h3>

<p>(See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/msn-1862-m-uk-requirements-for-deck-ratings">MSN 1862 (M)</a>)</p>

<p>1.3.1 All ratings must have as a pre-requisite the following elements of STCW basic training:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Personal Survival Techniques (STCW Code – Table A-VI/1-1)</li>
  <li>Fire Prevention and Fire Fighting (STCW Code – Table A-VI/1-2)</li>
  <li>Elementary First Aid (STCW Code – Table A-VI/1-3)</li>
  <li>Personal Safety and Social Responsibilities (STCW Code - Table A-VI/1-4)</li>
  <li>Security awareness training (&gt;500GT) (STCW A-VI/6- 4)</li>
</ul>

<p>1.3.2 All ratings assigned to watch keeping duties must be in possession of Watch Rating Certificates appropriate to their duties. Holders of non-STCW Yacht Master licenses, such as RYA Yacht Master Ocean, must also hold a Yacht Rating certificate if they are employed as a Yacht Rating on-board. This ensures mutual international recognition under the STCW Convention. Watch Rating Certificates issued by countries other than the United Kingdom are acceptable on United Kingdom ships provided they are issued by countries which are parties to the STCW Convention.</p>

<p>1.3.3 A Yacht Rating Certificate is a specific type of Navigational Watch Rating Certificate that is focused on Large Yachts. A Navigational Watch Rating Certificate (STCW II/4) is acceptable on a yacht, a Yacht Rating Certificate (STCW II/4) may not be acceptable on a vessel other than a yacht.</p>

<p>Those persons wishing to gain Watch Rating Certificates will find guidance in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/msn-1862-m-uk-requirements-for-deck-ratings">MSN 1862(M)</a> on the training and application process.</p>

<p>1.3.4 Companies that wish to issue their own Yacht Rating certificates can apply to the MCA. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/msn-1862-m-uk-requirements-for-deck-ratings">MSN 1862(M)</a> for guidance on becoming an approved company.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span> Ship’s Cooks / Chefs and Catering Staff</h3>

<p>1.4.1 The Merchant Shipping (Maritime Labour Convention) (Minimum Requirements for Seafarers etc.) Regulations 2014 (the “Minimum Requirements Regulations”) require that all Ship’s Cooks, catering staff and other persons processing food in the galley, on-board UK flagged vessels should be suitably qualified in food hygiene or food safety in Catering.</p>

<p>1.4.2 A list of qualifications and awarding bodies which fulfil the learning outcomes and assessment criteria set out in Annex 1 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/msn-1846-m-maritime-labour-convention-2006-food-and-catering-ships-cooks-and-catering-staff">MSN 1846 (M)</a> are provided in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1037786/MIN_671__M__MLC_Food_and_catering_recognised_qualifications_in_food_hygiene_or_food_safety.pdf" rel="external">MIN 671 (M)</a><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. Level 2 is the minimum acceptable level for ship’s cooks, catering staff and other persons processing food in the galley.</p>

<p>1.4.3 The learning outcomes (Annex 1 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/msn-1846-m-maritime-labour-convention-2006-food-and-catering-ships-cooks-and-catering-staff">MSN 1846 (M)</a>) also apply to the training for stewards and all persons preparing food in the galley for whom food preparation is not a primary role. However, these persons are not required to hold the qualifications as listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1037786/MIN_671__M__MLC_Food_and_catering_recognised_qualifications_in_food_hygiene_or_food_safety.pdf" rel="external">MIN 671 (M)</a><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> as it is expected that they would be working under qualified supervision.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span> Medical Fitness Certificates</h3>

<p>All crew require valid medical fitness certificates. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/msn-1815-amendment-6-equivalent-medical-certificates">MSN 1815 (M)</a> has a list of countries whose medical certificates are accepted as equivalent to a UK medical certificate (ENG 1) and is updated periodically. A valid medical fitness certificate issued by any of the listed countries can be accepted on a UK flagged yacht. Seafarers must work within the limits of any restriction or condition placed on their medical fitness certificate and report any change in their medical condition to an approved doctor for reassessment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span> UK Discharge Books</h3>

<p>(See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mgn-134-issue-of-discharge-books-to-uk-seafarers">MGN 134 (M+F)</a>)</p>

<p>All officers and crew on UK ships should apply for a UK Discharge Book. Discharge books are generally used to confirm sea service as required by the MLC regulations. If a seafarer holds a discharge book (or equivalent document) issued by one of the countries listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mgn-134-issue-of-discharge-books-to-uk-seafarers">MGN 134 (M+F)</a>, they are not eligible to apply for a UK Discharge Book.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Hours of Work and Rest</h2>

<p>The applicable United Kingdom regulations are the Merchant Shipping (Hours of Work) Regulations 2018 (SI 2018 No.58). An unofficial consolidated text is available on the website at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/58/contents" rel="external">https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/58/contents</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Rest</h3>

<p>2.1.1 Every seafarer must be provided with not less than 10 hours rest in total in any 24-hour period, provided that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the 10-hour period may be divided into not more than two periods, one of which shall be not less than 6 hours. and</li>
  <li>the interval between consecutive periods of rest shall not exceed 14 hours, and</li>
  <li>the minimum hours of rest shall not be less than 77 hours in any 7 day period.</li>
</ul>

<p>2.1.2 Situations when a seafarer is on standby but is free to sleep may be counted as rest but if at any time the normal period of rest is disturbed by callouts to work, this should be recorded as hours of work and the master, or a person authorised by the master, must ensure that the seafarer is provided with an adequate compensatory period of rest. “Call-outs to work”, include taking part in a safety drill. It should be noted that the 10-hour minimum period of daily rest must not be split into more than two periods. Multiple short periods of rest adding up to 10 hours do not provide sufficient rest to avoid fatigue.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Unmanned Machinery Space (UMS)</h3>

<p>The time when the designated duty engineer officer on a yacht with an Unmanned Machinery Space (UMS) class notation is free to sleep may also be counted as “rest”. However, any time that the officer is called to answer an alarm condition must be considered as work.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Schedule of Shipboard Working Arrangements</h3>

<p>2.3.1 Every yacht should have a ‘Table of Shipboard Working Arrangements’ showing the proposed rotas for in port and at sea. This is a document, or a computer display, that has been drawn up by the owner or manager (whoever is responsible for operating the ship) in conjunction with the master. It must show the maximum watch periods and minimum rest periods to be observed by all crew members.</p>

<p>2.3.2 The Table of Shipboard Working Arrangements should follow the model format developed by the IMO, a copy of which is in the Annexes to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/msn-1877-amendment-1-hours-of-work-and-entitlement-to-leave">MSN 1877 (M)</a> as amended. The table demonstrates that sufficient personnel are available on-board to cover all watches and to ensure minimum hours of rest can be provided. Only the master should amend the table and only after careful consideration to ensure that adequate rest periods are provided for all seafarers. Port State Control officers and MCA surveyors will expect to see a copy of this table posted on-board. It is likely that a deficiency will be raised if not found.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Schedule of Working Hours.</h3>

<p>2.4.1 Accurate records of hours of rest should be maintained. The IMO-approved format should be used, a copy of which is in the Annexes to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/msn-1877-amendment-1-hours-of-work-and-entitlement-to-leave">MSN 1877 (M)</a> as amended. One copy should be held by the master and a copy given to the seafarer. The hours of</p>

<p>rest record should be endorsed by both the seafarer and the master or their deputy.</p>

<p>2.4.2 Any deviations from the hours of rest in the schedule must be recorded with an explanation of why the deviation occurred. These records must be available for inspection on-board at any time. You can decide where the deviations are recorded, and you can use any method that is effective provided that the records are available for inspection.</p>

<p>2.4.3 Electronic records are acceptable where the system used is secure, allows the seafarer to access them and allows records to be printed off when requested for inspection. The electronic record should follow the format as described in paragraph 2.4.1.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> ‘Properly Rested’</h3>

<p>The regulations place a duty on the master to ensure that all crew involved in watch keeping are properly rested and that arrangements are adequate to maintain a safe watch at all times. You are required to ensure that your yacht does not sail from any port unless all seafarers, regardless of their duty to watchkeeping, immediately after sailing have received sufficient rest.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span> Exceptions from the schedule</h3>

<p>2.6.1 The regulations acknowledge that on-board any vessel there will be situations such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Emergencies and situations likely to become emergencies unless action is taken.</li>
  <li>Essential work on-board which cannot be delayed for safety or environmental protection reasons, and</li>
  <li>Factors beyond the control of the master or the operator other than commercial needs.</li>
</ul>

<p>2.6.2 When these things occur it is often necessary for crew members who are involved to miss out on their minimum rest as stated in the schedule. You have the authority as master to permit this, but you must record the fact and the reason for missing out on the minimum rest for those affected as you may need to justify your decision at a later date.</p>

<p>2.6.3 As soon as practicable after the normal situation has been restored the master must ensure that any seafarer who has been unable to take adequate rest, is provided with compensatory rest before continuing with their normal duties.</p>

<p>2.6.4 In deciding what factors might come within “factors outside the control of the master or the operator other than commercial needs” you will need to consider the circumstances. The definition was written to take account of situations such as when a Port Authority demands that the ship vacate the berth when you had planned to stay longer, or when a shift of berth is demanded unexpectedly. A request by the charterer to sail earlier so that they may minimise port dues is not a valid factor under this definition and counts as a commercial need.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.7 </span> Statutory Paid Leave</h3>

<p>2.7.1 The regulations state that a seafarer is entitled to paid annual leave of at least 2.5 days per month of employment, plus an additional 8 days per year (in respect of UK public holidays) or a proportion of those periods in respect of a period of employment of less than one month or one year. This may be taken in instalments but may not be replaced by a payment in lieu, except where the seafarer’s employment is terminated. Annual Leave is provided to ensure that the seafarer is adequately rested and to support a healthy lifestyle. Replacing Leave owed with money does not achieve this even if the seafarer agrees. The master has a duty to ensure that their crew are provided with annual leave in accordance with their SEA (Payment in lieu is only permitted for untaken leave at the end of a contract).</p>

<p>2.7.2 Arrangements for when leave can be taken should be agreed between the seafarer, the master and the employer.</p>

<p>2.7.3 Where seafarers have regular periods of leave as part of their pattern of work (e.g. one month on, one month off) statutory paid leave may be included</p>

<p>within that pattern. This should be made clear in the individual’s Seafarer Employment Agreement (SEA).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.8 </span> Shore leave</h3>

<p>2.8.1 Wherever possible, where consistent with their operational duties, seafarers should be granted shore leave in ports of call, for the benefit of their health and well-being.</p>

<p>2.8.2 There is no absolute duty to give seafarers shore leave in all circumstances. For example, where there is public disorder or a security risk in the port, shore leave may not benefit the seafarer’s health and well-being. Additionally, this requirement does not override the normal port security arrangements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Seafarers Employment Agreements (SEAs) and Lists of Crew</h2>

<p>(See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mgn-477-m-amendment-2-mlc-seafarers-employment-agreements">MGN 477 (M) As Amended</a>)</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Introduction to the requirements</h3>

<p>3.1.1 For yachts in commercial use; The Merchant Shipping (Maritime Labour Convention) Minimum Requirements for Seafarers etc. Regulations 2014 requires that every seafarer working on a sea-going United Kingdom ship shall have an agreement in writing with the shipowner, or with their employer and the shipowner, setting out their terms and conditions for working on-board. This is known as a seafarer employment agreement (SEA), and may consist of one or more documents, but must contain at least minimum provisions, which can be found listed in Annex 1 to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mgn-477-m-amendment-2-mlc-seafarers-employment-agreements">MGN 477 (M) As Amended</a>. It is important that the seafarer should have the opportunity to review and take advice on the SEA before signing it and must enter into the agreement freely. The SEA should be signed before the seafarer joins the yacht.</p>

<p>3.1.2 For yachts not in commercial use; The Merchant Shipping Act 1995, requires that every United Kingdom ship shall have an agreement in writing between each person employed and the person employing them, known as crew agreements. Refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mgn-477-m-amendment-2-mlc-seafarers-employment-agreements">MGN 477 (M) As Amended</a> for details.</p>

<p>3.1.3 The SEA is a requirement of both UK legislation and of the ILO Maritime Labour Convention, 2006. Failure to ensure that seafarers have a valid SEA may constitute an offence by the shipowner and may result in the ship being detained following a port State Control inspection.</p>

<p>3.1.4 On-board complaints procedures should be available, as stipulated in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/msn-1849-on-board-complaints-procedure">MSN 1849 (M)</a>. The Merchant Shipping (Maritime Labour Convention) (Survey and Certification) Regulations 2013 requires every ship to which the regulations apply to have in place an on-board complaints procedure which must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>seek to resolve the complaint at the lowest level possible</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enable a seafarer to complain directly to the master and appropriate external authorities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>include the right of the seafarer to be accompanied or represented when making a Complaint</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure that the seafarer does not suffer any detriment for making a complaint</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In all cases seafarers must have the right to lodge a complaint directly with the master and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> List of Crew</h3>

<p>3.2.1 The MLC requires that a record of seafarers under the age of 18 employed on-board is maintained.</p>

<p>3.2.2 On a UK vessel, the list of young persons is provided within annexes to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mgn-477-m-amendment-2-mlc-seafarers-employment-agreements">MGN 477 (M) As Amended</a> but is available as a separate document as follows, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/957338/MGN_477_Amendment_1_MLC_list_of_young_persons_MSF_4158.pdf" rel="external">MLC list of young persons (MSF 4158)</a>.</p>

<p>3.2.3 In addition to maintaining the List of Crew for those under 18, each crew member joining the vessel should be recorded in the List of Crew in the Official Log Book. When a crew member leaves the vessel, this should be entered into the OLB Narrative.</p>

<p>3.2.4 An up-to-date copy of the List of Crew used to record those employed under the age of 18 must be maintained ashore at an address in the UK.</p>

<p>3.2.5 The List of Crew for those under 18 remains valid until the last member of the crew on the list has been discharged from the vessel. A copy of the List of Crew must be sent when the list is closed, and at least every 6 months, to the Registry of Shipping and Seamen, together with the Official Log Book (OLB). A postal address is provided in Chapter 4.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Official Log Books</h2>

<p>4.1 The Merchant Shipping (Official Log Book) Regulations 1981 (as amended) make it a requirement for all United Kingdom Commercial Yachts to carry and keep an Official Log Book.</p>

<p>4.2 The Official Log Book (OLB) has guidance notes on the front cover that should be read and followed. It is essential that all the relevant entries are fully completed. For example, the absence of proper entries could prejudice the position of the master in the event of an accident. It is an offence to knowingly make false, inaccurate, or incomplete entries.</p>

<h3>Page 1 – Front Cover</h3>

<p>4.3 The first entries are simply the details of the ship; name, port of registry, official number, gross tonnage and net tonnage. The details should be taken from the ship’s certificate of registry, noting that the official number is a unique British ship number; it is not the IMO number.</p>

<p>4.4 The second section is for the names of successive masters of the ship. The master opening the Official Log Book should enter their name and certificate details on the first line, successive masters should add their details when they take over command. If a master has been on the ship before and returns while the log book is still in use, they do not need to add their name a second time.</p>

<p>4.5 The third section is for the details and address of the registered owner, or the managing owner, manager etc.</p>

<p>4.6 The final section on page 1 is for the date and place at which the log book is opened.</p>

<p>4.7 All entries in the boxes on page 1 must be made by the master.</p>

<p>Note that the ‘superintendent’ referred to at the bottom of the page is an official at the Registry (RSS).</p>

<h3>Pages 2 to 7 – Record of Seamen Employed in the Ship</h3>

<p>4.8 This section records all the crew members. The first column “Reference number in list of crew” is for the consecutive number given to each entry in the crew list. When each crew member joins, the number opposite to their entry in the list is entered in this first column, their name is entered in the second column and the capacity in which they are employed is entered in the third.</p>

<p>4.9 If a crew member leaves the ship and then returns while the log book is still in use, they should be entered again with their new number from the list of crew. It may happen that the same crew member will have several entries in this section of the OLB.</p>

<p>4.10 Column 4 “If entry made in narrative section give relevant page.” forms an index. If any entry in respect of a crew member is made in the narrative section of the log book (pages 40 onwards) then the narrative section page number is entered at the same time in column 4. If there are several entries then the page number of each is added, separated by a comma.</p>

<p>An example of the completed section will look like:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Reference   Number in list of crew</th>
      <th scope="col">Name   of Seamen (Use capital letters please)</th>
      <th scope="col">Capacity   in which employed</th>
      <th scope="col">If   entry made in narrative section give relevant page</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

      <td>Second   Officer</td>
      <td>42,   43, 46</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>4.11 All entries in this section should be made by the master.</p>

<h3>Pages 8 and 9 – Births and Deaths</h3>

<p>4.12 Instructions for completion are at the top of the section. It should be noted that in the section for births, the signature of the mother is required while in the section for deaths, the signature of the master and the signature of a member of the crew are both required. The crew member may be any crew member.</p>

<p>4.13 It is essential that the mother’s signature is given in the case of a birth and essential that the entries in respect of deaths are signed by the master and by a crew member. A failure to sign and witness these entries can invalidate them and can cause serious legal problems.</p>

<p>4.14 The Return of Births and Deaths form MSF 4605 referred to is available from the Registry of Shipping and Seamen or any Marine Office.</p>

<h3>Pages 10 to 14 – Record of Musters, Boat Drills etc</h3>

<p>4.15 This section must be completed at the time of every drill. Attention is drawn to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mgn-71-muster-drill-onboard-training-decision-support-system">MGN 71 (M) ‘Muster, drills, on-board training and instructions and Decision Support Systems’</a>. This sets out the current requirements for the frequency of drills and content.

<p>4.16 Every entry must be signed by the master and by one other crew member. If it is not signed by both, the entry is invalid and will not be accepted as proof that the drills have been carried out.</p>

<p>4.17 If for any reason a muster or drill is not held then a statement as to the reason why should be entered in column 2. Valid reasons might include ‘vessel rolling and pitching heavily, unsafe to carry out drills’.</p>

<p>4.18 If a drill is postponed or cancelled then it should take place at the next suitable opportunity. It is also acceptable to carry out a tabletop drill on occasion but drills utilizing equipment and realistic scenarios are preferred.</p>

<p>4.19 In addition, drills are required for Entry into Dangerous Spaces. The master of any yacht of 500GT and over must ensure that drills simulating the rescue of a crew member from a dangerous space are held at intervals not exceeding two months, and that a record of such drills is entered in the Official Log Book.</p>

<h3>Pages 15 to 18 – Record of Test Drills and Inspections of Steering Gear</h3>

<p>4.20 This section is self-explanatory. The regulations require steering gear to be tested within 12 hours before sailing (or once per week for ships making one voyage or more per week from the same port) and emergency steering systems to be tested every 3 months.</p>

<p>Typical entries might appear as:</p>

<p>4.21 As with most sections of the OLB all entries must be signed by the master and an officer to be valid.</p>

<h3>Pages 19 to 23 – Record of Inspections of Crew Accommodation</h3>

<p>4.22 This section is for records of mandatory inspections of crew accommodation. The regulations require that an inspection of the crew accommodation, to ensure that it is being kept clean and that all the requirements of the crew accommodation regulations are being followed, is carried out every 7 days. The inspection must be carried out by the master or an officer appointed by the master, accompanied by one other member of the crew. Both should sign the OLB entry.</p>

<h3>Pages 24 to 28 – Record of Inspections of Food and Water</h3>

<p>4.23 Guidelines for food hygiene are contained in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/msn-1845-m-maritime-labour-convention-2006-food-catering-provision-of-food-and-fresh-water">MSN 1845 (M)</a>.</p>

<p>4.25 The records of inspections in this section are similar to those in the previous section. The Maritime Labour Convention and the United Kingdom Regulation requires that inspections are carried out at intervals of not more than 7 days.</p>

<p>4.26 The inspections in this section must be made by the master or an officer appointed by the master, accompanied by a member of the catering staff. In practice it will usually be possible to inspect provisions, store rooms, galleys etc. with a member of the catering department during the accommodation inspection.</p>

<p>4.27 Entries in this section must be signed by the master and by the member of the crew making the inspection. Typical entries might appear as:</p>

<h3>Page 29 – Load Line, Depth of Loading etc</h3>

<p>4.28 This section is self-explanatory. The information must be completed and the necessary data can be found on the ship’s load line certificate. The section should be completed by the master at the same time as the log book is opened. It should be noted that those vessels on Near Coastal operations can follow the instructions at the bottom of this page of the OLB and need only complete certain sections of the Load Line declaration. This section of the OLB represents the master’s legal declaration that they are not putting to sea with the vessel’s Load Line immersed.</p>

<h3>Pages 30 to 39 – Dates of Departure From and Arrival at Each Dock</h3>

<p>4.29 This section records the date of sailing and the draughts and freeboards of the ship on departure for each voyage and the dates of arrival at the next port. It must be completed at departure.</p>

<h3>Pages 40 to 76 Narrative Section</h3>

<p>4.30 This section is for explanatory entries. A complete list of the categories of entry to be made is contained in the Official Log Book Regulations. In general terms this section should contain entries relating to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>changes of master</li>
  <li>the annexing of other documents to the OLB</li>
  <li>accidents</li>
  <li>casualties</li>
  <li>disciplinary matters</li>
  <li>discharge of crew members</li>
  <li>details of crew left behind</li>
  <li>desertions</li>
  <li>complaints</li>
  <li>promotions and demotions</li>
  <li>criminal convictions during a voyage</li>
  <li>illness</li>
  <li>deaths</li>
  <li>appointments of safety officers, representatives and committees</li>
  <li>meetings of safety committees</li>
  <li>wages disputes</li>
  <li>closing of Lists of Crew and OLB.</li>
</ul>

<p>4.31 If it is not practicable due to its length, or for any other reason for an entry to be contained in the narrative section, it shall be contained in a separate document annexed to the OLB and referred to in an entry in the narrative section.</p>

<p>4.32 Some fictional examples, designed to illustrate the type of entries that might commonly be made, are below. Every entry must be signed by the master and by a member of the crew.</p>

<p>4.33 The page number for every entry in the narrative section which refers to a crew member should be entered in column 4 of the list of crew section.</p>

<p>4.34 The requirements for opening and closing an OLB are contained in the Merchant Shipping (Official Log Books) Regulations 1981 as amended (SI 1981/0569). In summary, the logbook should be closed 6 months after the first entry is made. Should an OLB become full, another OLB should be started. An entry should be made in the narrative section of the second or subsequent book which reflects that this is a continuation book. All the books should be returned with the completed List of Crew for those under 18 when the yacht first calls into port more than 6 months after the first entry into the book.</p>

<p>4.35 These completed documents should be sent to the Registry of Shipping and Seamen (RSS) at the following address:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>4.36 There is also a requirement to record the official working language of the ship. If this is not recorded elsewhere on-board, then it should be recorded in the OLB narrative section.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Continuous Synopsis Record</h2>

<p>Where yachts are required hold an International Ship Security Certificate (ISSC) (≥500GT) they should hold a document called a ‘Continuous Synopsis Record’ (CSR). This is a form of log book that stays with the ship for its whole life and records all changes of owner, flag, name, class, ISM etc. Whenever a change occurs a new section or a new document is issued and then each has a consecutive number. The numbers should show a complete record. If a ship is sold this document must stay with the ship. The master is responsible for the proper upkeep of the CSR on-board UK ships. When you first receive a new CSR, or first join the ship, you should check that the details are correct. Port State Control will check the CSR as a matter of routine at inspections and will expect to see a continuous record, with the final document showing the current ship’s details.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Making Amendments to the CSR</h3>

<p>When any data entry in the current CSR requires an amendment, you must act as quickly as possible. To do this you should fill in the changes on the Form 2 and send this to the Registry of Shipping and Seamen (RSS) who will enter the new changes in the ship’s master record and issue a new CSR sheet with the next consecutive number to be attached to the record on-board. After this is done you must ensure that the Index of Amendments (Form 3) is kept up to date and also attached to the current CSR in date order.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Receiving an Amended CSR</h3>

<p>5.2.1 When you receive a new CSR or an amendment sheet, you should check its sequential number to make sure it is the correct one, review the data entries to make sure they are correct, and they cover all amendments in the Index of Amendments. You must keep all CSRs issued to the vessel. You should have a sequential record starting from 1.</p>

<p>5.2.2 If you find that there are amendments that are not included in the CSR you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>complete a new Amendment Form 2 relating to each outstanding amendment and attach it to the latest CSR. List the amendments in the Index of Amendments (Form 3) attached to the latest CSR; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>forward copies of the original Amendment Form(s) to the Registry of Shipping and Seamen.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>5.2.3 If, for any reason, the ship’s CSR records are lost or damaged it is essential that they are restored as quickly as possible to avoid potential delays to the ship’s voyage. You should contact RSS as quickly as possible and they will provide signed and stamped duplicates.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Registry</h2>

<p>A yacht may be registered as a commercial vessel or as a pleasure vessel. The type of registration depends on how the yacht will be used. If guests are carried that do not meet the definition of – ‘Owner, their friends or family’, then the yacht is on a commercial voyage and must be registered commercially. Whether the guest is paying to be on the voyage is immaterial. Commercial yachts must comply with the REG Yacht Code.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> Registration Documents</h3>

<p>For Part 1 Commercial registration the following documentation is required. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukshipregister.co.uk/registration/" rel="external">https://www.ukshipregister.co.uk/registration/</a></p>

<ol>
  <li>The Correct Fee.</li>
  <li>Original Application Form, MSF 4740A</li>
  <li>Original Declaration of Eligibility, MSF 4727</li>
  <li>Original Last Bill of Sale MSF 4705 or Builders Certificate MSF 4743 (if a new build)</li>
  <li>Copy of the Certificate of Incorporation (if company owned)</li>
  <li>Original Certificate of Survey for Tonnage and Measurement</li>
  <li>International Tonnage Certificate (ITC69) – (for vessels &gt;500GT)</li>

  <li>A copy of the ship’s Continuous Synopsis Record.</li>
  <li>Mortgage Registration Forms MSF 4736, MSF 4737 and MSF 4739</li>
</ol>

<p>If the vessel is to be registered as pleasure, then a coding certificate is not necessary but 5 years of original title in the form of original bills of sale/builders’ certificate is required. If your yacht is registered commercial and holds a Large Yacht Code certificate, then you must maintain the conditions of the certificate at all times for it to remain valid. When you are carrying the Owner, or transiting the Atlantic with no guests, you must maintain full compliance with the Large Yacht Code.</p>

<p>As an alternative to this, you may re-register your yacht as a Pleasure Registered vessel and so the Large Yacht Code does not apply. When the voyage is over, you may re-register again as a Commercial yacht. There is no charge for this, and you may do it as many times as you wish.</p>

<p>If you have missed a required survey window whilst operating as a pleasure-registered yacht, then you must be re-surveyed before operating as a commercial yacht.</p>

<p>The Large Yacht Code (REG Code) is the safety standard that the MCA considers appropriate for a large internationally operating yacht (over 24m LLL). It is the required standard for commercially operating yachts, but it is also very highly recommended that this same standard be adopted voluntarily for pleasure-registered yachts of this type.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> GMDSS Log Book</h2>

<p>7.1 All UK ships of 300GT or greater are required to carry a Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS) Log Book. MCA GMDSS Radio Logs are available from The Stationery Office (TSO), ref <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mgn-530-radio-log-book-merchant-shipping-and-fishing-vessels">MGN 530 (M+F)</a>. The log book is to keep records of communications relating to distress, urgency and safety radio traffic, regular positions of the ship and results of tests on radio equipment.</p>

<p>7.2 Instructions for completing the log book are contained in the book. GMDSS Log Books should be returned to RSS with the Official Log Book and List of Crew when these are closed.</p>

<p>7.3 It is not compulsory to carry an MCA version of GMDSS Log books however the following tests, listed in the front of the UK GMDSS Log, must be carried out and recorded in some form:</p>

<h3>Radio tests required:</h3>

<h4>Daily</h4>

<p>(a) The proper functioning of the DSC facilities shall be tested at least once each day, without radiation of signals, by use of the means provided on the equipment.</p>

<p>(b) Batteries providing a source of energy for any part of the radio installations shall be tested daily, and where necessary, brought up to the fully charged condition.</p>

<p>(c) Printer(s) shall be checked daily to ensure there is an adequate supply 
of paper.</p>

<h4>Weekly</h4>

<p>(a) The proper operation of the DSC facilities shall be tested at least once a week by means of a test call when within communication range of a coast station fitted with DSC equipment. Where a ship has been out of communication range of a coast station fitted with DSC equipment for a period of longer than one week, a test call shall be made on the first opportunity that the ship is within communication range such as a coast station.</p>

<p>(b) Where the reserve source of energy is not a battery (for example, a motor generator), the reserve source of energy shall be tested weekly.</p>

<h4>Monthly</h4>

<p>(a) Each EPIRB and satellite EPIRB shall be tested at least once a month to determine its capability to operate properly using the means provided on the device and without using the satellite system.</p>

<p>(b) Each search and rescue radar transponder shall be checked at least once a month using the in-built test facility and checked for security and signs of damage.</p>

<p>(c) A check shall be made at least once a month on the security and condition of all batteries providing a source of energy for any part of a radio installation. The battery connections and compartment shall also be checked.</p>

<p>(d) A check shall be made at least once a month on the conditions of all aerials and insulators.</p>

<p>(e) Each survival craft two-way VHF equipment shall be tested at least once a month on a frequency other than 156.8 MHz (VHF Channel 16).</p>

<span class="number">8. </span> On-Board Safety</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span> Safety Officials and Committees</h3>

<p>(See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-safe-working-practices-for-merchant-seafarers-coswp-2021">Code of Safe Working Practices</a> Chapter 13)</p>

<p>8.1.1 Every person on-board a ship has a responsibility for safety. Merchant shipping regulations place specific responsibilities on those personnel, ‘safety officials’, with designated duties to ensure the safety of those on-board. A ship’s safety culture is dependent upon the strong support and encouragement from the ship’s senior management. On every ship where five or more seafarers are working, the owner or the manager is required to appoint a safety officer.</p>

<h4>Safety Officer</h4>

<p>8.1.2 The master is required to record the appointment of a safety officer in the Official Log Book. The safety officer should have suitable training, be familiar with the statutory responsibilities for health and safety and with the principles and practice of risk assessment.</p>

<p>8.1.3 Amongst the duties of the safety officer it is the responsibility to ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of the Code of Safe Working Practices and the company’s/operator’s occupational health and safety policies are complied with.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Occupational health and safety inspections are conducted for each accessible part of the ship in which the crew may be required to work. These must be completed at least once every three months or more frequently if there have been changes in the working conditions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Work is stopped which they reasonably believe may cause an accident and inform the master who shall be responsible for deciding when work can safety be resumed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The minutes of each safety committee meeting are accessible to all the crew.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Investigations into Health and Safety incidents on-board are carried out.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Safety Representative</h4>

<p>8.1.4 On every ship in which five or more seafarers are working the company/operator is required to make rules and arrangements for the officers and ratings to elect safety representatives.</p>

<p>8.1.5 A safety representative must be someone who has at least 2 years sea service since they were 18.</p>

<p>8.1.6 The master is required to record the election of safety representatives to a safety committee in the official log book, in the narrative section. There are rules covering the number of representatives that must be elected depending on the total crew size. In general:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if the ship carries less than 16 crew, one safety representative elected by the officers and ratings together.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the ship carries 16 or more crew; one safety representative elected by the officers and one elected by the ratings.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As far as practicable, seafarers at all levels in all departments should have effective representation.</p>

<p>8.1.7 Those who are elected as safety representatives do not have to stay in that role for the whole voyage, others can be elected to take over. You should ensure that any safety representative is briefed on their duties and responsibilities. They can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Participate in any investigations or inspections carried out by the safety officer subject to their agreement, or after notification to the master, undertake similar investigations or inspections themselves, whether or not they have been carried out by the safety officer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consult with the master and safety officer on behalf of the crew on matters affecting occupational health and safety of crew members.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Request through the safety committee an investigation by the safety officer of any such safety matter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspect any of the records required to be kept by the safety officer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Safety Committee</h4>

<p>8.1.8 Once the safety officials have been appointed or elected the master is required to appoint a Safety Committee which includes the safety officer and each safety representative. The master is also on the Safety Committee as Chairman and the creation of this committee must be recorded in the Official Log Book. The Safety Committee should meet whenever it chooses, but the Committee should meet regularly, taking into account the pattern of operation of the ship and the arrangement for manning and with sufficient frequency to ensure continuous improvement in safety.</p>

<p>8.1.9 A Safety Committee should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure that the provisions of the Code of Safe Working Practices, relevant legislation, Marine Guidance Notices and Merchant Shipping Notices are complied with to improve the standard of safety consciousness among the crew.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make representations and recommendations on behalf of the crew to the company/operator on matters relating to occupational health and safety of the crew.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure the company’s/operator’s occupational health and safety policies are observed and to make recommendations for their improvement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspect any of the records required to be kept by the safety officer and ensure that any conclusions reached on matters of safety are followed up.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>8.1.10 There is a legal duty on the company to help the Safety Committee to work and the company must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Provide access to any necessary safety information, documents, Merchant Shipping Notices, Marine Guidance Notices and relevant Regulations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inform the safety officer, safety representatives and safety committee of any hazards on-board the ship known to them, which may endanger the ship or her crew.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Permit occupational health and safety inspections of any accessible part of the ship where crew members may be required to work.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span> Master’s Responsibility</h3>

<p>It is very important that the master takes a close interest in the work of the safety officials, checking that the safety officer is fulfilling their responsibilities effectively, while giving support and encouragement. The master is the best person to ensure that the safety committee works successfully by encouraging all crew members to participate in the ship’s safety culture.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span> Risk Assessments</h3>

<p>8.3.1 Masters should ensure that a risk assessment has been carried out to cover all work activities on-board where there is a realistic risk of harm to personnel. Refer to the Code of Safe Working Practices Chapter 1.</p>

<p>8.3.2 The aim of risk assessments is to minimise accidents and ill health on-board. Masters should ensure that not only are risk assessments prepared and kept under review, but work activities are carried out in accordance with the risk assessments.</p>

<p>8.3.3 Many accidents and fatalities could have been prevented if crew members had followed the precautions highlighted in a risk assessment.</p>

<p>An example completed risk assessment is given in Annex 1.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Medical Stores Requirements</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.1 </span> Medical Stores</h3>

<p>A full list of medical stores that must be carried is contained in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/msn-1905-amendment-1-application-of-the-ships-medical-stores-regulations">MSN 1905 (M+F)</a> As Amended.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.2 </span> Person in Charge of Medical Care On-Board Ship</h3>

<p>Any person designated to take charge of medical care on-board ship, must have successfully completed an approved Medical Care training programme meeting the standards laid down in STCW Code A-VI/4-2 within the preceding five years. It is a requirement for the master to have also completed this training. They can be the person responsible but if they delegate then the person delegated the duty must also be trained. There should be a record of this delegation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.3 </span> Shipowner’s Liability and Financial Security</h3>

<p>Financial security must be in place to meet the shipowner’s liabilities in relation to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Compensation for occupational illness, injury or death of seafarers on the ship.</li>
  <li>Documentary evidence of this financial security must be held on-board.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Surveys and Audits</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.1 </span> Surveys</h3>

<p>11.1.1 The surveys required are laid down in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.redensigngroup.org/media/1093/reg-yacht-code-january-2019-edition-common-annexes.pdf" rel="external">REG Code – Common Annexes, Annex N</a>.</p>

<p>11.1.2 Most statutory surveys (Load Line, Safety Construction, MARPOL, Safety Radio etc) are conducted under the Harmonised System of Survey and Certification, detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/msn-1751-harmonised-system-of-survey-and-certification-hssc">MSN 1751 (M+F)</a> and should be arranged in plenty of time. Annual and periodical/intermediate surveys must be completed within the 6-month window occurring three months before and after the ‘anniversary date’ of the certificate. The ‘anniversary date’ is the day and month of the expiry date of the full-term certificate. A certificate that has not been validated by an annual or a periodical survey within the ‘window’ becomes invalid and the ship risks detention. The vessel’s insurance may become invalid and if registered commercially, the vessel cannot go to sea. If a survey window has been missed, the certificate must be renewed. To do this, the vessel may require a survey to the full scope of a renewal survey.</p>

<p>Renewal surveys must be carried out in the three-month window prior to the expiry of the certificate. It is the master’s responsibility to arrange surveys and maintain validity of certification.</p>

<p>11.1.3 For a renewal Large Yacht Code survey (full 5 years), the following should be undertaken in addition to the annual survey requirements: -</p>

<ol>
  <li>A lightship check witnessed by MCA surveyor.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Static load test of any lifting appliances.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Maker’s overhaul of rescue boat davit and winch, followed by</li>
</ol>

<p>MCA surveyor witnessing 110% operational test.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Radio and nav aids independent survey report.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Retreatment of soft furnishings for fire retardancy, if applicable (every 18 months maximum).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For sailing yachts, a rig report.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.2 </span> Audits</h3>

<p>11.2.1 ISM Safety Management Certificate (SMC), ISSC and MLC audits should be carried out during the same visit. This should be planned well in advance to ensure that there will be sufficient time available to carry out the audits.</p>

<h4>Interim Audits</h4>

<p>11.2.2 Required at delivery of new yachts over 500GT or where existing yachts change their ISM management company. The management company should contact  to arrange this audit.</p>

<h4>Initial Audits</h4>

<p>11.2.3 Before expiry of the Interim certificate the yacht should be subject to an initial audit. There should be sufficient time (at least 3 months) elapsed since the interim audit to enable the crew to build up evidence to support the full implementation of the Safety Management System on-board.</p>

<h4>Intermediate Audits</h4>

<p>11.2.4 A 12 month ‘window’ exists (between the 2nd and 3rd anniversary dates of the certificate) in which to arrange intermediate audits.</p>

<h4>Renewal Audits</h4>

<p>11.2.5 To be completed in the three months prior to the expiry of the Safety Management Certificate. Arrange these early to ensure the certificate does not expire – this would almost certainly result in a major non-conformity and detention of the yacht.</p>

<p>11.2.6 For ISSC audits the Ship Security Plan should be re-submitted three months before the renewal audit for re-approval.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.3 </span> MLC 2006 Inspections</h3>

<p>(See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/msn-1848-m-amendment-3-mlc-survey-and-certification-of-uk-ships">MSN 1848 (M)</a> As Amended)</p>

<p>11.3.1 The ILO Maritime Labour Convention 2006 requires the MCA to inspect seafarer’s working and living conditions within specified time intervals. The requirements apply to United Kingdom registered sea-going vessels involved in commercial activities.</p>

<p>11.3.2 UK registered vessels will be inspected t initial SMC audit  at intervals not exceeding 3 years afterwards. This will usually be carried out during an ISM SMC or ISSC audit to minimise the inconvenience to ship-owners and masters or in conjunction with Large Yacht Code surveys for vessels under 500GT. The MCA is also required to investigate if a complaint is received or there is evidence that a ship does not conform to existing legislation in respect of seafarer’s working and living conditions.</p>

<p>11.3.3 After the inspection the surveyor will issue a Report of Inspection of Seafarers Working and Living Conditions to the master and to the Company. If any deficiencies are found these will be reported to the master for rectifying within an agreed time frame.</p>

<p>11.3.4 For yachts holding MLC certification (mandatory for &gt;500GT or voluntarily), there will be a Part I declaration by the MCA which states how we expect a ship to comply with the MLC regulations as well as national regulations we have put in place to ensure compliance. The Part II declaration is made by the Shipowner and details what actions have been taken on-board to ensure compliance with the MLC and national requirements stated in the DMLC Pt I.</p>

<p>For guidance on the completion of the DMLC II refer to the UK Chamber of Shipping guidance and to the appropriate M Notices. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/declaration-of-maritime-labour-compliance-part-ii-and-guidance">Example of declaration of maritime labour compliance part II</a>.</p>

<p>A DMLC Pt II must be reviewed and approved by the MCA.</p>

<p>11.3.4.1 For yachts under 500GT that do not voluntarily hold an MLC certificate, it is MCA policy for them to complete and submit a DMLC Pt II. It should be noted that whilst vessels under 500GT are not required to be certificated under the MLC, they are required to comply with the MLC in full.</p>

<p>11.3.5 The MLC inspection will generally cover areas such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Minimum age of seafarers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Medical certification</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span> Radio Licence</h2>

<p>A Ship Radio licence is required even if the transmitting equipment is not in constant use, or if it is used only for distress purposes.</p>

<p>The UK office of communications, Ofcom, is responsible for the effective management of the civil radio spectrum in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The regulations governing the use of maritime radio are detailed in the International Radio Regulations, set by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006. It is an offence to install or use any radio equipment on-board a UK vessel without a radio licence.</p>

<p>The Ship Radio licence allows the licensee to install and, if the relevant Maritime Radio Operators Certificate of Competence and Authority to Operate is held, use any combination of maritime radio equipment listed below on a specified vessel: -</p>

<ul>
  <li>Digital Selective Calling (DSC) equipment associated with the Global</li>
</ul>

<p>Maritime Distress &amp; Safety System (GMDSS).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>MF, HF, VHF equipment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Satellite communications equipment (Ship Earth Stations).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>RADAR. Search and Rescue Radar Transponders (SARTs).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Low powered, on-board maritime UHF communications equipment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>UHF On-board repeater stations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>121.5/123.1 MHz Aeronautical Search and Rescue equipment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>121.5/243 MHz and 406/121.5 MHz Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRBs) and Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A call sign is allocated to the vessel when first issued with a Ship Radio Licence. It uniquely identifies the vessel within the International Maritime Mobile Service. The call sign remains with the vessel for the duration of its life regardless of changes of ownership or even vessel name. However, the call sign is surrendered if the vessel ceases to be classed as a UK vessel, is destroyed or is unlicensed for a period of two or more years.</p>

<p>A Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) number uniquely identifies a vessel and is only issued to vessels fitted with Digital Selective Calling (DSC) and/or (Satellite) Ship Earth Station (SES) equipment.</p>

It is extremely important that Sea Service Testimonials are completed accurately and in full. Sea Service for seafarers on UK vessels must be verified before being accepted for revalidation, certificate upgrade, etc. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/min-543-m-sea-service-verification-on-large-yachts">MIN 543 (M)</a><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> provides information for obtaining sea service verification for seafarers on large yachts.</p>

<p>14.3 All seafarers employed on the yacht, including contractors, must receive safety familiarisation training. The Company should establish and maintain procedures for identifying any training which may be required in support of the safety management system and ensure that such training is provided for all personnel concerned.</p>

<p>14.4 The following training drills (ref. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mgn-71-muster-drill-onboard-training-decision-support-system">MGN 71 (M)</a>) are required at the specified intervals:</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span> Alcohol and Drugs</h2>

<p>15.1 Any level of alcohol or drug consumption by crew members on-board a ship has implications for the safety of the vessel, the crew and any passengers. Even small quantities of alcohol or drugs have been shown to impair judgment and increase the risk of accidents.</p>

<p>15.2 It is an offence for a professional seafarer to be impaired by drink or drugs on-board ship or at any time on-board a vessel if they might be required to undertake emergency duties to protect the safety of passengers.</p>

<p>15.3 The alcohol limits for Seafarers on all UK flagged ships and any ship operating in UK waters are:</p>
