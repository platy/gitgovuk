<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Who this guide is for</h2>

<p>This user guide is for learning providers and local authorities who are registered to use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://lrs.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">learning records service (<abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr>) portal</a>.</p>

<p>Learning providers include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>schools</li>
  <li>academies</li>
  <li>further education (FE) providers</li>
  <li>higher education (HE) providers</li>
  <li>offender learning providers (prisons)</li>
</ul>

<p>Learning providers and local authorities are sometimes referred to as learner registration bodies (LRBs) within <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>What you can do with <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr>
</h2>

<p>The learning records service (<abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr>) allows you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>collect unique learner numbers (<abbr title="unique learner numbers">ULNs</abbr>) on behalf of learners aged 14 and above - the <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> is a 10-digit reference number linked to a learner’s personal learning record (<abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr>)</li>
  <li>access a learner’s <abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr> to support education/career information, advice and guidance</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Keeping learner data safe</h2>

<p>As an <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr> user your obligations are set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://lrs.education.gov.uk/Public/UserAgreement" rel="external"><abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr> user agreement</a>, while the <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr> requirements for data governance are found in the <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr> organisation agreement.</p>

<p>When you share personal information about learners with the <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr> service desk you should contact us through the portal by raising a <a class="govuk-link" href="#data-challenges">data challenge</a>.</p>

<p>If you need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lrs-help-and-support/lrs-help-and-support">contact us</a> by email, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lrs-help-and-support/data-encryption-and-passphrase-guidance">encrypt and password protect</a> the data</li>
  <li>contact the <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr> service desk by phone with the password details</li>
</ul>

<p>Where users do not follow this process, we’ll need to contact their organisation’s super user. Continued security concerns could lead to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>user and organisation permissions being disabled</li>
  <li>escalation to your data protection officer (DPO) and senior management</li>
  <li>reporting the organisation to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Common security breaches</h3>

<p>These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sharing account details or allowing someone else to use your account - each user must have their own user account, and you should remove accounts that are no longer needed</li>
  <li>sending a learner’s <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> and any of the 5 demographics (‘Given name’, ‘Family name’, ‘Date of birth’, ‘Gender’ or ‘Postcode’) in an unencrypted email</li>
  <li>sending more than one of the 5 demographics in an unencrypted email (‘given name’ and ‘family name’ are deemed one demographic in this instance)</li>
  <li>sending an encrypted file containing learner data, where the password has been sent in the same email</li>
  <li>sending your username and password in an email</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Standard user responsibilities</h3>

<p>You must not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>share your login details (username and password)</li>
  <li>share your email address with another user</li>
  <li>use the account for purposes other than those for which it was created</li>
  <li>leave your workstation unlocked and unattended when accessing personal data or allow unauthorised people to see your screen</li>
  <li>use, copy, send or share data, except where the Education and Skills Funding Agency gives you permission, or you’re otherwise permitted to do so by law</li>
  <li>send any personal learner data by email unless it’s encrypted and password protected using a separate method for sending the password</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Logging in</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Logging in for the first time</h3>

<p>You’ll receive an email to the unique email address you provided when your account was created. Follow the link in the email to log in for the first time.</p>

<p>If the link has expired, contact your super user to re-send the registration email. If you’re the only super user in your organisation, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lrs-help-and-support/lrs-help-and-support">contact the service desk</a>.</p>

<p>When you follow the link, you’ll see the ‘Change password’ screen. Enter your username and create a password that meets the requirements shown on screen.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Changing your email address</h3>

<p>Once you’ve logged in, from the ‘My account’ page, you can change your email by selecting ‘Edit and verify email’.</p>

<p>Enter your new email address in both the ‘Email’ and ‘Confirm email’ fields, then select ‘Save changes’.</p>

<p>The email address you use must be unique and accessible only by you. Generic email addresses, for example contact@yourorganisation.co.uk are not allowed.</p>

<p>You’ll receive an email with a link to validate your email address. Once you follow the link to validate your email address, you’ll be asked to accept the terms of the user agreement.</p>

<p>Once you’ve done this, you’ll be taken to the ‘Learner Management’ homepage.</p>

<p>If the link in your email has expired, you’ll need to log in again and re-enter your email to receive a new link.</p>

<p>If another account holder has already used this email address, you’ll see an error message. You’ll need to log in again then enter a different email to receive a new link.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Using the portal as a super user</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Super user responsibilities</h3>

<p>Super users are the first contact point for your user community to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>create user accounts – the service desk only creates accounts in specific circumstances, for example, where all super users have left the organisation</li>
  <li>update a user’s personal details and permissions</li>
  <li>resolve access problems, including suspending and reinstating user accounts</li>
  <li>delete user accounts</li>
  <li>monitor user activity to ensure the data held on the <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr> is used appropriately</li>
</ul>

<p>Super users are responsible for managing other <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr> users in their organisation, including setting up additional super users. We strongly recommend having at least 3 super users but no more than 5.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Creating a new user or super user account</h3>

<h4>Before you create a new account</h4>

<p>When you create other user accounts check:</p>

<ul>
  <li>who authorised the request – it’s your responsibility to ensure that applications follow your internal process for access to confidential student records, which may involve criminal record checks – these are not carried out by <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>what level of permission the user needs - we recommend you only give users access to the areas of <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr> that they need</li>
  <li>what details are recorded for each user – all user accounts require a given name, family name and unique email address, and we also recommend adding a phone number</li>
  <li>whether users know their responsibilities when using the <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr> – make sure each new user has read and understood the <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr> user agreement as your organisation’s access to the portal may be suspended if users break the conditions</li>
  <li>how users will be trained – for example, any users uploading batch files to the portal should know how to create and validate batch files, and how to process any exceptions returned</li>
</ul>

<h4>Creating an additional user</h4>

<ol>
  <li>You’ll need to search for a user to check whether they already exist in the <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Choose ‘User Management’ from the left-hand menu, then ‘Find user’.</li>
  <li>Fill in the ‘Given Name’ and ‘Family Name’ fields and select a value from the ‘Status’ drop down, then select the ‘Search’ button.</li>
  <li>You’ll see the results screen with the message ‘No users match the selected criteria’.</li>
  <li>Select the ‘Create user’ button.</li>
  <li>When prompted, enter the new user’s given name, family name and a unique email address.</li>
  <li>Select the tick box next to the ‘User Role’ you want to assign – see <a class="govuk-link" href="#appendix-a">appendix A</a> for a list of user role descriptions.</li>
  <li>You’ll need to enter some information into the ‘Verification Provided’ box – this could be a staff ID or a school email address.</li>
  <li>Select ‘Create User’ and the <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr> automatically produces a user account name in the format ‘firstname.surname’.</li>
  <li>The user will get an email that tells them their username, with instructions and a link to complete their registration and create a password.</li>
  <li>If the link has expired, the user will need to contact their super user to resend the registration email. This is done by selecting the ‘Resend Welcome Email’ button on the ‘View user’ page.</li>
</ol>

<h4>User housekeeping</h4>

<p>Audit your users annually to check who’s using the <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr> and whether they hold the right level of access. You can find your organisation’s users on the portal.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select ‘User Management’.</li>
  <li>Leave the ‘Find user’ field blank.</li>
  <li>Select a status from ‘Active’, ‘Inactive’, ‘Deleted’ or ‘Suspended’.</li>
  <li>Tick the ‘Select all’ box from the ‘Select role(s)’ list and then select ‘Search’.</li>
</ol>

<p>You’ll see a full list of users to review including allocated user roles. As a super user, you must decide how to administer your user community and set up all other users.</p>

<p>Super users and the service desk cannot reset passwords. Users must reset their own passwords using the ‘I have forgotten my password’ link on the login page.</p>

<h4>Contract staff and third-party organisation accounts</h4>

<p>Temporary staff must undergo the same checks that protect confidentiality. They should have access as users belonging to your organisation, so that all transactions conducted for your organisation are audited as belonging to your organisation.</p>

<p>If you’re an agency working for several different organisations, you’ll need separate user accounts for each organisation you work for.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Updating or editing a user account</h3>

<p>To update the details associated with a user account, follow the steps below.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the ‘Find user’ link under ‘User Management’ from the left-hand menu.</li>
  <li>Search by username (if you know it) or given and family name.</li>
  <li>Check the status is set to ‘Active’.</li>
  <li>Use the ‘Search’ button.</li>
  <li>On the results screen select the ‘View user’ link next to the user you want to update.</li>
  <li>On the next screen, you can select ‘Edit user’ button to update the user.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can update:</p>

<ul>
  <li>title, given name and family name</li>
  <li>telephone landline and mobile numbers</li>
  <li>email address - by selecting the ‘Edit and verify email’ button, an email will be sent to the user to verify their email</li>
  <li>verification provided – confirmation of your internal authorisation procedure</li>
  <li>staff ID or Your reference – optional</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also use this screen to update the roles allowed for your own super user account.</p>

<p>Never reassign user accounts. Instead, delete the account and create a new one for the new member of staff.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Deleting a user account</h3>

<p>Remove a user account as soon as the user leaves your organisation or no longer needs <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr> access. If an account is left active, that person could still access the portal and potentially misuse it.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the ‘Find user’ link under ‘User Management’ from the left-hand menu.</li>
  <li>Search by username (if you know it) or given and family name.</li>
  <li>Check the status is set to ‘Active’.</li>
  <li>Use the ‘Search’ button.</li>
  <li>Select the ‘View User’ link next to the user you need to delete.</li>
  <li>Select ‘Delete User’.</li>
  <li>Select ‘Confirm delete’.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span>Dealing with user access problems</h3>

<h4>Resetting passwords</h4>

<p>If a user forgets their password they can follow the ‘I have forgotten my password’ link on the login page to reactivate their account and reset their password.</p>

<h4>Re-activating a locked or suspended user account</h4>

<p>If a user makes more than 5 consecutive unsuccessful attempts to log in, we’ll send an email to their verified email to tell them their account is locked. They can use the reset process to login.</p>

<p>If an account is suspended, the super user is responsible for reactivating the user’s account, verifying the user’s identify first if necessary.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the ‘User Management’ tab.</li>
  <li>Search by username (if you know it) or given and family name.</li>
  <li>Check the status is set to ‘Suspended’.</li>
  <li>Change the status to ‘Active’ to reinstate the account.</li>

<span class="number">6. </span>Creating and managing unique learner numbers (<abbr title="unique learner numbers">ULNs</abbr>)</h2>

<p>Once your organisation has registered with the <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr>, you need to decide the best approach for managing your unique learner numbers (<abbr title="unique learner numbers">ULNs</abbr>).</p>

<p>You can manage <abbr title="unique learner numbers">ULNs</abbr> by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#uln-manual">manually creating <abbr title="unique learner numbers">ULNs</abbr></a> through the <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr> portal - if you have a group of up to 50 learners, this is the quickest way to create them</li>
  <li>using the <a class="govuk-link" href="#uln-batch-files">batch process</a> to prepare and submit batch files containing multiple learner details - this method is for more than 50 learners and you’ll be able to download the output file back into your system</li>
  <li>using <a class="govuk-link" href="#uln-web-services">web services</a> to link your management information system (<abbr title="management information system">MIS</abbr>) to the learner register, automatically updating the <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr> - the <abbr title="management information system">MIS</abbr> may assist in the resolution of the exceptions</li>
</ul>

<p>Using web services is the preferred method, but it relies on your own <abbr title="management information system">MIS</abbr> supplier providing the interface with the <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr>. You can get more information about how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lrs-web-services-for-management-information-system-developers">register as a developer</a>.</p>

<p>You can download the web service certificate from the portal by selecting the ‘Certificate management’ link from the left-hand menu. When you download it, you’ll get an email to your verified email address with the password for the certificate.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>1. Managing and creating <abbr title="unique learner numbers">ULNs</abbr> using the portal (manual)</h3>

<h4>Searching for <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> using personal details</h4>

<p>Before registering a new <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> you need to check that the learner is not already registered.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Under the ‘Learner Management’ section, select ‘Find a learner by personal details’.</li>
  <li>Enter the ‘Given name’ and ‘Family name’ of the learner whose <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> you’re looking for</li>
  <li>Enter the ‘Date of birth’.</li>
  <li>Select the ‘Gender’ from the drop-down menu.</li>
  <li>Enter the last known ‘Postcode’. As a last resort use ZZ99 9ZZ – if there’s no possibility of obtaining a postcode from the learner.</li>
  <li>Enter the Optional fields.</li>
  <li>Select ‘Search.’</li>
</ol>

<p>When searching, to help increase the chances of finding a <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> where one exists, you should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>preferred given name</li>
  <li>middle names</li>
  <li>email address</li>
  <li>unique pupil number (<abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr>)</li>
  <li>universal candidate identifier (<abbr title="universal candidate identifier">UCI</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are more tips on searching for <abbr title="unique learner numbers">ULNs</abbr> in <a class="govuk-link" href="#appendix-b">appendix B</a>.</p>

<p>The results will be ‘Match’, ‘No Match’, ‘Possible match’ or ‘Too many matches’.</p>

<p>Where the result is a ‘Match’, ‘Possible Match’ or ‘Too many matches’, and there are differences in the information entered in the search compared to the record(s) returned, those fields will be underlined in red. The ‘Info on Data Match’ column shows where the fields did not match exactly.</p>

<p>Where the ‘Has linked Record(s)’ column says ‘Yes’, this means there’s a linked record (which may have different details to the Master that’s displayed). The differences in the data will not be highlighted.</p>

<h5>Result type is ‘Match’</h5>

<p>Where the result type is a ‘Match’, check the record by viewing the expanded details section (selecting +) next to the record.</p>

<p>You can also view the personal learning record (<abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr>) to confirm whether the record belongs to your learner. Use ‘Select learner’ then the ‘View <abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr>’ button.</p>

<p>If the record returned is your learner, use ‘Select Learner’ and ‘Continue’. Where there are no red underlines, the ‘View learner profile’ page is opened.</p>

<h6>If there are red underlines</h6>

<p>When you press ‘Select Learner’ then ‘Continue’, you’ll see the ‘Compare and update profile’ page with the <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr>.</p>

<p>On this page you can update the learner profile with the details entered in the search if this is the most up-to-date information for the learner.</p>

<p>Fields that are different are automatically ticked. If you leave the tick in place and select ‘Save changes’ the changes are saved and the ‘Learner profile’ page is displayed with the updated information. If you remove the tick, then even if ‘Save changes’ is selected, the changes will not be saved.</p>

<p>Selecting ‘Do not save changes’ will open the learner profile.</p>

<p>Where the result is a ‘Match’, and the record returned is not your learner, select ‘If your learner is not displayed above, click on this option and press continue’. Then select ‘Continue’.</p>

<p>You will see a warning message. If your learner genuinely has the same information, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lrs-help-and-support/lrs-help-and-support">contact the service desk</a> to register the learner.</p>

<h5>Result type is ‘Possible Match’</h5>

<p>Where the result type is a ‘Possible Match’, this may be because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the learner already has a <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the learner has a sibling, parent or other relative with an existing <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr>
</li>
  <li>there’s another learner in the system with similar demographics (for example, the same postcode)</li>
</ul>

<p>Check the demographics using the expanded details section (select +) next to the records, to see if any do not match. Confirm with the learner whether they have any previous postcodes/names that match those displayed in the search results.</p>

<p>You can also view the personal learning record (<abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr>) to confirm whether the record belongs to your learner. Use ‘Select learner’ then the ‘View <abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr>’ button.</p>

<p>If your learner exists in the results displayed, press ‘Select learner’ and ‘Continue’. Where there are no red underlines, the learner profile is opened. Where a column is underlined with a red line, the ‘Compare and update’ page is displayed.</p>

<p>If your learner is not displayed in the results, select ‘If your learner is not displayed above, click on this option and press continue’, and press ‘Continue’.</p>

<p>You can either <a class="govuk-link" href="#register-learner">register the learner</a> to obtain a <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> or return to the search results.</p>

<h5>Result type is ‘Too many matches’</h5>

<p>If the result type is ‘too many matches’, this is usually because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the learner has a common name</li>
  <li>the date of birth is 1 January</li>
  <li>you used a generic postcode to search</li>
</ul>

<p>For security purposes, the top 10 closest records will be displayed.</p>

<p>Ensure the search details are correct. If your learner exists in the results displayed, choose ‘Select learner’ and press ‘Continue’. Where there are no red underlines, the learner profile is opened. Where there are red underlines the ‘Compare and update’ page is displayed.</p>

<p>Where the result is ‘Too many matches’, and the record returned is not your learner, select ‘If your learner is not displayed above, click on this option and press continue’ and press ‘Continue’.</p>

<p>If your learner genuinely has the same information, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lrs-help-and-support/lrs-help-and-support">contact the service desk</a> to register the learner.</p>

<h5>Result type is ‘No Match/Register a learner for a new <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr>’</h5>

<p>Where the result type was ‘No match’, select the ‘Register this learner’ button.</p>

<p>Where the result type was ‘Possible match’ and you confirmed your learner was not displayed, ‘Yes’ to register the learner.</p>

<p>Enter as many details as you can to help identity this learner in future searches. Complete all mandatory fields including the ‘Verification Type’ field. Generally a learner’s identity should be verified at enrolment. Although a lack of proof of identity should not prevent enrolment. When a learner’s identity cannot be verified it must be verified later <a class="govuk-link" href="#appendix-d">(appendix D)</a>.</p>

<h4>Privacy notice</h4>

<p>Your organisation is responsible for sharing the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lrs-privacy-notices">privacy notice</a> with your learners. We recommend you do this as part of your enrolment process. Learners cannot opt out of sharing their <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> and <abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr>.</p>

<p>When a <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> is created, the corresponding option must be entered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no (the learner has not seen the privacy notice but a <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> is required for the learner for emergency purposes only) - organisations will not be able to view the learner’s <abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr>
</li>
  <li>yes (the learner has viewed the privacy notice and has allowed other organisations to view their data) - any qualifications deemed as sensitive will automatically be hidden even if the learner has viewed the privacy notice</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>If your organisation has shared the privacy notice set the flag to ‘yes’.</li>
  <li>Complete optional fields where the information is available (if not already provided in the search).</li>
  <li>Enter ‘Preferred Given Name’.</li>
  <li>Enter ‘Middle Name(s)’.</li>
  <li>Enter email address.</li>
  <li>Add the unique pupil number (<abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr>) – only for learners aged under 16.</li>
  <li>Add the universal candidate identifier (<abbr title="universal candidate identifier">UCI</abbr>) – optional.</li>
  <li>Select ‘Register learner’.</li>
</ol>

<p>You now have a <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> for the learner – make a note of the <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> to add to your MI database and tell the learner.</p>

<p>Select ‘View learner profile’ to view the learner’s <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> record or select ‘Register another learner’ to create a new <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> for another learner.</p>

<h4>Viewing, adding or updating a learner’s <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> details</h4>

<p>On the ‘Welcome’ page or on the ‘Find a Learner’ page, select ‘Find a learner by <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr>’. Enter the learner’s <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr>, ‘Given Name’ and ‘Family Name’ and select ‘Search’.</p>

<p>The ‘View Learner Profile’ screen shows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all the personal and contact details of the learner</li>
  <li>dates and times of when the record was created and last amended</li>
  <li>any linked <abbr title="unique learner numbers">ULNs</abbr> (other <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> records that were merged to make this <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> the master <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can check the learner’s details and add further details or update information.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select ‘Edit details’ at the bottom of the screen.</li>
  <li>Update the fields then select ‘Save changes’ to update the learner’s <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr>.</li>
</ol>

<p>There’s tips for updating a learner’s details in <a class="govuk-link" href="#appendix-c">appendix C</a>.</p>

<h5>Dealing with error messages when updating a learner profile</h5>

<p>To avoid duplicate records, where a learner profile is updated and the update would result in a match to an existing record, you’ll see the error message ‘Learner update not allowed’. The error will also show on both the ‘Learner profile’ page when pressing ‘Edit details’, and when trying to ‘Save’ on the ‘Compare and update’ page.</p>

<p>This error shows when there’s already a <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> in the system with the exact same demographics as those you’ve entered.</p>

<p>If they are separate learners with the same details, you should contact the <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr> service desk.</p>

<p>If there’s no other record in the system with the same demographics, <a class="govuk-link" href="#data-challenges">raise a data challenge</a> on the <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> with the details you’re trying to update.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>2. Managing and creating <abbr title="unique learner numbers">ULNs</abbr> using batch files</h3>

<p>Batch files are CSV (comma separated values) or XML format files containing learner data which, once submitted, can confirm a <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr>, register a learner for a new <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> or find an existing <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr>.</p>

<p>For some outcomes that require further investigation, for example a possible match, an ‘exception’ is created, which you can view and process from the portal.</p>

<p>All exceptions need to be processed within 90 days of the batch file being uploaded.
You can use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/lrs-batch-toolkit-for-aos-and-lrbs">batch file toolkits</a> to help you prepare and process a batch file.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>3. Managing and creating <abbr title="unique learner numbers">ULNs</abbr> using web services</h3>

<p>You can develop your own system or use a solution from a third-party developer to link your management information system (<abbr title="management information system">MIS</abbr>) with the <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr>. Third-party systems can allow the user to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>search for learners by <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr>
</li>
  <li>search for learners by demographics</li>
  <li>register a new <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> for a learner</li>
  <li>update an existing learner’s details</li>
  <li>submit a batch file</li>
  <li>view the output file for a batch file</li>
  <li>view a learner’s personal learning record</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Working with the personal learning record (<abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr>)</h2>

<p>The personal learning record (<abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr>) is an online record of qualifications and achievements for learners aged 14 and above. This section explains how to view a learner’s <abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr> and why there are times when you won’t be able to view the record.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Information displayed on the <abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Data for the <abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr> comes from three sources:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the national pupil database (<abbr title="national pupil database">NPD</abbr>) for key stage 4 and 5 qualifications</li>
  <li>periodic individualised learner record (<abbr title="individualised learner record">ILR</abbr>) returns, if a valid <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> and UK provider reference number (<abbr title="UK provider reference number">UKPRN</abbr>) are included within the <abbr title="individualised learner record">ILR</abbr> and they match the learner’s details</li>
  <li>awarding organisations, which can upload both general and vocational qualifications regulated by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofqual">Ofqual</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.qiw.wales/" rel="external">Qualifications in Wales (QiW)</a> - awarding organisations started to upload accredited qualification/unit data from 2013</li>
</ul>

<h4>Qualification has no grade</h4>

<p><abbr title="individualised learner record">ILR</abbr> data does not always require a grade to be added. For some qualifications, a grade is not required. This can occur for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there was no exam</li>
  <li>there was no grading structure for the qualification</li>
  <li>the qualification had not yet been achieved (current qualification)</li>
  <li>the learner withdrew from the course</li>
  <li>not all aims were completed for the qualification to be awarded</li>
  <li>the qualification was not achieved when the <abbr title="individualised learner record">ILR</abbr> was returned</li>
</ul>

<p>In these circumstances, you can raise this as a <a class="govuk-link" href="#data-challenges">data challenge</a> to request that the details are added, but this may not always be successful (for example, where the training provider no longer exists). You should always ask the learner for a copy of their qualification certificate.</p>

<h4>Qualification has no date</h4>

<p>Qualifications, depending on the source of the data, can show different information.
Awarding organisation (<abbr title="awarding organisation">AO</abbr>) source data, provided by the AOs (exam boards) themselves, will sometimes have a start date and always have an achieved date. All qualifications with the source of <abbr title="awarding organisation">AO</abbr> will be final.</p>

<p><abbr title="individualised learner record">ILR</abbr> source data, which is provided by the training providers, will usually have a start date, but not always an end date. If there’s no end date, it could be because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the learner is still achieving this qualification</li>
  <li>the learner has withdrawn from the course</li>
  <li>the qualification was not completed when the <abbr title="individualised learner record">ILR</abbr> was returned</li>
</ul>

<p>If no date is provided, we cannot update this information unless a <a class="govuk-link" href="#data-challenges">data challenge</a> is raised by the organisation that originally submitted the data (applies to <abbr title="individualised learner record">ILR</abbr> data only).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>Viewing the <abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Users given the ‘Learner Record’ role have access to a learner’s <abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr>, if the learner has been shown the privacy notice.</p>

<p>To view a learner’s <abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr>, you need to search using the <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> or by personal details.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select ‘Learner Management’ then ‘Find a learner’.</li>
  <li>Enter the learner’s <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr>, given name and family name.</li>
  <li>Select the ‘Search’ button:</li>
  <li>If there’s no exact match you’ll see the ‘Find Learner’s Results’ screen.</li>
  <li>If there’s an exact match, you’ll see the ‘View Learner Profile’ screen.</li>
  <li>Select the ‘View Personal Learning Record’ link to view the learner’s <abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Each record shows up to eight fields of data (not all the fields are populated).</li>
  <li>You can sort columns using the down arrow, either in ascending (first select) or descending (second select) order. If several pages are returned, all the records will be sorted and redisplayed.</li>
  <li>You can drill down to view more information about a particular subject or qualification by selecting the link</li>
  <li>You can also identify qualifications/units under investigation using the ‘data challenge’ process. A ‘View details’ link will become available, which will redirect you to the ‘View enquiries’ screen so you can see the status.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Explanation of <abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr> data fields</h4>

<p>The following fields are visible on the <abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>subject – displays the title of each record and includes a link to view qualification details</li>
  <li>level – level of the award from entry level – level 8 (or could be blank)</li>
  <li>grade – generally showing the grade of the award or ‘Pass’ or blank</li>
  <li>credit – displaying the amount of credit achieved for the award</li>
  <li>source – will be national pupil database (<abbr title="national pupil database">NPD</abbr>), individualised learner record (<abbr title="individualised learner record">ILR</abbr>) awarding organisation (<abbr title="awarding organisation">AO</abbr>)</li>
  <li>start date – if applicable</li>
  <li>end date – if applicable</li>
  <li>award date – date of the award or achievement</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span>Privacy notice</h3>

<p>You must show every learner the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lrs-privacy-notices">privacy notice</a> because it explains how the learner’s data may be shared with different organisations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span>Creating a <abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr> report</h3>

<p>You can download a <abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr> report for individual learners using the ‘Reports’ tab on the <abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr> screen.</p>

<ol>
  <li>You’ll see a screen with all qualifications and events listed in date order, with tick boxes that are checked by default.</li>
  <li>Untick any of the records that you do not want to include.</li>
  <li>Select ‘View my report’.</li>
  <li>The report is a PDF, which you can either save or open.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Reporting a problem (data challenges)</h2>

<p>There are two types of data challenge:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> data challenges - raised to highlight a problem with a unique learner number, for example shared <abbr title="unique learner numbers">ULNs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr> data challenges – raised on a qualification (learning event) to highlight a problem with the qualification itself</li>
</ul>

<p>You should not raise a data challenge to highlight a missing qualification. Contact the awarding organisation directly instead.</p>

<p>The data challenge process is only for instances where your organisation cannot resolve the issue and includes issues raised by the learner. Your organisation can update a learner’s details to correct:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wrong name</li>
  <li>wrong address</li>
  <li>opting out settings</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>When reporting a data challenge you’ll receive a reference number, which contains the learner’s ULN. To comply with the LRS security policy, do not send any other learner details in an email containing this reference number.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span>Reporting a <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> problem (<abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> data challenge)</h3>

<ol>
  <li>In the learner’s profile, select the ‘Report a Problem’ button.</li>
  <li>Select the type of data issue from the list, then ‘Next’.</li>
  <li>Explain what need to change in the ‘Additional comments’ field.</li>
  <li>Complete your name, email address and telephone number.</li>
  <li>Select the ‘Confirm create’ button to submit your request.</li>
  <li>Make a note of the enquiry reference number.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr> service desk does not have enough information they’ll need to contact you for further information, which will delay the issue being resolved.</p>

<h4>Reporting that a <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> has been incorrectly identified</h4>

<p>This can occur when there’s a duplicate <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr>, for example a learner has been given a second, fictitious or fraudulent <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr>.</p>

<p>When reporting this problem, you should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>both <abbr title="unique learner numbers">ULNs</abbr> that you suspect the learner has</li>
  <li>which <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> is the master and which <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> is the duplicate</li>
  <li>a reason for the merge request, if data on the <abbr title="unique learner numbers">ULNs</abbr> is significantly different – for example if the <abbr title="unique learner numbers">ULNs</abbr> have different postcodes you should confirm that the learner has lived at both addresses</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reporting that a <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> has been incorrectly merged</h4>

<p>When reporting this problem, you should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>both <abbr title="unique learner numbers">ULNs</abbr> that need to be de-merged</li>
  <li>the reason for this action</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reporting a different <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> problem</h4>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>two people sharing the same <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr>
</li>
  <li>deceased learner</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> incorrect as details have changed (learner is therefore using another learner’s <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>When reporting any other <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> problem, you should give as much information as you can to explain the issue.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span>Reporting a <abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr> problem (learning event data challenge)</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Once you’re in the learner’s profile, select the ‘View Personal Learning Record’ tab.</li>
  <li>Select the ‘Report a Problem’ button.</li>
  <li>Select the ‘Type of data issue’ from the list of options then ‘Next’.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Reporting that information on a qualification is wrong</h4>

<p>This might be because the grade, end date, or award date has been recorded incorrectly.</p>

<p>Do not raise a data challenge against a qualification that has been uploaded as part of your current individualised learner record (<abbr title="individualised learner record">ILR</abbr>) return, updating your next full <abbr title="individualised learner record">ILR</abbr> return will update the record.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the radio button next to the qualification that has incorrect details, then select ‘Next’.</li>
  <li>In the ‘Proposed’ column, edit any incorrect details then select ‘Next’.</li>
  <li>Explain why you believe the details are incorrect and the reason why, if known.
Complete your name, email address and telephone number.</li>
  <li>Finally, select ‘Finish’ to submit your request.</li>
  <li>Make a note of the enquiry reference number.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Reporting that a qualification does not belong to a learner</h4>

<p>The learner may be disputing ever starting the qualification, or the <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> was previously shared and the qualification needs to be transferred.</p>

<p>Before you follow the steps below to raise this data challenge:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check that one qualification is not a participation record</li>
  <li>consider if the <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> is being shared by 2 learners – if so, raise a <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> data challenge instead</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Select the radio button next to the qualification that does not belong to the learner then select ‘Next’.</li>
  <li>Add any additional information to the additional comments field. If the qualification needs to be transferred to another <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr>, you must add the other <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> and learner’s name to the additional comments. For example, “This qualification was uploaded to the incorrect learner. Please transfer to the correct learner, 1234567894 – John A Smith”.</li>
  <li>Select ‘Finish’ to submit your request.</li>
  <li>Make a note of the enquiry reference number.</li>

<h4>Reporting that a qualification appears more than once</h4>

<p>This may occur because the qualification has been incorrectly uploaded more than once. You should make sure that one qualification is not a participation record before raising with the <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the checkbox next to 2 qualifications that are duplicated then select ‘Next’.</li>
  <li>Add any additional information, including the reason you believe the qualifications have been duplicated and confirm that you’ve checked whether it’s a participation record.</li>
  <li>Complete your name, email address and telephone number.</li>
  <li>Select ‘Finish’ to submit your request.</li>
  <li>Make a note of the enquiry reference number.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Appendix A – types of user</h2>

<p>It’s your responsibility to make sure users only have the level of access they need. You can use the set roles below or ‘mix and match’ the level of accessed required.</p>

<p>The following user roles are available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr> super user - responsible for managing all users within their registered organisation</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr> batch user - can submit and view the results and progress of batch jobs</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr> online user - can find, update learner records and register learners</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr> view only user - can find learner records, but not register learners or update learner records</li>
  <li>learner record - can view and print the personal learning record (<abbr title="personal learning record">PLR</abbr>) for any <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr> once a ‘Find learner’ search has been performed</li>
  <li>verify learner details (VLD) learning provider - can verify learners using learner verification</li>
</ul>

<p>You can only select the user types that you were given access to when your organisation was set up.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Appendix B – tips for searching</h2>

<p>It’s important to be sure the learner you’re looking for does not already exist in the <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr> before you create a new <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr>. Here are some tips for searching.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.1 </span>Name</h3>

<p>You can try:</p>

<ul>
  <li>swapping previous name – try searching using the person’s previous family name.</li>
  <li>swapping the ‘Given Name’ and ‘Family Name’ fields – use their middle name as their given name.</li>
  <li>searching for the person with and without a prefix/suffix on their family name or using alternative forms of prefix/suffix, for example, McDonald/MacDonald</li>
  <li>searching using their preferred or nickname as the given name</li>
  <li>checking the appropriate spelling of the person’s name and considering using phonetic spelling, for example, Czaja as Chiah</li>
  <li>copying the previous family name into the relevant field when you’re updating a family name</li>
  <li>including and excluding a hyphen if it’s a double-barrelled name</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.2 </span>Date of birth</h3>

<p>You can try:</p>

<ul>
  <li>swapping month and day around (if less than or equal to 12) or using the first of the month (01-MM-YYYY)</li>
  <li>using 1 January and the year closest to their age, if you do not know their date of birth (as a last resort)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.3 </span>Contact information</h3>

<p>You can try:</p>

<ul>
  <li>using a previous postcode for the person (or their parent’s postcode)</li>
  <li>searching using the default postcode ZZ99 9ZZ</li>
  <li>uploading a batch file with the previous postcode, if you collect the previous postcode of learners – make sure you update the postcode once you’ve obtained the <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr>
</li>
  <li>using address matching tools such as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.royalmail.com/find-a-postcode" rel="external">Royal Mail Postcode Finder</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>Appendix C – tips for updating a learner’s details</h2>

<p>You should make sure learner’s details are regularly updated by submitting batches of current learners prior to exam entry.</p>

<p>If you have <abbr title="unique learner numbers">ULNs</abbr> for learners, you can update their demographics using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/lrs-batch-toolkit-for-aos-and-lrbs">batch processing</a>. One mandatory field can be updated per file.</p>

<p>You must not use prohibited text, for example ‘prisoner’. If the learner’s name includes prohibited text, contact the <abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr> service desk. If a postcode is prohibited, for example, a prison postcode, use the learner’s last address or the default postcode ZZ99 9ZZ.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.1 </span>Contact information</h3>

<p>You should always complete the address lines with the correct postcode. If you’re in any doubt, use address matching tools such as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.royalmail.com/find-a-postcode" rel="external">Royal Mail Postcode Finder</a>.</p>

<p>If you collect the previous postcode of your learners, you could try uploading a batch file with the previous postcode. Once you’ve obtained the <abbr title="unique learner number">ULN</abbr>, update the record with the correct postcode.</p>

<p>Make sure you include an email address for the learner, and do not use the word ‘none’.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.2 </span>Names</h3>

<p>Always use the learner’s legal name and not nicknames, as these can be recorded in ‘Preferred Given Name’.</p>

<p>Include the learner’s ‘Previous Family Name’ if you know it because this can improve search results.</p>

<p>You can add any middle names to ‘Middle Other Name’, using a space between each.</p>

<p>When updating a family name, make sure you copy the previous family name into ‘Previous Family Name’.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.3 </span>Date of birth</h3>

<p>If you do not know the date of birth, as a last resort try using 1 January and the year closest to their age.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.4 </span>School age</h3>

<p>If you’re updating the ‘School at Age 16’ field, enter the proper school name but do not include the word ‘School’ or ‘College’.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.5 </span>Place of birth</h3>

<p>If you have this information, include it in ‘Place of Birth’. This should be the city/town as recorded on their birth certificate.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>Appendix D – verification type</h2>

<p>There are several verification options to select from the drop-down:</p>

<ul>
  <li>none provided</li>
  <li>relationship with school – should be used by schools</li>
  <li>passport</li>
  <li>driving licence</li>
  <li>ID card or other form of national identification</li>
  <li>National Insurance card</li>
  <li>certificate of entitlement to funding</li>
  <li>bank/credit/debit card</li>
  <li>other – if selected the verification description field needs to be completed</li>
</ul>

<p>The ‘Verification Type’ field is a controlled list, while the ‘Other Verification Description’ is a free text entry field and is only used if value ‘Other’ is selected in ‘Verification Type’.</p>

<p>The verification type value ‘relationship with school’ should be used by pre-16 schools, where the identity checking processes typically involves verifying the identity of the learner with the parents or guardians.</p>

<p>Where the ‘Other’ value is assigned to the ‘Verification Type’ field, the verification document must be issued by a trusted third party. Any documentation that does not conform to the standard verification types or ‘other’ trusted documentation should result in the learner being registered with the verification type value ‘none’.</p>

<p>Examples of trusted document types are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>photographic security pass for current place of employment</li>
  <li>armed forces service ID</li>
  <li>re-enrolment of known student (record as ‘returning student’)</li>
  <li>exam certificates</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of non-accepted verification types are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>individualised learner record (<abbr title="individualised learner record">ILR</abbr>)</li>
  <li>other ID</li>
  <li><abbr title="learning records service">LRS</abbr></li>
  <li>by school/college/learning provider</li>
</ul>
