<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Livestock Unique Identifier System (LUIS) support is part of the Rural Payments Agency (RPA). We are responsible for making sure that ear tags go through the official approval process and for approving all official sheep and goat ear tags on behalf of the Agriculture Departments in England, Scotland and Wales. Approved ear tags must meet the specifications set out in the Sheep and Goats (Records, Identification and Movement) (England) Order 2009 (and its equivalents in Scotland and Wales).</p>

<p>When an ear tag is approved for official sheep and goat identification purposes, the tag may be sold and supplied to keepers for official use. In Great Britain tag orders are then entered onto the official government computer system called the Livestock Unique Identifier System (LUIS) This system allocates the unique identification code for the tag. More information about LUIS can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sheep-and-goat-ear-tag-manufacturers-and-suppliers-code-of-practice">Sheep and goat ear tag manufacturers and suppliers code of practice</a>. The Code of Practice is there to make sure that all suppliers of official ear tags meet the same standards.</p>

<p>Publicly Available Specification (PAS) `Official identification ear tags for sheep &amp; goats – Specification’ PAS 66:2019 provides the standard all ear tags to be approved for official sheep and goat identification purposes must meet before they may be approved for sale and supply to keepers. You must carry out the tests required under PAS 66:2019 in a laboratory accredited by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) to ISO 17025<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Defra do not charge for approving sheep and goat ear tags for official identification, or for allowing you access to LUIS. We do not charge for registering you as an official ear tag supplier either. You will probably be charged for welfare tests and PAS testing. Please speak with your vet and chosen accredited ISO 17025 laboratory, for details of costs for testing.</p>

<h2>General advice</h2>

<p>Applications for approval of sheep and goat ear tags, or changes to an existing approved ear tag must be accompanied by a report from an independent laboratory which meets ISO 17025<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. The report must confirm that the ear tag fully meets PAS 66:2019.</p>

<p>Download your free copy of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000030400221&amp;_ga=2.83078292.302357664.1578410763-1765414914.1548254721" rel="external">PAS 66:2019</a> document from the British Standards Institution (BSI) website.</p>

<h2>Making an application</h2>

<p>Before any tags are submitted for laboratory testing, you must send a written request with samples to:</p>

<div class="contact contact">
    <p class="govuk-body">ETAS Section</p>

    <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-4">
      British Cattle Movement Service  
<br>Curwen Road   
<br>WORKINGTON   
<br>CA14 2DD
    </p>

    <div>
        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-4">
          Email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:bcmsETASSection@rpa.gov.uk">bcmsETASSection@rpa.gov.uk</a>
        </p>


        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-4">
          Telephone 0345 050 9876   
        </p>
    </div>


</div>

<p>For each type and size of tag the application must contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a minimum of 6 samples of each tag, printed with a number in the correct format (such as “UK0654321 00001”)</li>
  <li>an ear tag applicator for fitting the tags</li>
  <li>instructions for fitting the tags, including images showing how the tag will be placed in the animal’s ear</li>
  <li>technical drawings (including measurements)</li>
  <li>your proposed quality control procedures</li>
  <li>your proposed marketing literature including the name and type of tag</li>
  <li>certificate(s) showing each tag conforms to EID technical standards (EID tags only)</li>
  <li>an original version of the currently approved tag (for modified tags only)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Arranging the welfare assessment</h2>

<p>If the initial assessment is satisfactory, we will tell you that the Welfare Assessment can go ahead. Where a range of tags with the same fixing mechanism are submitted for approval, we will confirm whether each tag should undergo the welfare assessment. You will be responsible for all costs relating to the production of the report. After you submit the welfare test report to us, we will confirm to you in writing if the tags can be submitted for PAS 66:2019 testing.</p>

<h2>Arranging the laboratory test</h2>

<p>Once you have approval to start PAS testing, you should submit sample tags with applicators to a laboratory which meets ISO 17025, to be tested for compliance with PAS 66:2019. You must make arrangements directly with the laboratory and pay all costs to them.</p>

<p>After PAS testing is complete, we will send you a full report. You must then send a copy to:</p>

<div class="contact contact">
    <p class="govuk-body">ETAS Section</p>

    <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-4">
      British Cattle Movement Service  
<br>Curwen Road   
<br>WORKINGTON   
<br>CA14 2DD
    </p>

    <div>
        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-4">
          Email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:bcmsETASSection@rpa.gov.uk">bcmsETASSection@rpa.gov.uk</a>
        </p>


        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-4">
          Telephone 0345 050 9876   
        </p>
    </div>


</div>

<p>The report must contain the signature of the tester.</p>

<p>We will confirm within one month of receipt of the test report, if full approval is to be granted. Approval will not be granted until:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the product literature takes account of any Defra comments</li>
  <li>access to LUIS is granted</li>
  <li>you confirm in writing that you have read and will meet with the Code of Practice</li>
  <li>for plastic tags, a sample of the tag to be marketed is submitted, containing the words “PAS 66” as required by clause 6.1.2 of PAS 66:2019</li>
</ul>

<p>When all these requirements are met, we will write to you to confirm that full approval has been granted. The letter will detail all the access codes needed for inputting tag orders onto LUIS. We will also update the list of approved sheep and goat ear tags on GOV.UK relevant to you.</p>

<p>Tags which do not meet PAS 66:2019, will not be approved. Within 10 working days of receipt of the laboratory report, we will write to you to explain why approval has been refused, and to request any further information or testing that may be needed. You must submit any appeal against non-approval within one month of the written notification.</p>

<p>We reserve the right, on behalf of the Agriculture Departments, to withhold or withdraw approval, after sending you written confirmation of the reasons.</p>

<p>Sheep and goat ear tags which are marketed in a Member State of the EU may be given reciprocal approval if you can demonstrate that the ear tag meets equivalent standards to those applied in the UK. In these cases, you must provide documentary evidence that the ear tags have been tested to the equivalent of PAS 66:2019.</p>
