<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Industry Personnel Security Assurance (IPSA), previously known as List V, has been in
development by the MOD for the last 18 months. It is an assurance framework for industry
partners that sponsor and manage individuals that hold national security vetting.</p>

<p>Based on the seven strands of personnel security developed by CPNI, it introduces an
end to end process of personnel security for industry through an aftercare lens. This ensures that relevant information is flagged to the vetting authority (UKSV) so that decisions can be made on an individual’s continued access to classified material. Furthermore, it will ensure that individuals holding a clearance are actively monitored by their employers and are exposed to a regular security education and awareness programme.</p>

<p>IPSA will be managed by the Industry Security Assurance Centre (ISAC), a Government
Security Centre, on behalf of the MOD. The ISAC is hosted in Defence Equipment and
Support (DE&amp;S).</p>

<h2>Issue</h2>

<p>The policy supporting IPSA<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> has now been adopted as part of the Security Policy
Framework/Government Standard 007 – Security (GovS007) and all organisations
supporting Defence-related contracts that hold UKSV sponsorship accounts will be expected to undertake the assurance process. Due to the number of organisations with a Facility Security Clearance (List X) that hold a sponsorship account, initial assurance will be undertaken in tranches over the next three years. Organisations will be informed directly by the ISAC when they will be expected to submit evidence to support assurance, however all organisations should actively prepare to have the required policies and processes in place at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>Guidance to support organisations in the development of their IPSA related personnel
security policies and processes, as well as the assurance process, has been published
alongside the IPSA policy on gov.uk.</p>

<p>The guidance will also be shared on the ListXtranet for organisations with an FSC, and a
new collaboration area for non-FSC organisations eligible for IPSA.</p>

<h2>Action by industry</h2>

<p>You should read the IPSA policy and supporting documentation and begin preparing for
assurance as soon as possible. This may require modifications to your existing personnel security policies and processes. It is recognised that there may be a short-term pressure on organisations that already hold an FSC to implement new policies and processes, however if these are maintained then ongoing assurance should become routine.</p>

<p>Introductory emails will be sent to all Security Controllers with links to the relevant
documents and an indication of when they are likely to be subject to assurance to enable
adequate time to prepare. Where organisations have multiple locations with an FSC then all security controllers have been contacted. However, IPSA, unlike FSC, is assessed at an organisation, not facility, level. Therefore, co-ordination via a central security function may be preferable. Where security and welfare policies are not managed centrally within an organisation we can, on a case by case basis, work with you to understand the most
appropriate level for assurance.</p>

<p>The ISAC will host virtual roadshows over the summer of 2021 to explain the IPSA process in more detail and to provide an opportunity to have any questions answered. Organisations with an FSC will be contacted nearer the time to book a slot onto a briefing of their choosing. Organisations without an FSC that would be interested in joining a session should contact the ISAC (<a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:isac-group@mod.gov.uk">isac-group@mod.gov.uk</a>) to express an interest so they can be informed when
booking goes live.</p>

<h2>Validity/Expiry date</h2>

<p>Until withdrawn.</p>
