<h2>Introduction to the car and trailer (BE) training syllabus</h2>

<p>The training syllabus sets out how to train drivers in the skills, knowledge and understanding they need to be a safe and responsible driver when towing a trailer with a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>car</li>
  <li>van</li>
  <li>pick-up truck</li>
</ul>

<p>It was developed by the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>), working in partnership with the Trailer Towing Advisory Group to achieve our common goal of keeping everyone safe on Britain’s roads.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>The training syllabus represents current good practice for driver training. There will be many other valid ways to deliver the learning outcomes.</p>
</div>

<h3>Who can do this training</h3>

<p>Any driver who holds a current, full category B driving licence can do this training as a way to improve their driving competence.</p>

<h3>How the training is structured</h3>

<p>Drivers must undertake training covering the contents of this syllabus which provides them with specific training on how to tow a trailer, up to 3,500kg maximum authorised mass (<abbr title="Maximum authorised mass">MAM</abbr>) with a category B vehicle. The duration of training will depend on the trainer’s judgement of  the driver’s ability and the time that will be needed for them to meet the aim of the syllabus.</p>

<p>The training will be a mixture of theory and practical elements.</p>

<p>You should speak to your trainer if you are in any doubt about any of the elements covered in this syllabus.</p>

<h2>Vehicle and trailer combinations</h2>

<p>You should take your training in a vehicle combination that suits your needs. Towing combinations fall into 3 groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>unbraked trailers</li>
  <li>medium-sized vehicles and trailers</li>
  <li>large category B vehicles towing large braked trailers</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever you tow, you should make sure you know how to drive, use and operate it safely.</p>

<h3>Unbraked trailers</h3>

<p>A trailer does not need brakes if it has a maximum permitted weight of 750kg or less. These trailers are generally used to transport gardening waste or general household goods.</p>

<p>If the trailer has brakes, they must be in good working order.</p>

<h3>Medium-sized vehicles and trailers</h3>

<p>These are combinations where the combined <abbr title="Maximum authorised mass">MAM</abbr> of the towing vehicle and the trailer or caravan is 3,500 kg or less.</p>

<h3>Large category B vehicles towing large braked trailers</h3>

<p>These are vehicles up to 3,500kg <abbr title="Maximum authorised mass">MAM</abbr>. The size of the trailer depends on the BE ‘valid from’ date shown on your licence. If the date is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>before 1 January 1997, you can tow any size trailer within the towing limits of the vehicle</li>
  <li>on or after 1 January 1997, you can tow a trailer with a <abbr title="Maximum authorised mass">MAM</abbr> of up to 3,500kg within the towing limits of the vehicle</li>
</ul>

<p>These trailers could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>horse trailers</li>
  <li>larger caravans</li>
  <li>caged trailers loaded with small plant and machinery</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>For example, a large 4X4 SUV with a MAM of up to 3,500 kg that can tow a trailer with a MAM of 3,500 kg is legally capable of towing a large horse box or a large 6 berth caravan.</p>
</div>

<h2>Aim of the syllabus</h2>

<p>This syllabus sets out how to train drivers in the skills, knowledge and understanding they need to be a safe and responsible driver when towing a trailer with a category B vehicle.</p>

<p>After completing this training, drivers will be able to discuss and demonstrate the following 12 aspects of driving whilst towing a trailer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>preparing a vehicle and its occupants for a journey</li>
  <li>how to guide and control the vehicle whilst towing</li>
  <li>how to competently reverse a vehicle and trailer</li>
  <li>how to uncouple and recouple the trailer safely and competently</li>
  <li>using the road in accordance with the Highway Code</li>
  <li>driving safely and responsibly in the traffic system</li>
  <li>road safety benefits</li>
  <li>fuel-saving driving techniques</li>
  <li>safe driving techniques</li>
  <li>safe loading</li>
  <li>vehicle-handling techniques</li>
  <li>legislative requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>Successful completion of training is demonstrated by the drivers’ ability to discuss and demonstrate all 12 aspects of driving whilst towing a trailer, to the satisfaction of the trainer.</p>

<p>Depending on the needs of the individual and employers, this can be evaluated through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ongoing assessment throughout the training</li>
  <li>an end point assessment</li>
</ul>

<p>The assessment may be carried out by the course trainer or other competent qualified person.</p>

<h2>How to use this syllabus</h2>

<p>The syllabus is divided into 4 sessions, which are based on content from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-standard-for-driving-cars-and-light-vans-category-b">national driving standard for cars and light vans</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-standard-for-driving-lorries">national standard for driving lorries</a>.</p>

<p>The 4 sessions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>preparing the vehicle, trailer, and its contents for daily use</li>
  <li>driving the vehicle, whilst towing, in accordance with The Highway Code and legislation</li>
  <li>reversing with the trailer, uncoupling, and coupling</li>
  <li>driving safely and efficiently</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s important for drivers and trainers to see these sessions as inter-connected and of equal importance. A driver can only become competent by understanding how the content from all the sessions fits together.</p>

<p>The route taken through the material by each trainee may differ, and <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> believes that the training should be client-centred. Client-centred learning means that the trainer should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consider a learner’s preferred style of learning</li>
  <li>understand that people are more likely to keep learning if they are encouraged to take responsibility for their learning at an early stage</li>
</ul>

<p>Trainees should use this training to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>develop a greater awareness of the risks associated with driving</li>
  <li>reflect on their own driving performance and take steps to improve in areas that need further development</li>
</ul>

<h2>Session 1: preparing the vehicle, trailer, and its contents for daily use</h2>

<p>This session will teach you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how to make an informed judgement on whether you, your vehicle, your trailer, and your load are fit to travel</li>
  <li>how your vehicle may or may not be affected by certain safety factors associated with the weight and size of trailer</li>
  <li>how to act appropriately based on that judgement</li>
</ul>

<h3>Assess your own and your vehicle’s safety</h3>

<p>This session will teach you about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>factors affecting your fitness to drive that can change from day to day and over your driving lifetime</li>
  <li>certain attitudes and misunderstandings that can prevent you from acting on the knowledge and understanding you have</li>
  <li>the roadworthiness of your vehicle and trailer</li>
  <li>the potential risks to yourself and others whilst towing</li>
  <li>what action you should take to manage any specific risks in the event of an incident</li>
  <li>how traffic, weather and road conditions can affect your driving</li>
</ul>

<h3>Loading your vehicle and trailer</h3>

<p>The session will teach you about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the safety and security issues involved in driving when towing a trailer (loaded or unloaded)</li>
  <li>how to reduce the risks that driving with a loaded or unloaded trailer can generate</li>
</ul>

<h2>Session 2: tow safely in accordance with the Highway Code and regulations</h2>

<p>The aim of this session is to understand and follow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the rules in The Highway Code</li>
  <li>other regulations which apply to driving whilst towing</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important that you do not think of The Highway Code as just something that you had to learn to pass your driving test. The Highway Code contains advice and rules about road signs and how to behave in particular situations whilst driving. You’ll also need to know the speed limits that apply to your vehicle whilst towing, especially on motorways and national speed limit roads. If you understand the Code’s content, it will make it much easier for you to drive safely and responsibly in changing traffic situations.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>There may be serious consequences for you and other road users if you do not follow the advice and rules set out in The Highway Code or regulations.</p>

<h2>Session 3: reversing with the trailer, coupling, and uncoupling</h2>

<p>The aim of this session is that you’ll be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>guide and control your vehicle and trailer safely and responsibly while reversing</li>
  <li>safely and competently couple and uncouple your trailer to the vehicle, ensuring that it is safe and legal, whether on the public road or off-road</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reversing with a trailer</h3>

<p>Reversing with a trailer is a complex task. It involves taking in a large amount of information and responding to it appropriately. To be able to do this you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>constantly scan the area around you</li>
  <li>understand what is happening</li>
  <li>identify possible hazards and risks</li>
</ul>

<h3>Couple and recouple your trailer to the vehicle</h3>

<p>Safely and successfully coupling your trailer to your towing vehicle is a matter of practice. It’s important that you focus on each skill and make sure you understand what’s required at each stage of the process.</p>

<h2>Session 4: drive safely and efficiently</h2>

<p>The aim of this session is that you will be able to guide and control your vehicle and trailer safely and responsibly, taking into account:</p>

<ul>
  <li>road conditions</li>
  <li>traffic</li>
  <li>terrain when off-road</li>
  <li>weather conditions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guiding and controlling your vehicle</h3>

<p>Driving is a complex task; it involves taking in a large amount of information and responding to it appropriately. To be able to do this you must constantly scan around you, understand what is happening and identify possible hazards and risks.</p>

<p>To drive safely with a trailer attached to your vehicle you need to master the essential driving skills, such as steering and coordinating your vehicle’s controls. You will ensure you are very confident of these skills before driving with a trailer so you can concentrate effectively on driving, towing, your surroundings and any potential hazards.</p>

<h3>Your trailer’s load</h3>

<p>You are legally responsible for your vehicle and trailer and need to make sure that it is loaded correctly for stability. You also need to be aware of the feel and handling of your vehicle at all times. As the driver, you need to be aware of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the impact of towing a trailer with a load that is wider than your vehicle</li>
  <li>the load distribution within the trailer and the effects of accelerating, braking and steering</li>
</ul>
