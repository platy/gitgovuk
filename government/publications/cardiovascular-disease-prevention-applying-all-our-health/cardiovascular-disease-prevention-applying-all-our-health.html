<h2>Why promote <abbr title="Cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr> prevention in your professional practice?</h2>

<p>Over the last few decades, great strides have been taken in reducing premature deaths due to cardiovascular disease (<abbr title="Cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr>) in England. However, <abbr title="Cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr> still remains a significant cause of disability, death and health inequalities.</p>

<p>Nearly 7 million people are living with <abbr title="Cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr> in England, and it contributes to over a quarter of deaths each year.  People from our most deprived populations are nearly 4 times more likely to die prematurely from <abbr title="Cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr>, compared to those from the most affluent populations.</p>

<p>Health and social care costs in England relating to <abbr title="Cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr> are estimated at £7.4 billion each year, with wider costs to the economy estimated at £15.8 billion annually.</p>

<p>Heart attacks and strokes are highly preventable through population level measures and support for individual behaviour change. The NHS also has a crucial role in identifying individuals who have developed high-risk <abbr title="Cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr> conditions. These include atrial fibrillation (<abbr title="atrial fibrillation">AF</abbr>), high blood pressure and raised cholesterol, which have been shown to significantly increase the risk of <abbr title="Cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr> events such as heart attack, stroke and dementia.</p>

<p>Optimal treatment of <abbr title="atrial fibrillation">AF</abbr>, high blood pressure and raised cholesterol is highly effective in preventing <abbr title="Cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr> events. However, a large proportion of those living with these conditions remain undiagnosed, and of those with a diagnosis, a large number are not receiving optimal treatment. For instance, over 40% of people with high blood pressure remain undiagnosed. Of those people diagnosed with high blood pressure, only 67% are optimally managed.</p>

<h2>Access the cardiovascular disease prevention e-learning session</h2>

<p>An <a class="govuk-link" href="https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/Component/Details/571421" rel="external">interactive e-learning version of this topic</a> is now available to use.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> and Health Education England’s ‘e-Learning for Healthcare’ have developed this content to increase the confidence and skills of health and care professionals, to embed prevention in their day-to-day practice.</p>

<h2>Taking action</h2>

<h3>If you’re a front-line health professional:</h3>

<p>There are several opportunities to identify <abbr title="Cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr> risk factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>access training to become more confident in identifying and managing high risk conditions for <abbr title="Cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr> – especially high blood pressure and atrial fibrillation</li>
  <li>support patients with information to lower their risk of <abbr title="Cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr>
</li>
  <li>check if patients have been offered an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/nhs-health-check/" rel="external">NHS health check</a>, if aged between 40 to 74 years of age</li>
  <li>ask patients if they know their recent blood pressure reading and offer a blood pressure check</li>
  <li>ask patients if they have recently had their cholesterol checked and offer testing where appropriate</li>
  <li>discuss with patients the importance of knowing and understanding their <abbr title="Cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr> risk</li>
</ul>

<h3>Managing <abbr title="Cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr> high risk factors</h3>

<p>Provide information to patients on the benefits of treating and managing <abbr title="Cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr> high-risk factors.</p>

<p>Familiarise yourself with the referral and management pathways for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>atrial fibrillation</li>
  <li>high blood pressure</li>
  <li>high cholesterol</li>
  <li>high <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qs100/chapter/quality-statement-1-full-formal-risk-assessment-using-qrisk2" rel="external">10-year <abbr title="Cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr> risk score</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>It is also helpful to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>discuss with patients the benefits of behaviour change in reducing <abbr title="Cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr> risk – this includes lifestyle factors such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/smoking-and-tobacco-applying-all-our-health">smoking,</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/physical-activity-applying-all-our-health">physical activity,</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-obesity-applying-all-our-health/adult-obesity-applying-all-our-health">obesity</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-applying-all-our-health">alcohol consumption</a>
</li>
  <li>provide support for behaviour change on the lifestyle factors identified above</li>
  <li>familiarise yourself with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/be-healthier/check-your-health/heart-age-test/" rel="external">heart age test</a> as a motivational tool and route to support behaviour change</li>
</ul>

<h4>If you’re a team leader or manager:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>ensure the teams you lead are aware of latest guidance and interventions on <abbr title="Cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr> prevention within your local area</li>
  <li>provide learning and development opportunities on <abbr title="Cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr> prevention for team members</li>
  <li>ensure there are clear local referral and management pathways for <abbr title="Cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr> conditions</li>
</ul>

<h4>If you’re a senior or strategic leader:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>it is important to know what success looks like within your organisation – and create opportunities to share learning</li>
  <li>ensure that your organisation is represented in the membership of relevant prevention, or <abbr title="Cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr> disease oversight boards</li>
  <li>seek opportunities to work collaboratively with local partners including sustainability and transformations partnerships (<abbr title="sustainability and transformations partnerships">STPS</abbr>) and integrated care systems (ICS) on <abbr title="Cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr> prevention initiatives</li>
  <li>ensure there is clarity on shared priorities with local partners</li>
</ul>

<h3>Understanding local needs</h3>

<p><abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> provides intelligence and data through the National Cardiovascular Intelligence Network (NCVIN). This information is useful to identify how well people are being diagnosed and treated for <abbr title="Cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr>.</p>

<p>It includes updates and additions to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cardiovascular disease primary care <a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/cardiovascular-disease-prevention" rel="external">prevention packs</a>
</li>
  <li>

</ul>

<h2>Measuring impact</h2>

<p>As a health professional, there is a range of reasons why it makes sense to measure your impact and demonstrate the value of your contribution. This could be about sharing what has worked well in order to benefit your colleagues and local people or to support your professional development.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://qof.digital.nhs.uk/" rel="external">quality and outcomes framework (QOF)</a> is a voluntary annual reward and incentive programme for all <abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr> surgeries in England, detailing practice achievement results. It is not about performance management but resourcing and then rewarding good practice.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/public-health-outcomes-framework">public health outcomes framework</a> examines indicators that help us understand trends in public health such as premature mortality in individuals with <abbr title="Cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr>.</p>
