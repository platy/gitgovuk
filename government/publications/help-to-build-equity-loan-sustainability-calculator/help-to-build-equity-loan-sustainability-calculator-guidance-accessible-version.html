<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Sustainability Calculator (calculator) works out if applicants pass the sustainability assessment for Help to Build: Equity Loan.</p>

<p>The sustainability assessment checks that applicants meet the sustainability ratios and can afford the equity loan. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mortgage income less debt multiple (max 4.5x) – mortgage amount divided by the gross income of the applicants, minus their debts. This means the total loan capital can’t be more than 4.5 times the applicants’ gross income, minus their debts.</li>
  <li>debt to net income ratio (max 45%) – costs related to the property (mortgage repayment amount, equity loan interest and service charge if applicable) divided by the net incomes of the applicants, minus their debts. This means the debt to income ratio can’t be more than 45% of applicants’ net incomes, once all property costs and debts are factored in.</li>
</ul>

<p>The calculator accepts the income of applicants who are employed, self-employed sole traders, or self-employed directors/shareholders of a limited company.</p>

<p>The calculator can take information about income for up to 4 people. This is because a maximum of 4 people can apply for Help to Build together.</p>

<p>Employed applicants only need to provide their gross incomes before tax. The calculator works out their tax and national insurance to calculate their net incomes after tax.</p>

<p>Self-employed applicants must provide their gross incomes (before tax) and their net incomes (after tax). The calculator will not work out their taxes and national insurance amounts.</p>

<h2>How to use the calculator</h2>

<h3>General function</h3>

<p>Data can be entered into the yellow fields, but the blue fields are calculated fields.</p>

<p>Only the yellow fields can be edited.  The information entered in the yellow fields must match the information provided in the application form.</p>

<p>The calculator does some validations.  These fields are highlighted in grey.</p>

<p>A warning message will show on the grey fields if there are issues with the information entered.</p>

<h3>Applicant(s) details</h3>

<p>Enter the Application reference number (cell D7).  This is the same number on the application form.</p>

<p>Enter the first name (cells C11-C14), last name (cells D11-D14), date of birth (cells G11-G14) and mobile/telephone phone number (cells I11-I14) of the applicants. The date of birth and mobile phone number must match the correct applicant’s first and last names.</p>

<h3>Help to Build property details</h3>

<p>This section covers information about the property, including estimated costs and how they will be funded during the build phase.</p>

<p>Property address (cell C18) – enter the address if known. The exact address may not be known in the early stages of the build, in which case this field can be left blank.</p>

<p>Local authority – there are 2 local authority fields - Local Authority (outside London) and Local Authority (London). Only one of these fields must be used.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the property address is outside London, complete Local Authority (outside London) (cell E18) by selecting the local authority from the dropdown list</li>
  <li>If the property address is inside London, complete Local Authority (London) (cell G18) by selecting the local authority from the dropdown list</li>
  <li>The unused local authority field must be left blank. If both fields are filled out, a warning message will appear in cell I18.  Delete the information in the field that is not needed if this happens.</li>
</ul>

<p>Land purchase price (if applicable), excluding VAT (cell D21)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enter the purchase price of the land, if known. If not known, enter the estimated land purchase price</li>
  <li>Most land purchases for self-build are exempt from VAT.  If there is a VAT on the land purchase price, the value entered in the field must not include it</li>
  <li>If the applicant already owns the land, this field needs to be ‘nil’ or left blank. If ‘nil’ or left blank, the message “Land is already owned” will show in cell E21</li>
  <li>The purchase price to buy a leasehold flat or a shell property can be the land purchase price. This figure must not include any cost to customise or fitout the interior of the property.</li>
</ul>

<p>Build cost, excluding VAT and contingency (cell D22)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enter the estimated build cost, excluding VAT and contingency</li>
  <li>This figure must not be over £400,000. If the value entered is higher than £400,000, the message “Exceeds max build cost” will show in cell E22</li>
  <li>If the property is a leasehold flat or a shell property, the build costs must be the cost to customise and fitout the interior of the property</li>
  <li>If the applicant plans to demolish an existing property in order to build a new self-build home, the demolition costs can be included in the build costs, but they must exclude VAT and contingency.</li>
</ul>

<p>Total build cost and land purchase price if applicable, excluding VAT and contingency (cell D23)</p>

<ul>
  <li>This is the sum of the Land purchase price (if applicable), excluding VAT (cell D21) and Build cost, excluding VAT and contingency (cell D22)</li>
  <li>The total must not be over £600,000.  If the total is higher than £600,000, the message “Exceeds max total cost” will show in cell E23.</li>

  <li>This is the applicant’s deposit, or contribution, towards the property’s estimated development costs (for land and build)</li>
  <li>It must be at least 5% of the total funding during build phase (cell H23)</li>
  <li>If the amount is lower than 5% the message “Insufficient deposit” will show in cell I21.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>This is the difference between the total funding during build phase (cell H23) and the self and custom builder’s deposit (cell H21)</li>
  <li>It must not be higher than 95% of the total funding during build phase (cell H23)</li>
  <li>If the amount is higher than 95% the message “Exceed max LTC” will show in cell L22.</li>
</ul>

<p>Total funding during building phase (cell H23) – this is the sum of total build cost and land purchase price if applicable, excluding VAT and contingency (cell D23), the VAT included in the mortgage (cell D24) and the contingency included in the mortgage (cell D25).</p>

<p>Mortgage amount at completion (cell H24)</p>

<ul>
  <li>This is the difference between the Self build-mortgage (cell H22) and the Homes England Help to Build contribution (cell D30)</li>
  <li>This will be the mortgage amount used in the sustainability assessment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mortgage term (in years) (cell H25)</p>

<ul>
  <li>This must be the mortgage’s total term (length), if known.</li>
  <li>If this is not known, 25 years will be entered by default.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mortgage follow-on interest rate (assumed after initial offer period expires) (cell H26)</p>

<ul>
  <li>The default value used is 4.8% per year, even if the follow-on rate in the mortgage offer is lower than this.</li>
  <li>If the follow-on rate in the mortgage offer is higher than 4.8% the higher rate must be used. Select the higher follow-on rate from the dropdown list.</li>
  <li>Follow-on rates listed in the dropdown are in increments of 0.05% and up to a maximum 10.00%. If the follow-on rate is in between the rates available, select the higher rate that is closest to the actual rate. For example, if the follow-on rate is 5.02% select 5.05% from the dropdown list.</li>
