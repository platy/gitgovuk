<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Information: teachers’ pension scheme employer contribution grant for further education providers – details for 2022 to 2023</h2>

<p>We have confirmed the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-pension-scheme-employer-contribution-grant-further-education-providers/teachers-pension-scheme-employer-contribution-grant-further-education-providers">arrangements for the teachers’ pension scheme</a> funding allocations for the 2022 to 2023 academic year.</p>

<p>If you have any questions after reading our guidance, please contact us using our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen" rel="external">online enquiry form</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Information: additional hours in study programmes</h2>

<p>In December, we said we would allocate funding for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-information-for-2022-to-2023#changes-for-2022-to-2023">additional hours in 16 to 19 study programmes from academic year 2022 to 2023</a>. This investment is part of the government’s commitment to a long-term education recovery.</p>

<p>This, alongside other education recovery programmes such as the 16 to 19 tuition fund, will help ensure gaps in learning caused by disruption to education can be filled. Today, we have published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-funding-additional-hours-in-study-programmes">guidance to support providers</a> to understand the new requirement for additional hours.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: the next round of the School Rebuilding Programme (SRP) is now open</h2>

<p>The SRP will carry out 500 major rebuilding and refurbishment projects at the worst buildings in the school and sixth form college estate across England over the next decade. We have previously announced the first 100 schools in the programme. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-rebuilding-programme/school-rebuilding-programme">Details of these and the programme</a> are available on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>DfE consulted over summer and early autumn 2021 on the future prioritisation of schools in the SRP. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/prioritising-schools-for-the-school-rebuilding-programme">Our consultation response</a> is available on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>If you would like a school to be considered for the rebuilding programme action is required <strong>before 3 March 2022</strong>.</p>

<p>We have published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-rebuilding-programme/school-rebuilding-programme">guidance on how to nominate a school for consideration</a>, and the portal for responsible bodies to nominate school buildings for consideration is now open. Any schools, and the specific buildings in need of rebuilding, must be nominated before 3 March 2022. The window for submitting supplementary evidence, where relevant, will remain open until 31 March 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: 3000th school visited in the Condition Data Collection 2 (CDC2) programme</h2>

<p>Running to 2026, the CDC2 programme is collecting building condition data on all government-funded schools in England. Our surveyors have now visited the 3000th school. The data will inform future condition allocations and target investment where most needed.</p>

<p>Following a visit, the collected data is validated and undergoes rigorous quality assurance, after which a report on the findings is shared with the school and responsible body. Although CDC2 reports are less detailed than a full condition survey, they highlight condition issues which may need attention or further investigation.</p>

<p>Schools that have not been visited will be contacted by one of our surveying organisations (Aecom, Faithful+Gould and Rider Levett) in due course. The surveying organisation will also contact the responsible body about the visit. Further <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/condition-data-collection-2-cdc2-programme">details about the programme and the visit schedule</a> can be found on GOV.UK.</p>
