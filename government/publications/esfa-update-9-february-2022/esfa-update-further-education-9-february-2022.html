<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Information: teachers’ pension scheme employer contribution grant for further education providers – details for 2022 to 2023</h2>

<p>We have confirmed the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-pension-scheme-employer-contribution-grant-further-education-providers/teachers-pension-scheme-employer-contribution-grant-further-education-providers">arrangements for the teachers’ pension scheme</a> funding allocations for the 2022 to 2023 academic year.</p>

<p>If you have any questions after reading our guidance, please contact us using our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen" rel="external">online enquiry form</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Information: additional hours in study programmes</h2>

<p>In December, we said we would allocate funding for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-information-for-2022-to-2023#changes-for-2022-to-2023">additional hours in 16 to 19 study programmes from academic year 2022 to 2023</a>. This investment is part of the government’s commitment to a long-term education recovery.</p>

<p>This, alongside other education recovery programmes such as the 16 to 19 tuition fund, will help ensure gaps in learning caused by disruption to education can be filled. Today, we have published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-funding-additional-hours-in-study-programmes">guidance to support providers</a> to understand the new requirement for additional hours.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Information: health and social care students and vaccination as a condition of deployment</h2>

<p>As <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/oral-statement-on-vaccines-as-a-condition-of-deployment">announced by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care on 31 January 2022</a>, the government has stated that its intention is to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/consultation-on-removing-vaccination-as-a-condition-of-deployment-for-health-and-social-care-staff">revoke the regulations making vaccines a condition of deployment for health and social care staff</a>, subject to parliamentary process.</p>

<p>The government has also published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2022-02-03/hcws587" rel="external">written ministerial statement including what registered persons should do</a> regarding the 3 February deadline for first doses. Whilst these timelines are now paused, we ask that you continue efforts to ensure health and social care students are fully vaccinated against the virus at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>Whilst the government consults on revoking these regulations, we suggest that where you may have been looking to navigate students onto other programmes, that this is paused until the outcome of the consultation is known.</p>

<p>We will continue to work closely with NHS England and NHS Improvement to ensure that as the consultation outcomes are published, and the other steps announced by the Secretary of State for Health are implemented, the implications for students and their placements are made clear.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: Secretary of State reappoints Institute board members for 3 more years</h2>

<p>There have been four reappointments to the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (the Institute) board.</p>

<p>Dame Fiona Kendrick, Dr Kate Barclay, Robin Millar CBE, and Bev Robinson OBE were originally appointed in 2017 for a five-year term finishing at the end of March this year. The Secretary of State for Education, Nadhim Zahawi, has now reappointed them for a further three years until April 2025.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Your feedback: IfATE apprentice survey</h2>

<p>The Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (IfATE) apprentice panel want to hear from apprentices all across the country in their apprenticeship survey. This is a chance to have apprentices’ voices heard and to help make apprenticeships even better.</p>

<p>This is a short survey and should take about 10 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>This <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/reviews-and-consultations/apprentice-panel-survey/" rel="external">survey is open to any apprentice</a> who is on or has completed an apprenticeship standard. The survey will close on 8 April 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Your feedback: reminder to complete the Sustainability and Climate Change Survey</h2>

<p>DfE is running an anonymous survey to gather feedback on our Sustainability and Climate Change Draft Strategy. We will use the results from this survey alongside feedback from focus groups and working groups to inform the final developments of the strategy before publication in April 2022.</p>

<p>Please read our<a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1031454/SCC_DRAFT_Strategy.pdf" rel="external"> draft strategy</a> and then take part in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://dferesearch.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6rmKf55aYSrcMUS" rel="external">anonymous survey</a>. Responses must be submitted by 23:59 on 20 February.</p>

<p>By submitting your response, you are consenting for us to use your answers as part of our analysis of the public’s opinion on the draft strategy.</p>

<p>We encourage you to share the survey amongst your networks in line with your own data privacy notices, as well as through social media.</p>
