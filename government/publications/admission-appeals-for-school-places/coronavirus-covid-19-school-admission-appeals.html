<p>Due to coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions, we have made changes to the way admission authorities (school governing bodies, local authorities and academy trusts depending on the type of school) carry out admission appeals this year.</p>

<p>On 24 April 2020 we introduced <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/446/contents/made" rel="external">new regulations (the 2020 regulations) temporarily amending the 2012 Appeals Regulations</a> to give admission authorities, local authorities and admission appeal panels more flexibility when dealing with appeals during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. These regulations were due to expire on 31 January 2021, however as the coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions are likely to be in place longer than was first envisaged, we have introduced <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/14/contents/made" rel="external">new regulations (the 2021 regulations)</a> so the temporary arrangements now apply until 30 September 2021.</p>

<p>The accompanying <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/school-admissions-appeals-code/changes-to-the-school-admission-appeals-code-regulations-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak">guidance on changes to the admission appeals regulations</a> is non-statutory and is aimed at supporting all of those who have a duty to act in accordance with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-appeals-code" class="govuk-link">School Admission Appeals Code</a>.</p>

<p>Our aim is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>give admission authorities as much flexibility as possible to manage appeals in a way that best suits local circumstances</li>
  <li>ensure families appealing an admission decision this year are supported and are not disadvantaged by the measures in place to protect public health</li>
</ul>

<h2>Important dates</h2>

<p>The regulatory changes will remain in force until 30 September 2021.</p>

<p>The changes mean:</p>

<ul>
  <li>admission authorities will have sufficient time to deal with the annual peak in appeals for children due to start new schools at the beginning of September 2021</li>
  <li>parents will continue to have the right to appeal to any school which has refused their child a place</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary of changes</h2>

<p>The new regulations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>disapply the requirement that appeals panels must be held in person and instead give flexibility for panel hearings to take place either in person, by telephone, video conference or through a paper-based appeal where all parties can make representations in writing</li>
  <li>relax the rules with regard to what happens if one of the 3 panel members withdraws (temporarily or permanently) to make it permissible for the panel to continue with and conclude the appeal as a panel of 2</li>
  <li>amend the deadlines relating to appeals for the time that the new regulations are in force</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes to appeal deadlines</h2>

<p>The new regulations provide more flexibility for admission authorities to set new or revised deadlines for submitting an appeal.</p>

<p>Our amendments to deadlines will ensure that appellants will be given:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at least 14 calendar days’ written notice of an appeal hearing (although appellants can waive their right to this)</li>
  <li>admission authorities must set reasonable deadlines relating to the parties submitting evidence</li>
</ul>

<p>Hearings must be held as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>

<p>Decision letters should be sent within 7 calendar days of the hearing, wherever possible.</p>

<h2>Maintaining fairness in the appeals process</h2>

<p>The new regulations relax current requirements but will maintain obligations around natural justice and procedural fairness.</p>

<p>We are not relaxing any of the clerking duties for admission appeals. Clerks carry out a key role in relation to appeal hearings and provide advice on admissions law as well as keeping an accurate record of proceedings. Our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/school-admissions-appeals-code/changes-to-the-school-admission-appeals-code-regulations-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak#section-1-the-constitution-of-appeal-panels">accompanying guidance also reinforces the importance of training for panel members</a>, following correct procedure and ensuring fairness.</p>

<h2>Maladministration complaints</h2>

<p>Parents can continue to lodge a complaint if they have evidence of maladministration.</p>

<p>We are not relaxing any of the requirements set out under Section 5 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-appeals-code">School Admissions Appeals Code</a> which covers complaints about appeals.</p>

<h2>Early suspension of changes</h2>

<p>The regulations are subject to review, and we can amend legislation to bring forward the date on which they end, if they are no longer required.</p>
