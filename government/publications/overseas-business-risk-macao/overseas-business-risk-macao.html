<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Economics and Trade</h2>

<p>Although a significantly smaller Trade and Investment partner for the UK than neighbouring Hong Kong, Macao shares some of the same characteristics that have made Hong Kong attractive to UK business, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>absence of capital controls</li>
  <li>currency indirectly pegged to the US dollar (via a peg to the HKD)</li>
  <li>ease of setting up a business</li>
  <li>free port</li>
  <li>low-tax regime</li>
  <li>strong connectivity to mainland Chinese market via CEPA and Greater Bay Area projects</li>
</ul>

<p>Macao has one of the highest GDP per capita in the world.&nbsp; Its service economy is dominated by gambling and is responsible for around 85% of government tax receipts. Macao’s revenue from gaming and gambling in 2019 was over four times that of Las Vegas in the same year.</p>

<p>Macao has kept COVID cases extremely low.&nbsp; But there has been an economic cost.&nbsp; In 2020 the economy contracted -45.9% in Q4 due to the collapse of the gambling and tourism sectors. Tourism related activities in 2020, such as retail sales, fell -41.5% and tourist arrivals fell -85% from more than 39.4 million in 2019. The gambling sector also saw a fall of over 79% in gross gaming revenue in 2020.</p>

<p>In 2021, year-on-year GDP growth was 27.5%. The expected continuation of the Macao Government’s “dynamic zero” COVID policy, make the outlook for 2022 uncertain. The University of Macao projects 2022 GDP growth at between 3.6% and 37.9%, which is dependent on visitor numbers to the territory.</p>

<p>Macao’s public finance position remains strong, despite the fall in public revenue by 29.1% in 2020 and 6.1% rise in public expenditure, compared to 2019. The preliminary estimate of fiscal reserve as at the end of 2020 increased by 6.3% year-on-year to MOP616.12 billion.</p>

<p>British businesses operating in Macao, or thinking of establishing there, should familiarise themselves with the changing political, social and business and landscapes, seeking professional advice where needed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Trade and Investment overview</h3>

<p>Macao’s capitalist economic system and legal regime are enshrined under the Basic Law until at least until 2049. As such it is a customs territory that holds WTO membership separate to China, characterised by a liberal economy and an investor friendly environment. There are no special rules governing FDI, with domestic and foreign businesses subject to the same treatment and no capital controls. The territory imposes low corporate and personal tax, with a top rate of 12%. The gaming industry is an exception, with 35% tax levied on gross gaming revenue plus 4% contribution to sustainable development, including a social security fund.</p>

<p>The Macao Trade and Investment Promotion Institute promotes Trade and Investment, and provides one-stop-shop services to foreign and local individuals seeking to set up a company in Macao.</p>

<p>Macao has a Free Trade Agreement with mainland China, the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement. In January 2021 Macao signed a Tax Information Exchange Agreement with the UK and 15 other jurisdictions. As of January 2021 there is also in place an agreement with Hong Kong to avoid double taxation on income.</p>

<p>The establishment of&nbsp;the Guangdong-Macao Intensive Cooperation Zone (ICZ) in Zhuhai in 2021 aims to promote greater diversity within Macao’s economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also highlights Macao’s increasing economic&nbsp;integration&nbsp;with mainland China&nbsp;under the umbrella of the Greater Bay Area.</p>

<p>The government of Macao offers incentives to businesses that meet certain criteria, with no Macanese resident share ownership requirement. These include corporate tax exemptions, reduced capital requirements for loans and stamp duty exemptions.</p>

<p>The UK has a notable business presence in Macao with a British Chamber of Commerce in existence since 2006. British business interests include banking, construction, hospitality, creative industries and education. Further opportunities for British businesses could develop as the Greater Bay Area initiative gains pace.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Gaming sector reform</h3>

<p>Currently half of&nbsp;Macao’s&nbsp;six gambling licenses are held by US casinos, although this could change under the new tender process as part of gaming sector reforms.</p>

<p>In January 2022 Macao’s Legislative Council published a draft Gaming Bill. The bill will establish a tighter grip on Gaming firms and introduce significant regulation of gambling ‘junkets’, VIP gambling rooms established to attract wealthy gamblers.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Approach to COVID-19</h3>

<p>The Macao Government has a policy of “dynamic zero COVID” which aims to keep COVID out of the territory and cases to a minimum. As in Hong Kong and mainland China, flight bans have been imposed regularly, along with hotel quarantine for all international arrivals. Macao has aligned closely with mainland China’s COVID policies and has conducted several rounds of mass testing and accompanying lockdowns. Quarantine free travel between Macao and mainland China has largely been maintained, with occasional regional restrictions with outbreaks. Up to date advice can be found on the UK <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/macao/entry-requirements">government travel advice website.</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Government</h2>

<p>Macao is a Special Administrative Region of China. It covers an area of around 33 square kilometres on the southern coast of China and has a population of around 660,000 people.</p>

<p>The Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration outlines the “One Country, Two Systems” model for the Macao Special Administrative Region following the handover from Portugal to China in 1999.&nbsp; China is responsible for Macao’s foreign affairs and defence whilst the Basic Law of the Special Administrative Region provides for a high degree of autonomy in the other areas of its governance, including economic and trade affairs.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Political Structure</h3>

<p>The current Chief Executive of the Macao Special Administrative Region Government (MSARG) is Mr Ho Lat Seng, who was elected for a five-year term by a 400-member Election Committee in 2019.&nbsp; The Legislative Assembly is Macao’s parliament, a 33-member body comprising fourteen directly elected members; twelve indirectly elected members representing “functional constituencies” selected mainly by the business sector and the professions; and seven members appointed by the Chief Executive.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;advance&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Legislative Assembly elections held in September 2021,&nbsp;21 opposition candidates were disqualified from standing due to not meeting allegiance criteria, thereby ensuring that only&nbsp;pro-Beijing&nbsp;legislators were subsequently elected.&nbsp;&nbsp;Voter turnout for the Legislative Assembly elections in 2021 was 42%, the lowest since handover.</p>

<p>Macao has not faced mass protests as seen in Hong Kong in 2019. &nbsp;In September 2019 Macao’s Court of Final Appeal in September 2019 stated that any demonstrations in support of Hong Kong’s protests would&nbsp;be considered as&nbsp;interference&nbsp;within&nbsp;Hong Kong’s internal affairs.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Business and Human Rights</h2>

<p>The Basic Law of Macao provides for freedom of expression, including for the press. Local media expresses a range of views, but the government takes steps to restrict unfavourable news coverage. There is some evidence of self-censorship by academics and local media.&nbsp; Legislation is in force to criminalise actions that disrespect the Chinese national anthem.</p>

<p>The Basic Law enshrines the people’s right to form and join independent unions, conduct legal strikes and organise collective bargaining.&nbsp; Consultation to implement a trade union law in Macao, which began in October 2021, appears to have stalled.&nbsp; Previous attempts to introduce similar legislation have been rejected since handover.</p>

<p>The Macao Basic Law provides for an independent judiciary.&nbsp; Macao operates a Continental European Legal System.&nbsp; Civilian authorities maintain effective control over the Macao Police Force and there are mechanisms to investigate and punish any cases of abuse and/or corruption.</p>

<p>Macao’s legislature passed National Security Legislation in 2009 which seeks to prohibit treason, secession, sedition and subversion, theft of state secrets, foreign political bodies from conducting activities or establishing ties with groups in Macao. Macao’s authorities could under certain circumstances detain individuals under the terms of the law, with a maximum penalty of 25-year imprisonment.&nbsp; However, no cases have ever been brought. Since March 2018, Macao has banned foreign judges from presiding in cases involving national security issues.&nbsp; An official English translation of the law does not exist.</p>

<p>The Secretary for Security, Wong Sio Chak, announced in January 2022 that a revision of Macao’s National Security Law would be undertaken within the next year. &nbsp;Changes are also expected in terms of legal systems and mechanism.&nbsp; The interception and protection of communications law (enabling the judicial police to collect evidence via telecommunications) has been approved at the first reading and is under panel review at the Legislative Assembly.</p>

<p>Macao has yet to establish an independent human rights body, as recommended by the UN Human Rights Committee.&nbsp; See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/countries/AsiaRegion/Pages/CNIndex.aspx" rel="external">United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) pages</a> on China for more information on human rights issues in Macao.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Intellectual Property</h2>

<p>Intellectual Property (IP) rights are territorial, that is they only give protection in jurisdictions where they are granted or registered. If you are thinking about trading internationally, then you should consider registering your IP rights in your export markets. Specific advice should be sought from qualified professionals either in the UK or overseas.</p>

<p>Macao has a separate IP system to mainland China. Macao is not in itself a member of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). However, China has extended for application a number of WIPO treaties, including the WIPO Copyright Treaty.</p>

<p>The Intellectual Property Department of the Macao Economic and Technological Development Bureau is the government department responsible for registration of trade marks, patents and designs, and for overseeing copyright policy. Customs is the government department responsible for enforcing criminal law regarding intellectual property.</p>

<p>General information on IP is provided on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/intellectual-property-an-overview">intellectual property</a> page. More detailed guidance on protecting IP overseas in other territories is available from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/intellectual-property-office">UK Intellectual Property Office</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Bribery and corruption</h2>

<p>Bribery is illegal. It is an offence for British nationals or someone who is ordinarily resident in the UK, a body incorporated in the UK or a Scottish partnership, to bribe anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>In addition, a commercial organisation carrying on a business in the UK can be liable for the conduct of a person who is neither a UK national or resident in the UK or a body incorporated or formed in the UK. In this case it does not matter whether the acts or omissions which form part of the offence take place in the UK or elsewhere.</p>

<p>For more information, read the information provided on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/anti-bribery-policy">bribery and corruption page</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>The UK Bribery Act</h3>

<p>The Bribery Act applies to non-UK companies operating in the United Kingdom and to UK companies working overseas. It created four prime offences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>two general offences covering the offering, promising or giving of an advantage, and requesting, agreeing to receive or accepting of an advantage</li>
  <li>an offence of bribing a foreign public official</li>
  <li>a new offence of failure by a commercial organisation to prevent a bribe being paid to obtain or retain business or a business advantage (should an offence be committed, it will be a defence that the organisation has adequate procedures in place to prevent bribery)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Act recognises that no bribery prevention regime will be capable of preventing bribery at all times. A company will have a full defence if it can show that despite a particular case of bribery it nevertheless had adequate procedures in place to prevent persons associated with it from bribing. Companies must therefore make sure that they have strong, up-to-date and effective anti-bribery policies and systems in place to prevent bribery by persons associated with them.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Bribery and corruption in Macao</h3>

<p>The Commission Against Corruption (CCAC) is the primary anti-corruption organisation in Macao. Macao has laws to combat official and private corruption activity that are non-discriminatory and effectively enforced. A new framework on public procurement is expected in 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Terrorism threat and protective security</h2>

<p>Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Macao, attacks can’t be ruled out. Please ensure you check <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/macao">foreign travel advice</a> for latest information on risks and precautions.</p>

<p>You should be aware of the global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be in public areas, including those frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers. UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/" rel="external">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad">global threat from terrorism</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Organised crime</h2>

<p>Since 1999, the expansion of Macao SAR’s gambling industry has enabled it to establish itself as a prosperous tourism destination, with gaming related taxes providing over 75% of the Macao Governments income. This has however provided an arena that is ripe for those involved in money laundering and associated criminality.</p>

<p>Casinos and Gambling Junkets have long been known to be utilised in the laundering of funds for those involved in criminality, corruption and terrorism. Although the current operations of junket businesses is determined by the external business environment in mainland China, organised crime groups treat VIP rooms as economic territories.&nbsp; The new gaming regulations, as mentioned in (1.2), are aimed at clamping down on junket operations and allowing the authorities to gain greater control of the gambling industry as a whole. How this will impact on organised crime and money laundering in Macao is not yet clear. PRC Currency Restrictions see Macao operate in the “grey market” to facilitate alternative remittance activities through a well-established debit card system involving cancelled credit purchases and also through pawn shops. All such activities are available and easily exploitable by money launderers.</p>

<p>Although Money Laundering compliance has improved in Macao over the last decade, particularly following mainland China’s anti-corruption drive, and FATF mutual assessment reports, the risk of money laundering within the gaming industry remains of significant concern.</p>
