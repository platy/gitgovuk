<p>Dear Baroness Williams of Trafford</p>

<p>28 March 2022</p>

<p>The Animals in Science Committee (ASC) is aware of concerns that have been expressed both from within the regulated community, and from wider stakeholders, about the recent and ongoing implementation of ASRU’s Change Programme. To date, the ASC has not had a formal role with the Animals in Science Regulation Unit (ASRU) Change Programme Steering Committee, nor have we been asked to provide advice relating to the operationalisation of the Change Programme itself. However, we have received briefings from the ASRU leadership team setting out their vision and rationale for regulatory reform.</p>

<p>Clearly, the Home Office should endeavour to learn from the experiences of implementing the Change Programme so far, and the feedback received. As part of our statutory responsibility to provide advice to you on the operation of ASPA, we would be very willing to offer our assistance in ensuring that going forwards, regulation of the use of animals in science in the UK continues to deliver public trust and confidence. As you will be aware, we also have a specific legal duty to ensure the sharing of best practice and to provide advice to the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Bodies.</p>

<p>Our future advice in this area would be guided by principles of effective regulation, including the need for appropriate regulatory independence, and robust evaluation of outcomes for animal welfare and for UK science.</p>

<p>Our advice would also be delivered mindful of the context of the recent establishment of a new integrated policy co-ordination function - a development that we welcome as it will facilitate greater strategic oversight to the policy area of the use of animals in science across the whole of Government.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely</p>

<p><strong>Professor David Main Chair of the ASC</strong></p>
