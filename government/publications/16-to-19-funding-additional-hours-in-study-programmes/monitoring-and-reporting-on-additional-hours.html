<p>Minimising the administrative burden has been our priority in developing reporting structures. Institutions should record delivery of qualification and non-qualification hours in Individualised Learner Record (ILR) or school census returns against each student in receipt of additional hours and a delivery report for the institution overall.</p>

<h2>Baseline data</h2>

<p>We uploaded baseline data for all institutions to Document Exchange in June 2022. We used the academic year 2020 to 2021 data to calculate the baseline figures. Where no data is available for the academic year 2020 to 2021, we expect institutions to deliver at least the new minimum number of hours for each band.</p>

<p>This is how we have calculated your baseline figure</p>

<ul>
  <li>we have used the ILR or school census as the data source</li>
  <li>we have not included T Level and high needs hours and students</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>total number of planned hours in band divided by the total number of students in the band</p>
</div>

<h2>End-of-year report</h2>

<p>The purpose of the end-of-year report is to monitor and ensure that all institutions deliver on average 40 additional hours more for band 5 and T Level students (and a proportionate increase for those in lower bands) in academic year 2022 to 2023 than their academic year 2020 to 2021 baseline.</p>

<p>We will monitor and enforce the minimum hours in each funding band through the ILR or school census. The end of year statement will not be considered in terms of delivering against these minimums.</p>

<p>We require a single end-of-year report which covers additional hours and coronavirus (COVID-19) 16 to 19 tuition fund (if appropriate to your institution).</p>

<p>This guidance explains the format for the report and what information you will need to provide.</p>

<p>We will ask you to make a declaration of compliance in the report, confirming that you have delivered the increased hours as outlined in our 16 to 19 funding guidance.</p>

<p>You do not need to submit an end-of-year report for additional hours if</p>

<ul>
  <li>you had no historical data for the academic year 2020 to 2021</li>
  <li>we did not share baseline data in June 2022. For example, if all your students in academic year 2020 to 2021 had high needs, you will not receive a baseline.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even if you do not need to submit an end-of-year report for additional hours, you will still need to complete the coronavirus (COVID-19) 16 – 19 tuition fund elements of the end-of-year report (if appropriate to your institution).</p>

<h2>Digital form</h2>

<p>You will provide your end-of-year report using a digital form. We will publish the form and guidance on how to complete it in October 2023.</p>

<p>You will need to access your institution’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">DfE Sign-in</a> account to submit the form.</p>

<h2>Actions we take after receiving your report</h2>

<p>We will compare the hours you report through your ILR or school census in the academic year 2022 to 2023 with the baseline data we sent you in June 2022. This will tell us whether you have met the expectation of the policy.</p>

<p>Where you have recorded a student’s planned hours as less than the minimum in each band, we will fund them for the lower band in the academic year 2024 to 2025. This will result in a reduction in funding as part of the usual lagged funding process.</p>

<p>As funding for students with high needs is calculated differently, changes to the funding band hours will have no negative impact on the amount of funding they attract.</p>

<h2>Information you will need to provide</h2>

<h3>Section 1</h3>

<p>We will ask you to provide information that demonstrates you have delivered additional hours for the academic year 2022 to 2023 in accordance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-funding-additional-hours-in-study-programmes/16-to-19-funding-additional-hours-in-study-programmes">additional hours in study programmes guidance</a>.</p>

<p>All institutions (except those who are exempt, as detailed above) delivering 16 to 19 study programmes must complete section 1 of the form. We will address non-compliance through department territorial teams. Where applicable, we may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>refer for further support from our territorial teams or notify the FE Commissioner</li>
  <li>notify the relevant Regional Schools Commissioner (RSC)/Reginal Directors so they can take it into consideration as part of their wider oversight of those schools</li>
</ul>

<p>We will ask you to confirm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether you have met the expected increase in average increase hours for each band</li>
  <li>the average increase in hours you have delivered per band</li>
  <li>if you have not met the increase, reasons why (drop down options)</li>
  <li>whether you used the increase in hours primarily for tutor-led activity in line with 16 to 19 study programme guidance, this should be separate to any small group provision provided through the Tuition Fund</li>
  <li>if you did not use the increase in hours primarily for tutor-led activity, what flexibilities you used and the rationale for doing so (free text box)</li>
  <li>a declaration from an authorised approver within your institution</li>
</ul>

<h3>Section 2</h3>

<p>We will ask you to complete section 2 in the form if you opted in or were automatically opted into the (COVID-19) 16 to 19 tuition fund.</p>

<h3>Variations</h3>

<p>We recognise there will be variation with differences in cohorts and courses that may result in the average increase in hours not being fully reflected in ILR or school census returns, despite hours being delivered fully in accordance with the published guidance.</p>

<p>You will be able to provide information in the form where this applies.</p>

<h2>T Levels</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-funding/t-levels-funding-guide-for-2022-to-2023#additionalhours">Planned hours delivered in T Levels</a> do not count towards an institution’s average hours for baseline data or for the comparison from 2022 to 2023 planned hours.</p>

<h2>High Needs</h2>

<p>To ensure students with high needs up to age 25, or those aged 19 to 25 with an EHCP can benefit from the additional hours policy, we have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-funding-additional-hours-in-study-programmes/16-to-19-funding-additional-hours-in-study-programmes#high-needs-funding-for-additional-hours-and-flexibilities">given further flexibilities</a> in how you deliver additional hours for these students. This is subject to the relevant local authority agreeing to any necessary change to the EHCP and/or high needs funding required.</p>
