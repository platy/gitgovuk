<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>This information is not meant to be definitive, and is not a substitute for independent legal advice.  Neither Her Majesty’s Government nor its staff take any responsibility for the accuracy of the information, nor accept liability for any loss, costs, damage, or expense that you might suffer as a result of relying on the information.  The information contained in this guide is general and factual.  You should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eritrea-list-of-lawyers">contact local lawyers</a> for independent legal advice.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: key points</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>If you are a British National, and are arrested or detained in another country, consular staff will do what they can to help you, but they cannot interfere with the local justice system, get you out of jail, or pay for services such as a lawyer.  Information about who we can help, including the circumstances in which we can assist dual nationals, is available at: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-british-nationals-abroad-a-guide">Support for British nationals abroad</a>.</p>

<p>This detention information pack is designed to give you, and your family and friends, information about the local system in Eritrea and who can help. A printed copy is provided to those in prison or in custody, and an online version is available. We welcome feedback to help us improve the information we can provide to others.</p>

<p>The Eritrean authorities do not recognise dual nationality. If you are of Eritrean descent, the Eritrean authorities will not inform the British Embassy of your detention and there will be very little the Embassy can do on your behalf.</p>

<h3>Contacting us</h3>

<p>If you are arrested or detained in Eritrea:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the authorities should ask whether you want them to contact the British Embassy (and must do so if you want them to)</li>
  <li>even if they do not ask, you can request the British Embassy is informed, and should do so, particularly if you are charged with a serious offence or need any kind of assistance</li>
  <li>friends or family can also contact the local British Consulate or the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) in London on +44 (0)20 7008 5000</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who we are</h3>

<p>Consular staff work in the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London, and in British Embassies, High Commissions and Consulates overseas.</p>

<p>The British Embassy in Eritrea is located in Asmara at</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

66-68 Mariam Ghimbi Street,
<br>PO Box 5584,
<br>Zip Code 174,
<br>Tel. +291 1 125 123
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>You can also contact us by phone 24/7 for help or advice from anywhere in the world by calling the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office on + 44 (0) 207 008 5000.</p>

<h3>What we can do</h3>

<p>The FCDO can offer you impartial and non-judgemental help. Once notified of your arrest or detention, consular staff will aim to contact you as soon as possible so that we can assess how we can help you. We will provide assistance according to your individual circumstances and local conditions: our priority is to provide assistance to British Nationals overseas that need our help the most.</p>

<p>The Eritrean authorities may not notify the British Embassy of the detention of a British national. In the past, the Embassy has received information from relatives of arrested British nationals.</p>

<p>Once we are notified, we aim to contact the prisoner as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If the authorities allow us we can also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eritrea-list-of-lawyers">list of local English-speaking lawyers and interpreters</a>
</li>
  <li>provide general information about the country, detention conditions, and the local legal system</li>
  <li>tell the police or prison doctor, with your permission, about any medical or dental problems including medication</li>
  <li>put you, or your family, in touch with a prisoners’ welfare charity called <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a>
</li>
  <li>help to transfer money to you from your friends or family. In places where phone or postal services aren’t 
 available, we can also pass on messages and deliver letters to the prison</li>
</ul>

<h3>What we cannot do</h3>

<ul>
  <li>get you out of prison or detention</li>
  <li>help you get special treatment</li>
  <li>offer legal advice, start legal proceedings or investigate a crime</li>
  <li>pay for any costs as a result of being arrested</li>
  <li>forward you packages sent by friends or family</li>
  <li>prevent the authorities from deporting you after release</li>
</ul>

<h3>First steps</h3>

<h4>Can you / will you tell my family?</h4>

<p>If you want us to, we can tell your family or friends that you have been detained and provide them with information about how to contact you. With your consent, we can also keep them updated on your well-being.</p>

<p>If you are not sure about informing your family, we can help you consider the impact that not doing so might have. For example, it may cause them distress if they do not know where you are, or cannot contact you. It can also be a disadvantage to you if you need someone to send you money or act on your behalf while you are detained.</p>

<h4>Will the UK Police be informed?</h4>

<p>If you are accused of certain serious offences, such as sexual assault or drugs trafficking, we are obliged to share information about your arrest with UK police.  It is therefore possible your detention may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer. There may be other circumstances in which information about you may need to be shared by ourselves or the authorities in Eritrea.</p>

<h4>Do I need a lawyer? / How can I find a lawyer?</h4>

<p>Although we cannot give legal advice, start legal proceedings, or investigate a crime, we can offer basic information about the local legal system. Legal aid is not available in Eritrea. However, where someone is accused of serious crimes, such as 1st, 2nd or 3rd degree murder, or 1st degree rape, and where the high court has the jurisdiction, the court may be able to source pro bono representation if you cannot afford a lawyer. A list of local interpreters and local English-speaking lawyers is included with this pack. See also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eritrea-list-of-lawyers">list of local interpreters and a list of local English-speaking lawyers</a>. You will want to consider the benefits of local legal representation and to discuss all the costs beforehand with a legal representative. In no circumstances can we pay your legal or interpretation costs.</p>

<h4>Can you get me out?</h4>

<p>We cannot get you out of prison or detention, nor can we get special treatment for you because you are British. However if you are not treated in line with internationally accepted standards we will consider whether to approach the local authorities. This may include if your trial does not follow internationally recognised standards for fair trial or is delayed unreasonably compared to local cases.</p>

<h3>Who else can help me?</h3>

<p>We can put you, or your family, in touch with Prisoners Abroad, a UK charity which supports British citizens detained overseas and their families: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk">https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk</a>.  Further information about Prisoners Abroad can be found in Chapter 4 of this document.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: Detention conditions in Eritrea</h2>

<h3>Arrest and police custody</h3>

<h4>What should happen if I am arrested?</h4>

<p>If arrested and taken to a police station, you should be able to phone your family or friends to inform them of the arrest. This may be your only chance to make a call. The police may allow you to call the British Embassy.</p>

<p>You should be informed of the reason for your arrest and allowed access to a lawyer and interpreter. The police will take your statement and your valuables will be kept in a safe place until you are discharged or transferred to remand detention.</p>

<p>You should not be detained in the police station for more than 48 hours, and should appear in court within 48 hours of your arrest if you are to be charged.</p>

<p>Detainees are allowed to take medication at the police station but there is no automatic assessment by a doctor or social worker:</p>

<ul>
  <li>should you have any questions concerning the legal aspects of your arrest, contact your lawyer. See our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eritrea-list-of-lawyers/list-of-english-speaking-lawyers-in-eritrea">list of local English-speaking lawyers</a>
</li>
  <li>the law provides the detainees with the right to be informed of their charges in a language which they understand</li>
</ul>

<h4>Police detention</h4>

<p>Cells in police stations are likely only to have blankets and mattresses.</p>

<h3>Visits: family and friends</h3>

<h4>Can my family and friends visit me? How can I arrange a visit?</h4>

<p>Unless allowed for a special reason, one cannot meet a detainee physically before they finish their trial, which may take several months. However, in most cases detainees can be sent food, clothes, blankets etc. before their trial.</p>

<h4>What can visitors expect?</h4>

<p>Where visiting is allowed, visitors can talk with detainees through barbed wire windows for up to 30 minutes. Guards may be around, but may not be close enough to listen to the conversation.</p>

<p>Where visitors can only leave food and clothes, they give their baskets to the guards and wait outside to get their empty containers.</p>

<p>Visiting times vary according to the detention centre but not more than two or three times a week. Visiting hours can be delayed.</p>

<h4>What can visitors bring?</h4>

<p>Visitors can bring food and clothing and small amount of money. Phones and sharp objects, like knives or nails, etc., are prohibited.</p>

<h3>Visits: consular staff</h3>

<p>There have been very few British nationals arrested in Eritrea in recent memory and no British nationals without Eritrean heritage. Thus Embassy staff have never visited a British prisoner in detention but would do so on request from the prisoner or family and with permission from authorities.</p>

<h4>Emergency trips outside of prison</h4>

<p>Detainees can make emergency trips outside prison if an urgent matter arises, for example to attend in Eritrea the funeral of a family member or for medical treatment.</p>

<h3>Prison: conditions and daily life</h3>

<p>In all prisons, the conditions and daily life are similar. Detainees are kept in their cells except for bathroom visits and exercise. In some cases prisoners are held in isolation, depending on their charges. We do not expect any representations made by Embassy staff will improve conditions.</p>

<h4>Accommodation</h4>

<p>Sentenced and remand prisoners are held separately. There are shared cells in all the prisons and bunk beds in the sentenced prisons.</p>

<p>There is natural light, running water and electricity in all prisons. Prisoners are allowed few hours out of their cells each day for exercise.</p>

<h4>Food and diet</h4>

<p>In most prisons, prisoners are entitled to three meals a day. Some prisoners may receive a special diet according to medical requirements. Prisoners are allowed to receive additional food from their family and friends. Drinking water is available in all prisons.</p>

<h4>Hygiene</h4>

<p>Generally, prisoners are allowed showers once week in communal facilities.  Toiletries are mostly supplied privately by visitors.</p>

<h4>Work and study</h4>

<p>Work is not allowed in prisons but sentenced prisoners are allowed access to education in accordance to the Eritrea’s educational system. There is also vocational training for sentenced prisoners.</p>

<h4>Contact and Languages</h4>

<p>Prisoners may communicate with other inmates. Sentenced prisoners are allowed to watch TV. There are no libraries except text books for those who study. There is no internet service in prisons.</p>

<h4>Exercise</h4>

<p>Prisoners are allowed out of their cells twice a day for few hours within the prison.</p>

<h4>Religion</h4>

<p>Although there are no religious services, prisoners are generally allowed to respect their faith if their religion is approved by the Government of Eritrea. The Government of Eritrea is not tolerant of some contemporary religions.</p>

<h4>Rules and regulations (including drugs)</h4>

<p>There are rules and regulation in all prisons. Maximum discipline is demanded and abusing or insulting staff may cause severe punishment.</p>

<p>The reward for good behaviour and good relations with guards may result in small benefits.</p>

<p>Drugs are completely prohibited in Eritrea, including in prisons.</p>

<h3>Prison: access to help and services</h3>

<h4>How can I receive money?</h4>

<p>There are two ways in which you may be able to receive financial assistance while in prison.</p>

<h4>Private funds</h4>

<p>While the FCDO cannot provide financial assistance to prisoners, we may be able, within certain limits, to facilitate money transfers from your family.</p>

<p>The FCDO operates a “Prison Comfort” system for money transfers to prisoners. Please ask your family to get in touch with the FCDO in order to arrange this.</p>

<p>We are unable to receive payment by credit or debit card, or by cash.</p>

<p>Sentenced prisoners are allowed to receive a small amount of money e.g. for cigarettes, soap etc from family and/or friends during visiting hours.</p>

<h4>Prisoners Abroad</h4>

<p>Prisoners Abroad, a UK charity, may be able to assist you with funding for prison essentials and some medical care if you are not in receipt of any regular donations from other sources.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>The British Government does not provide financial assistance to prisoners.</p>
</div>

<h4>Can I receive medical and dental treatment?</h4>

<p>While you are in detention, the Eritrean authorities are responsible for ensuring your basic medical needs are met.</p>

<p>There are small clinics in all detention centres and prisoners are allowed to visit other hospitals if the health personnel refers them. There is no payment for medication.</p>

<h4>Mail/Parcels</h4>

<p>There are no direct delivery of letters or parcels. Letters and parcels can be delivered by visiting relatives with the possibility of these being checked by the prison authorities.</p>

<h4>Can I make telephone calls?</h4>

<p>Telephone calls from detention are not allowed except on arrival at the police station to notify your relatives.</p>

<h4>How can I make a complaint about mistreatment?</h4>

<p>There is no official channel to make complaints.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: the Eritrean Judicial System</h2>

<p>The Eritrean Judicial System is based on Ethiopian law with Presidential proclamations amending it. The new constitution, which makes detention without charge for more than 48 hours illegal, has not yet come into force. However, the Eritrean transitional penal and criminal procedure codes ensure some of the basic rules of law regarding detention and due process of law from arrest to trial and post-trial procedures.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<h4>Is the system the same as the UK?</h4>

<p>The system is different to the UK.  In particular, there is no trial by jury.</p>

<p>The FCDO cannot interfere with the judicial system. We cannot ask for your case to be judged more quickly just because you are British, or ask the authorities to waive any penalties.</p>

<h4>How long can I be remanded in custody?</h4>

<p>This depends on your case; you may stay in custody for days or months, or be released on bail before remand.</p>

<p>There is a difference between sentenced and remand prisoners, and they are usually kept in different detention centres.</p>

<h4>What happens when I am charged?</h4>

<p>Once charged, you will be remanded in custody or released on bail until your trial is complete or the charges are dropped.</p>

<h4>What provision is there for bail?</h4>

<p>The possibility of bail would depend on the nature of crime and nationality is not a factor. The amount of bail is set depending on the severity/nature of crime. The Court can decide the amount of bail or the police can bail a detainee before trail.</p>

<p>Bail can be paid at the police station. The detainee’s passport may be kept at the police station if they think the detainee may leave the country before finishing their trail. If a detainee fails to adhere to the bail conditions, the detainee may be arrested again and the deposited money for the guarantee will be forfeited.</p>

<p>The FCDO is not able to facilitate the transfer of bail funds.</p>

<h3>Trial and legal assistance</h3>

<h4>What kind of legal assistance is available?</h4>

<p>There is no legal aid in Eritrea. Lawyers may be arranged by the high court on a pro bono basis for certain serious offences. If you wish to hire a lawyer, see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eritrea-list-of-lawyers">list of English-speaking lawyers</a>. Prisoners Abroad can also supply information on court proceedings and advise on appointing a lawyer.</p>

<p>The service fee and terms of payment depends on mutual agreement between the person and their lawyer. Often, in practice, half or two third of the fee is paid in advance with the rest paid on completion of the case. The defendant is supposed to pay the trial costs.</p>

<h4>What happens at the trial?</h4>

<p>Once the police investigation is complete, the police send the file to the public prosecution office. The public prosecutor has the power to order the police to investigate further, close the case, or submit the file to the court. If submitted to the courts, the judge will ask the defendant whether they are guilty of the charges. If the defendant pleads guilty then the judge can automatically move to sentencing, but may still call witnesses or hear evidence to inform their judgement. If the defendant pleads not guilty, the judge will hear the evidence from the prosecution and the defence with the threshold being ‘reasonable doubt’. The judge can, if needed, call additional witnesses. If the judge feels the case has been proven beyond reasonable doubt they will pass judgment.</p>

<p>The time needed to finalize a trial will vary according to the number of cases before the court and the complexity of the case.</p>

<h4>Sentences</h4>

<p>Fines and/or victim compensation, as well as imprisonment up to 25 years are often handed down. Eritrea retains the death penalty for serious crimes, such as murder, however has committed publicly not to use it and has not executed anyone since independence in 1993. Deportation of foreigners will depend upon the case. The British Embassy may make representation through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Eritrea and contact the police.</p>

<h4>How can appeals be made?</h4>

<p>Notice of Appeal must be submitted within 15 days from the delivery of judgement. Both the defendant and the prosecutor have the right to appeal and has the right to bring new evidences.</p>

<h3>Reaching the end of your sentence</h3>

<h4>What provision is there for reduction of sentence (remission) e.g. for good behaviour?</h4>

<p>Extenuating and aggravating circumstances can be considered that may reduce your sentence. These include good character before the arrest, great threat or pressure leading to the offence, or demonstrating sincere repentance.</p>

<h4>What provision is there for early release e.g. on parole?</h4>

<p>Good character and/or sincere repentance could be reasons for early release. The court may also ask the detainee to reconcile with the victim and/or their family so that they may have early release.</p>

<h4>What provision is there for clemency or pardon?</h4>

<p>Only the Head of State, in special circumstances, can grant a pardon.</p>

<h4>What about any financial penalties?</h4>

<p>Financial penalties can be imposed as an alternative, or in addition, to imprisonment. The law provides the limit of financial penalty depending on the offence and courts should not exceed the limit.</p>

<h4>Is transfer to another prison within Eritrea possible?</h4>

<p>It may be possible to transfer to another prison, if the prison authorities agree to do so, but we are not aware of this happening.</p>

<h4>Is transfer to the UK a possibility?</h4>

<p>There is no Prisoner Transfer Agreement between Eritrea and the UK.</p>

<h4>What are the procedures for release and deportation?</h4>

<p>At the end of your sentence you will be released from Prison. It is not common practice to deport a foreigner for criminal acts, however, if you are subject to deportation and registered with Prisoners Abroad, they can provide support and advice regarding your return to the UK.</p>

<h4>Will I have a criminal record in the UK?</h4>

<p>We will not normally pass on information about your case to a third party without your consent. However, if you’re arrested for certain serious offences, such as child sex abuse or drugs crimes, our staff must tell other relevant UK authorities. It is therefore possible that information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4: additional information</h2>

<h3>Prisoners Abroad</h3>

<p>Since 1978 Prisoners Abroad has offered practical support and advice to British citizens imprisoned overseas. It is the only UK charity providing this service and it is available to all, whether guilty or innocent, convicted or awaiting charge or trial. Prisoners Abroad is concerned with your health and welfare, both during your imprisonment and on your return to the UK. They can also provide support and advice to your family during your imprisonment. In order to access any services, prisoners must first register with Prisoners Abroad by signing and returning their authorisation form.</p>

<p>Once you seek help from Prisoners Abroad, the Prisoner &amp; Family Support Service will be your point of contact for advice and information. The type of assistance they can offer will vary from country to country, but generally they can provide you with information, in English, on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your rights as a prisoner and issues that may affect you such as health or transfer to the UK</li>
  <li>obtaining magazines, newspapers, books and the regular Prisoners Abroad newsletter</li>
  <li>learning the language of your country of imprisonment</li>
  <li>translation of documents</li>
  <li>grants for food, essential medicines and toiletries, if you are in a developing country and don’t have funds from other sources</li>
  <li>preparing for release</li>
  <li>help for your loved ones, including information, family support groups and, in a few cases, assistance with the cost of visiting</li>
</ul>
