<p>The primary guidance to assist landlords, letting agents and tenants when carrying out right to rent checks is the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/right-to-rent-landlords-code-of-practice">Code of practice on right to rent: civil penalty scheme for landlords and their agents</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/landlords-guide-to-right-to-rent-checks#other-steps">Landlord’s guide to right to rent checks</a>, where the list of acceptable documents can be found.</p>

<p>This document contains a visual guide to the types of immigration documents which can be presented by a tenant and accepted by a landlord or letting agent to satisfy a manual right to rent check. There is an FAQ section for landlords and tenants to address some common queries.</p>

<p>Landlords should conduct right to rent checks in a fair, justifiable and consistent manner, regardless as to whether they believe the tenant to be British, settled or a person with time-limited permission to be in the UK. Further information on avoiding discrimination is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/right-to-rent-landlords-code-of-practice">Code of practice for landlords: avoiding unlawful discrimination when conducting ‘right to rent’ checks in the private rented residential sector</a>.</p>

<h2>Conducting a manual document based right to rent check</h2>

<p>For further information about the steps required to establish a statutory excuse against liability for a civil penalty when checking physical documents, this is detailed in the Landlord’s guide to right to rent checks, available on GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>Digital evidence of immigration status</h2>

<p>Individuals who have been provided with digital status via an eVisa can only prove their right to rent using the Home Office online service on GOV.UK: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/prove-right-to-rent">Prove your right to rent in England</a>. To obtain a statutory excuse against a civil penalty when conducting an online check, landlords and letting agents must use: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/view-right-to-rent">View a tenant’s right to rent in England</a> side of the service on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Individuals using the service will generate a 9-character long share code that can be passed on to a landlord, which, when entered alongside the individual’s date of birth, enables the landlord to access their right to rent information.</p>

<p>The share code will be valid for 90 days from the point it has been issued and can be used as many times as needed within that time.</p>

<p>Share codes can only be used for the purpose they were originally selected for. All status share codes begin with a letter denoting the purpose the share code can be used for. Where a share code begins with the letter ‘R’, this will indicate that the share code has been generated by a tenant to evidence their right to rent. Landlords will not be able to accept or use share codes which begin with the letter ‘W’ or ‘S’ as these are designed for other services.</p>

<h2>Updates to this user guide</h2>

<p>This version of Right to rent checks: a user guide for tenants and landlords updates that issued on 3 September 2021.</p>

<p>The most significant update to this document relates to the changes in the way in which Biometric Residence Permits and Cards (BRP &amp; BRC) and Frontier Worker Permit (FWP) holders evidence their right to rent. Since 6 April 2022, they need to evidence their right to rent using the Home Office online service only.</p>

<p>Landlords can no longer accept or check a physical BRP, BRC or FWP as valid proof of right to rent, even if it shows a later expiry date.</p>

<p>BRPs, BRCs and FWPs have been removed from the lists of acceptable documents used to conduct a manual right to rent check.</p>

<p>Retrospective checks will not be required on biometric card holders who, before 6 April 2022, used their physical card to demonstrate their right to rent. Landlords will maintain a statutory excuse against liability for a civil penalty if the initial check was undertaken in line with the guidance that applied at the time the check was made.</p>

<h2>Acceptable immigration documents which prove a time-limited right to rent</h2>

<h3>A current passport or other ‘travel document’ endorsed to show that the holder is allowed to stay in the UK for a time-limited period</h3>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="&quot;&quot;" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147927/8.gif"></div></figure>

<p>What to look for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the photograph should be a true likeness of the holder</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the date of birth on the passport should be credible and consistent with any other instance of when the holder has provided their date of birth</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the passport should not appear to obviously have been tampered with</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the passport should contain an expiry date, and must be current</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the holder has a different name on the passport, it should only be accepted if there is a further supporting document which explains this (e.g. a marriage or deed-poll certificate). In these circumstances this document should be copied too</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the passport should clearly explain that the holder has leave to be in the UK for a limited time, and show the date that leave expires</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the individual provides this document, you should take a copy of the pages of the passport which contain the document expiry date, nationality, date of birth, signature, leave expiry date, biometric details, photograph and any page containing information indicating that the holder has an entitlement to enter or remain in the UK. You should retain the copies with a record of the date on which the check was made.</p>

<p>Endorsements can come in a number of different forms within a passport or travel document. A ‘travel document’ is a passport-type document issued by a government to somebody in lieu of a passport from their home nation.</p>

<p>If you conduct a check of this document in the correct manner as outlined here and in the Landlord’s guide to right to rent checks, you will establish a time-limited statutory excuse against liability for a civil penalty and you will need to carry out a repeat check before your statutory excuse expires. This time-limited statutory excuse lasts either 12 months, or until the expiry of the person’s permission to be in the UK, or until the expiry of the validity of the Home Office document which evidences their right to be in the UK, whichever is later.</p>

<h3>A document issued by the Bailiwick of Jersey, Bailiwick of Guernsey or the Isle of Man (UK Crown Dependencies) showing that the holder has been granted pre-settled (limited permission to stay) status, verified as valid by the Landlord Checking Service</h3>

<p>What to look for:</p>

<ul>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jersey issue a letter and operate an immigration status checker service for individuals to obtain confirmation of their status at any point. The results will go to their own email address, which they can present to you.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You are required to verify this document with the Landlord Checking Service via the form on GOV.UK or via telephone on 0300 790 6268.</p>

<p>If the individual provides this document, you should take a copy of each page. You should retain the copies with a record of the date on which the check was made.</p>

<p>You should retain the copy of the document from the UK Crown Dependency with the response from the LCS and record the date on which the check was made.</p>

<h3>A current immigration status document issued by the Home Office to the holder with a valid endorsement indicating that the named person may stay in the UK for a time-limited period</h3>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="&quot;&quot;" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147928/9.jpg"></div></figure>

This time-limited statutory excuse lasts either 12 months, or until the expiry of the person’s permission to be in the UK, or until the expiry of the validity of the Home Office document which evidences their right to be in the UK, whichever is later.</p>

<h3>A Certificate of Application (non-digital) issued by the Home Office showing that the holder has made an application to the UK EU Settlement Scheme, on or after 1 July</h3>

<p>Individuals with an outstanding valid application to the EU Settlement Scheme are issued with a Certificate of Application (CoA). Where an individual has been issued with a CoA, you should firstly establish whether this is a ‘digital’ or ‘non-digital’ CoA. Where the individual has a digital CoA, you must conduct an online check and do not need to check any physical documentation.</p>

<p>If the individual provides this document, you should take a copy of each page. You should retain the copies with a record of the date on which the check was made.</p>

<p>If the individual has a non-digital CoA, this will be in the form of an email or letter. You are required to verify this document with the Landlord Checking Service via <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eforms.homeoffice.gov.uk/outreach/lcs-application.ofml" rel="external">the form</a> on GOV.UK or via telephone on 0300 790 6268.</p>

  <li>
    <p>the date of birth on the document should be credible and consistent with any other instance of when the holder has provided their date of birth</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the document should not appear to obviously have been tampered with</p>

  <li>
    <p>the date of birth on the document should be credible and consistent with any other instance of when the holder has provided their date of birth</p>
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the tenant provides this document, you should take a copy of the front and back. You should retain the copies with a record of the date on which the check was made.</p>

<p>If you conduct a check of this document in the correct manner as outlined here and in the Landlord’s guide to right to rent checks, you will establish a continuous statutory excuse against a civil penalty, and you will not need to carry out any further right to rent checks, providing there is no change to the tenancy agreement.</p>

<h2>Annex A: Frequently Asked Questions for landlords and agents</h2>

<h3>I need help with carrying out a right to rent check, who should I contact?</h3>

<p>You should call the Landlord Helpline if you need help with a check on 0300 790 6268, Monday to Thursday, 9am to 4:45pm Friday, 9am to 4:30pm.</p>

<h3>My prospective tenant has presented me with a passport which contains an endorse ment allowing them to stay in the UK for a short period of time. They told me that they have longer leave in the United Kingdom and that they have to obtain a biometric immigration document to evidence this. What should I do?</h3>

<p>Whilst we encourage individuals to collect their biometric residence permit (BRP) before entering into a tenancy agreement we recognise that this is not always possible. If an individual is due to enter into a tenancy agreement before they collect their BRP then you are able to accept the short duration vignette in their passport as proof of their right to rent. You should ensure that the vignette is still valid (that the expiration date has not passed) and follow the manual check process. This will provide you with a statutory excuse for 12 months.</p>

<p>Once the individual has collected their BRP you may wish to conduct a further check which will provide you with a statutory excuse for the duration of their leave.</p>

<h3>Do I have to employ somebody else to carry out document checks if I am not an expert?</h3>

<p>No. You only have to be satisfied that the documents which you are checking seem genuine. You can make an arrangement with an agent who can carry out checks on your behalf. Anyone who is given a false document will only be liable for a civil penalty if it is reasonably apparent it is false.</p>

<h3>How can I check the identity of people who cover their face for reasons of belief?</h3>

<p>Individuals should be asked to show their face to check that it matches their facial image on their documents. Scarves which cover the hair need not be removed. Those carrying out the check should offer the opportunity for the prospective tenant to show their face in a private area and/or in the presence of a female.</p>

<h3>My tenant has guests staying with them. Do I need to carry out right to rent checks on them?</h3>

<p>House guests, such as friends or family members, will not ordinarily be treated as an ‘occupier’ under the Scheme because a guest will generally not be living in the accommodation as their only or main home. A landlord should make reasonable enquiries at the time the residential tenancy is entered into (including when it is renewed or varied) and make an assessment based on those enquiries as to whether someone will be living on the premises as their only or main home.</p>

<p>Where a person is living in accommodation as their only or main home and is paying rent to another occupier, they may be regarded as having entered into their own residential tenancy agreement with that occupier (as a sub-tenant or licensee) and it will fall to that occupier to carry out the right to rent checks.</p>

<h3>My tenant has brought someone into the property as their only or main home and is receiving rent. Do I nee d to carry out right to rent check on them?</h3>

<p>Your tenant will be responsible for the checks for anybody they enter into a separate subletting or licensee arrangement with.</p>

<h3>My prospective tenant is a student who is coming to the UK and wishes to arrange his tenancy from overseas. What do I do?</h3>

<p>You can agree a tenancy in principle and then check the tenant’s documents in person when they arrive in the UK. You may wish to see the tenant via live video link before agreeing the tenancy in principle. However, this does not negate the need for you to check the tenant’s documents in person once they arrive in the UK. Recent arrivals to the UK should have evidence of a right to rent through the documents they used to enter the country.</p>

<p>Further information on carrying out right to rent checks on students can be found in the Landlord’s guide to right to rent checks.</p>

<h3>My prospective tenant has provided me with an EUSS Certificate of Application (CoA), stating that they have an outstanding application with the Home Office. Can I accept this as part of a right to rent check?</h3>

<p>Yes. If your prospective tenant has a digital CoA ask your them for a share code, you can then use the GOV.UK online service ‘view a tenant’s right to rent in England’ to check their right to rent. If only have a non-digital CoA then you must check the CoA via the Landlord Checking Service to obtain a Positive Right to Rent Notice (PRRN) confirming their right to rent. You must make a copy the CoA and the PRRN to have statutory excuse against liability for a civil penalty.</p>

<h3>How will an EEA citizen be able to satisfy a right to rent check without physical documentary proof of their status?</h3>

<p>EEA citizens and their family members who have made a successful application to the EU Settlement Scheme, or the points-based system will have been provided an eVisa. They will use the Home Office right to rent service to prove their right to rent.</p>

<h3>What is the Home Office online service?</h3>

<p>The Home Office online right to rent service offers a simple way to check someone’s right to rent digitally, without needing to check a physical document.</p>

<p>The individual will provide you with a share code and you must check their details using the online service on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>Are retrospective checks required on EEA citizens who began renting on or before 30 June 2021?</h3>

<p>No. Landlords will maintain a continuous statutory excuse against a civil penalty if the initial check was undertaken in line with legislation and published guidance at the time.</p>

<h3>I have found out my tenant has not made an application to the EU Settlement Scheme do I have to evict them?</h3>

<p>No, encourage them to make an application. To maintain your statutory excuse against a civil penalty you <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eforms.homeoffice.gov.uk/outreach/lcs-reporting.ofml" rel="external">must make a report to the Home Office</a> via GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>Can I still carry out COVID-19 adjusted checks on my tenants?</h3>

<p>Yes, the temporary changes to right to rent checks made on 30 March 2020 remain in place until 30 September 2022 (inclusive). This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Checks can be carried out over video calls</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tenants can send scanned documents or a photo of documents for checks using email or a mobile app, rather than sending originals</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Landlords should use the Home Office Landlord Checking Service if a prospective or existing tenant cannot provide any of the accepted documents</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Further guidance relating to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-landlord-right-to-rent-checks">COVID-19 temporary adjusted checks</a> can be found on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>If you are planning on proving your right to rent by presenting your landlord with documents from list A or B, it is advisable to have the relevant documents ready before you begin looking for a property.</p>

<h3>How can I prove my right to rent?</h3>

<p>There are three types of right to rent checks; a manual document-based check, a right to rent heck using Identity Verification Technology (IDVT) via the services of an identity service provider (IDSP) or an online check via the Home Office online right to rent checking service.</p>

<p>If you have a valid British or Irish passport, or Irish passport card, you and your landlord or letting agent can choose to use IDVT via the services of an IDSP to check the validity of the document and that it belongs to the person claiming it.</p>

<p>It will not be possible to prove your right to rent using the online checking service in all circumstances, as not all individuals will have an immigration status that can be checked online at this stage. In these circumstances you should prove your right to rent by presenting your landlord with your documents.</p>

<p>If you have a Biometric Residence Permit, a Biometric Residence Card, status under the EU Settlement Scheme or have been granted status digitally via an eVisa, you can only evidence your right to rent using the online checking service.</p>

<h3>My landlord has asked for a follow-up check. Do I need to do this?</h3>

<p>Yes. Your landlord is required by law to carry out a follow-up check if you had a time-limited right to be in the UK when your initial check was carried out. You are required to comply with your landlord’s request for a follow up check.</p>

<h3>I have had my passport and/or other identity documents stolen. How can I satisfy a right to rent check?</h3>

<p>If your passport or biometric immigration document has been stolen, a letter from a UK police force confirming that you have been the victim of a crime and have reported your passport as stolen, stating the crime reference number, which has been issued in the last three months, can be used as part of the evidence of your right to rent. This must be accompanied by another document from list A group 2.</p>

<h3>I have recently been released from prison and have not been able to acquire any standard type of identity documentation. How can I satisfy a right to rent check?</h3>

<p>You can use a number of documents in combination to prove your right to rent. These can include letters from HM Prisons, and the probation services.

This should be used in combination with another document, however, there are a variety you can use including letters from a UK government department, local authority, or benefits paperwork. A full list of documents which can be used in combination in order to satisfy a right to rent check are detailed at the front of this document.</p>
