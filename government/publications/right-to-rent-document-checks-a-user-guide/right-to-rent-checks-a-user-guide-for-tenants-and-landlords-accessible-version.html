<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document is designed to assist both tenants and landlords and agents (landlords) when carrying out right to rent checks. It should be read in conjunction with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/right-to-rent-landlords-code-of-practice">Code of Practice on Right to Rent: civil penalty scheme for landlords</a> and their agents and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/landlords-guide-to-right-to-rent-checks">Landlord’s Guide to Right to Rent Checks</a>.</p>

<p>This document contains a visual guide to the types of document which can be presented by a tenant and accepted by a landlord to satisfy a manual right to rent check. There is also an FAQ section for both tenants and landlords to address some common queries.</p>

<p>Detailed information on the Right to Rent Scheme can be found in the code of practice and Landlord’s Guide, where landlords can also find information on how to carry out checks using the Home Office online service. These are available on GOV.UK at:</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/landlords-immigration-right-to-rent-checks">Landlords: immigration right to rent checks</a></p>

<p>Landlords who let private property in England or take in lodgers could be liable for a civil penalty if they enter into a tenancy agreement with someone without a right to rent. If a landlord carries out the checks and retains copies as required, they will have a statutory excuse against such a penalty. Landlords can arrange for an agent to carry out checks on their behalf if a written agreement exists between them.</p>

<p>It is important a prospective or existing tenant understands what documents to provide or how to use the Home Office online service to prove their right to rent. This will make the process of renting a property easier for both the tenant and the landlord.</p>

<p>Landlords should conduct right to rent checks in a fair, justifiable and consistent manner, regardless as to whether they believe the tenant to be British, settled or a person with limited permission to be in the UK. More information on avoiding discrimination is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/right-to-rent-landlords-code-of-practice">Code of Practice for Landlords Avoiding unlawful discrimination when conducting ‘right to rent’ checks in the private rented residential sector</a>.</p>

<p>The criminal offence of knowingly letting to a disqualified person is for the most serious cases. It is not intended for landlords who have simply made a mistake when complying with the Right to Rent Scheme. In the most serious cases, prosecution may be considered where it is deemed the appropriate response to the noncompliance encountered.</p>

<h3>Right to rent checks on EEA citizens from 1 July 2021</h3>

<p>Since 1 July 2021, EEA citizens and their family members require immigration status in the UK. To prove their right to rent they can no longer rely on an EEA passport or national identity card, which only confirms their nationality. They are required to provide evidence of lawful immigration status in the UK, in the same way as other foreign nationals. The only Introduction 3 exception to this is Irish citizens, who continue to have a continuous right to rent. They can prove their right to rent using their passport or passport card, as listed in this user guide.</p>

<h3>Digital evidence of immigration status</h3>

<p>Individuals who have been provided with digital evidence of their immigration status, via an eVisa, can only prove their right to rent using the Home Office online service <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/prove-right-to-rent">Prove your right to rent in England</a> available on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>This includes those who have made a successful application to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS); or,</li>
  <li>the points-based system.</li>
</ul>

<p>To obtain a statutory excuse against a civil penalty landlords must use the online service <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/view-right-to-rent">View a tenants right to rent in England</a> available on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Where an individual holds another form of immigration leave in the UK and they have a current Biometric Residence Permit or Card they may also be able use the online right to rent service.</p>

<p>This version of ‘Right to Rent Checks: A user guide for tenants and landlords’ updates that issued on 1 July 2021.</p>

<p>Futher information about the latest changes can be found at Annex C, in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/landlords-immigration-right-to-rent-checks">The Landlords Guide to Right to Rent Checks</a> which is available on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>The changes relate to the way in which those with outstanding EUSS applications evidence their right to rent. Landlords will obtain a statutory excuse against liability for a civil penalty if the check undertaken is as set out in the guidance issued on 31 August 2021, which is inclusive of these changes.</p>

<p><strong>List B document 5</strong> has been amended to remove reference to ‘on or before 30 June 2021’, and to include the ‘Isle of Man’ and ‘together with a Positive Right to Rent Notice issued by the Landlord Checking Service’</p>

<p><strong>List B, document 11</strong> is an additional entry.</p>

<p>A passport or national identity card showing that the holder is a national of the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland.</p>

<h3>To carry out a manual or digital right to rent check, the landlord must:</h3>

<p>1. <strong>Obtain</strong> either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a tenant’s original documents or,</li>
  <li>a ‘share code’ for the online service from the tenant for a digital check</li>
</ul>

<p>2. <strong>Check</strong> either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the document with the tenant present for a manual check or,</li>
  <li>Go to <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/view-right-to-rent">View a tenant’s right to rent</a> and enter the ‘share code’ along with the person’s date of birth for a digital check.</li>
</ul>

<p>3. <strong>Record and retain</strong> evidence of the check.</p>

<p>If a prospective or existing tenant has an ongoing application, appeal or administrative review with the Home Office, or if they state that they have permission to rent from the Home Office, the landlord should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eforms.homeoffice.gov.uk/outreach/lcs-application.ofml" rel="external">use this form to contact the Landlord Checking Service (LCS)</a> to check if they can rent.</p>

<p>If the landlord has problems accessing the form or needs help completing it, the Landlord Helpline on 0300 790 6268 can help. The landlord will receive a response from the Landlord Checking Service within two days.</p>

<h3>Conducting an online right to rent check using the Home Office online service</h3>

<p>Where an individual has access to the online service right to rent checks can be conducted using the ‘View a tenant’s right to rent in England’ page on GOV.UK to obtain a statutory excuse against a penalty when conducting a right to rent check.</p>

<p>It is not possible to conduct a Home Office online check in all circumstances, as not all people will have an immigration status that can be checked online at this time.</p>

<p>Landlords will be able to undertake an online right to rent check, in real time, for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a current biometric residence permit;</li>
  <li>a current biometric residence card;</li>
  <li>a current frontier worker permit card;</li>
  <li>status issued digitally, via an eVisa, under the EU Settlement Scheme;</li>
  <li>a digital Certificate of Application to the EU Settlement Scheme issued on or before 30 June 2021</li>
  <li>status issued digitally, via an eVisa, under the points-based immigration system; and</li>
</ul>

<p>The online service allows checks to be carried out by video call. Landlords do not need to see physical documents as the 7 right to rent information is provided in real time, directly from Home Office systems. The service works on the basis of the individual first viewing their own Home Office right to rent record.</p>

<p>They may then share this information with the landlord, by providing a ‘share code’ which, when entered alongside the individual’s date of birth, enables the landlord to access the information.</p>

<p>Some individuals can evidence their right to rent either by using the Home Office online service or via the list of acceptable documents. In such cases, landlords cannot insist that they use the online service, and whilst they may encourage use of the online check and support a person in doing so (for example, by providing access to hardware and the internet), they cannot discriminate against those who present acceptable documents. To do so is against the law.</p>

<p>For further information about how to conduct an online right to rent check, please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/landlords-guide-to-right-to-rent-checks">Landlord’s Guide to Right to Rent Checks</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>Lists of acceptable documents</h2>

<p><strong>Changes have been made to List B.</strong></p>

<p>List B document 5 has been amended to remove reference to ‘on or before 30 June 2021’, and to include ‘Isle of Man’ and ‘together with a Positive Right to Rent Notice issued by the Landlord Checking Service’.</p>

<p>List B, document 11 is an additional entry.</p>

<p>These changes take effect with this guidance and will be amended in upcoming legislation.</p>

<p><strong>The landlord will obtain a statutory excuse against liability for a civil penalty if the check they undertake is as set out in the guidance issued on 31 August 2021 which includes the use of the amended, and additional, document.</strong></p>

<p>A current passport or other ‘travel document’ endorsed to show that the holder is allowed to stay in the UK for a time-limited period.</p>

<p>If the tenant provides this document then the landlord should take a copy of the pages of the passport which contain the document expiry date, nationality, date of birth, signature, leave expiry date, biometric details, photograph and also any page containing information indicating that the holder has an entitlement to enter or remain in the UK. The landlord should retain the copies with a record of the date on which the check is made.</p>

<p>If the landlord does this then they will establish a time-limited statutory excuse against a penalty. The landlord should carry out a repeat check before their statutory excuse expires. This time-limited statutory excuse lasts either for 12 months or until expiry of the person’s permission to be in the UK, or until expiry of the validity of the Home Office document which evidences their right to be in the UK, whichever is later.</p>

<p>What to look for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Endorsements can come in a number of different forms within a passport or travel document. Landlords should check what is written on them, and that they have not obviously been tampered with.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>The photograph should be a true likeness of the holder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The date of birth on the passport should be credible and consistent with any other instance of when the holder has provided their date of birth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The passport should not appear to obviously have been tampered with.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The passport should contain an expiry date, and must be current.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the holder has a different name on the passport, it should only be accepted if there is a further supporting document which explains this (i.e. a marriage or deed-poll certificate). In these circumstances this document should be copied too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The passport should clearly explain that the holder has leave to be in the UK for a limited time, and show the date that leave expires.</p>

  <li>
    <p>A ‘travel document’ is a passport-type document issued by a government to somebody in lieu of a passport from their home nation.</p>

<p>A Certificate of Application (digital or non-digital) issued by the Home Office showing that the holder has made an application for to the UK EU Settlement Scheme, on or after 1 July 2021.</p>

<p>Individuals with an outstanding valid application to the EUSS, are issued a Certificate of Application (CoA). Where an individual has been issued with a Certificate of Application (CoA), the landlord must establish whether this is a digital or non-digital CoA and must retain evidence of the check (hardcopy or electronic).</p>

<p><strong>Digital</strong> - a digital CoA is provided electronically and the tenant will access this via the online service. They will provide the landlord with a share code to access the online service <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/view-right-to-rent">View a tenant’s right to rent in England</a>. This will confirm the individual’s right to rent, for twelve months from the date of the check. If the landlord carries out the check in this way they will establish a time-limited statutory excuse against a penalty.</p>

<p><strong>Non-digital</strong> - a ‘non-digital’ CoA is an email or letter sent to the applicant. Where a prospective tenant provides a non-digital CoA, the landlord must make a copy of this document and retain this copy, together with a Positive Right to Rent Notice (PRRN) from the Landlord Checking Service (LCS). In doing so the landlord will have a statutory excuse for twelve months from the date stated on the PRRN.</p>

<p>Should a non-digital CoA dated on or before 30 June 2021 be provided, the landlord should ask the prospective tenant to check if they have also been issued with a digital CoA. If they have, they should provide a share code to verify their right to rent via the online service instead. If they have not, the landlord must verify the non-digital CoA via an LCS check.</p>

<p>There are a small number of individuals who made their EUSS application using a paper application. Due to the postage and processing time related to paper applications the landlord may be required to undertake a check before they receive their Certificate of Application.</p>

<p>If an individual presents a letter or email notification acknowledging receipt of the EUSS application made on or before 30 June 2021, the landlord must request a right to rent check from the LCS, using the online form ‘request a Home Office right to rent check’ on GOV.UK at:</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://eforms.homeoffice.gov.uk/outreach/lcs-application.ofml" rel="external">Request a Home Office right to rent check</a></p>

<h2>FAQs for landlords or agents</h2>

<h4>I need help with carrying out a right to rent check, who should I contact?</h4>

<p>You should call the Landlord Helpline if you need help with a check on 0300 790 6268, Monday to Thursday, 9am to 4:45pm Friday, 9am to 4:30pm.</p>

<h4>My prospective tenant has presented me with a passport which contains an endorsement allowing them to stay in the UK for a short period of time. He/she tells me that they have longer leave in the United Kingdom and that they have to obtain a biometric immigration document to evidence this. What should I do?</h4>

<p>Whilst we encourage individuals to collect their biometric residence permit (BRP) before entering into a tenancy agreement we recognise that this is not always possible. If an individual is due to enter into a tenancy agreement before they collect their BRP then you are able to accept the short duration vignette in their passport as proof of their right to rent. You should ensure that the vignette is still valid (that the expiration date has not passed) and follow the manual check process. This will provide you with a statutory excuse for 12 months. Once the individual has collected their BRP you may wish to conduct a further check which will provide you with a statutory excuse for the duration of their leave.</p>

<h4>Do I have to employ somebody else to carry out document checks if I am not an expert?</h4>

<p>No. You only have to be satisfied that the documents which you are checking seem genuine. You can make an arrangement with an agent who can carry out checks on your behalf. Anyone who is given a false document will only be liable for a civil penalty if it is reasonably apparent it is false.</p>

<h4>How can I check the identity of people who cover their face for reasons of belief?</h4>

<p>Individuals should be asked to show their face to check that it matches their facial image on their documents. Scarves which cover the hair need not be removed. Those carrying out the check should offer the opportunity for the prospective tenant to show their face in a private area and/or in the presence of a female.</p>

<h4>My tenant has guests staying with them. Do I need to carry out right to rent checks on them?</h4>

<p>House guests, such as friends or family members, will not ordinarily be treated as an ‘occupier’ under the Scheme because a guest will generally not be living in the accommodation as their only or main home. A landlord should make reasonable enquiries at the time the residential tenancy is entered into (including when it is renewed or varied) and make an assessment based on those enquiries as to whether someone will be living on the premises as their only or main home.</p>

<p>Where a person is living in accommodation as their only or main home and is paying rent to another occupier, they may be regarded as having entered into their own residential tenancy agreement with that occupier (as a sub-tenant or licensee) and it will fall to that occupier to carry out the right to rent checks.</p>

<h4>My tenant has brought someone into the property as their only or main home and is receiving rent. Do I need to carry out right to rent check on them?</h4>

<p>Your tenant will be responsible for the checks for anybody they enter into a separate subletting or licensee arrangement with.</p>

<h4>My prospective tenant is a student who is coming to the UK and wishes to arrange his tenancy from overseas. What do I do?</h4>

<p>You can agree a tenancy in principle and then check the tenant’s documents in person when they arrive in the UK. You may wish to see the tenant via live video link before agreeing the tenancy in principle. However, this does not negate the need for you to check the tenant’s documents in person once they arrive in the UK. Recent arrivals to the UK should have evidence of a right to rent through the documents they used to enter the country. Further information on carrying out right to rent checks on students can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/landlords-guide-to-right-to-rent-checks">Landlord’s guide to right to rent checks</a>.</p>

<h4>My prospective tenant has provided me with an EUSS Certificate of Application (CoA), stating that they have an outstanding application with the Home Office. Can I accept this as part of a right to rent check?</h4>

<p>Yes. If your prospective tenant has a digital CoA ask your them for a share code, you can then use the GOV.UK online service ‘view a tenants right to rent in England’ to check their right to rent. If only have a non digital CoA then you must check the CoA via the Landlord Checking Service to obtain a Positive Right to Rent Notice (PRRN) confirming their right to rent. You must make a copy the CoA and the PRRN to have statutory excuse against liability for a civil penalty.</p>

<h4>How will an EEA citizen be able to satisfy a right to rent check without physical documentary proof of their status?</h4>

<p>Since 1 July 2021, EEA ctizens who have made a successful application to the EU Settlement Scheme, or the points-based system will have been provided with digital evidence of their immigration status (known as an eVisa). They will use the Home Office right to rent service to prove their right to rent. The online right to rent service is simple, secure, free to use and enables checks to be carried out via video call. Landlords do not need to check physical documents as an individual’s status information is provided in real time directly from Home Office systems.</p>

<h4>What is the Home Office online service?</h4>

<p>The Home Office <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/view-right-to-rent">online right to rent service</a> offers a simple way to check someone’s right to rent digitally, without needing to check a physical document.</p>

<p>The individual will provide you with a share code and you must check their details using the online service on GOV.UK</p>

<h4>Are retrospective checks required on EEA citizens who began renting on or before 30 June 2021?</h4>

<p>No. There is no requirement for retrospective checks to be undertaken on EEA citizens who began renting on or before 30 June 2021. Landlords will maintain a continuous statutory excuse against a civil penalty if the initial check was undertaken in line with legislation and published guidance at the time.</p>

<h4>I have found out my tenant has not made an application to the EU Settlement Scheme do I have to evict them?</h4>

<p>No, encourage them to make an application. To maintain your statutory excuse against a civil penalty you must make a report to the Home Office via GOV.UK:</p>

<h4>Can I still carry out COVID-19 adjusted checks on my tenants?</h4>

<p>Yes, the temporary changes to right to rent checks made on 30 March 2020 remain in place until 5 April 2022 (inclusive). This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Checks can currently be carried out over video calls</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tenants can send scanned documents or a photo of documents for checks using email or a mobile app, rather than sending originals</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Landlords should use the Home Office Landlord Checking Service if a prospective or existing tenant cannot provide any of the accepted documents</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Further guidance relating to the COVID-19 temporary adjusted checks can be found on GOV.UK at:

<h2>FAQs for tenants</h2>

<p>If you are planning on proving your right to rent by presenting your landlord with documents from list A or B, it is advisable to have the relevant documents ready before you begin looking for a property.</p>

<p>Dear &lt; Lead tenant’s name &gt;</p>

<p>Prospective tenancy of  &lt; prospective address in full &gt;</p>

<p>We have worked with you in order to arrange your tenancy of the above property.</p>

<p>In most cases, upon letting a property in the private rented sector, a landlord should carry out right to rent checks on each adult living at that property. These are simple document checks, and this letter can be used towards satisfying such a check <strong>when used in combination with another acceptable document</strong>.</p>

<p>[In your case, you intend to use &lt; insert name of document &gt; along with this letter in order to satisfy the right to rent check. We believe that this should be acceptable under the code of practice for the Scheme, however, it is the landlord or agent who must carry out the check.]</p>

<p>A simple, interactive guide around which documents are accepted in Right to Rent checks is available on GOV.UK, here:</p>
