<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Why are the security officer and door supervisor courses a day longer than they were?</h3>
<p>There are more practical assessments in the new content, which take longer. Everyone will need to do at least 1 physical search. We have added more content including personal safety, knowledge of physical intervention for security officers, and knowledge of door supervision equipment for door supervisors. We have taken out any repeated content.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Why have we included more practical assessments?</h3>
<p>We wanted to make the assessment more rigorous. That is why we have included more practical elements such as searching.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>How much will the new training cost?</h3>
<p>Training providers will determine the costs. We do not set the costs of training.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span>What role has the private security industry played in developing the new licence-linked qualifications?</h3>
<p>The private security industry played a fundamental role in developing the new qualifications. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we conducted robust research within the industry on skills</li>
  <li>front line industry experts drafted the specifications</li>
  <li>we did 2 rounds of public consultation on all of the draft qualification specifications. We had over 6,000 responses to our consultations, which were mostly from licence holders.</li>
</ul>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#top-up-advance">How far in advance of my renewal date can I complete the top-up training?</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Who needs to do the top-up training?</h3>
<p>We explain this on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/changes-to-the-training-you-need-for-an-sia-licence">Changes to the training you need for an SIA licence</a> page.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>When do I need to do top-up training?</h3>
<p>We explain this on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/changes-to-the-training-you-need-for-an-sia-licence">Changes to the training you need for an SIA licence</a> page.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>How long will it take to do the top-up training?</h3>
<p>It depends on which licence you want to apply for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Door supervisor = 2 days</li>
  <li>Security guard = 0.5 days</li>
</ul>

<p>In both cases you will need to complete first aid training (Emergency First at Work or equivalent) before you take the top-up training. The first aid training is 1 day.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>What is included in the top-up training?</h3>
<p>An Emergency First Aid at Work qualification (or equivalent) must be completed before taking the top-up training.</p>

<p>Door supervisors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use of equipment</li>
  <li>updated terror threat awareness</li>
  <li>physical intervention skills refresher training (knowledge and practical)</li>
  <li>knowledge around critical incidents eg. where to access government guidance on pandemic responses</li>
</ul>

<p>Security guards:</p>

<ul>
  <li>knowledge of physical intervention</li>
  <li>updated terror threat awareness</li>
  <li>knowledge around critical incidents eg. where to access government guidance on pandemic responses</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>How much will the top-up training cost?</h3>
<p>Training providers will determine the costs. We do not set the costs of training.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span>Why do I need to do top-up training?</h3>
<p>The private security industry is increasingly recognised as providing an important role in the protection of the public. This recognition brings scrutiny, and it is more important than ever that the industry maintains and improves its standards.</p>

<p>We have updated our qualifications to reflect the current risks that a licensed security operative may come across in their work. It is important that all licence holders have the knowledge and skills to deal with common risks, especially in safety critical areas.</p>

<p>A key element of our role as the regulator is to work with the industry to raise standards in private security. The new requirements will help to achieve this.</p>

<p>The new licence-linked qualifications and top-up training reflect what we have learned from extensive research, consultation, and engagement. This took into account the views of approximately 6,000 respondents, and also included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>views from front line staff and security businesses on working practices, environments, and emerging technology</li>
  <li>input from the National Counter Terrorism Security Office and the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure to develop counter terrorism training</li>
  <li>advice from experts in specialist areas like physical intervention</li>
  <li>recommendations from coronerâs inquests following deaths involving security operatives</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.7 </span>How will trainers deliver top-up training? Will the training be via e-learning or practical?</h3>
<p>You can do the training using a range of options: face-to-face, self-study, or within a virtual classroom.</p>

<p>For the door supervision top-up training, the practical elements of the physical intervention unit can only be taught face-to-face.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.8 </span>Do I have to have the first aid training before I do my door supervisor or security guard top-up training?</h3>
<p>Yes. From 1 April you must complete Emergency First Aid at Work training, or the equivalent, before taking a new licence-linked qualification. From 1 October this also applies to those taking top-up training.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.9 </span>How will the top-up training be assessed?</h3>
<p>The security guard top-up training will be assessed by 2 exams (security guarding knowledge and terror threat awareness). The door supervisor top-up training will be assessed by 3 exams (door supervisor knowledge, terror threat awareness and physical intervention knowledge) plus a practical physical intervention assessment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.10 </span>How far in advance of my renewal date can I complete the top-up training?</h3>
<p>Top-up training for door supervisors and security guards will be available from 1 April 2021. You can renew your licence 4 months before your existing licence expires.</p>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#first-aid-cp">Will the first aid requirement of the close protection qualification remain the same?</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Do I need to send my first aid certificate to the SIA?</h3>
<p>No, we will not verify first aid certificates. Your training provider must check that you have the correct first aid qualification before they allow you to do the licence-linked qualification.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>I have an existing and valid first aid qualification. Can I present my existing qualification certificate?</h3>
<p>Yes, your training provider will accept your existing qualification if it is still valid for a minimum of a year. It must also be on our list of acceptable first aid qualifications.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Why did the SIA choose the basic Emergency First Aid at Work rather than a full first aid at work qualification?</h3>
<p>We have to strike a balance between the need for greater skills, the level of risk, and the cost to you. That is why we chose the basic emergency first aid level.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>Does the first aid requirement apply to security guards who are not public facing?</h3>
<p>Yes. We base our qualification requirements on licensable activity. If you are applying for a door supervision or security guarding licence, you must fulfil our first aid requirement before starting your application.</p>

<p>First aid is already mandatory for licensed close protection operatives. They must have the three-day First Aid at Work qualification.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>Will current training providers provide the first aid training, or will I need to find a separate course?</h3>
<p>This will depend on the training provider.</p>

<p>Some providers will offer a combined programme, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first aid training on day 1</li>
  <li>licence-linked training from day 2 onwards</li>
</ul>

<p>If they do not, you will need to find first aid training elsewhere.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span>What if I am disabled and cannot physically or mentally do the first aid qualification?</h3>
<p>Speak with your training provider to see what reasonable adjustments can be made for you.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.7 </span>Door supervisors and security guards must take first aid training. What about CCTV operators and Cash and Valuables in Transit operatives?</h3>
<p>Emergency First Aid at Work or equivalent is not required for public space surveillance (CCTV) or cash and valuables in transit licence holders. Door supervisor and security guard licence applicants will need evidence of their first aid training before they can join a training course.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.8 </span>Will there be enough trainers to deliver first aid training?</h3>
<p>We have spoken with the Health and Safety Executive. They have confirmed that first aid providers have the capacity to cover this new requirement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.9 </span>Will security staff be obliged to carry out first aid now that they have training? What has been done to mitigate the risk of liability or malpractice/negligence?</h3>
<p>The new first aid requirement does not change the responsibilities or liabilities of employers or operatives to ensure safe working environments. We are raising the basic required skillset of licence holders, not changing the obligations individuals have to respond in an emergency.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.10 </span>Will the first aid requirement of the close protection qualification remain the same?</h3>
<p>First aid continues to be a requirement for close protection. The acceptable level and types of first aid qualification are listed on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/changes-to-the-training-you-need-for-an-sia-licence">changes to the training you need for an sia licence</a> page.</p>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#counter-terror-help">Where can I get help if I have a technical problem?</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Is counter-terrorism training compulsory now that the new licence-linked qualifications have launched?</h3>
<p>Terror threat awareness was already part of the licence-linked qualifications. The new qualifications include the latest guidance from both the National Counter Terrorism Security Office and the Centre for Protection of National Infrastructure.</p>

<p>Top-up qualifications also contain updated terror threat content for door supervisors and security officers.</p>

<p>The new assessments include questions relating to counter-terrorism.</p>

<p>We have created an e-learning course called ACT Security that is specifically designed for security operatives. We have authorised training providers to accept your ACT Awareness and ACT Security certificates as evidence of your participation in the course.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>How can I access the ACT Awareness and ACT Security e-learning courses?</h3>
<p>Both e-learning modules are free. You can access ACT e-learning from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.protectuk.police.uk" rel="external">www.protectuk.police.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>I have already done the ACT Awareness e-learning; do I need to do the ACT Security e-learning?</h3>
<p>Yes.</p>

<p>When you have completed both courses (ACT and ACT for Security) then you will need to take an exam. Your training provider will give you more guidance when you sign up for the course.</p>

<p>In the meantime, please keep your existing certificate as evidence.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>I have completed the ACT e-elearning courses. Will I need to do them again when I renew?</h3>
<p>We are still looking at what top-up training will look like in the future. We recommend that all security operatives undertake a yearly refresher on counter-terrorism and safety critical content. ACT Awareness and ACT Security can be taken at any time, and we have published guidance on how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/getting-training-and-advice-on-counter-terrorism">get training and advice on counter-terrorism</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span>Where can I get help if I have a technical problem?</h3>
<p>Technical support is provided by Highfield. Visit their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ctsupport.highfieldelearning.com/" rel="external">ACT help centre</a> or email them at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ct@highfield.co.uk">ct@highfield.co.uk</a>.</p>

<span class="number">5. </span>Physical intervention training</h2>

<p>Questions in this section:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#physical-changes">Will there be any changes in the physical intervention module for the new door supervisor qualification?</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#physical-length">Has the length of the physical intervention unit for the door supervisor qualification changed?</a></li>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#physical-real">When will the SIA provide more effective physical intervention training that matches âreal lifeâ situations?</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Will there be any changes in the physical intervention module for the new door supervisor qualification?</h3>
<p>There are minor updates, but the skills remain very similar.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Has the length of the physical intervention unit for the door supervisor qualification changed?</h3>
<p>Yes, there is a slight increase due to the assessment being more rigorous. It will now take 13 hours.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Why has knowledge of the risks of physical intervention been included in the security guarding qualification?</h3>
<p>We want to help security officers manage the risks they may face in a proportionate manner.</p>

<p>We have included knowledge of physical intervention and personal safety to provide security officers with information on practices to avoid if they ever have to intervene physically, or in other occasions where their personal safety may be at risk. This includes identifying situations that might compromise personal safety, and implementing strategies like dynamic risk assessment.</p>

<p>The unit also covers the risks of inappropriate restraint such as positional asphyxia, which is in the door supervisor qualification.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>When will the SIA provide more effective physical intervention training that matches âreal lifeâ situations?</h3>
<p>As a regulator we set the minimum requirement. If an employer or venue identifies a need for further training following a risk assessment, then they should provide this training to their staff. The training is intended to give operatives safe skills to deal with the most common scenarios. It has been tested in coronersâ courts and is constantly reviewed by leading experts.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>When will the new close protection qualification be available?</h3>
<p>The new training will be available from 1 April 2022.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Will existing close protection licence holders need top-up training when the new qualification is available?</h3>
<p>Existing licence holders will be required to take top-up training to bridge the gap between their original qualification and the new qualification. The top-up training will be available from July and will be mandatory from 1 October 2022.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>Will there be any physical intervention content included in the new close protection qualification?</h3>
<p>Yes. Physical intervention is included in the close protection qualification.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span>Are close protection operatives required to do both the door supervisor and close protection physical intervention units?</h3>
<p>Yes. In order for licence integration to continue close protection operatives will be required to do both the existing physical intervention training for door supervisors and the new bespoke physical intervention for close protection operatives.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span>Will I still be able to work as a close protection operative, door supervisor or a security guard after the launch of the new close protection qualification?</h3>
<p>Yes. If you have an active close protection licence you will still be able to work as a close protection operative, door supervisor or a security guard.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.6 </span>Will the new close protection qualification include terror-threat awareness training?</h3>
<p>Yes. New terror-threat content has been added to the close protection qualification. This content has been developed with input from external agencies including the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure and the National Counter Terrorism Security Office.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.7 </span>What research did the SIA do in the development of the new close protection qualification?</h3>
<p>We carried out extensive research in 2018 with the private security industry. We also held 2 public consultations for all of the qualifications in 2018 and 2019, and a specific close protection consultation in 2020. In addition we have worked closely with experts in the field to develop these requirements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.8 </span>Who were the expert stakeholders and public consultants involved in the re-development of the close protection physical intervention content?</h3>
<p>We established expert working groups to help develop the qualification. They comprised representative companies who were part of the Approved Contractor Scheme, training providers, awarding organisations and industry experts with expertise in close protection and physical intervention skills.</p>

<span class="number">7. </span>General</h2>

<p>Questions in this section:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#general-vulnerable">What is the awareness of vulnerable people training?</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#general-disability">Will the new qualifications take disability into account?</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#general-switch">I hold a door supervisor licence but I only operate as a security guard. Can I switch to a security guard licence?</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>What is the awareness of vulnerable people training?</h3>
<p>This is training content for security operatives on how to recognise vulnerable people and keep them safe. Vulnerable people can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>people with a mental health issue</li>
  <li>people with learning or physical disabilities</li>
  <li>pregnant women</li>
  <li>the elderly</li>
  <li>children or under-age adults</li>
</ul>

<p>The definition could also include someone who is acutely ill or under the influence of drink or drugs. There will be training about identifying behaviours that may be exhibited by sexual predators, as well as identifying indicators of abuse.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>Will the new qualifications take disability into account?</h3>
<p>Yes. Our guidance document âWorking in the private security industry: a guide for disabled peopleâ is available from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/applying-for-an-sia-licence-help-and-guidance">Applying for an SIA licence: help and guidance</a> page of our website.</p>

<p>Each awarding organisation and training provider will have their own âreasonable adjustmentâ policy, which should be used where applicable.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span>I hold a door supervisor licence but I only operate as a security guard. Can I switch to a security guard licence?</h3>
<p>From 1 October, if you hold a door supervisor licence you can choose one of the following options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take the door supervisor top-up training and renew your door supervisor licence</li>
  <li>take the security guard top-up training and switch to a security guard licence</li>
</ul>

<p>In either case, you must have an Emergency First Aid at Work qualification, or equivalent, before can you take the top training.</p>

<p>The security guard top-up training is shorter than the door supervisor top-up training, so is likely to be cheaper. However, you should consider the day-to-day duties of the job that you do. If your job involves guarding licensed premises (such as a pub or a club) you will need to renew your door supervisor licence.</p>
