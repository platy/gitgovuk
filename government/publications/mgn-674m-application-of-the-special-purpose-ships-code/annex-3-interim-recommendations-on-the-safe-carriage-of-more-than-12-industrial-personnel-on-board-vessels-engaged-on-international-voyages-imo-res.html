<p>1 &nbsp; For the purposes of these Interim Recommendations, industrial personnel means all persons who are transported or accommodated on board for the purpose of offshore industrial activities performed on board other vessels and/or other offshore facilities and meet the criteria set out below.</p>

<p>2 &nbsp; Such industrial personnel should not be considered or treated as passengers under SOLAS regulation I/2(e).</p>

<p>3 &nbsp; Offshore industrial activities are the construction, maintenance, operation or servicing of offshore facilities related, but not limited, to exploration, the renewable or hydrocarbon energy sectors, aquaculture, ocean mining or similar activities.</p>

<p>4 &nbsp; For the purpose of these Interim Recommendations, all industrial personnel should:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.1 be not less than 16 years of age;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.2 prior to boarding the ship, receive appropriate safety training, meeting the standard in paragraph 2.1 of section A-V1/1 of the STCW Code. Administrations may accept other industrial training standards such as those of the Global Wind Organisation (GWO), Offshore Petroleum Industry Training Organisation (OPITO), Basic Offshore Safety Induction and Emergency Training (OPITO accredited), if they consider these appropriate alternatives;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.3 receive on board ship specific safety familiarisation that includes, but is not limited to, the layout of the ship, and handling of the safety equipment, as appropriate. The standard in paragraph 1 of section A-VI/1 of the STCW Code, or equivalent, should be used as the standard;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.4 be familiarised with specific procedures, e.g. transfer procedures on and off the ship while at sea, as appropriate;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.5.1 be accounted for in the ship’s life-saving equipment, and</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.5.2 be equipped with personal protective clothing and equipment suitable for the safety risks to be encountered both while on board the ship and being transferred at sea; and</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.6 meet appropriate medical standards. The standard in section A-I/9 of the STCW Code, applicable to engineers, or equivalent, may be used as a standard.</p>

<p>5 &nbsp; IMO guidance (MSC-MEPC.7/Circ.10) or relevant industry standards should be taken into account, to the extent possible, when transferring industrial personnel at sea.</p>

<p>6 &nbsp; Industrial personnel may be carried on board ships meeting the provisions of the 2008 SPS Code or other standards, providing they meet an equivalent level of safety acceptable to the Administration, taking into consideration the number of persons on board.</p>
