<h2>Differences between a Variant of Concern and a Variant Under Investigation</h2>

<p>SARS-CoV-2 variants, if considered to have concerning epidemiological, immunological or pathogenic properties, are raised for formal investigation. At this point they are designated Variant Under Investigation (<abbr title="Variant Under Investigation">VUI</abbr>) with a year, month, and number. Following a risk assessment with the relevant expert committee, they may be designated Variant of Concern (<abbr title="Variant of Concern">VOC</abbr>).</p>
