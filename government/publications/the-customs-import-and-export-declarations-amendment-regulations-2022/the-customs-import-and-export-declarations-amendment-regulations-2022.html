<h2>Who is likely to be affected</h2>

<p>This measure will affect anyone moving aid to support the victims of the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.</p>

<h2>General description of the measure</h2>

<p>This measure will allow movements of humanitarian aid intended to support the Ukrainian people to be exported quickly by allowing the required declaration to be made orally or by conduct, that is either by speaking to a Customs officer, or by driving the goods in a lane past a Customs office, or across the boundary of the port.</p>

<h2>Policy objective</h2>

<p>To make sure vital aid can reach victims of the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine as quickly as possible by reducing the requirements for a customs declaration for such exports.</p>

<h2>Background to the measure</h2>

<p>In response to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, the government is taking action to make sure charities and members of the public can send humanitarian aid more easily.</p>

<p>This measure temporarily removes the requirement to complete electronic customs declarations for these exports. This includes goods moving to the area surrounding Ukraine but excluding movements to or going through Russia and Belarus. It also excludes goods that are controlled, restricted or prohibited and excise goods.</p>

<h2>Detailed proposal</h2>

<h3>Operative date</h3>

<p>The instrument will take effect immediately and will apply until 19 June 2022.</p>

<h3>Current law</h3>

<p>The current vires for oral and by conduct declarations for exports is provided by Sections 2 and 3 of Chapter 4 of Part 4 of the Customs (Export) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (the export regulations).</p>

<p>Regulation 14 of the Customs (Import Duty) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 (the import duty regulations) provides the definition, version number and publication date for the ‘Oral or by conduct list’ which is mentioned throughout Part 4 of Chapter 4 of the export regulations.</p>

<h3>Proposed revisions</h3>

<p>This measure will introduce oral and by conduct declarations for humanitarian aid exported from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to support victims of the crisis in Ukraine.</p>

<p>This means an electronic customs declaration will not be required for most disaster relief material intended to counter the effects of the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. Instead, exporters can make an oral declaration where available by speaking to a Customs officer or make a by conduct declaration by driving across the port boundary or past a Customs office in a lane designated for making a customs declaration.</p>

<p>Goods moving from Northern Ireland into the EU directly can do so without customs processes under the Northern Ireland Protocol.</p>

<p>To be eligible, goods must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not be exported from the UK with the intention of being sold</li>
  <li>not be destined for or travelling through Russia or Belarus</li>
  <li>not be excise goods within the meaning of regulation 3 of the Excise Goods (Holding, Movement and Duty Point) Regulations 2010</li>
</ul>

<p>Restricted and prohibited goods are excluded from oral and by conduct declarations by Regulation 16 and Regulation 20 of the export regulations.</p>
