<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>1. About us</h2>

<p><strong>1.1.</strong> The Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) helps employers make safer recruitment decisions and prevent unsuitable people from working with vulnerable groups, including children.</p>

<p><strong>1.2.</strong> Every year we issue around four million DBS certificates. We also manage both the children’s and adults’ Barred Lists.</p>

<p><strong>1.3.</strong> We search police records and, in relevant cases, Barred List information and then issue a DBS certificate to you.</p>

<p><strong>1.4.</strong> Please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-update-service-applicant-guide/dbs-update-service-applicant-guide">Update Service guide for applicants</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>1.5.</strong> The Update Service is not available for applicants who have a basic DBS check. It is only available for standard and enhanced checks.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>2. What is it I need to know?</h2>

<p><strong>2.1.</strong> This is the Update Service Privacy Policy, which tells you how we will use and protect any information we hold about you as part your Update Service subscription.</p>

<p><strong>2.2.</strong> This Policy also explains why we need your personal data, what we will do with it and what you can expect from us. It details what your rights are as an Update Service subscriber in accordance with the Data Protection Act (DPA) 2018 and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), collectively known as Data Protection (DP) Legislation. It should be noted from January 2021 the UK becomes a third country with regard to GDPR as the UK is no longer a member of the European Union.</p>

<p>This Policy also explains how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-subject-access-request">get a copy of any personal data we may hold about you</a>, known as a Subject Access Request.</p>

<p><strong>2.3.</strong> We do have other Privacy Policies that cover our other statutory functions. They can be accessed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-privacy-policies">here</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>3. How will we use the personal information supplied to us?</h2>

<p><strong>3.1.</strong> We at the DBS collect your personal information to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>allow you to register for the Update Service</li>
  <li>process payments when appropriate</li>
  <li>carry out searching of data sources</li>
  <li>consider whether your name should be included on one or both of the barred lists</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3.2.</strong> Your information may also be used for testing purposes. Testing is undertaken to ensure that our systems function as per specified requirements. If it is not practical to disguise your data or use dummy data then we will test our system using your data.</p>

<p>This testing will only take place in environments that are secured to the same level as our live system.</p>

<p>Please note, we may use previous applications you have submitted to assist in the checking process.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>4. Who is the data controller?</h2>

<p><strong>4.1.</strong> A data controller decides the purpose, and the manner, in which any personal data is processed.</p>

<p><strong>4.2.</strong> DBS is the data controller of information held by us for the purposes of GDPR. We have the responsibility for the safety and security of all the data we hold.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>5. Who are the data processors?</h2>

<p><strong>5.1.</strong> A data processor is anyone (other than an employee of a data controller) who processes that data on behalf of the controller.</p>

<p><strong>5.2.</strong> At DBS, we have a range of suppliers who process data on behalf of DBS as defined in section 9. We make sure that our data processors comply with all relevant requirements under data protection legislation. This is defined in our contractual arrangements with them.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>6. Contacting the Data Protection Officer</h2>

<p><strong>6.1.</strong> The DBS Data Protection Officer, can be contacted via email at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dbsdataprotection@dbs.gov.uk">dbsdataprotection@dbs.gov.uk</a> or in writing to:</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>7. What are the legal grounds for processing my information?</h2>

<p><strong>7.1.</strong> Disclosure functions of the DBS are contained within Part V of the Police Act 1997. DBS is required to produce an up-to-date certificate on request.</p>

<p><strong>7.2.</strong> In addition to the above, we may share information with third parties for other purposes, where we are legally permitted to do so.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>8. Why would DBS hold my personal data?</h2>

<p><strong>8.1.</strong> We will only hold your data if you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>previously used or are using the disclosure service</li>
  <li>been referred to DBS for consideration under the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 (SVGA)/Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups (Northern Ireland) Order 2007</li>
  <li>been cautioned or convicted for a relevant (automatic barring) offence that leads to DBS considering you for inclusion in one or both lists</li>
</ul>

<p>We will periodically check local police intelligence. If information about relevant offences is released by the police, DBS will consider whether you should be included in one or both lists.</p>

<p><strong>8.2.</strong> When we ask you for personal information, we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure you know why we need this information</li>
  <li>only ask for information that we need</li>
  <li>ensure only those appropriate have access to it</li>
  <li>store your information securely</li>
  <li>only keep it for as long as we need to – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-data-retention-policy">Retention Policy</a>

  <li>ensure you are provided with a copy of data we hold on you, on request – this is called a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-subject-access-request">Subject Access Request</a>
</li>

</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note: We will share information with ‘relevant authorities’ such as the police, government departments etc. under UK Data Protection Act Prevention and Detection of Crime (Sch2, Part 1 Paragraph 2).</p>

<p>We will also share information under UK Data Protection Act (Sch2 Part 2 Paragraph 5 (2)) where disclosures are required by law or made in connection with legal proceedings.</p>

<p><strong>8.3.</strong>  In return, we will ask you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>give us accurate information</li>
  <li>tell us as soon as possible if there are any changes to your details, such as a new address</li>
</ul>

<span class="number">12.4 </span>12.1.4. Your right to request erasure of your personal data</h3>

<p>In certain circumstances, you have a right to have personal data held about you erased. At the DBS, we will only do this if certain criteria are met. There are some circumstances where this cannot be done so we advise you to seek independent advice before submitting an application to us.</p>

<p>Any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/deletion-of-data">requests for information to be destroyed</a> will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>There are some specific circumstances where the right to erasure does not apply and we may refuse your request.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.5 </span>12.1.5. Your right to prevent DBS from processing your information which is likely to cause you damage/distress</h3>

<p>You have the right to request restriction of processing where it has been established 	that one of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>during the period of rectification if accuracy of personal data is contested</li>
  <li>processing is unlawful</li>
  <li>an individual has requested it is retained to enable them to establish, exercise or defend legal claims</li>
  <li>pending verification of the outcome of the Right to object</li>
  <li>where processing has been restricted</li>
</ul>

<p>DBS customers can request restriction of processing for any of the above reasons until these are resolved. Should you wish to restrict processing you will need to call the DBS helpline on 03000 200 190.</p>

<p>Any requests to stop processing will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.6 </span>12.1.6. Right to receive an electronic copy of any information you have consented to be supplied to us - known as data portability</h3>

<p>You have the right, where this is technically feasible, to electronically receive any personal data you have provided to the DBS to process, on a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/consent-privacy-policy">consent</a> basis.</p>

<p>Please note that basic, standard and enhanced certificates are processed under our legal obligation, under Part V of the Police Act 1997, and barring information is processed under the Safeguarding and Vulnerable Groups Act 2006. Therefore this information falls outside of the right to data portability.</p>

<p>All <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-portability">requests for portability</a> will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
