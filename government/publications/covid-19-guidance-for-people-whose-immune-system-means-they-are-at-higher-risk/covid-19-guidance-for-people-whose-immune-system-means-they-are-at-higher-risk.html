<p>This guidance came into effect on 24 February 2022 and will be updated by 1 April 2022.</p>
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The success of the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination programme has meant that the requirement for shielding and identifying people as clinically extremely vulnerable (<abbr title="clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr>) is no longer necessary.  However, there remains a smaller number of people whose immune system means they are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19, despite vaccination.</p>

<p>Enhanced protections such as those offered by treatments, additional vaccinations and potentially other non-clinical interventions may benefit them.</p>

<p>This page includes specific guidance for people aged 12 and over whose immune system means they are at higher risk of serious illness if they become infected with COVID-19.</p>

<p>This page contains useful information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>who the guidance is for</li>
  <li>keeping yourself safe</li>
  <li>eligibility for additional COVID-19 vaccine doses</li>
  <li>eligibility for new NHS COVID-19 treatments if you become infected and accessing them if you are eligible</li>
  <li>taking a test if you get symptoms of COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who this guidance is for</h2>

<p>Immunosuppression means you have a weakened immune system due to a particular health condition or because you are on medication or treatment that is suppressing your immune system. People who are immunosuppressed, or have specific other medical conditions, may have a reduced ability to fight infections and other diseases, including COVID-19.</p>

<p>Most people in this group will be under the care of a hospital specialist.</p>

<p>People in this group should follow this guidance on keeping yourself safe. You will normally have been identified in one of 2 ways:</p>

<p>1.	Eligibility for a third primary dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p>2.	Eligibility for new treatments for COVID-19.</p>

<p>Further information on who is included in these 2 groups of people is included in the sections on vaccination and new treatments below.</p>

<h2>Keeping yourself safe</h2>

<p>If you are in one of these 2 groups, we advise you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure you have had all of the vaccines you are eligible to receive, including your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/" rel="external">booster COVID-19 vaccination</a>
</li>
  <li>continue to follow any condition-specific advice you may have been given by your specialist</li>
  <li>consider continuing to wear a face covering in public spaces</li>
  <li>work from home if this feels right for you – if you cannot work from home, speak to your employer about what arrangements they can make to reduce your risk</li>
  <li>reduce the time you spend in enclosed crowded spaces</li>
  <li>practice social distancing if that feels right for you</li>
  <li>ventilate your home by opening windows and doors to let fresh air in</li>
  <li>consider asking friends and family to take a rapid lateral flow antigen test before visiting you</li>
  <li>ask home visitors to wear face coverings and wear a face covering yourself</li>
  <li>wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are too ill to work, you may be <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay">eligible for Statutory Sick Pay</a>. Children and young people should attend education settings unless their clinician has advised otherwise.</p>

<p>NHS Volunteer Responders are available to help with things like collecting shopping, medication, or other essential supplies, and with transport to medical appointments. They can also provide a regular, friendly phone call.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://nhsvolunteerresponders.org.uk/" rel="external">More information is available online</a>, or you can call 0808 196 3646 between 8am and 8pm.</p>

<h2>COVID-19 vaccines</h2>

<p>A primary vaccination schedule for people aged 12 and over who were severely immunosuppressed at or around the time of their first or second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine is 3 doses rather than 2. Additionally, people in this group who have completed their primary course (3 doses) of COVID-19 vaccine will be due a first booster (as a fourth dose) at least 3 months after administration of their third primary dose.</p>

<p>Severe immunosuppression includes people who had or may recently have had:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a blood cancer (such as leukaemia or lymphoma)</li>
  <li>a weakened immune system due to a treatment (such as steroid medicine, biological therapy (sometimes called immunotherapy), chemotherapy or radiotherapy)</li>
  <li>an organ or bone marrow transplant</li>
  <li>a condition that means you have a very high risk of getting infections</li>
  <li>a condition or treatment your specialist advises makes you eligible for a third dose</li>
</ul>

<p>If you haven’t already done so, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/" rel="external">book your vaccine online</a>.</p>

<p>The NHS urges people who are immunosuppressed (and their household contacts) to come forward for any vaccine doses they are eligible for as a matter of urgency. We would strongly encourage you to take up this invite as soon as possible to ensure you have the highest possible level of protection.</p>

<p>Vaccination sites have been asked to ensure that appropriate arrangements and reasonable adjustments are in place to reduce wait times for people who are severely immunosuppressed. Priority access at vaccination sites will be given to you and staff will be available to help.</p>

<h2>Treatments</h2>

<p>The NHS is offering <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/treatments-for-coronavirus/" rel="external">new monoclonal antibody and antiviral treatments</a> to people with COVID-19 who are at highest risk of becoming seriously ill and are 12 years of age or above (although only some treatments are suitable for people aged 12 to 17).</p>

<p>This includes some people who have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Down’s syndrome</li>
  <li>sickle cell disease</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> or <abbr title="acquired immunodeficiency syndrome">AIDS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>chronic kidney disease (<abbr title="chronic kidney disease">CKD</abbr>) stage 4 or 5</li>
  <li>certain types of cancer</li>
  <li>had certain types of chemotherapy in the last 12 months</li>
  <li>had radiotherapy in the last 6 months</li>
  <li>had an organ transplant</li>
  <li>a severe liver condition (such as cirrhosis)</li>
  <li>a rare condition affecting the brain or nerves (multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease, Huntington’s disease or myasthenia gravis)</li>
  <li>certain autoimmune or inflammatory conditions (such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease)</li>
  <li>a condition or treatment that makes you more likely to get infections</li>
</ul>

<p>You should have been made aware if you might be eligible for treatments by either NHS England or your specialist consultant. If you have not been contacted, and you think you should have been, your specialist consultant will be able to confirm if you are eligible for COVID-19 treatments.</p>

<p>A broader group of patients (currently those aged 50 or over and those aged 18 to 49 with underlying health conditions) may also be able to take part in the <a class="govuk-link" href="www.panoramictrial.org">national study of antivirals if they get COVID-19</a>.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>Keep tests at home (valid until 31 March 2022 – to be updated).</p>

<p>If you are eligible for COVID-19 treatments, make sure you have some tests at home so you can get tested quickly if you get symptoms of COVID-19 – the main symptoms are a high temperature, a new continuous cough or a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.</p>

<p>NHS Test and Trace will send you a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kit to keep at home. This is a test you can do at home and send to a lab to find out if you have COVID-19. If you have not received a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kit to keep at home but you think you may be eligible for COVID-19 treatments, call 119 for advice.</p>

<p>You can also get rapid lateral flow tests to keep at home. These are tests that give a quick result and do not need to be sent to a lab. You can order COVID-19 rapid lateral flow tests on GOV.UK, calling 119, or collecting from a pharmacy. Please do not collect tests from a pharmacy if you have any COVID-19 symptoms.</p>

<p>Take a test if you get symptoms (valid until 31 March 2022 – to be updated).</p>

<p>If you have any of the main symptoms of COVID-19, you should take the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test as soon as possible, even if your symptoms are mild.</p>

<p>You can find <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> home test kit instructions for people eligible for COVID-19 treatments on GOV.UK.
You can take a rapid lateral flow test while you are waiting for your <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result or if you do not have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test.</p>

<p>You must report your COVID-19 rapid lateral flow test result on GOV.UK. This is so the NHS can contact you about treatment if you have tested positive for COVID-19.</p>

<p>When registering your <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test and reporting a lateral flow test result, it is important to enter your NHS number, contact details and postcode correctly so the NHS can contact you about treatment.</p>

<h2>What happens if you test positive</h2>

<p>If either test shows that you have COVID-19, the NHS will contact you about treatments that may be available to you and make any necessary arrangements.</p>

<p>If you are not contacted within 24 hours of your positive test result, you should contact your GP or 111 who can make an urgent referral.</p>

<p>There is different guidance available for people living in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/covid-highest-risk/" rel="external">Scotland</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/shielding-extremely-vulnerable-people" rel="external">Wales</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-clinically-extremely-vulnerable-and-vulnerable-people" rel="external">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>
