<p>The Environment Agency is working in partnership on a major new scheme to reduce flood risk in Oxford. The Oxford Flood Alleviation Scheme will cost around £150 million and is one of the biggest flood schemes in the country. It will reduce flood risk to homes, businesses, services and major transport routes into the city.</p>

<p>We have a dedicated website with videos, maps and information about the scheme. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.environment-agency.gov.uk/thames/oxfordscheme/" rel="external">Visit the page here.</a></p>

<p>Oxford has the second fastest growing economy of all UK cities. The scheme will keep Oxford open for business and keep the economy thriving. It will also bring environmental benefits to the area in addition to reduced flood risk.</p>

<p>The scheme partners are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Environment Agency</li>
  <li>Oxfordshire County Council</li>
  <li>Oxford City Council</li>
  <li>Vale of White Horse District Council</li>
  <li>Thames Water</li>
  <li>Thames Regional Flood and Coastal Committee</li>
  <li>Oxford Flood Alliance</li>
  <li>Oxfordshire Local Enterprise Partnership</li>
  <li>University of Oxford</li>
  <li>National Highways</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Oxford needs a flood scheme</h2>
<p>Oxford has a long history of flooding. Significant floods in recent decades have caused damage to homes and businesses and closed the main railway line and major roads.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency <a class="govuk-link" href="https://environment.data.gov.uk/asset-management/index.html" rel="external">maintains rivers and streams</a> in and around Oxford.  This work reduces the risk from smaller floods. Significant flooding cannot be reduced by maintenance alone.</p>

<p>Climate change is happening now and the UK government declared a climate emergency in 2019. We saw the devastating effects of flooding across the country last winter. Climate change is expected to cause more frequent and more severe floods. The Oxford Flood Alleviation Scheme is designed to manage flood risk in Oxford over the next 100 years.</p>

<h2>How the scheme will work</h2>

<p>The Oxford Flood Alleviation Scheme will create a new stream with wetland wildlife corridor, running through the existing floodplain to the west of Oxford. This will create more space for floodwater away from built-up areas, reducing flood risk in Oxford and surrounding areas for many decades to come.</p>

<p>The scheme will be approximately 5km long. It begins north of Botley Road and ends south of the A423 near Kennington, where the new stream joins the River Thames.</p>

<p>Most of this area is farmland and flood meadow. We have designed the scheme to be as natural as possible in appearance and to blend into the surrounding fields. Material will be dug out to create:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new stream which will always carry water - this will look and behave like a natural stream</li>
  <li>a gently sloping floodplain of wetland habitat, grazing meadow and wildflowers running alongside the new stream - most of the time this will be dry</li>
</ul>

<p>When water levels in the River Thames and other existing streams are high, water will overflow from the new stream and start to fill the lowered floodplain next to it. The scheme does not need to be turned ‘on’ or ‘off’ when floods occur. Water will simply enter the lowered floodplain as river levels rise. This draws floodwater away from built-up areas that would otherwise flood. In major floods water will still also use the wider existing floodplain, which is mostly farmland and flood meadow. In this way the scheme is designed to work together with the natural floodplain. Reducing flood risk to homes, businesses and infrastructure, while fitting with the existing landscape.</p>

<p>The scheme keeps hard engineering to a minimum, but in some areas new structures are needed to complement the new stream. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>new bridges for footpaths and bridleways to cross the new stream</li>
  <li>culverts for water to pass under main roads in the south of the scheme</li>
  <li>earth embankments and flood walls in some places to reduce risk to houses which would otherwise still flood</li>
</ul>

<p>Flood risk to properties downstream will not increase as a result of the scheme. Flood risk will remain the same as it is now.</p>

<p>In December 2017, Vale of White Horse District Council commissioned an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.whitehorsedc.gov.uk/vale-of-white-horse-district-council/environment-and-neighbourhood-issues/environmental-advice/the-oxford-flood-alleviation-scheme/" rel="external">additional review of our downstream impact modelling approach</a>.</p>

<figcaption><p>When river levels are high, the scheme will divert some flood water across the undeveloped floodplain and away from properties. The same amount of water that enters the scheme will return to the River Thames at Kennington.</p></figcaption></figure>

<h2>How the Oxford Flood Alleviation Scheme will benefit Oxford</h2>

<p>The scheme will benefit everyone who lives, works in or visits Oxford. The scheme is designed to reduce risk from the size of a flood not seen in Oxford since 1947. This means it’s designed to cope with floods larger than all those Oxford has experienced in recent decades.</p>

<h3>Homes and businesses</h3>
<p>The scheme will reduce flood risk to all homes and businesses in Oxford currently at risk of flooding from the River Thames. The scheme will provide peace of mind to residents who are currently at risk of flooding.</p>

<h3>Infrastructure</h3>
<p>Flood risk to vital transport links, including the railway, Botley and Abingdon roads and other local roads will be reduced. There will be fewer flood related electricity, telephone and internet disruptions. Many properties will be less likely to experience sewer flooding.</p>

<h3>Environment</h3>
<p>The scheme will create new wetland habitat. Wetland habitats support plants and animals adapted to living in a wet environment and are in decline across the country. Creating over 20 hectares of new wetland and around 16 hectares of floodplain meadow throughout the area will be a valuable benefit of the scheme.</p>

<p>The scheme will work with the natural floodplain and blend with the existing environment. The lowered ground alongside the new stream will consist of wetland, grazing meadow and be seeded with wildflowers. It will be landscaped to include around 4 hectares of backwaters, scrapes and ponds. These will be a variety of depths and sizes to encourage biodiversity of wetland and aquatic wildlife. The new stream and its associated habitat will link up existing wetland sites. This will create a wildlife corridor to the west of Oxford, further increasing biodiversity.</p>

<p>We are working closely with local wildlife groups on an ambitious environmental vision for the scheme. This will ensure the scheme is maintained and sees further environmental improvements in the long term.</p>

<h2>Environmental Vision</h2>
<p>The Environment Agency has a plan to ensure that the scheme area is properly cared for and maintained after it is in place. This plan is known as the ‘Environmental Vision’.</p>

<p>The Environmental Vision will ensure the habitats, wildlife and environmental features of the scheme area are properly maintained and continue to improve in the long term. It will ensure the scheme is a valued asset for the local community and the environment for generations to come.</p>

<p>As part of the vision, the Environment Agency has formed a new collaboration with the environmental charity Earth Trust. We will be working with Earth Trust on our plan for the long term environmental benefits of the scheme. This work will establish the best approach to ensure the scheme improves the local environment over time.</p>

<p>Once we near construction of the scheme, we will appoint an external environmental partner. The partner will be responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>habitat management and enhancement</li>
  <li>long term engagement with local communities</li>
</ul>

<p>They will ensure the Oxford Flood Alleviation Scheme delivers a long term green legacy for many decades to come.</p>

<h2>What stage is the scheme at?</h2>

<p>The planning application for the scheme has been submitted to Oxfordshire County Council as the local planning authority. The council will hold an online public consultation from 7 April to 9 May. All the information submitted to the council is available on their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://myeplanning.oxfordshire.gov.uk/Planning/Display/MW.0027/22" rel="external">ePlanning system</a>, planning reference MW.0027/22.</p>

<p>The Oxford Flood Alleviation Scheme has been shown to be the best long term solution for Oxford. The Environment Agency and all the scheme partners remain fully committed to delivering the scheme.</p>

<p>With climate change, flooding will become more frequent and severe and this is the best option to reduce flooding in Oxford when a major flood occurs in the future.</p>

<h2>How this partnership scheme is being funded</h2>
<p>This ambitious project is made possible through central government funding and local contributions. A record £66.5 million has been raised by partners. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Oxfordshire County Council</li>
  <li>Oxfordshire Local Enterprise Partnership</li>
  <li>Thames Regional Flood and Coastal Committee</li>
  <li>Oxford City Council</li>
  <li>Thames Water</li>
  <li>National Highways</li>
</ul>
