<p>The Environment Agency is seeking a professional partner to sustainably manage and maintain a substantial area of land in Oxford following construction of the Oxford Flood Alleviation Scheme.  The scheme has a clear and ambitious environmental vision to benefit communities, wildlife, biodiversity, health and wellbeing as well as reducing flood risk.</p>

<p>Working together with our project partners, our aim is to deliver environmental outcomes that align with the UK government’s 25 Year Environment Plan and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.</p>

<p>The successful Environmental Vision Partner will have past experience of undertaking complete habitat management, enhancement and maintenance tasks whilst maintaining long-term engagement with the community.</p>

<p>Community engagement is at the heart of the success of our Environmental Vision. The successful partner will need to build and maintain relationships with local groups and seek out opportunities for education, environmental research and ecological enhancements that will ensure that the scheme becomes an integral part of the Oxford landscape.</p>

<p>In addition, the successful partner will have experience of seeking appropriate funding and grants to support additional enhancements.</p>

<p>There will be an application process to assess quality and price based on our assessment criteria. The successful partner will enter into a legal agreement with the Environment Agency for up to 21 years.</p>

<p>This is a unique opportunity to manage land for the benefit of wildlife, sustainability and health in the heart of Oxford. If you would like to receive the application or find out more information please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:OxfordScheme@environment-agency.gov.uk">OxfordScheme@environment-agency.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The closing date for completed applications is 31 October 2019.</strong></p>
