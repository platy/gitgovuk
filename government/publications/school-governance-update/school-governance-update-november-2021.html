<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Welcome message from Baroness Barran</h2>

<p>In my new role as the minister with responsibility for governance, I am delighted to be able to introduce myself and welcome you to the November governance update. As I write to you we are celebrating Trustees’ Week, when we recognise those who volunteer their time and expertise in governance roles.</p>

<p>From my previous experience as minister responsible for charities, and my own personal experience as a charity trustee, I have huge respect for the role you play as governors and trustees and I look forward to learning more about the contributions you make to our schools and trusts.</p>

<p>Effective governance underpins our continuing efforts to raise standards in our schools and your passion and dedication is vital to securing the best future for our children and young people. Thank you for all you do and I look forward to being the champion of this incredible volunteer army.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Understanding your data: a guide for school governors and academy trustees updated</h2>

<p>We have updated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-your-data-a-guide-for-school-governors-and-academy-trustees">Understanding your data: a guide for school governors and academy trustees</a>. This resource brings together a range of data to help boards analyse, discuss, and challenge the educational and financial performance of their school or academy trust.</p>

<p>We have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>updated and improved all sections to provide new information and to reflect changes in policy</li>
  <li>included new subsections on cyber security, additional support for pupils with special educational needs or disabilities and governing body composition</li>
  <li>included links to additional sources of information, such as the ‘View my financial insights’ (<abbr title="View my financial insights">VMFI</abbr>) tool</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>National Leaders of Governance: eligibility for funded support and new designations</h2>

<p>Working with the National Governance Association (<abbr title="National Governance Association">NGA</abbr>) we have designated over 60 new National Leaders of Governance (<abbr title="National Leaders of Governance">NLGs</abbr>) to provide fully funded governance support to trusts and schools. All <abbr title="National Leaders of Governance">NLGs</abbr> have completed a rigorous assessment process and meet the new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-leaders-of-governance-a-guide-for-potential-applicants#nlg-standards"><abbr title="National Leaders of Governance">NLG</abbr> Standards</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Leaders of Governance">NLGs</abbr> undertake funded external reviews of governance and support improvement of governance in trusts and schools that meet the eligibility criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>trusts that are eligible for the Trust and School Improvement Offer (<abbr title="Trust and School Improvement Offer">TSI</abbr>)</li>
  <li>maintained schools that have a current single RI Ofsted judgement, with RI in Leadership and Management and nominated by the diocese or local authority</li>
</ul>

<p>Local authorities and dioceses can nominate eligible maintained schools by contacting <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nga.org.uk/Training-and-Development/NLG.aspx" rel="external"><abbr title="National Governance Association">NGA</abbr></a>.</p>
