<p>Welcome to the April governance update.</p>

<p>These are links to the main guidance pages that cover a range of topics. While these may cover issues related to the operational running of schools and academies, it is important for those on governing and trust boards to be aware of this information, as part of their role in supporting and challenging school leaders on their duties:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Actions for schools during the coronavirus outbreak</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-in-education">Face coverings in education</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-reducing-burdens-on-educational-and-care-settings" class="govuk-link">Coronavirus (COVID-19): reducing burdens on educational and care settings</a></li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-for-schools-coronavirus-covid-19">Guidance for schools: coronavirus (COVID-19)</a> - this is a collection of all guidance relating to all educational settings</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Governing and trust boards meetings and visits into schools</h2>

<p>Governing and trust boards should continue to take a pragmatic approach to their meetings. In line with national restrictions, and guidance on social distancing, boards should continue with their alternative meeting arrangements where possible but could consider whether a blended approach of face-to-face and virtual meetings would be appropriate if needed.</p>

<p>Chairs should respond flexibly to the personal circumstances of board members and their clerk/governance professionals, having open conversations about how they wish to join meetings.</p>

<p>Our guidance about governors or trustees going into schools has not changed. This can still happen, if considered essential. Schools will need to consider their own risk assessments and how they will protect the health and safety of any visitors, alongside staff and pupils, in line with our guidance, including on face coverings. Where visits can happen safely outside of school hours, they should. A record should be kept of all visitors with sufficient detail to support rapid contact tracing if required by NHS Test and Trace.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>National Tutoring Programme: subsidised tutoring available</h2>

<p>All state-maintained schools can still access tutoring subsidised by 75% through the <a href="https://nationaltutoring.org.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">National Tutoring Programme</a> (<abbr title="National Tutoring Programme">NTP</abbr>), to support pupils who need extra help. You should speak to your school to ensure they are aware of the support that is available.</p>

<p>Schools can <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://nationaltutoring.org.uk/ntp-tuition-partners">search for approved <abbr title="National Tutoring Programme">NTP</abbr> Tuition Partners</a> and enquire directly with providers.</p>

<p>Tutoring can be provided to pupils at home or in school. This includes specialist provision for supporting students with <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr> and students in special school settings.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Tutoring Programme">NTP</abbr> is running an information webinar on Wednesday 21 April at 4pm that you can <a rel="external" href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_iOCE1Q4ZQCKVNj7BOR6zUw" class="govuk-link">sign up</a> to. You can hear directly from Tuition Partner organisations and learn about the subsidy.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Early Career Framework (<abbr title="Early Career Framework">ECF</abbr>) statutory induction guidance change</h2>

<p>On 25 March, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> published <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework-reforms-overview/early-career-framework-reforms-overview#updated-statutory-induction-guidance" class="govuk-link">statutory induction guidance</a>. The governing body should ensure compliance with the requirement to have regard to this guidance.</p>

<p>From September 2021, statutory induction for teachers will change as part of the <abbr title="Early Career Framework">ECF</abbr> reforms. Early career teachers in England undergoing statutory induction will be entitled to 2 years of high-quality professional development and training.</p>

<p>Schools offering statutory induction need to replace their current induction process. A range of support is available to ensure schools can meet this requirement. Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework-reforms-overview/early-career-framework-reforms-overview" class="govuk-link">Early career framework reforms guidance</a> for further information about the support available.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Honours nominations for those who work or volunteer in school or trust governance</h2>

<p>Anyone can nominate someone worthy for an honour. Consider <a href="https://www.gov.uk/honours" class="govuk-link">submitting an honours nomination</a> if you know someone who works or volunteers in school or trust governance consistently:</p>

<ul>
  <li>goes above and beyond in their role</li>
  <li>makes an exceptional contribution</li>
  <li>has contributed to notable achievements in public life</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Governor and trustee recruitment: Inspiring Governance and Academy Ambassadors</h2>

<p>If looking to recruit to current or upcoming vacancies on your governing board, there are 2 dedicated, free services which continue to assist you with finding the person with the right skills and experience to fill the role:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for governors - <a href="https://www.inspiringgovernance.org/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Inspiring Governance - Become a school governor</a>
</li>
  <li>for academy trustees - <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.academyambassadors.org/" rel="external">Academy Ambassadors</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>How to complete or update your governance contacts on Get Information about Schools (<abbr title="Get Information about Schools">GIAS</abbr>) - for academy trusts only</h2>

<p>Feedback from a survey of almost 400 academy trusts told us that some help regarding the requirement to supply governance contacts would be useful.</p>

<p>We have produced a short video to demonstrate what information is required and how to record governance contacts on the <abbr title="Get Information about Schools">GIAS</abbr> service.</p>
