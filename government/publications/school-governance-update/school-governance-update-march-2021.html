<p>Welcome to the March 2021 edition of the governance update.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Message from the Minister</h2>

<p>The impact of the last 12 months has been enormous and has touched every corner of our lives. Those working and volunteering in the education system have been particularly affected by the pandemic.</p>

<p>I cannot overestimate the importance of having such dedicated volunteers and governance support in our schools and academies, supporting our school leaders and staff and rising to meet each new challenge. I wish to say a huge thank you, both personally and from the Department for Education, to all of you who have worked so tirelessly throughout the pandemic.</p>

<p>The importance of high quality and effective governance is at the heart of our education system, and your personal dedication to maintaining the support structure of governance at this time is not recognised enough.</p>

<p>I hope that as the year progresses, we will start to see some normality return. The first step being, as the Prime Minster announced on Monday 22 February, that the majority of pupils in primary and secondary schools and colleges will return to face-to-face teaching on Monday 8 March. In the meantime, I want each of you to know how much your hard work, and that of your colleagues, is and will continue to be appreciated by me and the department.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Coronavirus (COVID-19) guidance pages for schools and colleges</h2>

<p>These are links to the main guidance pages that cover a range of topic around pupils returning to schools and colleges from the 8 March. While these may cover operational running of schools and academies, it is important for those on governing and trust boards to be aware of in their role of supporting and challenging school leaders on their duties.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Updated school land guidance and forms</h2>

<p>We have published updated school land guidance and application forms at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/submit-a-school-land-transaction-proposal">submit a school land transaction proposal</a>.</p>

<p>The guidance explains how and when it is mandatory to involve the Secretary of State in land transactions, including the disposal and acquisition of school land and the change of use of school playing fields.</p>

<p>There is advice for different types of applicant (including governing bodies that hold land for a school) on how the rules apply to them depending on the type of land and transaction.</p>

<p>For each type of transaction, the guidance describes the assessment criteria and information required and there are new application forms.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> For maintained schools: update on School Financial Value Standard (SFVS)</h2>

<p>Local authority-maintained schools must submit the SFVS annually to their local authority. Local authorities use this information to inform their programme of financial assessment and audit.</p>

<p>Due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, DfE has decided that the SFVS return should be delayed this year. This is to take account of the current pressures schools and local authorities are facing.</p>

<p>For the financial year 2020 to 2021, schools should submit their SFVS to their local authority no later than Friday 28 May.</p>

<p>Local authorities should submit their assurance statement to the DfE within 6 weeks, no later than Friday 9 July.</p>

<p>This has now been published at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/schools-financial-value-standard-sfvs">Schools Financial Value standard (SFVS)</a>.</p>
