<h2>Schools white paper – Opportunity for all: strong schools with great teachers for your child</h2>

<p>We’ve published the schools white paper, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/opportunity-for-all-strong-schools-with-great-teachers-for-your-child">Opportunity for all: strong schools with great teachers for your child</a>.</p>

<p>This sets out our long-term vision for a school system that helps every child to fulfil their potential by ensuring that they receive the right support, in the right place, at the right time – founded on achieving world-class literacy and numeracy. Strong leadership and governance are critical in advancing educational outcomes for children. The new schools bill, announced on 10 May in the queen’s speech, will provide the legislation required to make this vision a reality.</p>

<p>We’ve also published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/implementing-school-system-reform-in-2022-to-2023">Implementing school system reform in 2022 to 2023</a>. This outlines how schools, trusts, local authorities, and where applicable, faith bodies and leaders can take the next steps in the journey towards a stronger and fairer system to support them in engaging constructively with the department over the coming year.</p>

<p>We welcome the views of trustees, governors, and governance professionals on the publication and encourage them to engage with future consultations.</p>

<h2>Local authority-established multi-academy trusts (<abbr title="Multi academy trust">MAT</abbr>)</h2>

<p>As announced in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/opportunity-for-all-strong-schools-with-great-teachers-for-your-child">Opportunity for all: strong schools with great teachers for your child</a>, we have published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-authority-established-mats-registration-of-interest">Registration of interest (<abbr title="registration of interest">ROI</abbr>) document</a> for local authorities who are interested in setting up a <abbr title="Multi academy trust">MAT</abbr>.</p>

<p>We expect to initially support a small number of projects as part of a test-and-learn exercise in 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p>Further information about test-and-learn and the application process is available in the <abbr title="registration of interest">ROI</abbr> document.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr> Review: Right support, right place, right time</h2>

<p>We’ve published the <abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr> and alternative provision (<abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr>) green paper. This sets out proposals for a system that offers children and young people access to the right support, in the right place, and at the right time, so they can fulfil their potential and lead happy, healthy and productive adult lives.</p>

<p>Further information is available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://sendreview.campaign.gov.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr> Review: Right support, right place, right time</a>.</p>

<h2>Recovery guidance</h2>

<p>We’ve published an update to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/education-recovery-support/education-recovery-guidance-for-governors-and-trustees">Education recovery support guidance</a>. This includes guidance specifically for governors and trustees. It provides information about the programmes and activities we’re funding to support education recovery and children and young people’s wellbeing.</p>

<p>There are programmes and activities for children and young people of all ages, prioritising those that need help most, including disadvantaged pupils and students, and those with special educational needs and disabilities (<abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr>).</p>

<h2>Keeping children safe in education guidance</h2>

<p>Our statutory safeguarding guidance, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2">Keeping Children Safe in Education</a> (KCSIE), has been published. This comes into effect on 1 September 2022. Schools and colleges must have regard to this when carrying out their duties to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. Some of this year’s changes include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>making clear the reasons why children may not feel ready or know how to tell someone that they are being abused</li>
  <li>adding more detail about governor and trustee training</li>
  <li>clarifying the process of sharing low-level concerns</li>
  <li>highlighting the importance of explaining to children and young people that the law is in place to protect them rather than criminalise them</li>
  <li>absorbing the standalone sexual violence and sexual harassment advice</li>
</ul>

<h2>Webinars for schools on attendance best practice</h2>

<p>In line with the publication of our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-improve-school-attendance">Working together to improve school attendance</a> guidance, we are running a series of effective practice training webinars to support schools and trusts to meet the new expectations.</p>

<h2>External reviews of governance guidance</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> has recently updated its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/external-reviews-of-governance-whats-involved">external reviews of governance guidance (<abbr title="external reviews of governance">ERGs</abbr>)</a>. We encourage boards to undertake <abbr title="external reviews of governance">ERGs</abbr> regularly as part of a positive, proactive approach to improving governance.</p>

<p>The guidance is to support boards when undertaking a review to understand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how to get the best out of a review, with a focus on understanding the purpose of <abbr title="external reviews of governance">ERGs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>how they can be beneficial</li>
  <li>what to consider when commissioning a review to ensure best value for money</li>
</ul>

<p>We have recently emphasised our position on <abbr title="external reviews of governance">ERGs</abbr> in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academy-trust-handbook/academy-trust-handbook-2021-to-print">Academy Trust Handbook</a>.</p>
