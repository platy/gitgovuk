<p>Welcome to the July 2021 of the edition of the Governance Update – maintained Schools version</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Actions for schools during the coronavirus outbreak</a> has the most up-to-date information for schools. While these may cover issues related to the operational running of schools, it is important for those on governing boards to be aware of this information, as part of their role in supporting and challenging school leaders on their duties.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Message from Baroness Berridge</h2>

<p>At the beginning of June, we celebrated National Volunteers’ Week, the perfect opportunity to recognise the vital role volunteers play as Governors and Trustees of schools and trusts across the country.</p>

<p>I am acutely aware that taking on any role in governance is a significant commitment. The time and expertise you generously give to participating in board meetings, committees and panels, to visiting schools, meeting staff and supporting our school leaders, is absolutely vital to ensuring that all children receive the education they deserve.</p>

<p>As we reach the end of the school year, I therefore want to say a heartfelt thank you, on behalf of myself and the Department, to you all for your service.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>National Leaders of Governance (NLG) reform – application round now open</h2>

<p>We are recruiting new National Leaders of Governance (NLGs). NLGs will deliver targeted governance support to help secure effective governance in schools and trusts in line with the recommendations for <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/916114/NLG_Reform-Advisory_Group_Report_Sep_2020.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NLG reform</a>.</p>

<p>We are keen to attract high calibre chairs, trustees and governance professionals to apply for this exciting role. Please consider applying for the role or encouraging others to do so. The application round will close at 9am on Thursday 29th July 2021. Further information about the role and eligibility can be found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-leaders-of-governance-a-guide-for-potential-applicants" class="govuk-link">here</a>.</p>

<p>We would like to thank all former and current NLGs for giving their invaluable time and experience in supporting schools and academy trusts across England.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Keeping children safe in education statutory guidance updated for September 2021</h2>

<p>KCSIE sets out the legal duties your school must follow to safeguard and promote the welfare of children and young people under the age of 18 in schools and colleges.</p>

<p>As governors you have a strategic leadership responsibility for your school’s or college’s safeguarding arrangements and must ensure that they comply with their duties under legislation. You must have regard to KCSIE, ensuring policies, procedures and training in your school or college are effective and comply with the law at all times.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2">information in KCSIE</a> will assist you with supporting and challenging senior leadership.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Consultation on proposed arrangement for exams 2022 now open</h2>

<p>The department and Ofqual are seeking views on proposed arrangements for GCSEs, AS and A levels (GQs) in summer 2022, along with vocational and technical qualifications (VTQs) in academic year 2021 to 2022.</p>

<p>The suggested arrangements for GQ include choices about the topics students will be assessed on for some subjects and giving schools and colleges advance information about the focus of content of the exams for other subjects.</p>

<p>For VTQs, the consultation builds on 2021 arrangements, which enabled awarding organisations to put in place adaptations such as streamlining assessments, providing revision guidance, and making changes to invigilation, including the introduction of remote invigilation and remote assessment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/proposed-changes-to-the-assessment-of-gcses-as-and-a-levels-in-2022" class="govuk-link">The GQ consultation</a> runs until 11.45pm on 1 August 2021 and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/arrangements-for-the-assessment-and-awarding-of-vocational-technical-and-other-general-qualifications-2021-to-2022" class="govuk-link">the VTQ consultation</a> until 11.45pm on 26 July 2021.</p>

<span class="number">5. </span>Guidance for trust partnerships published</h2>

<p>DfE has published non-statutory <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/981434/Trust_Partnerships_guidance_for_academy_trusts_and_prospective_joiners.pdf" class="govuk-link">guidance</a> and a <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/980753/Trust_partnerships_service_level_agreement_template.docx" class="govuk-link">model service level agreement</a> (SLA) for trust partnerships, a time-limited arrangement between a school and academy trust, allowing parties to explore how a permanent arrangement might work. Governing bodies considering academisation may wish to consider this option to ‘try before they buy’.</p>

<p>The SLA can be adapted to individual circumstances. For example, for schools to collaborate and their share expertise with a trust or for a school to receive school improvement support.</p>

<p>Funding towards a partnership is a new support element for standalone schools eligible for the 2021 to 2022 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/trust-and-school-improvement-offer" class="govuk-link">Trust and School Improvement Offer</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Early Career Framework Reforms</h2>

<p>From September, statutory induction for new teachers will change as part of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework-reforms-overview/early-career-framework-reforms-overview" class="govuk-link">Early Career Framework</a> reforms.</p>

<p>Additionally, in recognition of the challenging time NQTs have faced, all state funded schools with an NQT who is due to complete induction this summer will have access to a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-induction-for-newly-qualified-teachers/covid-19-induction-for-newly-qualified-teachers-guidance#additional-funding-for-those-currently-undertaking-induction" class="govuk-link">one-off payment</a> to support their development.</p>
