<p>Welcome to the July 2021 of the edition of the Governance Update – Academy Trust version</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak" class="govuk-link">Actions for schools during the coronavirus outbreak</a> has the most up-to-date information for academy trusts. While these may cover issues related to the operational running of academies, it is important for those on trust boards to be aware of this information, as part of their role in supporting and challenging school leaders on their duties.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Message from Baroness Berridge</h2>

<p>At the beginning of June, we celebrated National Volunteers’ Week, the perfect opportunity to recognise the vital role volunteers play as Governors and Trustees of schools and trusts across the country.</p>

<p>I am acutely aware that taking on any role in governance is a significant commitment. The time and expertise you generously give to participating in board meetings, committees and panels, to visiting schools, meeting staff and supporting our school leaders, is absolutely vital to ensuring that all children receive the education they deserve.</p>

<p>As we reach the end of the school year, I therefore want to say a heartfelt thank you, on behalf of myself and the Department, to you all for your service.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> National Leaders of Governance (NLG) reform – application round now open</h2>

<p>We are recruiting new National Leaders of Governance (NLGs). NLGs will deliver targeted governance support to help secure effective governance in schools and trustsin line with the recommendations for <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/916114/NLG_Reform-Advisory_Group_Report_Sep_2020.pdf" class="govuk-link">NLG reform</a>.</p>

<p>We are keen to attract high calibre chairs, trustees and governance professionals to apply for this exciting role. Please consider applying for the role or encouraging others to do so. The application round will close at 9am on Thursday 29 July 2021. Further information about the role and eligibility can be found at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-leaders-of-governance-a-guide-for-potential-applicants" class="govuk-link">Apply for the National Leaders of Governance programme</a>.</p>

<p>We would like to thank all former and current NLGs for giving their invaluable time and experience in supporting schools and academy trusts across England.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Academy Trust Handbook 2021 (also known as the Academies Financial Handbook) published</h2>

<p>Baroness Berridge, Minister for the School System, wrote to all academy trusts on 10 June 2021 informing them the name of the Academies Financial Handbook was changing to the Academy Trust Handbook to reflect its full range of content more accurately.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-financial-handbook" class="govuk-link">2021 edition of the Handbook</a> will come into effect on 1 September 2021 and includes new information about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>trusts’ existing obligations in relation to safeguarding, health and safety, and estates management</li>
  <li>parental representation on trust governance structures</li>
  <li>cybercrime</li>
  <li>external reviews of governance</li>
  <li>renaming the financial notice to improve (FNtI) to notice to improve (NtI)</li>
</ul>

<p>The 2021 edition is currently available to download as a pdf (with a summary of changes on page 9). We will update the digital handbook to reflect the 2021 edition on 1 September 2021.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Updated model articles of association</h2>

<p>We have updated the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-model-memorandum-and-articles-of-association">model articles of association for mainstream academies, special academies, 16 to 19 academies, alternative provision academies, free schools and studio schools</a>.</p>

<p>The new model is for use by all new trusts and existing trusts updating their articles of association.</p>

<p>The main changes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new requirement for at least the majority of members to be independent of the board</li>
  <li>a requirement for trusts to hold Annual General Meetings</li>
  <li>new wording to emphasise that trusts must appoint a governance professional (clerk) to the board of trustees</li>
</ul>

<p>We have also made formatting and other changes to make the document more accessible and easier to navigate.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Keeping children safe in education statutory guidance updated for September 2021</h2>

<p>KCSIE sets out the legal duties your trust must follow to safeguard and promote the welfare of children and young people under the age of 18 in academy trusts and colleges.</p>

<p>As trustees you have a strategic leadership responsibility for your trust’s or college’s safeguarding arrangements and must ensure that they comply with their duties under legislation. You must have regard to KCSIE, ensuring policies, procedures and training in your schools or colleges are effective and comply with the law at all times.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2">information in KCSIE</a> will assist you with supporting and challenging senior leadership.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Consultation on proposed arrangement for exams 2022 now open</h2>

<p>The department and Ofqual are seeking views on proposed arrangements for GCSEs, AS and A levels (GQs) in summer 2022, along with vocational and technical qualifications (VTQs) in academic year 2021 to 2022.</p>

<p>The suggested arrangements for GQ include choices about the topics students will be assessed on for some subjects and giving schools and colleges advance information about the focus of content of the exams for other subjects.</p>

<p>For VTQs, the consultation builds on 2021 arrangements, which enabled awarding organisations to put in place adaptations such as streamlining assessments, providing revision guidance, and making changes to invigilation, including the introduction of remote invigilation and remote assessment.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/proposed-changes-to-the-assessment-of-gcses-as-and-a-levels-in-2022">The GQ consultation</a> runs until 11.45pm on 1 August 2021 and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/arrangements-for-the-assessment-and-awarding-of-vocational-technical-and-other-general-qualifications-2021-to-2022">the VTQ consultation</a> until 11.45pm on 26 July 2021.</p>

<span class="number">7. </span> Guidance for trust partnerships published</h2>

<p>DfE has published non-statutory <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/981434/Trust_Partnerships_guidance_for_academy_trusts_and_prospective_joiners.pdf">guidance</a> and a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/980753/Trust_partnerships_service_level_agreement_template.docx" rel="external">model service level agreement</a> (SLA) for trust partnerships, a time-limited arrangement between a school and academy trust that allows them to explore how a permanent arrangement might work. Trust boards may wish to consider this option to support other schools in a ‘try before they buy’ arrangement.</p>

<p>The SLA can be adapted to individual circumstances. For example, for schools to collaborate and their share expertise with a trust or for a school to receive school improvement support.</p>

<p>Funding towards a partnership is a new support element for standalone schools eligible for the 2021 to 2022 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/trust-and-school-improvement-offer">Trust and School Improvement Offer</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Reminder to apply for a suitability check</h2>

<p>Chairs of trustees in academy trusts must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-trust-chair-suitability-checks?utm_source=30-June-2021&amp;utm_medium=ESFA%20Update&amp;utm_campaign=ESFA">complete a suitability check</a> as soon as they are appointed. This is in addition to any checks arranged locally by the academy trust.</p>

<p>ESFA conducts suitability checks to support the safeguarding requirements set out in legislation.</p>

<p>If your trust has recently appointed a new chair of trustees who has not yet applied for a suitability check, they should do this without delay.</p>

<p>If an existing chair of trustees’ term of office has recently been extended, and they did not receive a check when originally appointed, please ensure they <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-trust-chair-suitability-checks?utm_source=30-June-2021&amp;utm_medium=ESFA%20Update&amp;utm_campaign=ESFA">apply for a suitability check now</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Early Career Framework Reforms</h2>

<p>From September, statutory induction for new teachers will change as part of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework-reforms-overview/early-career-framework-reforms-overview" class="govuk-link">Early Career Framework</a> reforms.</p>

<p>Additionally, in recognition of the challenging time NQTs have faced, all state funded schools with an NQT who is due to complete induction this summer will have access to a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-induction-for-newly-qualified-teachers/covid-19-induction-for-newly-qualified-teachers-guidance#additional-funding-for-those-currently-undertaking-induction" class="govuk-link">one-off payment</a> to support their development.</p>

<p>To receive direct updates on these reforms, fill in this <a rel="external" href="https://forms.gle/USwLhcSv5nVyk4y7A" class="govuk-link">form</a>.</p>
