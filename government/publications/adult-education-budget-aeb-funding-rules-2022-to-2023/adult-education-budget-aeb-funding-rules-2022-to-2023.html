<h2>Devolution of adult education functions</h2>

<p>The devolution of adult education functions to specified combined authorities and the Mayor of London will apply in relation to the funding year from 1 August 2022. The following Combined Authorities will exercise, in relation to their area, certain adult education functions of the Secretary of State under the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009. This transfer of functions has been achieved by way of orders made under the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Greater Manchester Combined Authority (Adult Education Functions) Order 2018 (SI 2018/1141)</li>
  <li>The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority (Adult Education Functions) Order 2018 (SI 2018/1142)</li>
  <li>The West of England Combined Authority (Adult Education Functions) Order 2018 (SI 2018/1143)</li>
  <li>The West Midlands Combined Authority (Adult Education Functions) Order 2018 (SI 2018/1144)</li>
  <li>The Tees Valley Combined Authority (Adult Education Functions) Order 2018 (SI 2018/1145)</li>
  <li>The Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority (Adult Education Functions) Order 2018 (SI 2018/1146)</li>
  <li>The Newcastle Upon Tyne, North Tyneside and Northumberland Combined Authority (Adult Education Functions) Order 2019 (SI 2019/1457)</li>
  <li>South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority (SI 2020/806)</li>
  <li>The West Yorkshire Combined Authority (Election of Mayor and Functions) Order 2021 (SI 2021/112)</li>
</ul>

<p>A delegation of those functions has been made in relation to the Mayor of London, under section 39A of the Greater London Authority Act 1999. Both the transfer of the functions to the specified combined authorities and the delegation of those functions in relation to the Mayor of London is referred to in this document as the devolution of adult education.</p>

<p>Further information for each combined authority can be found via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.local.gov.uk/topics/devolution/devolution-online-hub/devolution-explained/combined-authorities" rel="external">Local Government Association website</a>.</p>

<p>Where relevant in this document, specified combined authorities and the Mayor of London will be referred to as ‘devolved authorities’ or ‘devolved authority area’.</p>

<p>Since 1 August 2019 devolved authorities with responsibilities for adult education for their residents and associated budgets have published their own funding rules, for those providers in receipt of devolved AEB funding, for AEB delivery to residents in their areas.</p>

<p>As a result of these changes, the content and requirements set out in this document <strong>only</strong> apply to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>individuals resident in areas of England outside of the devolved authority areas undertaking ESFA funded AEB provision</li>
  <li>continuing AEB funded individuals who are resident in devolved authority areas, who have not completed their learning by 31 July 2022, but started their learning before that authority’s devolution date</li>
  <li>learners resident in England, including those resident in a devolved authority area, undertaking a 19 to 24 traineeship programme</li>
</ul>

<h2>Introduction and purpose of the document</h2>

<p>This document sets out the ESFA AEB funding rules for the 2022 to 2023 funding year (1 August 2022 to 31 July 2023). These rules contain conditions of funding (in accordance with section 101 of the Apprenticeships Skills Children and Learning Act 2009 and section 16 of the Education Act 2002) and apply to all providers who receive ESFA funded AEB from the Secretary of State for Education acting through the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA).</p>

<p>ESFA funded AEB aims to engage adults and provide the skills and learning they need to progress into, or within, work; or equip them for an apprenticeship or other learning. It enables more flexible tailored programmes of learning to be made available, which may or may not require a qualification, to help eligible learners engage in learning, build confidence, and/or enhance their wellbeing.</p>

<p>Providers must have due regard to the skills analysis and priorities of Local Enterprise Partnership(s).</p>

<p>Where there is an approved local skills improvement plan for the specified area, the relevant provider must consider that plan when making decisions about English-funded post-16 technical education or training.</p>

<p>These rules do not apply to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apprenticeships</li>
  <li>advanced learner loans</li>
  <li>Skills Bootcamps</li>
  <li>Multiply</li>
  <li>education and training services funded by the European Social Fund (ESF) / HMT Guarantee</li>
  <li>individuals resident in a devolved authority area, unless they meet the criteria for continuing learners in the second paragraph of the <a class="govuk-link" href="#fund">who we fund</a> section, or are undertaking a 19 to 24 traineeship programme</li>
</ul>

<p>This document forms part of the terms and conditions of funding and you must read them in conjunction with your funding agreement. You must operate within the terms and conditions of the funding agreement, these rules, and the Individualised Learner Record (ILR) specification. If you do not, you are in breach of your funding agreement with us.</p>

<p>All information, including hyperlinks were correct when we published this document.</p>

<p>ESFA reserves the right to make changes to these rules.</p>

<h3>How this document can help you</h3>

<p>There are 3 sections in the funding rules that contain general funding requirements, ESFA funded AEB and traineeship programme specific rules. We will add a further section on performance management in the summer.</p>

<p>Each section may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the context of the rule in a box, or set out in a table, and/or</li>
  <li>the rule(s) itself</li>
</ul>

<p>We have included a <a class="govuk-link" href="#glossary">glossary</a> to explain technical terms.</p>

<p>We have included a <a class="govuk-link" href="#summary">summary of changes</a> to explain new policy rules and amendments that differ from 2021 to 2022.</p>

<h3>Understanding the terminology</h3>

<p>The term ‘we’ refers to the Secretary of State for Education, acting through ESFA, an executive agency sponsored by the Department for Education (DfE).</p>

<p>When we refer to ‘you’ or ‘providers’, this includes colleges, higher education institutions, training organisations, local authorities and employers who receive ESFA funded AEB from us to deliver education and training to learners set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#fund">who we fund section</a>.</p>

<p>We will use the generic term ‘you’ or ‘provider’ unless the requirements only apply to a specific provider type. We use the term ‘funding agreement’ to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>financial memorandum</li>
  <li>conditions of funding (grant)</li>
  <li>contract for services</li>
  <li>conditions of funding (grant) – employer</li>
</ul>

<p>We use the terms ‘individual’ and ‘learner’ to cover those whose provision is funded by us.</p>

<p>When we refer to ‘ESFA funded AEB’ this is funding you can claim from us for delivery of AEB provision, and/or the traineeship programme to learners set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#fund">who we fund</a> section. Please also refer to the ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="#devolution">devolution of adult education functions</a>’ section.</p>

<p>We use the term ‘provision’ or ‘learning’ or ‘learning aims’ to refer to ESFA funded AEB, whether it is a regulated qualification, or other learning that is not a regulated qualification.</p>

<p>If we refer to qualifications, either these will be from the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) or an Access to Higher Education Diploma recognised and regulated by the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA).</p>

<p>If we refer to ‘learning aims’, we mean a single episode of learning which could be a regulated qualification, a component of a regulated qualification or non-regulated learning.</p>

<p>If we refer to ‘programmes’, we mean a coherent package of learning which may include regulated qualifications, components of regulated qualifications or non-regulated learning with clearly stated aims supporting agreed outcomes.</p>

<p>We may refer to this document as ‘funding rules’ or ‘the rules’.</p>

<p>You can contact us through our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen" rel="external">enquiry form</a>. You can also contact your territorial lead.</p>

<h2>Section 1 - General funding requirements</h2>

<h2>Principles of funding</h2>

<p>These rules apply in relation to all learners starting new ESFA funded AEB learning aims on or after 1 August 2022 and continuing learners as referenced in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#fund">who we fund</a> section.</p>

<p>You must not transfer funding between the following budgets:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ESFA funded AEB</li>
  <li>19 to 24 traineeship programmes</li>
  <li>level 3 free courses for jobs</li>
  <li>apprenticeships</li>
  <li>advanced learner loans bursary fund</li>
  <li>advanced learner loan facility</li>
  <li>Skills Bootcamps</li>
  <li>Multiply</li>
</ul>

<p>We will review and monitor whether the ESFA funded AEB provision you provide represents good value for money. If we consider that funding is significantly more than the cost of providing education and training, we may reduce your funding after consulting with you.</p>

<p>Failure to comply with funding rules could lead to action or intervention. Our policies and guidance about the oversight of providers have been updated and were published in August 2019 (last updated July 2021). The triggers for action and the type of action we may take is set out in these documents and is in accordance with provisions in our Grant Agreements and Contracts for Services:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/college-oversight-support-and-intervention">College oversight: support intervention</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-esfa-maintains-oversight-of-independent-training-providers-itps">How ESFA maintains oversight of independent training providers</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Who we fund</h2>

<p>We will fund:</p>

<ul>
  <li>individuals resident in areas of England outside of devolved authority areas undertaking ESFA funded AEB</li>
  <li>continuing learners who are resident in devolved authority areas, who have not completed their learning by 31 July 2022, but started their learning before the authorities’ devolution date with providers who have an Education and Skills Funding agreement (grant) only</li>
  <li>learners resident in England, including those resident in a devolved authority area, undertaking a 19 to 24 traineeship programme</li>
</ul>

<p>You must check the eligibility of a learner, including where in England they are resident, at the start of each learning aim, or their traineeship programme, and only claim funding for ESFA funded AEB for eligible learners. Please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="#glossary">glossary</a> definition of ‘learner residency’ and the devolution <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-education-budget-aeb-postcode-files">postcode checker data set</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the criteria in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#fund">who we fund</a> section, to be ESFA funded, on the first day of learning a learner must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be aged 19 or older on 31 August within the 2022 to 2023 funding year or,</li>
  <li>start a 16 to 18 traineeship programme on or after 1 August of the funding year in which they have their 16th birthday and before the funding year in which they turn 19, if you have a 16 to 19 traineeship funding agreement without a 16 to 19 study programme</li>
</ul>

<p>The age of the learner on 31 August in the funding year determines whether the learner is funded through ESFA’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/sfa-funding-rates">AEB funding methodology</a> (for individuals aged 19 and over), or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/funding-education-for-16-to-19-year-olds">16 to 19-year-olds funding methodology</a> (for individuals aged 16 to 19 and those aged 19 to 24 with an education health and care plan).</p>

<p>All individuals aged 19 or over on 31 August who are continuing a programme they began aged 16 to 18 (‘19+ continuers’) will be funded through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/funding-education-for-16-to-19-year-olds">16 to 19-year-olds funding methodology</a>.</p>

<p>Learners will be eligible for ESFA funded AEB for the whole of the learning aim or programme if they are eligible for funding at the start, even if the duration is for over one year. You must reassess the learner for any further learning they start.</p>

<p>If an individual starts a learning aim or programme and is not eligible for funding, we will not fund their learning while they remain ineligible.</p>

<p>You must not fund a learner who is unable to complete a learning aim or programme of study in the time they have available. Any learner of any age must be able to achieve the learning aim or programme of study within the time they have available.</p>

<h2>Residency eligibility</h2>

<p>Individuals will be eligible for ESFA funded AEB if they meet the criteria in the ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="#fund">who we fund</a>’ section, the learning is taking place in England, and they fulfil the residency requirements set out in one or more of the categories below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>resided in the EEA or Switzerland by 31 December 2020 (or resident in the UK, having moved to the UK from EEA or Switzerland after 31 December 2017), and</li>
  <li>resided in the EEA, Switzerland, Gibraltar or the UK for at least the previous 3 years on the first day of learning and</li>
  <li>remained ordinarily resident in the UK, Gibraltar, the EEA or Switzerland between 31 December 2020 and the start of the course and</li>
  <li>the course starting before January 2028<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The EEA includes all the countries and territories listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex_A">annex A</a>.</p>

<h3>Other non-UK nationals</h3>

<p>Non-UK nationals who have been ordinarily resident in the UK and Islands for at least the previous 3 years on the first day of learning and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have permission granted by the UK government to live in the UK and such permission is not for educational purposes only, or</li>
  <li>have obtained pre-settled or settled status under EUSS</li>
</ul>

<h3>Family members of EU nationals</h3>

<p>A ‘family member’ is the husband, wife, civil partner, child, grandchild, dependent parent or grandparent of an EU national (principal). A family member is eligible for funding if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where required to do so, they have obtained pre-settled or settled status under EUSS, and</li>
  <li>the EU national (principal) has obtained pre-settled or settled status under EUSS and has been ordinarily resident in the UK, EEA and/or Switzerland for at least the previous 3 years on the first day of learning</li>
</ul>

<h3>Family members of an eligible person of Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>Family members of an eligible person of Northern Ireland<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> (principal) are eligible for funding if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they have been living in the UK by 31 December 2020 and</li>
  <li>they have obtained pre-settled or settled status under EUSS, and</li>
  <li>the eligible person of Northern Ireland (principal) has been ordinarily resident in the UK by 31 December 2020, for at least the previous 3 years on the first day of learning</li>
</ul>

<h3>Joining family members under the EU Settlement Scheme</h3>

<p>Family members of an EEA or Swiss national can apply to EUSS<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> after 30 June 2021, if they are joining them in the UK on or after 1 April 2021. They have 3 months to apply to EUSS from the date they arrive in the UK. They will have temporary protection and therefore be eligible for funding during those 3 months and pending the outcome of any EUSS application made during that period (and of any appeal). &nbsp;</p>

<p>The joining family member must also be ordinarily resident in the UK, Gibraltar, EEA, and/or Switzerland for at least the previous 3 years on the first day of learning.</p>

<h3>Late applications to the EU Settlement Scheme</h3>

<p>The closing date for EUSS was 30 June 2021 (except for joining family members of EEA or Swiss nationals). After this date, EEA and Swiss nationals applying for courses starting in the 2021 to 2022 academic year and beyond are generally eligible for funding only if they have been granted pre-settled or settled status under EUSS.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, there may be individuals who have reasonable grounds for making a late application to EUSS and, there may also be some individuals who have made an EUSS application on time, but are still waiting on a final decision on their status from the Home Office, including those that have lodged an appeal. Once a valid application has been made to EUSS (evidenced by receipt of a certificate of application), the applicant will have temporary protection, pending the outcome of that application. &nbsp;</p>

<p>These individuals may be eligible for funding if they:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>have been ordinarily resident in the relevant area for at least the previous 3 years on the first day of learning, and</li>
  <li>have a certificate of application, and</li>
  <li>are family members of EEA/Swiss nationals (if applicable)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Individuals with certain types of immigration status and their family members</h2>

<p>Any individual with any of the statuses listed below, or leave under the listed schemes, is eligible to receive funding and is exempt from the 3-year residency requirement rule:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Refugee status</li>
  <li>Discretionary leave to enter or remain</li>
  <li>Exceptional leave to enter or remain</li>
  <li>Indefinite leave to enter or remain<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>Humanitarian protection</li>
  <li>Leave outside the rules</li>
  <li>Ukraine Family Scheme</li>
  <li>Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme (Homes for Ukraine)</li>
  <li>Ukraine Extension Scheme</li>
  <li>The husband, wife, civil partner or child of any of the above in the first 8 bullet points in this list</li>
  <li>Section 67 of the Immigration Act 2016 leave<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>Calais leave to remain<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>British Nationals evacuated from Afghanistan under Operation Pitting</li>
  <li>British Nationals evacuated from Afghanistan by the UK government before 6 January 2022</li>
</ul>

<p>In relation to the above categories, you must have seen the learner’s immigration permission. This would include the biometric residence permit (BRP) and in some cases an accompanying letter from the Home Office.</p>

<h3>Extension or variation of current immigration permission</h3>

<p>Any learner or family member who has applied for an extension or variation of their current immigration permission in the UK is still treated as if they have that leave. This only applies if the application was made before their current permission expired. Their leave continues until the Home Office decide on their immigration application. Their leave will continue where they have appealed or sought an administrative review of their case within the time allowed to them for doing so.</p>

<p>Therefore, a learner or family member is considered to still have the immigration permission that they held when they made their application for an extension, administrative review or appeal, and their eligibility would be based upon this status.</p>

<p>You may wish to find information, advice and support on eligibility from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukcisa.org.uk/" rel="external">UK Council for International Student Affairs</a>.</p>

<p>The learner’s immigration permission in the UK may have a ‘no recourse to public funds’ condition. Public funds do not include education or education funding. Therefore, this does not affect a learner’s eligibility, which must be decided under the normal eligibility conditions.</p>

<h3>Children of Turkish workers</h3>

<p>A child of a Turkish worker is eligible if both the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Turkish worker is ordinarily resident in the UK on or before 31 December 2020 and has Turkish European Community Association Agreement (ECAA) rights or extended ECAA leave and</li>
  <li>the child has been ordinarily resident in the UK, EEA and/or Turkey for at least the previous 3 years on the first day of learning and is resident in the UK on or before 31 December 2020</li>
</ul>

<h3>Asylum seekers</h3>

<p>Asylum seekers are eligible to receive funding if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have lived in the UK for 6 months or longer while their claim is being considered by the Home Office, and no decision on their claim has been made, or</li>
  <li>are receiving local authority support under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/section/23C" rel="external">section 23C</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/section/23CA" rel="external">section 23CA of the Children Act 1989</a> or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/23/contents/enacted" rel="external">Care Act 2014</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>An individual who has been refused asylum will be eligible if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they have appealed against a decision made by the UK government against granting refugee status and no decision has been made within 6 months of lodging the appeal, or</li>
  <li>they are granted support for themselves under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1999/33/section/4" rel="external">section 4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999</a>, or</li>
  <li>are receiving local authority support for themselves under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/section/23C" rel="external">section 23C</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/section/23CA" rel="external">section 23CA of the Children Act 1989</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Persons granted stateless leave</h3>

<p>A person granted stateless leave is a person who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has extant leave to remain as a stateless person under the immigration rules (within the meaning given in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/77/section/33" rel="external">section 33(1) of the Immigration Act 1971</a>); and</li>
  <li>has been ordinarily resident in the UK and Islands throughout the period since the person was granted such leave</li>
</ul>

<p>A stateless person must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be ordinarily resident in the UK on the first day of the first funding year of the course; and</li>
  <li>have been ordinarily resident in the UK and Islands throughout the 3-year period preceding the first day of the first funding year of the course</li>
</ul>

<p>Certain family members are also eligible under this category if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the spouse or civil partner of a person granted stateless leave (and who was the spouse or civil partner of that person on the leave application date), who is ordinarily resident in the UK on the first day of the first funding year of the course, and who has been ordinarily resident in the UK and Islands throughout the 3-year period preceding the first day of the first funding year of the course; or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the child of a stateless person or of the stateless person’s spouse or civil partner (and who was the child of that stateless person or the child of the stateless person’s spouse or civil partner on the leave application date), was under 18 on the leave application date, is ordinarily resident in the UK on the first day of the first funding year of the course, and has been ordinarily resident in the UK and Islands throughout the 3 year period preceding the first day of the first funding year of the course</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>“Leave application date” means the date on which a person is granted stateless leave made an application to remain in the UK as a stateless person under the immigration rules (within the meaning given in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/77/section/33" rel="external">section 33(1) of the Immigration Act 1971</a>).</p>

<h2>Individuals who are not eligible for funding</h2>

<p>You must not claim funding for individuals who do not meet the eligibility criteria set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#residency">residency eligibility</a> section (from ‘overview’ up to and including ‘persons granted stateless leave’). Examples of individuals who do not meet the eligibility criteria include the following. Please note this list is not exhaustive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>those who are here without authority or lawful status</li>
  <li>those who are resident in the UK on a student visa unless they are eligible through meeting any other of the categories described above</li>
  <li>those who are in the UK on holiday, with or without a visa</li>
  <li>those who are a family member of a person granted a student visa, who have been given immigration permission to stay in the UK and have not been ordinarily resident in the UK for the previous 3 years on the first day of learning</li>
  <li>those whose biometric residence permit or residence permit imposes a study prohibition or restriction on the individual</li>
</ul>

<h3>Learners in the armed forces</h3>

<p>British armed forces personnel, Ministry of Defence personnel or civil and crown servants resident in England, who meet the criteria in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#fund">who we fund</a> section, where learning takes place in England are eligible for ESFA funded AEB.</p>

<p>British armed forces, Ministry of Defence personnel or civil crown servants on postings outside of the UK, including their family members, are treated as ordinarily resident in the UK, who meet the criteria in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#fund">who we fund</a> section, and are eligible for ESFA funded AEB funding.</p>

<p>Members of other nations’ armed forces stationed in England, and their family members, aged 19 and over, are eligible for ESFA funded AEB, set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#fund">who we fund</a> section, if the armed forces individual has been ordinarily resident in England for the previous 3 years on the first day of learning. We will not fund family members that remain outside of England.</p>

<h3>Learners temporarily outside of England</h3>

<p>Individuals resident in areas of England outside of devolved authority areas and who work outside of England as part of their job, are eligible for ESFA funded AEB as long as some of the learning takes place in England. You cannot claim for the additional expense of delivering learning outside of England.</p>

<h3>Learners who live in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own funding arrangements. You must develop arrangements with the relevant devolved administration if you are planning to deliver a significant quantity of learning to learners who do not live in England.</p>

<p>You must not actively recruit learners who live or work outside of England.</p>

<p>We will fund an individual who does not live in England if specialist skills training is only available in England and the individual wants to travel to, or live in, England to study or learn. We do not expect these numbers to be significant.</p>

<p>For learning delivered at an employee’s workplace, we will fund individuals whose main employment or normal place of work is in England.</p>

<p>We will fund individuals who live in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland who require and are eligible for ESFA funded AEB, and work for a UK-based employer. Delivery must take place in England. We do not expect these numbers to be significant.</p>

<p>Providers located close to the borders can deliver ESFA funded AEB to learners who are not resident in England but reside in their catchment area. Delivery must take place in England. We do not expect these numbers to be significant.</p>

<h2>Fees and charging</h2>

<p>You must not make compulsory charges relating to the direct costs of delivering a learning aim to learners we fully fund, including those with a legal entitlement to full funding for their learning. Direct costs include any essential activities or materials without which the learner could not complete and achieve their learning.</p>

<p>If a fully funded learner needs a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check to participate in learning, you cannot charge them for this. If the learning is associated with the learner’s employment, their employer is responsible for carrying out and paying for this check.</p>

<h2>Qualifying days for funding</h2>

<p>A learner must be in learning for a minimum number of days between their learning start date and learning planned end date before you can earn funding, including learning support. You can access this information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-education-budget-aeb-funding-rates-and-formula-2022-to-2023">AEB funding rates and formula 2022 to 2023 guidance</a>.</p>

<p>This does not apply where the learner achieves the learning aim.</p>

<h2>Recognition of prior learning (RPL)</h2>

<p>A learner could have prior learning or attainment that has been previously accredited by an awarding organisation or could be formally recognised and count towards achievement of a qualification. If this is the case, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduce the funding amount claimed for the qualification aim by the percentage of learning the learner does not need</li>
  <li>follow the policies and procedures set by the awarding organisation regarding recognition of prior learning, including any restrictions concerning where RPL or prior attainment may not be applied</li>
  <li>ensure you have a robust internal RPL policy and appropriate resources to deliver RPL</li>
</ul>

<p>We would not expect RPL or prior attainment to be used against the whole qualification, this is exemption rather than RPL.</p>

<p>You must not use prior learning to reduce funding for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>English and maths qualifications up to and including level 2 or</li>
  <li>essential digital skills qualifications up to and including level 1</li>
</ul>

<p>If a learner enrols on an advanced subsidiary (AS) level qualification followed by an A level, you must reduce the funding claimed for the A level to take account of the prior study of the AS level and record this in the ‘funding adjustment for prior learning’ field in the ILR. More information is available in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://guidance.submit-learner-data.service.gov.uk/22-23/ilr" rel="external">ILR guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>Breaks in learning</h2>

<p>You and the learner can agree to suspend learning while the learner takes a break from learning. This allows the learner to continue later with the same eligibility that applied when they first started their learning.</p>

<p>We will not fund a learner during a break in learning.</p>

<p>You must record the date a learner starts a break in learning and the date they restart their learning in the ILR. Further guidance on recording breaks can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://guidance.submit-learner-data.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">ILR provider support manual 2022 to 2023</a>.</p>

<p>You must have evidence that the learner agrees to return and continue with the same learning aim; otherwise, you must report the learner as withdrawn. When the learner returns to learning, you must re-plan and extend the remaining delivery as required.</p>

<p>You must not use a break in learning for short-term absences, such as holidays or short-term illness.</p>

<h2>What we will not fund</h2>

<p>We will not fund:</p>

<ul>
  <li>qualifications, units or learning aims that are not listed on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://findalearningaimbeta.fasst.org.uk/" rel="external">find a learning</a> aim or on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.qualifications.education.gov.uk/Search" rel="external">DfE list of qualifications approved for funding</a> – please see sections <a class="govuk-link" href="#offer">level 3 adult offer and the level 3 legal entitlement</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#flexibility">Local flexibility</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#legal">Local flexibility and legal entitlements</a> below</li>
  <li>provision to learners in custody - the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice">Ministry of Justice</a> funds prison education in England. Please note you can use your ESFA funded AEB to fund individuals released on temporary licence as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#unemployed">unemployed</a> section</li>
  <li>end-point assessment outside of apprenticeship standards, which is subject to Ofqual external quality assurance and regulated as a qualification</li>
  <li>any part of any learner’s learning aim or programme that duplicates provision they have received from any other source</li>
  <li>
    <p>training through ESFA funded AEB, where a learner is undertaking or planning to undertake an apprenticeship and where that training will:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>replicate vocational and other learning aims covered by the apprenticeship standard or framework, including English and maths</li>
      <li>offer career-related training that conflicts with the apprenticeship aims</li>
      <li>be taking place during the apprentices working hours. Where an apprentice has more than one job, working hours refers to the hours of the job the apprenticeship is linked to</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>a learner to repeat the same regulated qualification where they have previously achieved it, unless it is for any GCSE where the learner has not achieved grade 4 (C) or higher</li>
  <li>a learner to sit or resit a learning aim assessment or examination where no extra learning takes place</li>
</ul>

<h2>Contracting</h2>

<h3>Staying on the Register of Training Organisations</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The Register of Training Organisations (ROTO) was formally decommissioned on 31 July 2021.</p>

<p>Subcontractors who wish to deliver over £100k previously had to be listed on ROTO. We have updated the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/subcontracting-funding-rules-for-esfa-funded-post-16-funding-excluding-apprenticeships/subcontracting-funding-rules-for-esfa-funded-post-16-funding-excluding-apprenticeships-2022-to-2023">subcontracting funding rules for ESFA funded post-16 funding (excluding apprenticeships) 2022 to 2023</a>, setting out the interim measures that will remain in place until the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1007581/subcontracting_standard_guidance.pdf" rel="external">subcontracting standard</a> is introduced for the 2022 to 2023 funding year.</p>
</div>

<h3>Subcontracting</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For funding year 2021 to 2022 we took the decision to both simplify and unify the subcontracting funding rules that apply to all providers of education and training who receive AEB, ESF and 16 to 19 funding. By subcontracting we mean any delivery to a learner’s programme of learning by a third party.</p>

<p>We have removed the rules from this document and they are published separately at: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/subcontracting-funding-rules-for-esfa-funded-post-16-funding-excluding-apprenticeships">subcontracting funding rules for ESFA funded post-16 funding (excluding apprenticeships)</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Match funding requirements relevant to the AEB</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>We procure and manage contracts for ESF-funded provision on behalf of local enterprise partnerships that meets local needs. This includes matching the ESF contract value to other similar funding and learners, which we report to the ESF Managing Authority in England.</p>

<p>This means any learning funded by us becomes part of the ESF programme, and the ESF programme rules apply and will be subject to our ESF compliance checks and external audit.</p>
</div>

<p>You must not use the payments that we make as match funding for any ESF projects with any co-financing organisation or Managing Authority direct bids.</p>

<p>You must return complete ILR data, including contact details such as telephone numbers, and you must only return ‘not knowns’ in exceptional circumstances. In particular, you must ensure data for employment status prior to starting, household situation, prior attainment and destination is returned, as these are important for match funding. If the information is not provided, or ‘not known’, or is not available, then you must use ‘learner has withheld this information’.</p>

<p>You and your subcontractors must follow the retention of documents, ‘publicity’ and horizontal themes rules and provide evidence as detailed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-funding-rules">funding and performance management rules 2014 to 2020 European Social Fund (ESF) programme</a>.</p>

<p>You and your subcontractors must follow the evaluation, surveys and annual implementation reporting rules in the ESF 2014 to 2020 funding rules.</p>

<p>You must keep to the rules of the ESF programme, or you will break the conditions of your contract, and this could result in us recovering funds. This includes keeping to the eligibility evidencing rules in the ‘evidence pack’ section of this document.</p>

<h2>Evidence</h2>

<p>You must hold evidence to assure us that you are using ESFA funded AEB appropriately. Most evidence will occur naturally from your normal business process.</p>

<p>You must make sure enrolments for ESFA funded AEB, and/or the traineeship programme, support your decision to claim funding and support the individual’s case for consideration as ordinarily resident in England, or any exceptions set out in the ‘Residency eligibility’ section.</p>

<p>In line with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation">General Data Protection Regulations</a> (GDPR), you must record in the evidence pack what appropriate documentation you have seen, rather than take photocopies to prove eligibility.</p>

<h3>Evidence Pack</h3>

<p>The evidence pack must contain evidence to support the funding claimed and must be available to us if we need it.</p>

<p>Evidence in the evidence pack must assure us that the learner exists.</p>

<p>The learner must confirm information they provide is correct when it is collected.</p>

<p>If the time spent in learning is short, the level of evidence in the evidence pack would reflect this.</p>

<p>Where you hold information centrally, you only need to refer to the source.</p>

<p>If applicable, the evidence pack must confirm the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all information reported to us in the ILR and the earnings adjustment statement (EAS), and all supporting evidence to substantiate the data that you report</li>
  <li>your assessment and evidence of eligibility for funding and a counter signed record of the evidence the learner has provided to support their eligibility for funding</li>
  <li>copies of all assessments and diagnostics undertaken to determine a learner’s requirements</li>
  <li>information on prior learning that affects the learning or the funding of any of the learning aims or programme</li>
  <li>for ‘personalised learning programmes’, for example, non-regulated learning aims, full details of all the aspects of the learning to be carried out, including supporting evidence of the number of planned hours reported in the ILR</li>
  <li>a description of how you will deliver the learning and skills and how the learner will achieve</li>
  <li>the supporting evidence about why you have claimed funding and the level of funding for a learner</li>
  <li>details of any learner or employer contribution</li>
  <li>support needs to be identified, including how you will meet these needs and the evidence of that</li>
  <li>that learning is taking or has taken place (including a work placement if the learner is taking part in a traineeship) and records are available</li>
  <li>if applicable, a learner’s self-declaration as to what state benefit they claim</li>
  <li>a learner’s self-declaration on their status relating to gaining a job; and</li>
  <li>all records and evidence of achievement of qualifications, learning aims or traineeship programme. This must be available within 3 months of you reporting it in the ILR</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the learner is unemployed, this must include a record of what you have agreed with them, including the relevance of the learning to their employment prospects and the labour market needs.</p>

<p>If a subcontractor delivers any provision to the learner, it must clearly identify who it is. This must match the information reported to us in the ILR.</p>

<h3>Confirmation and signatures</h3>

<p>The learner must confirm the information is correct when it is collected. You must have evidence of this, which can include electronic formats.</p>

<p>We accept electronic evidence, including electronic/digital signatures. Where evidence is electronic, you must have wider systems and processes in place to assure you that learners exist and are eligible for funding.</p>

<p>Both electronic and digital signatures are acceptable, we do not specify which should be used, only that a secure process to obtain and store signatures is followed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an electronic signature is defined as any electronic symbol or process that is associated with any record or document, where there is an intention to sign the document by any party involved</li>
  <li>an electronic signature can be anything from a check box to a signature and/or</li>
  <li>a digital signature is where a document with an electronic signature is secured by a process making it non-refutable</li>
  <li>it is a digital fingerprint which captures the act of signing by applying security to a document. Usually documents which have a digital signature embedded are extremely secure and cannot be accessed or amended easily</li>
</ul>

<p>Where an electronic or digital signature is being held, from any party for any reason, you must ensure it is non-refutable. This includes the definitions of both wet and dry signatures. Systems and processes must be in place to assure to us the original signature has not been altered. Where any document needs to be renewed, and a new signature taken, it must be clear from when the new document takes effect, and both must be held.</p>

<p>You must keep effective and reliable evidence. You are responsible for making the evidence you hold easily available to us when we need it.</p>

<h2>Starting, participating and achieving</h2>

<p>You can only claim ESFA funded AEB when directly related learning starts. This would not include enrolment, induction, prior assessment, diagnostic testing, or similar learning.</p>

<p>For your direct delivery, and any subcontracted delivery, you and where relevant, your subcontractor(s) must have direct centre approval and where appropriate, direct qualification approval from the respective awarding organisation for the regulated qualifications you are offering.</p>

<p>Delivery of the qualification (including learner registration with the awarding organisation) for direct delivery and any subcontracted delivery must be in line with the qualification specification and guidance set out by the relevant awarding organisation.</p>

<p>You must have evidence that the learning took place, and the learner was not certificated for prior knowledge.</p>

<p>Where the learning is certificated, you must follow the relevant awarding organisation’s procedure for claiming the relevant certificate(s) and ensure the learner receives them. You must evidence this has happened in the evidence pack.</p>

<h2>Leaving learning</h2>

<p>You must report the learning actual end date in the ILR for a learner who leaves learning as the last day that you can evidence they took part in a learning activity.</p>

<h2>Individualised learner record (ILR)</h2>

<p>You must accurately complete all ILR fields as required in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://guidance.submit-learner-data.service.gov.uk/22-23/ilr" rel="external">2022 to 2023 ILR specification</a> even if they are not required for funding purposes.</p>

<p>The ILR must accurately reflect the learning and support (where applicable) you have identified, planned and delivered to eligible individuals. You must not report inaccurate information that would result in an overstatement of the funding claimed.</p>

<p>Where your data does not support the funding claimed, we will take action to correct this, and we could recover funds you overstated.</p>

<h2>Self-declarations by learners</h2>

<p>All self-declarations must confirm the learner’s details and describe what the learner is confirming for requirements set out in this document.</p>

<p>If a learner self-declares prior attainment, you must check this in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-access-your-personal-learning-record">personal learning record (PLR)</a> and query any contradictory information with the learner. The PLR will not necessarily override the learner’s self-declaration.</p>

<h2>Section 2 – ESFA funded AEB</h2>

<h2>Provision and individuals we fund</h2>

<h3>Legal entitlements</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>ESFA funded AEB includes support for 4 legal entitlements to full funding for eligible adult learners.</p>

<p>Note: The legal entitlements for level 2 and level 3 follow the definition of fullness in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#level_2">full level 2</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#level_3">full level 3</a> sections respectively. A learner can only be fully funded for one vocational qualification from the entitlement qualifications list when exercising their legal entitlement. Appropriate information, advice and guidance should be given to a learner and the learner should be made aware of their entitlement rights and progression routes on completing an entitlement qualification.</p>

<p>These entitlements are set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/22/part/4/chapter/1/crossheading/education-and-training-for-persons-aged-19-or-over-etc" rel="external">Apprenticeships, Skills and Children Learning Act 2009</a>, and enable eligible learners to be fully funded for the following qualifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>English and maths, up to and including level 2, for individuals aged 19 and over, who have not previously attained a GCSE grade 4 (C), or higher, and/or</li>
  <li>first full qualification at level 2 for individuals aged 19 to 23, and/or</li>
  <li>first full qualification at level 3 for individuals aged 19 to 23</li>
  <li>essential digital skills qualifications, up to and including level 1, for individuals aged 19 and over, who have digital skills assessed at below level 1</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>If an individual meets the legal entitlement eligibility criteria, you must not charge them any course fees.</p>

<p>Eligible learners exercising their legal entitlement must be enrolled on qualifications that DfE has approved for funding through the relevant entitlement. For the funding year 2022 to 2023, providers can find the qualifications we have approved in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.qualifications.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">DfE list of qualifications approved for funding</a>, for the following entitlement offers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>level 2 and level 3 and/or</li>
  <li>English and maths and/or</li>
  <li>essential digital skills qualifications</li>
</ul>

<h3>Level 3 adult offer and the level 3 legal entitlement</h3>

<p>Eligible 19 to 23-year-old learners can access all qualifications from the level 3 adult offer. If a learner aged 19 to 23 completes a qualification that is included on both the legal entitlement list and the level 3 adult offer list, they will have exercised their level 3 legal entitlement. For more information on the eligibility criteria refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="#free">level 3 free courses for jobs</a> section.</p>

<h3>Local flexibility</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>ESFA funded AEB also supports delivery of flexible tailored provision for adults, including qualifications and components of these and/or non-regulated learning, up to level 2 – we call this ‘local flexibility’.</p>

<p>Local flexibility provision either is fully or co-funded, depending on the learner’s age, prior attainment and circumstances. Please refer to the ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="#government">level of government contribution</a>’ <a class="govuk-link" href="#government">chart 1</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#table_2">chart 2</a> and the sections below up to and including Learners with an education, health and care (EHC) plan for learner eligibility. Where appropriate for the learner, you can deliver local flexibility provision alongside a legal entitlement qualification.</p>
</div>

<p>Learners aged 19 to 23 progressing towards their first full level 2, must undertake learning at entry and/or level 1 only from local flexibility.</p>

<h3>Local flexibility and legal entitlements</h3>

<p>Learners aged 19 to 23 who progress to their first full level 2, must only enrol on a qualification DfE has approved for funding from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.qualifications.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">qualifications website</a>.</p>

<p>Learners aged 19 to 23 and aged 24 and over, who have already achieved at level 2, or above can undertake learning up to and including level 2 qualifications from the local flexibility offer or qualifications for the level 2 legal entitlement available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.qualifications.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">qualifications website</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://findalearningaimbeta.fasst.org.uk/" rel="external">find a learning aim</a>.</p>

<p>Learners aged 24 and over who have not achieved a level 2 qualification can undertake learning up to and including level 2 qualifications from the local flexibility offer, or qualifications in the level 2 legal entitlement list available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.qualifications.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">qualifications website</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://findalearningaimbeta.fasst.org.uk/" rel="external">find a learning aim</a>.</p>

<h2>Definitions used in the AEB</h2>

<h3>Unemployed</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>We will update the universal credit thresholds to align to any revisions made by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).</p>
</div>

<p>For funding purposes, we define a learner as unemployed if one or more of the following apply, they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receive Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA), including those receiving National Insurance credits only</li>
  <li>receive Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)</li>
  <li>receive Universal Credit (UC), and their take-home pay as recorded on their UC statement (disregarding UC payments and other benefits) is less than £345 a month (learner is sole adult in their benefit claim) or £552 a month (learner has a joint benefit claim with their partner)</li>
  <li>are released on temporary licence, studying outside a prison environment, and not funded by the Ministry of Justice</li>
</ul>

<p>Providers may also use their discretion to fully fund other learners if both of the following apply. The learner:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receives other state benefits (not included in the list above) and their take-home pay (disregarding UC payments and other benefits) is less than £345 a month (learner is sole adult in their benefit claim) or £552 a month (learner has a joint benefit claim with their partner), and</li>
  <li>wants to be employed, or progress into more sustainable employment, and their take-home pay (disregarding UC payments and other benefits) is less than £345 a month (learner is sole adult in their benefit claim) or £552 a month (learner has a joint benefit claim with their partner), and you are satisfied identified learning is directly relevant to their employment prospects and the local labour market needs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Learners in receipt of low wage</h3>

<p>You may fully fund learners who are employed, or self-employed, and would normally be co-funded for provision, up to and including level 2. You must be satisfied the learner is both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>eligible for co-funding, and</li>
  <li>earns less than £18,525 annual gross salary (please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="#glossary">glossary</a>). From 1 April 2022 you may also fully fund learners who meet the low wage criteria for qualifications included in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#free">level 3 free courses for jobs offer</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You must have seen evidence of the learner’s gross annual wages in these circumstances. This could be a wage slip or a UC statement within 3 months of the learner’s learning start date, or a current employment contract which states gross monthly/annual wages. Please note this is not an exhaustive list, but you must evidence your decision to award full funding to an individual who would normally be eligible for co-funding.</p>

<p>To claim full funding for learners who meet the low wage criteria, excluding those on qualifications included in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#free">level 3 free courses for jobs offer</a>, you must use LDM code 363 and FFI code 1.</p>

<h2>Heavy goods vehicle (HGV) driver training</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>This was a one year offer for 2021 to 2022 and is currently under review for 2022 to 2023 academic year. We will communicate the outcome before the start of the academic year.</p>

<p>HGV driver training flexibilities have been developed to support an increase in HGV driver training.</p>

<p>The 2021 to 2022 offer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>includes level 2 qualifications which will prepare learners for HGV licence acquisition of all vehicles up to category C and E (articulated)</li>

  <li>allows all eligible learners, fully funded and co-funded, to be reimbursed for the cost of HGV licences and medical</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Learners must be eligible under the criteria for ESFA funded AEB eligibility and enrolled on one of the targeted approved for funding level 2 qualifications listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://findalearningaimbeta.fasst.org.uk/" rel="external">find a learning aim</a>.</p>

<p>For learners, we will fund the first attempt only for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the HGV licence as part of a programme of training and</li>
  <li>the medical, at a cost of £61 per learner and/or</li>
  <li>a licence to upgrade from category C to category C+E</li>
</ul>

<p>Providers must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use learning aims that are marked with:
    <ul>
      <li>category code 50: HGV Emergency Response, to identify an approved qualification, and</li>
      <li>category code 51: HGV Medical for the additional learning aim to represent the HGV medical and</li>
      <li>category code 52: HGV Licence, for the additional learning aim(s) to represent parts of the Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) tests required to attain the licence, when learners undertake these elements</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>record an outcome of “Achieved” in the ILR where you have a recorded learning aims for the HGV licence and medical aim, to generate reimbursement funding for these activities</li>
  <li>have criteria for how you will administer and distribute your funds</li>

<h2>Sector-based Work Academy Programme (SWAP)</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sector-based-work-academies-employer-guide/sector-based-work-academies-employer-guide">Sector-based Work Academy Programme (SWAP)</a> is designed to help Job Centre Plus claimants build confidence to improve their job prospects and enhance their CV, whilst helping employers in sectors with current local vacancies to fill them. SWAP can last up to 6 weeks and has 3 main components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pre-employment training</li>
  <li>work experience placement</li>
  <li>a guaranteed job interview</li>
</ul>

<p>The scheme runs in England (and Scotland). Participants remain on benefits throughout their placement.</p>

<p>Only the pre-employment training element in England can be funded through AEB local flexibility, and normally lasts 2 to 3 weeks. Jobcentre Plus fund the other components and will pay any travel and childcare costs whilst claimants are on the work experience placement.</p>

<p>FE providers are part of the SWAP local design process and are informed when to expect referrals and how many.</p>
</div>

<p>You must keep a copy of the claimant’s SWAP referral notification issued by Jobcentre Plus in the evidence pack setting out start date and times for their ESFA AEB funded pre-employment training.</p>

<p>To claim full funding for claimants referred to SWAP pre-employment training you must use LDM code 375 and complete the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://guidance.submit-learner-data.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Benefit Status Indicator (BSI)</a> to identify the claimant is in receipt of Jobseeker’s Allowance (BSI 1), Universal Credit (BSI 4), or Employment and Support Allowance (all categories) (BSI 5).</p>

<h2>Level 3 free courses for jobs offer</h2>

<p>As part of the Lifetime Skills Guarantee, a targeted level 3 adult offer has been developed to support adults without an existing full level 3 qualification and, from 1 April 2022, adults who meet the definition of ‘low wage’ or ‘unemployed’. This offer is also known as the free courses for jobs offer.</p>

<p>The offer includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>level 3 qualifications which will support the development of new skills for adult learners and improve the prospects of eligible adults in the labour market. In particular, eligible adults aged 24+ can now access fully-funded level 3 provision from the list of level 3 free courses for jobs qualifications available via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.qualifications.education.gov.uk/Search?Status=All&amp;Offer=9" rel="external">DfE list of qualifications approved for funding</a>
</li>
  <li>additional level 3 qualifications for 19 to 23-year-olds that are not included in the legal entitlements</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#support">support funding</a></li>
  <li>the ability for eligible learners to take one short qualification (identified by category code 49) without exhausting their eligibility. We expect this flexibility to be used where a learner could benefit from a more substantial qualification once they have completed a short qualification</li>
</ul>

<p>An uplift is payable at 2 different rates and follows the earnings methodology set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-education-budget-aeb-funding-rates-and-formula-2022-to-2023">funding rates and formula document</a>. This uplift should be used to support delivery of the level 3 adult offer.</p>

<p>Only level 3 qualifications included in this offer will attract an uplift. There may be additions to the list to ensure it meets the needs of the economy; we encourage providers to check availability regularly.</p>

<p>When qualifications are added to the list of qualifications included in this offer, they will become eligible for funding from that publication date and will not be backdated to the start of the level 3 adult offer (1 April 2021) or the funding year.</p>

<p>Please note this policy is subject to potential further amendments and clarifications.</p>

<p>We will fully fund individuals as part of this offer where they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are aged 19 or above on 31 August within the 2022 to 2023 funding year</li>
  <li>have not achieved a full level 3 qualification, or above, which meets the requirements set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#level_3">full level 3</a> section; or</li>
  <li>have not achieved a qualification available through the level 3 adult offer, unless that qualification is a short qualification, as set out below</li>
  <li>enrol on the level 3 adult offer qualifications approved for funding with effect from 1 April 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>From 1 April 2022, we will also fully fund individuals as part of the offer where they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meet the unemployment or <a class="govuk-link" href="#wage">learners in receipt of low wage</a> criteria and
    <ul>
      <li>if they already have an existing full Level 3 qualification or higher, or have achieved any other qualification included in the level 3 adult offer qualifications list (DfE list of qualifications approved for funding), that qualification must have been achieved before 1 April 2021 or</li>
      <li>if they have achieved a short qualification as set out below, and that was achieved after 1 April 2021, the individual is eligible for one further qualification through the offer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>enrol on the level 3 adult offer qualifications approved for funding with effect from 1 April 2022</li>
</ul>

<p>Once a learner has achieved their qualification(s) in line with the paragraphs above, they will have exhausted their eligibility for the offer.</p>

<p>We will fund eligible learners to take one short qualification, followed by one further qualification in the level 3 adult offer, without exhausting their eligibility. Short qualifications are identified by category code 49 which can be found in level 3 free courses for jobs offer – short qualification within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://findalearningaimbeta.fasst.org.uk/" rel="external">find a learning aim</a>.</p>

<p>A learner will not be eligible for this additional short qualification offer if they have already achieved one of the short qualifications prior to 1 April 2021.</p>

<p>You must not claim for ESFA AEB funding where learners are already being funded through an advanced learner loan (ALL), or a Skills Bootcamp (where applicable), for qualifications that are in the level 3 adult offer. The criteria for ALL can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advanced-learner-loans-funding-rules-2022-to-2023">ALL funding rules 2022 to 2023</a>.</p>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use LDM code 378 and FFI code 1 to claim for funding for learners who meet the requirements above</li>
  <li>use LDM code 378, FFI code 1, and LDM code 382 when recording learners who meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="#wage">low wage eligibility criteria</a>
</li>
  <li>record the employment status of learners accessing the offer in the ILR</li>
  <li>use category code 49 to identify a short course qualification in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://findalearningaimbeta.fasst.org.uk/" rel="external">find a learning aim</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Full level 2</h2>

<p>Level 2 is the level of attainment which, is demonstrated by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) in 5 subjects, each at grade 4 (C) or above, or</li>
  <li>a Technical Certificate at level 2 which meets the requirements for the 16 to 19 performance tables</li>
</ul>

<p>If a learner, aged 19 to 23, has achieved a level 2 qualification that was, at the time they started, or still is, classed as a full level 2, any subsequent level 2 qualifications will be fully funded if they meet the definition of <a class="govuk-link" href="#unemployed">unemployed</a> or meet the eligibility criteria for <a class="govuk-link" href="#wage">learners in receipt of low wage</a>. Please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:qualifications.esfa@education.gov.uk">qualifications.esfa@education.gov.uk</a> if you need advice on a previous qualification’s designation.</p>

<h2>Full level 3</h2>

<p>Level 3 is the level of attainment which is demonstrated by a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>General Certificate of Education at the advanced level in 2 subjects</li>
  <li>General Certificate of Education at the AS level in 4 subjects</li>
  <li>QAA Access to Higher Education (HE) Diploma at level 3</li>
  <li>Technical, or applied general qualification at level 3, which meets the requirements for the 16 to 19 performance tables</li>
  <li>Core maths at level 3</li>
</ul>

<p>If a learner has achieved a level 3 qualification that was not classed as a full level 3 at the time they started it but has since been classed as a full level 3 and wants to enrol on any subsequent level 3 qualification, of any size, they may apply for an advanced learner loan (provided the qualification is designated for funding, and subject to learner eligibility conditions), or pay for their own learning. From the 1 April 2022 there is an exception to this rule; a learner will be fully funded under the level 3 adult offer if they meet the definition of <a class="govuk-link" href="#unemployed">unemployed</a> or meet the eligibility criteria for <a class="govuk-link" href="#wage">learners in receipt of low wage</a>.</p>

<p>Please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:qualifications.esfa@education.gov.uk">qualifications.esfa@education.gov.uk</a> if you need advice on a previous qualification’s designation.</p>

<p>For new linear AS and A levels, where a learner enrols on an AS qualification and continues with further study to take the A level qualification in the same subject, you must record both the AS and A level in the ILR. The AS learning aim will be funded separately to the A level learning aim.</p>

<h2>Approved qualifications</h2>

<p>Where you deliver regulated qualifications and/or their components, you must ensure they are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.qualifications.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">approved for ESFA funded AEB</a> and available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://findalearningaimbeta.fasst.org.uk/" rel="external">find a learning aim</a>.</p>

<p>Where you deliver approved qualifications and/or their components you must ensure that learners are registered for the qualifications and/or component in line with the awarding policies and procedures. You must not ‘pre-register’ students a significant period in advance of the learner starting the qualification.</p>

<p>We will fund qualifications that are linked to occupational regulation/licence to practise. You can find more information about these qualifications at the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.qualifications.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">qualifications website</a>.</p>

<p>Before delivering a component, you must check with the awarding organisation they provide a learner registration facility, and the learner can achieve it alone or as part of accumulating achievement towards a qualification.</p>

<p>If the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ecctis.com/" rel="external">UK ENIC</a> has confirmed the authenticity of a qualification gained overseas and confirmed it is comparable/compatible with a regulated qualification in England, currently part of the level 2 and level 3 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/qualifications-approved-for-public-funding">legal entitlement</a>, the individual will be deemed to have achieved their first level 2 and/or level 3 qualification.</p>

<p>You must provide accurate unique learner number (ULN) information to awarding organisations and ensure all information you use to register learners for qualifications is correct. You can find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-access-your-personal-learning-record">Learner Records Service</a> guidance.</p>

<h2>Non-regulated learning</h2>

<p>Where you deliver non-regulated learning, you must ensure it is eligible for funding. Such learning could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>independent living skills or engagement learning supporting adults to operate confidently and effectively in life and work</li>
  <li>locally commissioned and/or locally developed basic knowledge and skills needed to access technical qualifications</li>
  <li>employability and labour market re-entry</li>
  <li>locally commissioned and/or locally devised technical education short courses (also known as taster sessions)</li>
  <li>community learning courses</li>
  <li>basic digital skills courses, including where learners are unable to undertake digital skills qualification specified in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#digital">digital entitlement for those aged 19 or older</a> section</li>
</ul>

<p>The eligibility principles we apply to non-regulated learning are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it must not be provision linked to UK visa requirements</li>
  <li>it must not be provision linked to occupational regulation unless there is an agreed concession in place</li>
  <li>it must not be restricted to being delivered to employees of only one employer</li>
  <li>it must not be learning, for example, ‘induction to college’, that should be part of a learner’s experience</li>
  <li>it must not be a non-regulated version of a regulated qualification</li>
  <li>it must not be above notional level 2 (that is, at notional levels 3 or 4)</li>
  <li>at notional level 2 it must focus on technical provision</li>
</ul>

<p>Where you are delivering non-regulated learning, you must ensure you have appropriate and robust quality assurance processes in place. For instance, ‘The Recognising and Recording Progress and Achievement (RARPA) Cycle’. Further <a class="govuk-link" href="https://learningandwork.org.uk/resources/research-and-reports/rarpa/" rel="external">information on RARPA</a> is available from the Learning and Work Institute.</p>

<h2>Learning in the workplace</h2>

<p>We will fund learning in the workplace where a learner has a legal entitlement to full funding for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>English and/or maths up to and including level 2, and/or</li>
  <li>a first <a class="govuk-link" href="#level_2">full level 2</a>, or</li>
  <li>a first <a class="govuk-link" href="#level_3">full level 3</a> qualification</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#digital">essential digital skills qualification</a>, up to and including level 1</li>
</ul>

<p>We will fund learning in the workplace for the level 3 free courses for jobs offer.</p>

<p>We will not fund any qualification or learning aim delivered at an employee’s workplace, and is either relevant to their job or their employer’s business, unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is a legal entitlement qualification, and/or</li>
  <li>it is included in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#free">level 3 free courses for jobs offer</a>
</li>
  <li>DfE and/or ESFA have confirmed a national level concession that responds to a significant negative economic impact for a specific industry, or work placement or work experience, unless it is delivered as part of a traineeship programme, or the Prince’s Trust Team programme</li>
</ul>

<h2>English and maths for those aged 19 or older</h2>

<p>We will fully fund individuals, including individuals who are employed, aged 19 or older, who have not previously attained a GCSE grade 4 (C), or higher, in English and maths, as part of their legal entitlement on the day they start the following qualifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GCSE English language or maths</li>
  <li>Functional Skills English or maths from Entry to level 2</li>
  <li>Stepping-stone qualifications (including components, where applicable) in English or maths approved by DfE</li>
</ul>

<p>If a learner wants to ‘retake’ their GCSE English and maths qualification because they did not achieve a grade 4 (C), or higher, we will not fund the learner to only resit the exam.</p>

<p>You must not enrol individuals on qualifications which are not necessary for progressing towards a GCSE or Functional Skill level 2.</p>

<p>You must not fund an apprentice for English or maths from ESFA funded AEB.</p>

<p>We will fully fund non-regulated English and maths learning for learners, including those assessed at pre-entry level with significant learning difficulties and/or disabilities as part of a personalised learning programme, where assessment has identified the learner cannot undertake provision identified in the first paragraph of this section.</p>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>

<h2>Digital entitlement for those aged 19 or older</h2>

<p>We will fully fund individuals aged 19 or older and assessed at below level 1, including individuals who are employed, as part of their legal entitlement on the day they start the following qualification: Essential Digital Skills qualification (EDSQ up to and including level 1).</p>

<p>We will fully fund non-regulated learning for learners, including those assessed at pre-entry level with significant learning difficulties and/or disabilities as part of a personalised learning programme, where assessment has identified the learner cannot undertake provision identified in the paragraph above. This provision must be aligned with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-standards-for-essential-digital-skills">national standards for essential digital skills</a> and must not be a non-regulated version of a regulated qualification (see rules for <a class="govuk-link" href="#regulated">non-regulated learning</a>).</p>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>carry out an initial assessment using current assessment tools based on the national standards for essential digital skills</li>

<p>The assessments must place a learner’s current skills levels within the level descriptors used for the RQF.</p>

<h2>Individuals aged 19 to 23 (excluding English, maths, digital and ESOL)</h2>

<p>We will fully fund 19 to 23-year-olds (refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="#fund">who we fund</a> section), including individuals who are employed, on the day they start the following learning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>qualifications defined within the legal entitlement that are a learner’s:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>first full level 2, and/or</li>

</ul>

<p>We will co-fund all other learners aged 24 years and older for provision up to, and including, a level 2. Where learners are employed, the <a class="govuk-link" href="#wage">low wage flexibility</a> may apply</p>

<h2>English for speakers of other languages (ESOL)</h2>

<p>We will fully fund individuals aged 19 and over on the day they start their ESOL learning aim where they are <a class="govuk-link" href="#unemployed">unemployed</a>.</p>

<p>We will co-fund all other individuals aged 19 and over on the day they start their ESOL learning aim. Where learners are employed, the <a class="govuk-link" href="#wage">low wage flexibility</a> may apply.</p>

<p>We will fund ESOL learning up to and including level 2.</p>

<p>Providers offering ESOL qualifications may need to deliver additional learning to individual learners that incurs additional cost above the qualification rate. You can access information on how to do this in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-education-budget-aeb-funding-rates-and-formula-2022-to-2023">AEB funding rates and formula 2022 to 2023</a>.</p>

<h2>Learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities</h2>

<p>We will fund learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/22/contents" rel="external">Apprenticeships, Skills, and Children and Learning Act 2009</a>.</p>

<p>ESFA has the responsibility for securing the provision of reasonable facilities for education and training suitable to the requirements of persons who are 19 and over, set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#fund">who we fund</a> section. This includes learners with an identified learning difficulty and/or disability who have previously had an education, health and care (EHC) plan and have reached the age of 25.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/funding-education-for-16-to-19-year-olds#16-to-19-funding:-how-it-works">funding methodology</a> will apply to learners aged 19 to 24, who have an EHC plan and require provision and support costs.</p>

<h2>Learners with an education, health and care (EHC) plan</h2>

<p>To access provision and support costs you must inform us before the start of the 2022 to 2023 funding year where a learner:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has reached the age of 25 and has not completed their programme of learning as set out in their EHC plan by the end of the previous funding year, or</li>
  <li>will reach the age of 25 in the funding year, where their EHC plan is not extended by their local authority to allow them to complete their programme of learning</li>
</ul>

<p>The learner must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have an EHC plan that confirms their needs could only be met by the training organisation they are, or were, attending</li>
  <li>continue to make progress on the programme of learning as set out in their EHC plan</li>
</ul>

<p>If a learner has an EHC plan, you must report this in the ‘Learner funding and monitoring’ fields in the ILR.</p>

<p>We will not fund learners whose EHC plan is extended by the local authority beyond their 25th birthday. The local authority must continue to provide top-up funding and contract directly with the institution.</p>

<h2>Community learning</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>This section only applies to providers with a non-formula community learning allocation included in appendix 1 of their contract.</p>

<p>The purpose of community learning is to develop the skills, confidence, motivation and resilience of adults of different ages and backgrounds in order to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>progress towards formal learning or employment and/or</li>
  <li>improve their health and well-being, including mental health and/or</li>
  <li>develop stronger communities</li>
</ul>

<p>The community learning objectives, set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex_B">annex B</a>, ask you to widen participation and transform people’s destinies by supporting progression relevant to personal circumstances. We would expect you to encourage and support all learners to progress onto new or more stretching provision to help them into more formal learning or employment. We would not expect to see multiple enrolments on similar level courses, or a repeat of similar learning aims where this does not benefit the learner’s development.</p>

<p>Community learning courses are delivered and reported on the ILR under the following 4 delivery strands:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Personal and Community Development Learning - learning for personal and community development, cultural enrichment, intellectual or creative stimulation and for enjoyment (in most cases not leading to a formal qualification)</li>
  <li>Family English, Maths and Language - learning to improve the English, language and maths skills of parents, carers or guardians and their ability to help their children</li>
  <li>Wider Family Learning - learning to help different generations of family members to learn together how to support their children’s learning</li>
  <li>Neighbourhood Learning in Deprived Communities - supports local Voluntary and other third sector organisations to develop their capacity to deliver learning opportunities for the residents of disadvantaged neighbourhoods</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note, non-formula Community Learning funding follows <a class="govuk-link" href="#model">funding model 10</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Non-formula community learning funding</h3>

<p>Where applicable, your ESFA funded AEB allocation will include an amount of non-formula community learning funding. We state this value in Appendix 1 of your contract. You must deliver non-formula funded community learning provision in line with the existing community learning objectives set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex_B">annex B</a> community learning objectives, up to this maximum amount.</p>

<p>Non-formula community learning funding will be reconciled against the community learning allocation line at the end of the funding year. You must repay funding that has not been used for community learning or where its use cannot be evidenced.</p>

<p>You must ‘attribute costs’ for eligible learners, up to the value of your non-formula community learning allocation. This must include the use of your non-formula community learning funding to cover learning and learner support costs. If you do, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>claim for learning and learner costs through the final funding claim and follow the policy in line with the support funding section</li>
  <li>record these costs in the learner’s evidence pack and maintain evidence that support the costs for audit purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>We will monitor community learning provision through the ILR and claim submissions and may require you to provide information on your delivery where it does not represent value for money.</p>

<p>If we fund you through a grant or financial memorandum, you have the flexibility to use all, or some, of your non-formula community learning funding in line with the AEB formula-funded methodology (<a class="govuk-link" href="#model">funding model 35</a>), to meet local demand. This flexibility works one way, you cannot use your ESFA formula funded AEB to fund additional community learning and the ESFA will not fund above value in Appendix 1 of your contract.</p>

<p>You can use this amount of non-formula community learning funding (stated in your Appendix 1) to deliver non-regulated provision that may be similar to community learning, and/or regulated qualifications to meet local demand. If you do deliver regulated and non-regulated qualifications, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>follow the ESFA funded AEB formula-funded methodology and submit ILR data under <a class="govuk-link" href="#model">funding model 35</a> for the delivery and support</li>
  <li>enrol learners following ESFA funded AEB eligibility requirements set out in Government contribution <a class="govuk-link" href="#government">table 1</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#table_2">table 2</a> and in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#unemployed">learner eligibility</a> sections from unemployed up to and including learners with an EHC plan. You must not use your non-formula community learning local fee remission policy</li>
  <li>if we fund your organisation through a contract for services, you do not have this flexibility, and we will reclaim unspent non-formula community learning funding at year-end</li>
</ul>

<p>You can support learners aged under 19 if they meet both of the following, they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a parent, carer or guardian attending a wider family learning or family English, maths or language course</li>
  <li>funded through non-formula community learning using funding model 10 in the funding model field (refer to ILR guidance for more information)</li>
</ul>

<p>You must not use non-formula community learning funding for learning that is eligible for funding through an advanced learner loan.</p>

<h3>Pound Plus and local fee remission policy</h3>

<p>Pound Plus - the ‘Pound’ represents the public pound, the ‘Plus’ is everything else that you can generate in addition to your non-formula community learning funding allocation, such as fee income, funding from other sources, resources in kind and other sources of revenue/sponsorship/volunteering.</p>

<p>You must have in place a ‘Pound Plus’ policy. You must invest Pound Plus fee income/savings for the people who most need, and can least afford, community learning provision.</p>

<p>Local fee remission policy - you must have in place and operate a fair and transparent community learning local fee remission policy that requires individuals to pay a course/tuition/joining fee, but also sets out clear eligibility criteria for those individuals who, due to their circumstances, qualify for either partial or total fee remission.</p>

<p>Your Pound Plus and Local Fee remission polices must be available on your website and/or in the venues you deliver community learning to eligible learners.</p>

<h3>Partnership working</h3>

<p>Partnership working underpins the community learning objectives and is critical to developing and delivering an effective community learning offer in a given locality.</p>

<p>You must engage and work closely with a wide range of relevant partners and stakeholders in your local area to help shape your community learning offer to engage specific groups. These could include specialist partners, such as health, Jobcentre Plus and schools, and voluntary and community sector (VCS) organisations.</p>

<p>We expect you to work with other providers in your local area, who may be in receipt of non-formula community funding. We expect you to develop a strategic, efficient community learning offer to reduce duplication of courses in a locality, and signpost learners to other partners as and when appropriate.</p>

<h2>Prince’s Trust Team Programme</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The Prince’s Trust Team Programme is a 12-week course designed to improve confidence, motivation and skills for eligible 16 to 25-year-olds. Each team recruits a mix of 16 to 25-year-olds of different abilities and backgrounds, including employees sponsored by their employer. We fund the team programme. Providers in partnership with the Prince’s Trust run and manage it on a local basis.</p>
</div>

<p>In order to deliver the team programme, you must get approval from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.princes-trust.org.uk/about-the-trust/qualifications/employment-teamwork-community/funding-team-qualifications" rel="external">Prince’s Trust</a>.</p>

<p>For eligible learners aged 19 to 25, we fund the team programme through the ESFA’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-education-budget-aeb-funding-rates-and-formula-2022-to-2023">AEB funding methodology</a>. Please also refer to the Princes Trust section in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-education-budget-aeb-funding-rates-and-formula-2022-to-2023">AEB funding rates and formula 2022 to 2023</a> guidance.</p>

<p>For eligible learners aged 16 to 19, the team programme is funded through the ESFA’s 16 to 19 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/funding-education-for-16-to-19-year-olds#16-to-19-funding:-how-it-works">funding methodology</a>.</p>

<h2>Support funding</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The ESFA funded AEB’s overarching aim is to support as many eligible adult learners as possible to access learning. Some learners will need additional support to start or stay in learning.</p>

<p>Where you identify that a learner has a learning difficulty and/or disability, or a financial barrier, your ESFA funded AEB allocation enables you to claim learning support and/or learner support funding to meet the additional needs of learners.</p>
</div>

<h3>Learning support</h3>

<p>Learning support is available to meet the cost of putting in place a reasonable adjustment, as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents" rel="external">Equality Act 2010</a>, for learners who have an identified learning difficulty and/or disability, to achieve their learning goal.</p>

<p>Learning support must not be used to deal with everyday difficulties that are not directly associated with a learner’s learning on their programme.</p>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>carry out a thorough assessment to identify the support the learner needs</li>
  <li>agree and record the outcome of your assessment in the evidence pack</li>
  <li>record all outcomes on the evidence pack and keep all evidence of the assessment of the needs, planned and actual delivery</li>
  <li>report in the ILR that a learner has a learning support need associated with an identified learning aim, by entering code LSF1 in the ‘Learning Delivery Funding and Monitoring’ field and entering the corresponding dates in the ‘Date applies from’ and ‘Date applies to’ fields. This does not apply to 16 to 18 traineeships without a 16 to 18 study programme or non-formula funded community learning</li>
</ul>

<p>All learning support claims must be reported in the ILR. To claim any costs that exceed the fixed monthly rate you must also use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/earnings-adjustment-statement-eas-2021-to-2022">earnings adjustment statement</a> (EAS).</p>

<p>You must keep evidence of these additional costs in the evidence pack. You must only record the excess amount on the EAS, not the whole learning support cost.</p>

<p>There are 2 exceptions when you may claim the entire cost through the EAS. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where the learning aim is delivered in less than one calendar month</li>
  <li>16 to 18 traineeships without a 16 to 19 study programme</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exceptional learning support claims above £19,000</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If a learner needs significant levels of support to start or continue learning and has support costs of more than £19,000 in a funding year, you can claim exceptional learning support (ELS).</p>

<p>Learners aged 19 to 24 who require significant levels of support should have an EHC plan provided by their local authority and, therefore, would access funding from their local authority.</p>
</div>

<p>You must submit ELS claims at the beginning of the learner’s programme, or when you identify the learner requires support costs more than £19,000 in a funding year, by completing and sending the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/exceptional-learning-support-cost-form">ELS claims document</a>.</p>

<p>To claim exceptional learning support for a learner aged 19 to 24 you must confirm why the individual does not have an EHC plan. This should be a letter or email from the learner’s local authority stating the reason(s) why the individual does not need an EHC plan.</p>

<p>When you claim exceptional learning support you must explain why you have claimed the amount you have, which would be linked to the learner’s assessment and planned learning support claim. You must only claim amounts for your costs of providing the support to the learner and not include any indirect costs or overheads.</p>

<h3>Learner support</h3>

<p>Learner support is available to provide financial support for individuals with a specific financial hardship preventing them from taking part/continuing in learning. Before you award support to a learner, you must identify their needs within the following ‘categories’.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hardship funding – general financial support for financially disadvantaged learners to support participation learning</li>
  <li>20+ childcare funding – for learners aged 20 or older on the first day of learning who are at risk of not starting or continuing learning because of childcare costs</li>
  <li>Residential Access funding – to support ESFA funded AEB learners (set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#fund">who we fund</a> section) where they need to live away from home in order to access provision</li>
  <li>ICT devices and connectivity - to support disadvantaged learners who cannot undertake online delivery</li>
</ul>

<p>You must not claim more than 5% of your total Learner Support (including 19 to 24 traineeships) as administration expenditure. You must document your process for managing your administration costs over the current funding year and record, report and retain evidence on spending for each of the categories. You must follow these rules and claim learner support using the appropriate method as set out below.</p>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have criteria for how you will administer and distribute your funds; these must reflect the principles of equality and diversity and be available to learners and to us on request</li>
  <li>assess and record the learner’s needs, demonstrating the need for support – you must record this information and retain in the evidence pack</li>
  <li>report the appropriate Learner Support Reason codes in the ‘Learner Funding and Monitoring’ fields in the ILR. This does not apply to non-formula community learning</li>
  <li>complete 3 funding claims throughout the year in line with funding claims guidance if you have a grant contract, else record delivery through the earning adjustment statement each month if on a contract for services</li>
  <li>consider the availability of other support for learners, for example from Jobcentre Plus</li>
  <li>make it clear to learners it is their responsibility to tell the Department for Work and Pensions about any learner support they are receiving from you, as learner support payments may affect their eligibility to state benefits</li>
  <li>use either AEB or loans bursary to support specific provision funded by either AEB or ALL where a learner is on 2 courses at the same time</li>
</ul>

<p>You must not use learner support funds for any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>essential equipment or facilities if the learner is eligible for full funding with the exception of the items covered in the first clause of the <a class="govuk-link" href="#_hardship">Hardship</a> section and the flexibilities in <a class="govuk-link" href="#connect">ICT devices and connectivity</a>
</li>
  <li>a learner in custody or released on temporary licence</li>
  <li>a learner carrying out a higher education course or learning aims fully funded from other sources</li>
  <li>to pay attendance allowances or achievement and attendance bonuses</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hardship</h3>

<p>You can use hardship funds for the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>course-related costs, including course trips, books and equipment (where costs are not included in the funding rate)</li>
  <li>support with domestic emergencies and emergency accommodation provided by others, or by providing items or services or cash direct to the learner, this can be in the form of a grant or repayable loan provided by you</li>
  <li>transport costs (but not make a block contribution to post-16 transport partnerships or routinely fund transport costs covered in the local authority’s legal duty for learners of sixth-form age)</li>
  <li>examination fees</li>
  <li>accreditation fees, professional membership fees and any fees or charges due to external bodies</li>
  <li>your registration fees</li>
  <li>to support learners on a traineeship including the work placement element</li>
</ul>

<p>In exceptional circumstances, you can use hardship funds to assist with course fees for learners who need financial support to start or stay in learning.</p>

<p>If an asylum seeker is eligible for provision, you may provide learner support in the form of course-related books, equipment, cash payments or a travel pass.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">20+ </span> childcare</h3>

<p>You can only use childcare funding to pay for childcare with a childminder, provider or childminder agency, registered with Ofsted.</p>

<p>You must not use childcare funding to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fund informal childcare, such as that provided by a relative</li>
  <li>set up childcare places or to make a financial contribution to the costs of a crèche</li>
  <li>fund childcare for learners aged under 20 on the first day of learning; instead you must direct them to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/care-to-learn-guide-for-the-2022-to-2023-academic-year">‘Care to Learn’ programme</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You must not use childcare for those aged 20 years or older to top up childcare payments for those receiving ‘Care to Learn’ payments.</p>

<h3>Residential access funding</h3>

<p>You can use residential access funding to support ESFA funded AEB learners who meet eligibility criteria in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#fund">who we fund</a> section, where they need to live away from home, for example to access specialist provision which involves a residential element, or to support learners who cannot access provision locally. You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>set out the criteria and procedures for considering and agreeing applications for support from your residential access funds</li>
  <li>only pay for travel costs for learners who are awarded residential access funding in exceptional circumstances</li>
  <li>only claim residential access funding for the period the learner is resident, this could be in accommodation you own or manage or other accommodation which you have agreed to fund in line with your criteria</li>
  <li>ensure costs claimed represent value for money for the local area</li>
  <li>where you have your own residential facilities, you must publish your rates</li>
</ul>

<h3>ICT devices and connectivity</h3>

<p>You can support disadvantaged learners who are undertaking classroom or blended learning to continue to participate via online learning where the learner does not have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>internet access at home, and/or</li>
  <li>a suitable device, for example a laptop or tablet, to compete the necessary online course work</li>
</ul>

<p>You must secure value for money when purchasing IT devices and/or internet access including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>deploying any unused devices before you purchase new ones</li>
  <li>exploring options to access low cost second hand or recycled devices</li>
  <li>avoiding entering long term contract arrangements</li>
  <li>holding a record of actual costs for any IT devices and/or internet access bought for this purpose and make this available to us, if asked</li>
</ul>

<p>IT devices you purchase must only be loaned out to learners and returned at the end of their learning aim to allow them to be re-used by other learners. Learners must sign a declaration, confirming:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they will return the device when their online learning aim(s) is complete, or if they leave before completing their learning</li>
  <li>they will return the device in the same condition in which they received it</li>
</ul>

<p>You must maintain an up-to-date record of the loan and return of devices to learners.</p>

<p>You must record the following evidence in the learner’s evidence pack:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the outcome of the assessment undertaken to identify the learner’s individual needs</li>
  <li>the learner declaration referred to above</li>
</ul>

<h2>Job outcome payments</h2>

<p>For fully funded learners who are unemployed (including traineeships), we will pay 50% of the achievement payment if they start a job before achieving the learning aim. If the learner then achieves the learning aim, we will pay the remaining achievement payment. The following conditions apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the learner must provide you with evidence through a declaration, that they have a job for at least 16 hours or more a week for 4 consecutive weeks</li>
  <li>where the learner was claiming benefits relating to unemployment, they must also declare that they have stopped claiming these</li>
</ul>

<h2>Section 3 – traineeships</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Traineeships are a national programme which provides 16 to 24-year-olds resident in England with the skills and work experience needed to progress into apprenticeships, employment and further learning.</p>

<p>The traineeship core offer includes the following mandatory elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>work-preparation training</li>
  <li>substantial work-placement element, and</li>
  <li>English, maths, ESOL or digital skills as necessary</li>
</ul>

<p>Providers can also offer a <a class="govuk-link" href="#element">flexible element</a>.</p>

<p>Guidance for providers and employers can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supporting-young-people-to-develop-the-skills-for-apprenticeships-and-sustainable-employment-framework-for-delivery">Traineeships Framework for Delivery</a> .</p>

<p>ESFA will continue to fund eligible individuals for the traineeship programme across England, including individuals resident in a devolved authority area in England, set out in the ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="#devolution">devolution of adult education functions’</a> section.</p>

<p>We fund:</p>

<ul>
  <li>traineeships for 16 to 18-year-olds (and 19 to 25-year-olds with an EHC Plan) through the ESFA’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/funding-education-for-16-to-19-year-olds#16-to-19-funding:-how-it-works">16 to 19 funding methodology</a>, and</li>

</ul>

<h2>Core Offer</h2>

<h3>Work preparation training</h3>

<p>You must plan to deliver both the work preparation training and work placement to claim traineeship learning aim funding.</p>

<p>If work preparation training leads to a qualification, you must offer the qualification from an Ofqual-regulated awarding organisation.</p>

<p>Work preparation training must address the employability needs of the learner and could include writing CVs, preparing for interviews, searching for jobs and developing interpersonal and communication skills.</p>

<p>Non-regulated learning must be a learning aim categorised as ‘Work Preparation-SFA traineeships’ on <a class="govuk-link" href="#aim">find a learning aim</a>. These aims will not attract additional funding as they are included in the single traineeship rate for work placement and work preparation training.</p>

<p>For 16 to 18-year-olds, qualifications must be approved on <a class="govuk-link" href="#aim">find a learning aim</a> for 16 to 18 funding in the 2022 to 2023 funding year.</p>

<h3>Work placement</h3>

<p>A learner’s work-placement must take place with an employer and allow the learner to develop new workplace knowledge, skills and behaviours. In total, the work placement element must last at least 70 hours and must not be simulated learning in an artificial environment.</p>

<p>You must report the employer’s details in the ILR within 60 days of the traineeship start date. The work placement does not need to start within 60 days and can be recorded as a future start date on the ILR.</p>

<p>An individual can have separate work placements in different organisations. These must last at least 2 weeks with each employer, and at least 70 hours in total with each placement supporting progression linked to their learning plan.</p>

<p>For learners on Jobseeker’s Allowance or Universal Credit, work-placements can be between 70 to 240 hours (or extended up to 320 hours if an offer of an apprenticeship place is offered and accepted).</p>

<p>The employer must offer at the end of each work-placement (which you must evidence) either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a formal interview for a job or apprenticeship vacancy, plus feedback</li>
  <li>an exit interview, written feedback and evidence of the learner’s time and activities during the work-placement</li>
</ul>

<p>For 16 to 18-year-olds, the work placement must be the most substantial element of the programme which must be reported in the ILR as the core aim in a learner’s traineeship. Where the core aim does not occupy the majority of the hours, for example where a vocational qualification is included in the flexible element of a traineeship, the learning plan must confirm how the whole traineeship is associated with becoming work ready and progressing to a planned Apprenticeship or other employment.</p>

<h3>English and maths, ESOL or digital skills</h3>

<p>You must assess all 16 to 18 and 19 to 24 learners for English and maths in order to claim traineeship funding, in line with the criteria set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#over">English and maths for those aged 19 and over</a> section.</p>

<p>You must support learners who have not previously achieved an English and/or maths GCSE grade 4 (C), or higher, or level 2 Functional Skills qualification to improve their skills and progress towards them. You may use English and maths stepping-stone qualifications (including components, where applicable), as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#over">English and maths for those aged 19 and over</a> section.</p>

<p>For 16 to 18-year-olds, you must follow both of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>condition of funding set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/funding-education-for-16-to-19-year-olds">16 to 19 study programmes</a>
</li>
  <li>English and maths condition of funding set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-maths-and-english-condition-of-funding">16 to 19 funding: maths and English condition of funding</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can continue to fund a learner to complete their English and maths qualifications beyond completion of their work-preparation training and work-placement.</p>

<p>You must support learners to achieve ESOL qualifications where necessary.</p>

<p>You must support trainees aged 19+ to improve digital skills where they are assessed as below level 1 through the <a class="govuk-link" href="#digital">digital entitlement</a>. You should also support the development of any digital skills that are part of an occupational standard published by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/" rel="external">Institute for Apprenticeships &amp; Technical Education</a></p>

<h2>Flexible element</h2>

<p>We fund the flexible element in line with the general funding and ESFA funded AEB eligibility rules set out in this document.</p>

<p>You can offer activities, including appropriate technical qualifications and skills required by the local labour market that will help the learner move into work or remove a barrier to them entering work. This must exclude work preparation training and ESOL learning aims.</p>

<p>To support progression to apprenticeships, the traineeship should provide vocational learning elements that are occupationally focussed and that prepare the learner for the relevant occupational standard published by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/" rel="external">the IATE</a>. These occupational standards are used in combination with end-point assessment plans as apprenticeship standards.</p>

<p>All elements of the programme (including work placement) are subject to a maximum of 35 hours activity each week to meet the requirements of state benefit rules.</p>

<p>For 16 to 18-year-olds, qualifications must be approved on <a class="govuk-link" href="#find">find a learning aim</a> for 16 to 18 funding in the 2022 to 2023 funding year.</p>

<h2>Traineeship programme duration</h2>

<p>The work placement, work preparation and flexible elements must be completed between a minimum of 6 weeks and a maximum of 12 months.</p>

<h2>Evidence</h2>

<p>The evidence pack for a traineeship must contain evidence of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a formal interview and feedback to the learner, where there is a vacancy</li>
  <li>an exit interview, written feedback, and evidence of the time spent on, and activities performed during, work placements, when there is no vacancy</li>
  <li>progression to a defined positive outcome within 6 months</li>
  <li>information on employer incentive payments will be published separately in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/traineeships--2">traineeships collection</a> on GOV.UK. This will include any additional requirements for the evidence pack</li>
</ul>

<h2>Outcomes</h2>

<p>The following are recognised outcomes, if they are achieved and evidenced within 6 months of completing the traineeship:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an apprenticeship start that meets the minimum qualifying days evidenced by ILR records or a self-declaration by the learner</li>
  <li>a job, including being self-employed, for at least 16 hours a week and for 8 consecutive weeks within 6 months of leaving a traineeship, evidenced by a declaration from the learner or their employer</li>
  <li>progression to another English or maths qualification, which is a level higher than that achieved in the traineeship</li>
  <li>
    <p>further learning recognised in the 16 to 19 performance tables (for 19 to 24-year-olds, this includes qualifications as part of the legal entitlement), if:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>it meets minimum <a class="govuk-link" href="#qualify">qualifying days for funding</a>, or</li>
      <li>a learner self-declares they are studying a level 2 or level 3 qualification with at least 150 guided learning hours</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The achievement payment for the combined work-placement and work- preparation (single) rate is based on reporting a successful outcome on the ILR in the programme aim. You must not claim <a class="govuk-link" href="#jobs">job outcome payments</a> for this combined rate.</p>

<h2>Support funding</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#support">Learning support</a> for traineeships is available.</p>
