<p>This guidance applies from 15 December 2021 and replaces previous guidance on care home visiting.</p>

<p>This guidance applies to residential care homes. There is separate <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supported-living-services-during-coronavirus-covid-19/covid-19-guidance-for-supported-living">guidance for supported living and extra care settings</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>We expect and encourage providers to facilitate visits wherever possible, and to do so in a risk-managed way.</p>

<p>Visiting is an integral part of care home life. It is vitally important for maintaining the health, wellbeing and quality of life of residents. Visiting is also crucial for family and friends to maintain contact and life-long relationships with their loved ones, and to contribute to their support and care.</p>

<p>People living in care homes are typically more vulnerable to severe illness as a result of coronavirus (COVID-19). While vaccination is proving very effective, we are still seeing some cases of severe illness, hospitalisation and death of care home residents who have been vaccinated. Caution is advised as we learn more about real-world vaccine effectiveness and disease severity of the Omicron variant of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Additional measures are therefore in place to facilitate visiting while keeping care home staff and residents safe. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>limiting the number of visitors who can visit regularly</li>
  <li>infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) measures</li>
  <li>individual risk assessments</li>
  <li>testing arrangements</li>
  <li>isolation on return from some high-risk activities out of the home</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance is based on regularly reviewed clinical advice.</p>

<p>This guidance covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>visits that should happen in all circumstances</li>
  <li>safe visiting practices</li>
  <li>when different visiting arrangements are needed</li>
  <li>sources of information and support</li>
</ul>

<p>The key things to know about care home visiting are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>every care home resident can nominate up to 3 visitors who will be able to enter the care home for regular visits (this number does not include essential care givers or preschool age children)</li>
  <li>visitors should make arrangements with care homes in advance of the visit, so that care providers can manage the number of people attending at any one time to ensure safe visiting practices can be maintained taking into account the size and layout of the care home</li>
  <li>the duration of visits should not be limited if safe visiting practices can be maintained</li>
  <li>visits should take place in a room most practical and comfortable for the resident (for example, residents with dementia may be more comfortable in their own room with familiar belongings)</li>
  <li>visitors should receive a negative lateral flow test result and report it on the day of their visit, either by conducting the test at home or when they arrive at the care home – essential care givers need to follow the additional testing arrangements outlined below</li>
  <li>every care home resident should be supported to have an identified essential care giver (in addition to their named visitors) who may visit the home to offer companionship or help with care needs – essential care givers should be able to visit inside the care home even during periods of self-isolation and outbreak affecting the care home</li>
  <li>during an outbreak, care providers should also continue to offer visits in well-ventilated spaces with substantial screens, visiting pods or from behind windows – rooms should be left to ventilate with external doors and windows open between uses wherever possible, while aiming to maintain a comfortable temperature for residents and visitors</li>
  <li>subject to a risk assessment by the health protection team (<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>), outbreak controls may be in place for up to 28 days following the last positive case especially as we learn more about real-world vaccine effectiveness and disease severity of the Omicron variant</li>
  <li>physical contact should be enabled to help health and wellbeing, as long as <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures are in place, such as visiting in a ventilated space, using appropriate personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) for the visit, and hand washing before and after holding hands – gloves are not needed for handholding and stringent adherence to hand washing is advised</li>
  <li>residents should be supported to undertake visits out of the care home as appropriate:
    <ul>
      <li>residents who have received at least 2 doses of the vaccine, or are exempt from vaccination, should not have to isolate following most visits out of the care home if they follow the correct testing regime</li>
      <li>residents who have not received at least 2 doses of the vaccine, and are not exempt from vaccination, should isolate for 14 days following a visit out</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>all residents should isolate following an emergency stay in hospital, if they test positive for COVID-19 or following a visit that has been deemed high-risk following an individual risk assessment by the care home</li>
  <li>vaccination is one of our best defences to combat infection. The COVID-19 vaccine significantly reduces the transmission of infection, particularly after 2 or more doses. It is strongly recommended that residents and visitors receive 2 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, plus their booster especially in light of the emergence of the Omicron variant. The data shows that booster doses are required to provide higher levels of protection against symptomatic infection. If eligible, visitors should also get their flu jab when it is offered to them</li>
  <li>visitors should not enter the care home if they are feeling unwell, even if they have tested negative for COVID-19 and are fully vaccinated and have received their booster. Transmissible viruses such as flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and norovirus can be just as dangerous to care home residents as COVID-19. If visitors have any symptoms that suggest other transmissible viruses and infections, such as cough, high temperature, diarrhoea or vomiting, they should avoid the care home until at least 5 days after they feel better</li>
  <li>visitors who are not legally required to self-isolate are advised against visiting the care home (for 10 days) if they have been identified as a close contact of someone with COVID-19, unless absolutely necessary, even if they have been fully vaccinated. Where visits do occur, visitors should have received a negative <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result prior to their visit, and a negative lateral flow test result earlier in the day of their visit</li>
  <li>anyone who is fully vaccinated, and has been identified as a close contact of a confirmed case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, does not need to self-isolate if they receive a negative <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result and take daily rapid lateral fow tests until 10 days after their last exposure to the positive case</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Visits in all circumstances</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Essential care givers</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Key message</h4>
<p>All residents should be enabled to have an essential care giver, who should be able to visit more often. Essential care givers will need to be supported to follow the same testing arrangements as care home staff. When essential care givers are providing direct personal care, they should follow the same PPE and infection control arrangements as care home staff.</p>
</div>

<p>The essential care giver role is vitally important to supporting residents’ health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>Every resident should be supported to choose an essential care giver to benefit from companionship and additional care and support provided by someone with whom they have a personal relationship. Essential care givers do not count towards the limit of 3 visitors per resident.</p>

<p>Essential care givers should be allowed to continue to visit during periods of isolation or when there is an outbreak.</p>

<p>There are exceptional circumstances where someone may need the additional support of more than one essential care giver and this should be considered (for example, if a nominated essential care giver is unwell).</p>

<p>Essential care givers will need to follow the following testing arrangements. Essential care givers must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take a weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test and share the result with the home. Care homes should use their existing <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> stocks to test essential care givers and these should be registered as ‘staff’ tests using the care home unique organisation number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>) and be returned via courier with other staff tests</li>
  <li>take a minimum of 3 lateral flow tests a week: one lateral flow test on the same day as a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, one lateral flow test 2 to 3 days later, and and then again after another 2 to 3 days. These rapid lateral flow tests can be done onsite, at an asymptomatic testing site (<abbr title="asymptomatic testing site">ATS</abbr>) or at home. These tests should be reported as ‘visitor’ using the care home <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>
</li>
  <li>in line with care home staff, be subject to additional testing should the care home be engaged in rapid response daily testing or outbreak testing. If this includes lateral flow tests, these can be done at home. This testing must be conducted in accordance with the guidance for care home staff on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-in-adult-care-homes" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing, rapid lateral flow testing (including rapid response testing) and outbreak testing</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Essential care givers should read and follow the appropriate guidance for using <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in the different care scenarios laid out in the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes">how to work safely in care homes</a>. <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> recommendations are different depending on whether direct personal care or companionship is being provided. More information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-use-for-non-aerosol-generating-procedures">how to safely put on and remove <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr></a> can be found in the guidance and visitors should also be encouraged to view the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes/covid-19-putting-on-and-removing-ppe-a-guide-for-care-homes-video" class="govuk-link">video demonstration</a>. It is sensible for the essential care giver to be supported by an experienced member of staff as they put on and take off the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> on the first few visits to ensure they are doing so correctly.</p>

<p>Essential care givers should be briefed on the relevant <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures in the areas of the care home they will have access to, and reminded of the importance of remaining at least one metre from staff and any other residents they might encounter, though this may differ subject to a local risk assessment.</p>

<p>The care home and essential care giver should also agree any other relevant arrangements – for example, managing immediate visits (if the resident is distressed and the essential care giver is needed urgently to settle them) and communal areas such as staff rest areas that the essential care visitor should not enter.</p>

<p>Clinical care and medical tasks such as the administering of medication and physiotherapy remain the overarching responsibility of the care home.</p>

<p>Where the resident lacks the capacity to choose their essential care giver, the care home should discuss the situation with any attorney or deputy, the resident’s family, friends and others who may usually have visited the resident or are identified in the care plan. In this situation, a person can only be nominated as an essential care giver if this has been determined to be in the resident’s best interests in accordance with the empowering framework of the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/9/contents" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Mental Capacity Act (<abbr title="Mental Capacity Act 2005">MCA</abbr>) 2005</a>. Consideration should be given to whether there is an attorney or deputy with appropriate authority to make this decision.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> End of life visits</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Key message</h4>
<p>Visits at the end of life should always be supported. Families and residents should be supported to plan end of life visiting carefully, with the assumption that visiting will be enabled to happen not just towards the very end of life, and that discussions with the family take place in good time.</p>

<p>Visitors for visits of this nature should be tested using lateral flow tests. For information on how to test, see the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-lateral-flow-testing-of-visitors-in-care-homes/care-home-lfd-testing-of-visitors-guidance" class="govuk-link">rapid lateral flow testing in adult social care settings</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>End of life care (for residents in care homes) means identifying early those who are in their last year of life, and offering them the support to live as well as possible and to then die with dignity. <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/end-of-life-care/what-it-involves-and-when-it-starts/" class="govuk-link">NHS guidance on end of life care</a> is available to support this process, as well as <a href="https://www.bgs.org.uk/resources/covid-19-managing-the-covid-19-pandemic-in-care-homes#anchor-nav-8-end-of-life-care" rel="external" class="govuk-link">advice from the British Geriatric Society</a>. There is a role for care home staff to support residents with end of life care, and visiting is an essential factor in this.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/enhanced-health-in-care-homes-framework/">enhanced health in care homes service provides a framework</a> for support from general practice, the care home clinical leads and local multidisciplinary teams (which may include community nurses and professionals as well as specialised palliative care teams).</p>

<p>This support involves early identification, as well as a personalised care and support planning approach with good communication with the individual, their relatives and care home staff through the weekly home care round. The <a href="https://www.bgs.org.uk/resources/end-of-life-care-in-frailty-care-homes" class="govuk-link" rel="external">British Geriatric Society advice</a> can support communication.</p>

<p>As a resident approaches the last months, weeks and days of their life, it continues to be important to communicate well to enable good and timely decisions around care. Planning these visiting arrangements should proceed from the assumption that visits are enabled in the final months and weeks of life – not just the final days or hours – albeit recognising that these timelines can be difficult to determine with accuracy.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> Professional visits in the care home</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Key message</h4>
<p>Health, social care and other professionals need to visit care home residents to provide services. Care homes should facilitate these visits while ensuring necessary testing, IPC and PPE measures are adhered to. The arrangements for visiting professionals differ from those for family and friends visiting the care home.</p>
</div>

<p>Any professionals visiting a care home – such as healthcare workers, tradespeople and hairdressers – are required to show they are vaccinated or exempt before entering the home.  This includes staff who may work or volunteer in the care home on a part time or occasional basis to deliver non-care-related services such as maintenance or activities.</p>

<p>Exemptions include medical grounds where a person should not be vaccinated for clinical reasons (including some situations where a vaccine has been received overseas) or if the professional is providing emergency services. Emergency services in the NHS include staff deployed as part of an emergency ambulance response, including first responders. The NHS provides more information on <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/publication/vaccinations-for-nhs-staff-entering-care-homes/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">vaccinations for NHS staff entering a care home</a>.</p>

<p>The vaccination requirement only applies to people who go inside a care home. Individuals who are not entering the building will not need to show vaccination status.</p>

<p>Further information, including on exemptions, can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vaccination-of-people-working-or-deployed-in-care-homes-operational-guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccination-of-people-working-or-deployed-in-care-homes-operational-guidance" class="govuk-link">vaccination of people working or deployed in care homes: operational guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Visiting professionals will also need to have a negative test within 72 hours of visiting. Refer to the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-in-adult-care-homes/testing-for-professionals-visiting-care-homes">testing for health professional visits</a> for further information on testing requirements (which differ from those outlined for family and friends in this guidance).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Safe visiting practices</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>)</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Key message</h4>
<p>Providers should facilitate visiting in a way that allows them to manage the risk of COVID-19 and other infections, such as flu, in line with the principles set out below.</p>
</div>

<p>It is essential to safe visiting that visiting happens within a wider care home environment of robust <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>. Visitors should make arrangements with the care home before visiting to ensure adequate <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures are in place.</p>

<p>The provider’s policy should set out the precautions that will be taken in respect of infection control during visits, placing this within the context of the care home’s wider infection prevention and control practice. Care homes should ensure that these are communicated in a clear and accessible way to visitors.</p>

<p>The Care Quality Commission (<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>) has included adherence to infection control measures for visitors as part of its infection prevention control inspections. It is vital that providers are meeting required standards.</p>

<p>The following precautions should be followed when visitors are inside the care home. All visitors should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>follow any guidance and procedures put in place by the care provider to ensure compliance with <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> – therefore, copies of the guidance and procedures should at least be available to be read by visitors on arrival</li>
  <li>be reminded that following <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures (for example, hand washing) is essential even if <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is worn, they have been vaccinated and produced a negative test</li>
  <li>be supported therefore to ensure appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is always worn and used correctly, and they follow good hand hygiene – care homes are being provided with <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to meet visiting requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>Visitors should wear a face mask when visiting the care home, particularly when moving through the care home. COVID-19 spreads through the air by droplets and aerosols that are exhaled from the nose and mouth of an infected person. Face masks reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19, especially when there is close contact between people in enclosed, poorly ventilated and crowded spaces. It is important that face masks fit securely around the face to safely cover the mouth and the nose.</p>

<p>We recognise that individual approaches are needed as the wearing of face masks may cause distress to some residents. In these circumstances, face masks may be removed when not in communal areas of the care home. However, other mitigations should be considered, including limiting close contact, clear visors and increased ventilation (while maintaining a comfortable temperature).</p>

<p>It is important to seek advice and support from the care home management team at an early stage if the measures show signs of causing distress for individual residents. If face masks are to be removed, a comprehensive risk assessment should be undertaken for each resident identifying the specific risks to them, care home staff and visitors to develop appropriate strategies to safely manage those risks. It is important <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items are not altered in any way as this could reduce their effectiveness in protecting staff or residents.</p>

<p>It is not usually recommended to wear a face mask while undertaking visits outdoors. However, a risk assessment should be undertaken, and mitigations considered if visitors may be in very close contact with someone or if there is likely to be contact with bodily fluids, for example due to someone spitting or coughing.</p>

<p>Visitors should be reminded, and provided facilities, to wash their hands for 20 seconds or use hand sanitiser on entering and leaving the home, and to catch coughs and sneezes in tissues and clean their hands after disposal of tissues.</p>

<p>Visitors should limit contact with other residents and staff, and maintain as much distance as possible. Regular conversations with staff can be arranged over the phone following in-person visits.</p>

<p>Communal areas can be used for visits if there is only one visiting group using the area at a time. Individual groups may wish to remove face masks to share a meal together in communal areas, providing no other people are in the area.</p>

<p>Care homes should support NHS Test and Trace by keeping a temporary record (including address and phone number) of current and previous residents, staff and visitors (including the person or people they interact with – for example, staff members or visiting professionals), as well as keeping track of visitor numbers and staff.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Risk assessments</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Key message</h4>
<p>When developing their visiting policies, providers should undertake individual risk assessments to assess the rights and needs of individual residents, as well as any specific vulnerabilities that are outlined in the resident’s care plan, and to consider the role that visiting can play in this.</p>
</div>

<p>Providers must develop a risk assessment that assesses how the care home can best manage visits safely, considering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the needs of their residents and visitors</li>
  <li>residents’ rights to visits and the important role visitors play in residents’ wellbeing</li>
  <li>what is possible within the layout and facilities within the home to ensure that mixing between visitors is limited as much as possible</li>
  <li>where and how visitors might be received on arrival at the home to avoid mixing with other visitors, staff or residents</li>
  <li>the precautions that will be taken to prevent infection during visits (including <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> use, ventilation, limiting close contact and hand washing)</li>
  <li>legal duties relevant to visiting, including the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/23/contents/enacted" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Care Act 2014</a>, <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/9/contents">Mental Capacity Act 2005</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/contents" class="govuk-link">Human Rights Act 1998</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Residents and their loved ones should always be involved in developing individual risk assessments.</p>

<p>When developing risk assessments for residents who are assessed as lacking the relevant mental capacity, providers will need to consider any appropriate legal frameworks, including the <abbr title="Mental Capacity Act 2005">MCA</abbr>. Decisions should be made individually for residents and blanket decisions should not be made for groups of people. The resident should be involved as far as possible in decision-making, and providers should consult with their family and friends on what the person would want for themselves.</p>

<h4>Key message</h4>
<p>This guidance applies to family and friends visiting care homes. There is different guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-in-adult-care-homes/testing-for-professionals-visiting-care-homes" class="govuk-link">testing for professionals visiting care homes</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Before receiving and testing visitors, it is important that care providers consider all the necessary practicalities of implementing a visitor testing regime and put in place relevant safeguards. Further information detailing the practicalities of administering tests and reporting results, including simple guides for visitors, can be found in the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-adult-social-care-settings">rapid lateral flow testing in adult social care settings</a>. Each pack of tests will also come with instructions.</p>

<p>Testing onsite at the care home is preferable for assurance purposes. Where testing will be fully or partly conducted onsite, care home managers will need to set up a testing area as described in the guidance above. However, recognising that individuals now have access to testing through other routes and visitors may be travelling long distances to visit, care home managers can allow visitors to provide evidence of a recent negative test undertaken through other means, if the test has been taken that same day. Testing arrangements are different for visiting professionals (as outlined in section 1.3).</p>

<p>Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) rules state that care homes are not able to distribute packs of 25 tests to visitors to self-test.</p>

<p>When considering the most appropriate testing route, managers should consider any additional risks that may arise from testing off-site, as well as the confidence of visitors to carry out tests away from the care home. This may include factors such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>visitors inaccurately conducting or reporting lateral flow testing themselves</li>
  <li>the increased risk of visitors needing to take public transport to a testing site, particularly where it is far from the setting, or coming into contact with other people</li>
  <li>the need for visitors to have a mobile phone or email address to receive the result of their test</li>
</ul>

<p>Where visitors will be self-testing, managers may wish to supervise the first few tests on-site and provide support to ensure visitors are confident conducting the tests at home, and they are being completed and reported satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Wherever the test is conducted, it must be done on the day of the visit. Once the visitor has reported the test, they will receive confirmation of their result by text message (SMS) and email to show proof of result. Visitors should show proof of a negative test result before every visit, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an email or text from NHS Test and Trace</li>
  <li>a date-stamped photo of the test cartridge itself</li>
</ul>

<p>If visitors are not able to produce a negative test, they may be asked to reschedule or be prepared to take the test onsite.</p>

<p>Care homes do not need to retain records of proof. All tests done both at the care home and when self-testing at home should be reported to the <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> of the care home, and managers should ensure visitors are aware of their <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> and the legal duty to report the result. This will support NHS Test and Trace and public health teams to better support care homes to understand the transmission of COVID-19 and prevent outbreaks.</p>

<p>If a visitor tests positive, they must immediately self-isolate, following government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">guidance for households with possible or confirmed COVID-19 infection</a>. If the test has been taken away from their own home, when returning home, they should avoid public transport if possible and wear a mask. Visitors should also complete a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, which should be provided to them by the care home if testing onsite, or ordered from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">government portal</a> or by calling 119. Instructions on how to conduct the test and return it will be provided with the test kit. This can be returned either through a courier or through a Royal Mail priority post box.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Visits out of the care home</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Key message</h4>
<p>We expect and encourage providers to facilitate residents to take part in visits out of the care home. This could be for a short walk, to attend a place of worship or for a longer visit including an overnight stay to see family and friends.</p>
</div>

<p>If a resident with the relevant mental capacity wishes to go out, then in most cases members of staff at the home cannot lawfully prevent them from doing so.</p>

<p>If a resident is assessed as lacking the relevant mental capacity to decide to go out, they should still be involved in decision-making as much as possible and their family and friends consulted. The decision-maker should, where necessary, make a best interests decision under the <abbr title="Mental Capacity Act 2005">MCA</abbr> regarding this decision, following the best interests decision checklist as set out under the <abbr title="Mental Capacity Act 2005">MCA</abbr>. Providers should always consider less restrictive options. In certain cases, these arrangements may amount to a ‘deprivation of liberty’, in which case legal authorisation is required and it is important that decision-makers comply with their legal requirements for this. The NHS provides more <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/making-decisions-for-someone-else/mental-capacity-act/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">information on applying the <abbr title="Mental Capacity Act 2005">MCA</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Care home residents who have had 2 doses of the vaccine, or are exempt from vaccination, should not have to isolate for 14 days after most visits out of the care home, but should take a lateral flow test every other day for 14 days following the visit out.</p>

<p>Care home residents who have not received at least 2 doses of the vaccine, and are not exempt from vaccination, should not go on visits out of the care home unless they isolate for 14 days after the visit out. This is a necessary precaution following clinical advice in light of a more transmissive variant of COVID-19.</p>

<p>There are certain types of activity where the risks are inherently higher and the advice is that, in these cases, the resident should self-isolate for 14 days on their return to the care home regardless of their vaccine status. This is to ensure that, in the event they have unknowingly become infected while out of the home, they minimise the chances of passing that infection on to other residents and staff. These activities are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>emergency stays in hospital – as they are higher risk than an elective admission</li>
  <li>visits assessed to be high-risk following an individual risk assessment by the care home</li>
</ul>

<p>For planned hospital overnight stays (such as elective admissions), residents do not need to isolate upon return provided they meet the following criteria. Residents should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be fully vaccinated and have had their booster jab when eligible</li>
  <li>receive a negative <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test following their return to the care home (and isolate until the result is received)</li>
  <li>complete testing requirements as detailed in the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes" class="govuk-link">admission and care of residents in a care home during COVID-19</a>
</li>
  <li>avoid contact with other highly vulnerable residents in the care home</li>
</ul>

<p>If there is an outbreak of an infection that originated in hospital in the part of the hospital where the resident stayed, refer to guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes">admission and care of residents in a care home during COVID-19</a>. Separate guidance is available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes#providing-care-to-residents">planning visits that residents may need to make to a hospital or other healthcare setting</a>.</p>

<p>When going out of the care home residents should manage the risk by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>avoiding visiting people they do not usually spend time with regularly</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>avoiding visits out that involve mixing with a large number of people indoors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensuring they have had a COVID-19 booster before taking part in a visit out of the care home, unless exempt, and where they have had the opportunity to receive a booster</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asking those they are visiting to undertake regular lateral flow testing, and receive a negative lateral flow on the day of the visit</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asking those they are visiting to have had their COVID-19 vaccinations, including their booster if eligible</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Decisions about steps to mitigate the risk of an individual resident’s visits out of a care home should be taken with the resident’s assessed needs and circumstances considered. Individual risk assessments should consider the vaccination status of residents, visitors and staff, and any testing for those involved in the visit out.</p>

<p>Where possible, anyone else who the resident meets as part of an indoor visit should undertake a lateral flow test and receive a negative result on the day of the visit. All tests should be reported to the <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> of the care home.</p>

<p>Providers must consider the rights of residents who may lack the relevant mental capacity needed to make a decision about visits out of care homes. These people are protected by the empowering framework of the <abbr title="Mental Capacity Act 2005">MCA</abbr> and its safeguards. Where practicable and appropriate, their advocates and those with power of attorney should be consulted, as well as any deputy, and if there is a deputy or attorney with relevant authority, they must make the best interests decision regarding the visiting policy on the person’s behalf.</p>

<p>Wider guidance on ventilation, limiting close contact, good hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene and requirements on use of face masks should be followed while people are away from the home.</p>

<p>Transport arrangements will need careful consideration. If the care home is using its own vehicle then cleaning protocols will need to be in place. If comfortable, the vehicle windows should be opened to aid ventilation.</p>

<p>If the resident is being accompanied by a member of care home staff, a risk assessment should be carried out. This should assess the COVID transmission risk to the care worker arising from any activities during the visit to ensure that the necessary precautions are in place. This may, for example, include if the care worker is likely to undertake direct personal care, as per the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-domiciliary-care" class="govuk-link">how to work safely in domiciliary care</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes">how to work safely in care homes</a> guidance, and therefore whether the care worker requires <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> (above that recommended for individuals in a public place). If necessary, the staff member should take the required additional <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, as well as the means to safely store or dispose of it, along with a spare replacement face mask, with them when they leave the care home.</p>

<p>Residents may wish to be accompanied on visits out, including to medical appointments. Wherever possible, those accompanying the resident should have received a negative lateral flow test on the day of the visit. Once at the clinical setting, whether the resident can be accompanied will be at the discretion of the medical facility they are visiting.</p>

<p>If a provider is concerned that protocols were not followed or there may have been exposure while at the clinical setting, they should seek advice, if required, from <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> leads within the clinical commissioning group, <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> nurses in the hospital, health protection teams (<abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>) or directors of public health. If there has been a known outbreak of an infection originating in the hospital or clinical care setting then a different risk assessment may be appropriate.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> Communicating with families and visitors</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Key message</h4>
<p>It is important that advice and instructions provided by the care home are clearly communicated to reduce risks to visitors and their loved ones as much as possible.</p>
</div>

<p>The care home’s visiting policy should be made available and communicated to residents and families, together with any necessary variations to arrangements.</p>

<p>Care homes should also consider what additional communications (including posters, leaflets, letters and so on) would help visitors to understand what to expect from visiting, as well as the different arrangements for visitors and essential care givers.</p>

<p>Visitors should be clear with care homes about the best method of communication for them, and providers should meet these communication preferences.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> When different visiting arrangements are needed</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Care home outbreaks</h3>

<p>In the event of an outbreak in a care home, the home should stop indoor visiting (except in exceptional circumstances such as end of life). Essential care givers can continue to visit indoors, but not if the essential care giver or resident they visit are COVID-positive.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> will inform the care home of how long outbreak restrictions (including regarding visiting) need to be in place for. This will be informed by the <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>’s risk assessment and results from the whole home recovery testing. Since September 2021, if no further positives are identified in the 2 rounds of whole home outbreak testing, subject to the <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> risk assessment, then the outbreak restrictions can be lifted. This could mean that outbreak restrictions are only in place for 7 to 8 days in some outbreaks. However, outbreak controls may be in place for up to 28 days following the last positive case especially as we learn more about real-world vaccine effectiveness and disease severity of the Omicron variant.</p>

<p>In the event of an outbreak, other methods of maintaining contact between residents and their loved ones should be supported. This could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>visits in well-ventilated spaces with substantial screens, visiting pods or from behind windows</li>
  <li>telephone calls</li>
  <li>video calls</li>
  <li>newsletters</li>
  <li>emails, letters, cards or photographs</li>
</ul>

<p>A risk assessment should consider the impact of the outbreak and capability to facilitate window or other visits without breaching zoning or cohorting of residents and staff. <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>, local authority directors of public health, clinical commissioning group infection control leads and other partners provide advice to care homes to help them with such a risk assessment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Role of the director of public health and the director of adult social services</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Key message</h4>
<p>The local director of public health (DPH) and director of adult social services (DASS) have an important role in supporting care homes to ensure visiting happens safely. They should support the visiting arrangements set out in this guidance, unless there is good evidence to take a more restrictive approach in an individual care home for a limited period.</p>

<p>While frameworks and advice developed by the DPH and covering the local population may be helpful, these should recognise different circumstances in individual homes and variations in infection rates in different areas within the local authority. It is important that any frameworks and advice enable care homes to exercise discretion based on their own circumstances.</p>

<p>Blanket visiting bans covering whole local authority areas are not appropriate.</p>
</div>

<p>The default position is that visits of all kinds should be supported and enabled wherever it is safe to do so. The local <abbr title="director of public health">DPH</abbr> and <abbr title="director of adult social services">DASS</abbr> have an important role in ensuring that can happen across their local area and may provide advice to care homes accordingly. This may be through a dedicated care home outbreaks management team or group, often in partnership with local social care commissioners. The <abbr title="director of public health">DPH</abbr> should work with the local <abbr title="director of adult social services">DASS</abbr> in developing and communicating their advice to care homes.</p>

<p>The role of the <abbr title="director of public health">DPH</abbr> includes formally leading efforts to suppress and manage outbreaks, and ensuring the local outbreak plan (overseen by the <abbr title="director of public health">DPH</abbr>) includes care homes. Local authorities may also have powers to issue directions to care homes to close to visiting, or to take further specific steps. However, care should be taken to ensure such directions are dynamic and applied proportionately across a local authority area.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="director of public health">DPH</abbr> may consider it appropriate to provide advice for specific care homes, or for areas within the local authority where differences in infection rates or other factors make this appropriate. This may take the form of a framework and guidance rather than individual home-by-home advice.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="director of public health">DPH</abbr> may give directions to a specific home about steps they are required to take to allow visiting safely. This may at times take the form of a notice or direction pursuant to the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/22" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984</a>. It may also take the form of a direction pursuant to <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/7/schedule/22/enacted" class="govuk-link">Schedule 22 of the Coronavirus Act 2020</a>.</p>

<p>Conversely, the <abbr title="director of public health">DPH</abbr> may also provide advice to a specific care home, where he or she is confident that the <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures and other arrangements in that home make it appropriate for it to allow more visiting opportunities. This should be shared in a clear and simple way with residents and loved ones.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Sources of support and information</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Key message</h4>
<p>If care providers have any queries regarding visiting, a range of additional support is available.</p>
</div>

<p>Providers may wish to seek advice from their local <abbr title="director of public health">DPH</abbr> or <abbr title="director of adult social services">DASS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Additionally, care homes may wish to make use of the resources provided by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.careengland.org.uk/visiting" rel="external">Care England</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.nationalcareforum.org.uk/care-home-visiting-in-a-covid-19-world/" class="govuk-link">Partners in Care</a>, a coalition of providers, relatives’ and residents’ organisations facilitated by the National Care Forum.</p>

<p>If visitors feel a care home is not implementing this guidance properly, in the first instance, they should speak to the care home management. All health and social care service providers must have a complaints procedure that explains how to make a complaint.</p>

<p>If the care is funded or arranged by a local council then they should be contacted about the issue.</p>

<p>If the issue has not been resolved then visitors should <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/contact-us/how-complain/complain-about-adult-social-care-service">complain to the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr></a>.</p>
