<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Non-residents and investment income</h2>

<p>This helpsheet explains how income from UK savings and investments (such as interest or alternative finance receipts from banks or building societies, unit trusts, National Savings and Investments, or dividends from UK companies) is taxable if you’re not resident in the UK for a tax year.</p>

<p>It includes a  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/non-residents-and-investment-income-hs300-self-assessment-helpsheet">working sheet</a>, which you only need to use if you decide to calculate your tax.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>How is investment income charged to tax</h2>
<p>v
With the exception of income from property in the UK and investment income connected to a trade in the UK through a permanent establishment, the tax charge for non-residents on investment income arising in the UK is restricted to the amount of tax, if any, deducted at source. If the tax charge is limited in this way, personal allowances will not be given against other income. This restriction does not apply in the overseas part of a split year.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Getting advice</h2>

<p>This helpsheet explains the restriction but it’s only an introduction. If you’re in any doubt about whether the restriction applies or how it operates, ask your tax adviser or phone the HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/income-tax-enquiries-for-individuals-pensioners-and-employees">Income Tax general enquiries helpline</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>How the restriction works</h2>

<p>If you’re not resident in the UK, the tax you pay on all your income cannot be more than:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the amount of tax that would be chargeable on income, other than the ‘disregarded income’, but before the deduction of any personal allowances due</li>
  <li>plus the amount of tax deducted at source from the ‘disregarded income’</li>
</ul>

<p>‘Disregarded income’ includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>interest and alternative finance receipts from banks and building societies</li>
  <li>dividends from UK companies</li>
  <li>income from unit trusts</li>
  <li>income from National Savings and Investments</li>
  <li>profits from public revenue dividends</li>
  <li>profits or gains from transactions in deposits</li>
  <li>certain social security benefits, such as State pensions or widows’ pensions</li>
  <li>taxable income from purchased life annuities except annuities under personal pension schemes</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>‘Disregarded income’ does not include a share of partnership investment income. If you receive dividend income from a partnership you cannot use this helpsheet. You should enter in the ‘Any other information’ box, box 19 on your tax return, the following words: ‘I have been unable to complete the Tax Calculation fully because I had a share in partnership dividend income and the self calculation sheet on HS300 does not provide for this. HMRC will need to complete the calculation for me.’</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Calculating your tax</h2>

<p>If you want HMRC to calculate your tax for you, you can ignore the rest of this helpsheet.</p>

<p>If you’ve decided to calculate your tax yourself see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-tax-calculation-summary-sa110">Tax Calculation Summary pages and notes</a>. You will have to compare the amount of tax that would otherwise be due with the amount due as shown by this helpsheet. This is to make sure that you do not pay too much tax.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, you will be better off paying tax as if you were resident in the UK. Use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/non-residents-and-investment-income-hs300-self-assessment-helpsheet">working sheet</a> to make the comparison. There are instructions in this helpsheet on how to fill it in.</p>

<h2>
