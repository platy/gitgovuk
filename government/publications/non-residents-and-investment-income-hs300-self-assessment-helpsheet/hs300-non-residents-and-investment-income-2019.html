<h2>Non-residents and investment income</h2>
<p>This helpsheet explains how income from UK savings and investments (such as interest or alternative finance receipts from banks or building societies, unit trusts, National Savings and Investments, or dividends from UK companies) is taxable if you’re not resident in the UK for a tax year.</p>

<p>It includes a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/non-residents-and-investment-income-hs300-self-assessment-helpsheet">working sheet</a>, which you only need to use if you decide to calculate your tax.</p>

<h2>How is investment income charged to tax</h2>
<p>With the exception of income from property in the UK and investment income connected to a trade in the UK through a permanent establishment, the tax charge for non-residents on investment income arising in the UK is restricted to the amount of tax, if any, deducted at source. If the tax charge is limited in this way, personal allowances won’t be given against other income. This restriction doesn’t apply in the overseas part of a split year.</p>

<h2>Getting advice</h2>
<p>This helpsheet explains the restriction but it’s only an introduction. If you’re in any doubt about whether the restriction applies or how it operates, ask your tax adviser or phone the HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/income-tax-enquiries-for-individuals-pensioners-and-employees">Income Tax general enquiries helpline.</a></p>

<h2>How the restriction works</h2>
<p>If you aren’t resident in the UK, the tax you pay on all your income can’t be more than:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the amount of tax that would be chargeable on income, other than the ‘disregarded income’ shown below, but before the deduction of any personal allowances due</li>
  <li>plus the amount of tax deducted at source from the ‘disregarded income’</li>
</ul>

<p>‘Disregarded income’ includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>interest and alternative finance receipts from banks and building societies</li>
  <li>dividends from UK companies</li>
  <li>income from unit trusts</li>
  <li>income from National Savings and Investments</li>
  <li>profits from public revenue dividends</li>
  <li>profits or gains from transactions in deposits</li>
  <li>certain social security benefits, such as State pensions or widows’ pensions</li>
  <li>taxable income from purchased life annuities except annuities under personal pension schemes</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>‘Disregarded income’ doesn’t include a share of partnership investment income. If you receive dividend income from a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-partnership-full-sa104f">partnership</a> you can’t use this helpsheet. You should enter in the ‘Any other information’ box, box 19 on your tax return, the following words: ‘I’ve been unable to complete the Tax Calculation fully because I had a share in partnership dividend income and the self calculation sheet on HS300 doesn’t provide for this. HMRC will need to complete the calculation for me.’</p>
</div>

<h2>Calculating your tax</h2>
<p>If you want HMRC to calculate your tax for you, you can ignore the rest of this helpsheet.</p>

<p>If you’ve decided to calculate your tax yourself see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-tax-calculation-summary-sa110">tax calculation summary pages and notes</a>. You’ll have to compare the amount of tax that would otherwise be due with the amount due as shown by this helpsheet. This is to make sure that you don’t pay too much tax.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, you’ll be better off paying tax as if you were resident in the UK. Use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/non-residents-and-investment-income-hs300-self-assessment-helpsheet">working sheet</a> to make the comparison. There are instructions below on how to fill it in.</p>

  </li>

  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Filling in the working sheet</h2>

<h3>Boxes 1 and 2</h3>
<p>Enter the details of the ‘disregarded income’, showing the totals of the gross income (box 1), tax deducted at source, tax credits or notional Income Tax (box 2).</p>

<h3>Box 3</h3>
<p>Enter your total gross income for the year minus deductions. This is the figure in box A81 minus the figure in box A114 in your working sheet in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-tax-calculation-summary-sa110">tax calculation summary notes</a>.</p>

<h3>Box 4</h3>
<p>Deduct the figure in box 1 from the figure in box 3.</p>

<h3>Box 5 to 7</h3>
<p>Employee contributions to personal pension plans and Gift Aid are normally paid net of tax at the basic rate. Further relief is due if you’re liable to higher rate tax.</p>

<p>Add together:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pension payment relief, from box A109</li>
  <li>Gift Aid payments, from box A110</li>
</ul>

<p>Then enter the total in box 5. Add box 5 to box 6 and enter the result in box 7. Box 7 is your basic rate band limit.</p>

<h3>Boxes 8 to 15</h3>
<p>Income up to your basic rate band limit is taxed at 20%. Any income over your basic rate band limit is taxed at 40%. Any income over the higher rate band limit is taxed at 45%.</p>

<h3>Box 16</h3>
<p>Enter the total tax due, from boxes 2, 9, 13 and 15, in box 16.</p>

<h3>Box 17</h3>
<p>Copy the total of Venture Capital Trust relief, Enterprise Investment Scheme relief, SEED Enterprise Investment Scheme relief, Community Investment Tax relief and Social Investment Tax relief from box A254 and enter the total in box 17.</p>

<h3>Boxes 18 and 19</h3>
<p>Enter in box 18 the figure of maintenance or alimony paid, from box A255. Multiply the figure in box 18 by 10% and enter the result in box 19.</p>

<h3>Box 20</h3>
<p>Add together:</p>

<ul>
  <li>notional tax, from boxes A263</li>
  <li>foreign tax credit relief, from box A266</li>
</ul>

<p>Then enter the total in box 20.</p>

<h3>Box 21</h3>
<p>Add together the figures in boxes 17, 19, and 20 and enter the result in box 21.</p>

<h3>Box 22</h3>
<p>Subtract the figure in box 21 from the figure in box 16.</p>

<h3>Box 23 and 24</h3>
<p>Copy the figure from box A274 to box 23. Box 24 ensures there’s sufficient tax to ‘cover’ any Gift Aid payments.</p>

<h3>Box 25</h3>
<p>Box 25 ensures there’s sufficient tax to ‘cover’ any annuity payments. Copy box A279 to box 25.</p>

<h3>Box 26</h3>
<p>The maximum amount of Income Tax due from you is the total of the amount due after allowances and reliefs (except for personal allowances) and the amount of tax, if any, deducted at source. Add together boxes 24 and 25 and enter the result in box 26.</p>
