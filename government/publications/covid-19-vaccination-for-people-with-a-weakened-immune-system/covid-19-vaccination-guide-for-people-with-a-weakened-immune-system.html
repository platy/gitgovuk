<p>People who have a severely weakened immune system should now come forward for a third dose of coronavirus (<abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr>) vaccine.  This is to help improve any protection you may have built from your first 2 doses.</p>

<h2>What is coronavirus or <abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr>?</h2>
<p><abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> is a very infectious respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It can be very serious in people who have a weakened immune system. There is no cure for <abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> although some newly tested treatments do help to reduce the risk of complications.</p>

<h2>Why are you being offered a third dose of the <abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> vaccine?</h2>
<p>This third dose is being offered to all those aged 12 years and older who had a weakened immune system around the time they had their first 2 doses of the <abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> vaccine. It is possible that you may not have responded as well as other people. This third dose may help to improve your immune response and give you better protection.</p>

<p>Your specialist can advise whether this applies to you. By having the third dose you may reduce your chance of catching the <abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> infection. And, if you do, the symptoms may be less severe and the illness shorter, than if you had not had the third vaccination.</p>

<p>People who need a third dose are those who had a severely weakened immune system around the time they had their first 2 doses.</p>

<p>This includes those who had or have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>blood cancers (such as leukaemia or lymphoma)</li>
  <li>lowered immunity due to treatment (such as steroid medication, biological therapy, chemotherapy or radiotherapy)</li>
  <li>lowered immunity due to inherited disorders of the immune system</li>
  <li>an organ or bone marrow transplant</li>
  <li>diseases that affect the immune system such as poorly controlled <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>
</li>
  <li>other diseases or treatments as advised by your specialist</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timing of third dose</h2>
<p>You will need 1 extra dose to improve your protection. Your extra (third) dose should be given at least 8 weeks after your second dose.</p>

<p>After that you will also need a booster dose to extend your protection – this should be given around 3 months after your extra (third) dose.</p>

<h2>Side effects</h2>

<p>Very common side effects include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>having a painful, heavy feeling and tenderness in the arm where you had your injection. This tends to be worst around 1 to 2 days after the vaccine</li>
  <li>feeling tired</li>
  <li>headache</li>
  <li>general aches, or mild flu like symptoms</li>
</ul>

<p>You can rest and take paracetamol (follow the dose advice in the packaging) to help make you feel better. Although feeling feverish is not uncommon for 2 to 3 days, a high temperature is unusual and may indicate you have <abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> or another infection.</p>

<p>Symptoms following vaccination normally last less than a week. If your symptoms seem to get worse or if you are concerned, you can call NHS 111.</p>

<h2>How to get the vaccination</h2>
<p>Your GP will be in contact with your specialist and the NHS will let you know when and where to have the vaccine.</p>

<h2>People who shouldn’t have the third vaccination</h2>
<p>If you’ve had a very severe reaction to the previous dose of the vaccine, you should discuss this with your doctor.</p>

<h2>If you have missed a vaccination</h2>
<p>If you have not yet had either of your first 2 doses of the vaccine you should have them as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If it is now more than 8 weeks from your second dose, please arrange to have your extra (third) dose soon as possible.</p>

<p>You will still need a booster dose, around 3 months after your extra (third) dose. Your specialist should be able to advise on the best timing.</p>
