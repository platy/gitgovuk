<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> <abbr title="key performance indicator">KPI</abbr> review and sign off</h3>

<p>The NHS Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (<abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr>) Screening Programme is responsible for extracting the key performance indicators (<abbr title="key performance indicator">KPI</abbr> data) from <abbr title="screening management and referral tracking">SMaRT</abbr> (‘screening management and referral tracking’, the <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> national IT system). <abbr title="key performance indicator">KPI</abbr> AA2 is reported cumulatively across the screening year whereas AA3 and AA4 are reported by individual quarters.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> programme will email the <abbr title="key performance indicator">KPI</abbr> numerator, denominator and percentage to each provider coordinator or manager to review and sign off. We will copy it to the screening quality assurance service (<abbr title="screening quality assurance service">SQAS</abbr>) regional offices for information. If the screening provider does not raise any concerns regarding the data by the end of the submission window, the <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> programme will assume the data is accurate. Guidance for checking AA2 (standard 2a) can be found in the support section of <abbr title="screening management and referral tracking">SMaRT</abbr>. For AA3 and AA4, the <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> programme will provide screening providers with a list of surveillance appointments due, to aid the validation. Men who are not conclusively tested within the relevant time frames should be reported using the <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> exception report. This will be emailed to providers every quarter.</li>
  <li>Concerns regarding data quality should be emailed to the <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> programme at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:phe.adultscreeningdata@nhs.net">phe.adultscreeningdata@nhs.net</a>.</li>
  <li>Once any data quality issues are resolved the <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> programme will amend the data in the national submission as necessary.</li>
  <li>The <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> programme will email the data to the national <abbr title="key performance indicator">KPI</abbr> screening data and information manager at the close of the submission window. Screening providers should share their <abbr title="key performance indicator">KPI</abbr> data with their commissioners and screening and immunisation team as soon as it has been signed off.</li>
</ol>

<p>Only complete data is published. Data is not usually published if the numerator or denominator is less than 5 for an individual quarter. In such cases, the data will be aggregated and published annually.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Quarterly standards review and sign off</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> programme produces these reports for each screening provider on a quarterly basis. Most standards are reported cumulatively across the screening year. The surveillance standards are reported for individual quarters. Data is extracted from the screening standards data in <abbr title="screening management and referral tracking">SMaRT</abbr>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> programme will upload the screening standards reports onto <abbr title="screening management and referral tracking">SMaRT</abbr> for screening providers to review in the second week after the end of the reporting quarter. Please note that due to data sharing restrictions, screening providers will only be able to see their own and national level data. If the provider coordinator or manager does not raise any concerns within 3 weeks, the <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> programme will assume the data is accurate. Screening providers should check the data as soon as possible after it is sent as the data will change on a daily basis. This will minimise differences due to the day on which the queries are run. The <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> programme will make a copy of the initial reports available to <abbr title="screening quality assurance service">SQAS</abbr> regional offices.</li>
  <li>Concerns regarding data quality should be emailed to the <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> programme at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:phe.adultscreeningdata@nhs.net">phe.adultscreeningdata@nhs.net</a>. Concerns will be resolved between the screening provider, <abbr title="screening quality assurance service">SQAS</abbr> (regions), the <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> programme and software supplier as appropriate.</li>
  <li>As <abbr title="screening management and referral tracking">SMaRT</abbr> is a live system it is not possible to extract the data for the report again as there may have been significant changes to the underlying data in each service. However, updated figures will be available in subsequent reports.</li>
  <li>The <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> programme will make the validated reports available to the <abbr title="screening quality assurance service">SQAS</abbr> regional offices.</li>
</ol>

<p>The screening standards report should be used for programme board meetings and to inform discussions between the screening providers and <abbr title="screening quality assurance service">SQAS</abbr> (regions).</p>

<p>Note that the data in the quarterly screening standards reports will be provisional, and only contains information that can be extracted from <abbr title="screening management and referral tracking">SMaRT</abbr>.</p>

<p>Screening providers are responsible for disseminating the report to commissioners and the screening and immunisation teams.</p>

<p>We encourage screening providers to share their report as soon as it is signed off.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Annual screening standards report</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> programme is responsible for extracting the screening standards data from <abbr title="screening management and referral tracking">SMaRT</abbr> in the form of a report. The annual screening standards report is the finalised data for the screening year. The data is extracted 2 months after the end of the last quarter to allow for completed information on testing and referrals. Screening providers receive a quarter 4 report in April. They should use the time between this and the extraction of annual data in June to ensure their data for the year is accurate and complete.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> programme will upload the screening standards reports onto <abbr title="screening management and referral tracking">SMaRT</abbr> for screening providers to review and validate where possible (using national guidance) on 13 June. Screening providers have 3 weeks to respond. If no concerns are raised within 3 weeks, the <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> programme will assume the data is accurate. A copy of the reports will be made available to <abbr title="screening quality assurance service">SQAS</abbr> regional offices.</li>
  <li>Concerns regarding data quality should be emailed to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:phe.adultscreeningdata@nhs.net">phe.adultscreeningdata@nhs.net</a>. Any concerns will be resolved between supplier, screening provider, <abbr title="screening quality assurance service">SQAS</abbr> (regions) and the <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> programme as appropriate.</li>
  <li>Once data quality issues are resolved the data will be extracted from <abbr title="screening management and referral tracking">SMaRT</abbr> again and the report updated so that changes are reflected.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> programme will email finalised reports to the provider coordinator or manager and relevant <abbr title="screening quality assurance service">SQAS</abbr> regional office. We encourage screening providers to share their report with commissioners as soon as it is signed off. The annual pathway standards reports can be used to support the quality assurance visits and programme board meetings.</p>

<p>The trackers are run on the first Tuesday 3 months after the end of the quarter. This ensures that screening providers have 3 months to complete information on referrals made each quarter. The reports are run on Tuesdays following a weekly update of the database. Screening providers need to enter data by close of play on the Friday preceding the running of the reports to ensure that the snapshot of the database includes the most up to date data. The data reported is cumulative across the screening year.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Screening providers should ensure that records for men referred to surgery are kept as up to date as possible. Delays for attendance at specialist assessments and for surgery should be recorded when the information becomes available to the service. Guidance on the completing the relevant sections of <abbr title="screening management and referral tracking">SMaRT</abbr> is available in the ‘<abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> <abbr title="screening management and referral tracking">SMaRT</abbr> user release notes v9.1’ in the support section of <abbr title="screening management and referral tracking">SMaRT</abbr>.</li>
  <li>The <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> programme will email the provider coordinator or manager on the date that the tracker reports are available in the report section of <abbr title="screening management and referral tracking">SMaRT</abbr>.</li>
  <li>The provider coordinator or manager will have one week to review the data in the report against local information. If any discrepancies are identified they should amend the record in <abbr title="screening management and referral tracking">SMaRT</abbr> accordingly. The change in <abbr title="screening management and referral tracking">SMaRT</abbr> will be captured for subsequent reports. The provider coordinator or manager should also amend an Excel version of the tracker report and send this to their regional <abbr title="screening quality assurance service">SQAS</abbr> office and the <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> programme (see email addresses below). If there are no amendments needed, the original version of the file should be sent to relevant <abbr title="screening quality assurance service">SQAS</abbr> regional office and the <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> programme stating that no changes have been made. The latest date for sending reports is on the last day of the service validation period.</li>
  <li>Upon receipt of the tracker report <abbr title="screening quality assurance service">SQAS</abbr> (regions) and the <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> programme will review the figures and speak with screening providers if there are queries regarding the information.</li>
