<p>We are no longer accepting applications for the national e-cycle programme competition.</p>
</div>

<p>In December 2021, the Department for Transport (DfT) launched a competition to find an organisation or consortium to deliver the national e-cycle support programme.</p>

<p>In May 2022, it was announced that Cycling UK had been selected and would lead a consortium of partners to offer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>short-term opportunities to try e-cycles schemes: giving people a chance to ride in a relaxed and pleasant environment</li>
  <li>longer-term loans of e-cycles: encouraging people to see how e-cycles can be used in their daily routine</li>
  <li>the provision of e-cycles to help people access opportunities for employment and skills</li>
</ul>

<p>The first pilot scheme has launched in Greater Manchester.</p>

<p>The term e-cycle covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>electrically assisted pedal cycles</li>
  <li>electric cycles</li>
  <li>e-bikes</li>
  <li>e-trikes</li>
</ul>

<p>All e-cycles must comply with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/electrically-assisted-pedal-cycles-eapcs/electrically-assisted-pedal-cycles-eapcs-in-great-britain-information-sheet">electrically assisted pedal cycles (EAPCs) regulations</a>.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The national e-cycle programme provides a unique opportunity to integrate e-cycles into wider net zero and decarbonisation initiatives.</p>

<p>This e-cycle programme forms part of the Prime Minister’s ambitious <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycling-and-walking-plan-for-england">Cycling and Walking Plan</a> to boost cycling and walking, with a vision for half of all journeys in towns and cities to be cycled or walked by 2030. This included a £2 billion package of funding for active travel, which is the largest ever boost for cycling and walking.</p>

<p>E-cycles are already within the scope of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/cycling-and-walking#cycle-to-work-scheme">Cycle to Work scheme</a>, which is a tax-efficient, salary-sacrifice employee benefit allowing employees to hire a cycle or cycle safety equipment.</p>

<p>A pilot e-cycle scheme launched in 2021 with a number of local authorities to test approaches to providing e-cycles to those with the highest need, including people who cannot benefit from the Cycle to Work scheme. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/e-cycle-extension-fund-successful-bids">successful local authorities have been announced</a>.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister also announced an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-announces-new-funding-for-cornwall-to-create-a-g7-legacy-for-the-region">e-cycle pilot scheme</a> in Cornwall as part of the No.10-led G7 Summit announcement on the creation of England’s first nature recovery area in Cornwall.</p>
