<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The World Health Organization (<abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>) defines sexual health as a state of physical, emotional, mental and social wellbeing in relation to sexuality – it is not just the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence.</p>

<p>For sexual health to be attained and maintained, the sexual rights of all persons must be respected, protected and fulfilled.</p>

<p>Most adults are sexually active and good sexual health matters to individuals and communities. Sexual health needs vary according to factors such as age, gender, sexual orientation and ethnicity. However, there are certain core needs common to everyone, including high-quality information and education enabling people to make informed responsible decisions, and access to high-quality services, treatment and interventions.</p>

<p>In England, our definition of sexual, reproductive and human immunodeficiency virus (<abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>) health promotion includes the provision of advice, information, education and services around contraception, sexually transmitted infections (<abbr title="sexually transmitted infections">STIs</abbr>), <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> and termination of pregnancy.</p>

<p>The consequences of poor sexual health include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>unplanned pregnancies and abortions</li>
  <li>psychological consequences, including from sexual coercion and abuse</li>
  <li>poor educational, social and economic opportunities for teenage mothers, young fathers and their children</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> transmission</li>
  <li>cervical and other genital cancers</li>
  <li>hepatitis, chronic liver disease and liver cancer</li>
  <li>recurrent genital herpes</li>
  <li>recurrent genital warts</li>
  <li>pelvic inflammatory disease, which can cause ectopic pregnancies and infertility</li>
  <li>poorer maternity outcomes for mother and baby</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-framework-for-sexual-health-improvement-in-england">framework for sexual health improvement in England</a> sets out the government’s ambitions for improving sexual health outcomes. The document aims to provide the information, evidence base and support tools to enable those involved in sexual health improvement to work together effectively.</p>

<h2>Access the sexual and reproductive health and <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> e-learning session</h2>

<p>An interactive <a class="govuk-link" href="https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/Component/Details/596373" rel="external">e-learning version of this topic</a> is now available to use.</p>

<p>The Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (<abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>) and Health Education England’s ‘e-Learning for Healthcare’ have developed this content to increase the confidence and skills of health and care professionals, to embed prevention in their day-to-day practice.</p>

<p>Completing this session will count towards your continued professional development.</p>

<h3>Promoting sexual health in your professional practice</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)62035-8/fulltext" rel="external">Findings from the national surveys of sexual attitudes and lifestyles (Natsal)</a> show most young people become sexually active and start forming relationships between the ages of 16 and 24. Young people in these age groups have significantly higher rates of poor sexual health, including <abbr title="sexually transmitted infections">STIs</abbr> and abortions, than older people.</p>

<p>Unplanned pregnancy is a key public health indicator. The increasing intervals between first sex, cohabitation, and childbearing means that, on average, women in Britain spend about 30 years of their life needing to avert an unplanned pregnancy. Available evidence shows that around one third of births are unplanned. Unplanned pregnancies can have a negative effect on women and children’s lives and result in poorer outcomes than those that are planned.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hiv-in-the-united-kingdom">progress towards ending <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> epidemic in the UK: 2019 report</a> estimated 101,600 people were living with <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> in the UK, of which it is estimated 8% are unaware of their infection and remain at risk of infecting others and are unable to benefit from effective treatment. The report found <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> continues to be concentrated among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (<abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr>) and black African men and women.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/sexually-transmitted-infections-stis-annual-data-tables">sexually transmitted infections and screening for chlamydia in England, 2018 report</a> found that there were approximately 447,694 diagnoses of <abbr title="sexually transmitted infections">STIs</abbr> made in England, a 5% increase compared to 2017.</p>

<p>The impact of <abbr title="sexually transmitted infections">STIs</abbr> remains greatest in young heterosexuals aged 15 to 24 years, black ethnic minorities and <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr>. For more information on preventing <abbr title="sexually transmitted infections">STIs</abbr>, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-matters-preventing-stis/health-matters-preventing-stis">Health matters: preventing <abbr title="sexually transmitted infections">STIs</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>It has long been recognised that gonorrhoea and, more recently, mycoplasma genitalium are at risk of becoming  untreatable diseases due to the ongoing <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gonococcal-resistance-to-antimicrobials-surveillance-programme-grasp-report">threat of antimicrobial resistance</a>.</p>

<h2>Core principles for healthcare professionals</h2>

<p>Healthcare professionals should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide a non-judgemental, empathetic approach to sexual health to create a safe and comfortable environment for the patient to discuss their needs</li>
  <li>know the needs of individuals, communities, and populations related to sexual health, reproductive health and <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> – a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sexual-and-reproductive-health-in-england-local-and-national-data">guide to sexual and reproductive health data</a> is available</li>
  <li>think about the resources and the services available in the health and wellbeing system to promote good sexual and reproductive health</li>
  <li>understand specific activities or interventions which can prevent poor sexual health, reproductive health and <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>
</li>
  <li>utilise opportunities in different settings to provide sexual health, reproductive health and <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> prevention, diagnosis and treatment</li>
</ul>

<h2>Taking action</h2>

<h3>Frontline health and care professionals</h3>

<p>Health and care professionals can have an impact on an individual level by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reassuring individuals that they are entitled to confidential, non- judgemental access to information and services</li>
  <li>providing information about the full range of contraceptive methods and promoting prompt access to the method that best suits their needs – see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sexwise.org.uk/" rel="external">Sexwise website</a> for downloadable information leaflets and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception/" rel="external">NHS.UK</a> also provides useful information on contraception</li>
  <li>ensuring that pregnant women needing an abortion have respectful, non-judgemental, easy, quick and confidential access to services</li>
  <li>ensuring pregnant women have the option to discuss their pregnancy intentions, receive unbiased information, and access contraception and/or preconception care as appropriate taking account of the potential benefits of addressing factors early, such as obesity before pregnancy</li>
  <li>ensuring people understand the different <abbr title="sexually transmitted infections">STIs</abbr>, associated potential consequences and how to protect themselves and partners from <abbr title="sexually transmitted infection">STI</abbr> transmission – the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sexwise.org.uk/" rel="external">Sexwise website</a> provides a number of useful resources and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sexually-transmitted-infections-stis/" rel="external">NHS.UK</a> provides useful information on <abbr title="sexually transmitted infections">STIs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>providing information about where to get prompt access to <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> and <abbr title="sexually transmitted infection">STI</abbr> testing and the full range of <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> prevention methods available – see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hivpreventionengland.org.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> Prevention England (HPE) website</a> for free patient resources, information briefings for professionals, and sector development training events and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hiv-and-aids/" rel="external">NHS.UK</a> provides useful information on <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>
</li>
  <li>ensuring people who are diagnosed with <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> receive prompt referral into care and high-quality treatment services</li>
  <li>using ‘making every contact count’ principles by initiating conversations about sexual and reproductive health, and <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>, in different health and non-health settings</li>
  <li>ensuring that people understand their right to healthy and non-coercive relationships, and those that do not have access to appropriate support</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you’re a team leader or manager</h3>

<p>Community health and care professionals and providers of specialist services can have an impact by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing services which offer the full range of contraception, the testing and treatment of <abbr title="sexually transmitted infections">STIs</abbr> and <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>, and provision of condoms for the benefit of everyone in the community</li>
  <li>ensuring high standards of partner notification are available in services to protect patients from <abbr title="sexually transmitted infection">STI</abbr> reinfection – an essential component of <abbr title="sexually transmitted infection">STI</abbr> management and control</li>
  <li>offering chlamydia testing to young people where appropriate and in line with the current National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP)</li>
  <li>publicising and ensuring easy access to sexual health advice, free condoms, and testing for <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> and other <abbr title="sexually transmitted infections">STIs</abbr> for young people and other high-risk groups in a range of accessible settings with condom distribution schemes</li>
  <li>promoting and raising awareness that prescribed contraception, condoms and <abbr title="sexually transmitted infection">STI</abbr> and <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> testing and treatment are provided free from prescription charge to reduce the risk of unplanned pregnancy and onward transmission of infections</li>
</ul>

<h3>Senior and strategic leaders</h3>

<p>Health and care professionals should be aware of the interventions at population level, which include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>building an honest and open culture where everyone can make informed and responsible choices about relationships and sex to reduce the stigma associated with sexual health and <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>
</li>
  <li>understanding sexual health needs to improve service offer using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sexual-and-reproductive-health-spend-and-outcome-tool-spot">practical guidance to <abbr title="spend and outcome tool">SPOT</abbr> for improving sexual and reproductive health: 2017 guidelines for local authorities</a>
</li>
  <li>leading the development and commissioning of integrated sexual health services and ensure these are informed by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-health-services-non-mandatory-contracts-and-guidance-published">National Integrated Sexual Health Service specification</a>
</li>
  <li>making contact with your regional sexual health facilitator for tailored support and advice</li>
  <li>working to ensure children receive good quality evidence based relationships and sex education at school, at home and in the community following the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/relationships-education-relationships-and-sex-education-rse-and-health-education">relationships and sex education (RSE) and health education statutory guidance</a>, which began in September 2020</li>
  <li>working to ensure prevention is prioritised in all services and sexual health promotion interventions so people are motivated to practise safer sex, including using contraception and condoms</li>
  <li>working to ensure sexual health services are appropriately targeted, including effectively promoting testing for <abbr title="sexually transmitted infections">STIs</abbr> in populations with higher <abbr title="sexually transmitted infection">STI</abbr> rates</li>
</ul>

<h2>Understanding local needs</h2>

<h3>Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (<abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> develops <a class="govuk-link" href="http://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/sexualhealth" rel="external">sexual and reproductive health profiles</a> to support local authorities and others to monitor the health of their populations and the contribution of local public health related systems.</p>

<p>Guidance has been published to help health professionals including local government, service providers and commissioners understand the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sexual-and-reproductive-health-in-england-local-and-national-data">sexual health data available across England and how the data can be accessed</a>. This information provides an overview of the information available on <abbr title="sexually transmitted infections">STIs</abbr>, <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>, contraception, conception and abortion and where to access it. It is divided into indicators (used for tracking progress), detailed local information (collation and interpretation of local intelligence) and national resources (tables and reports).</p>

<h3>NHS Digital</h3>

<p>NHS Digital has 3 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/sexual-and-reproductive-health-services/sexual-and-reproductive-health-services-england-2016-17" rel="external">quality and outcomes framework (<abbr title="quality and outcomes framework">QOF</abbr>) indicators</a> in relation to contraception prescribing.</p>

<h3>Measuring impact</h3>

<p>As a health and care professional there are a range of reasons why it makes sense to measure your impact and demonstrate the value of your contribution. This could be about learning and improving your own practice and sharing what has worked well in order to benefit your colleagues and local people or help you with your professional development.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rsph.org.uk/our-work/policy/wider-public-health-workforce/measuring-public-health-impact.html" rel="external">everyday interactions measuring public health impact pathways toolkit</a> provides a quick, straightforward and easy way for health care professionals (HCPs) to record and measure their public health impact in a uniform and comparable way.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sexual-health-reproductive-health-and-hiv-services-evaluation-resources">Resources for practitioners</a> have been developed to undertake evaluations of interventions or projects in sexual health, reproductive health and <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> services, which will help in measuring outcomes.</p>
