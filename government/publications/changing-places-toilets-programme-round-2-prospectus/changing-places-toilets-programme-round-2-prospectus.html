<h2>Ministerial foreword</h2>

<p>In our national effort to build back better from COVID-19, the government wants to create a stronger, safer and fairer society in which everyone is treated with dignity and respect.</p>

<p>For thousands of people living with learning disabilities, motor neurone disease, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy and other conditions it remains difficult to meet friends, family and neighbours in public. Too many are unable to visit shops, restaurants, cafes or pubs due to there being wholly inadequate facilities nearby.</p>

<p>That is why in 2020 we introduced&nbsp;a major change to statutory guidance in England, making it compulsory to include a Changing Places toilet in certain new, publicly accessible buildings. In summer 2021 we launched the Â£30 million Changing Places Fund to help local authorities substantially increase the number of Changing Places toilets in every part of the country.</p>

<p>Following Round 1 of the Changing Places Fund we have allocated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/changing-places-fund-allocation-of-funding-following-round-1-assessment/changing-places-fund-local-authority-allocations">Â£23.5 million to 191 local authorities across England</a> in support of over 500 Changing Places toilet facilities.</p>

<p>We have made progress but there is more to do as gaps in provision and areas in need of further investment remain.</p>

<p>This Round 2 prospectus continues our journey to make our shops, high streets and public places much more accessible. The value of resource available in round 2 will be up to Â£6.5 million.</p>

<p>Eligible local authorities can now submit expressions of interest to receive a proportion of this funding, to install facilities in their communities and help more residents enjoy a worry-free day out.</p>

<p>We want to deliver as many new facilities as possible with the Changing Places Fund. But we recognise that government investment alone can only do so much.</p>

<p>We also need to continue work with charities and grass-roots organisations â many who have long-campaigned for change â utilising their expertise and knowledge to build a more equal society after COVID.</p>

<p>That is why our funding programme will continue to be delivered with the support of our charity partner, Muscular Dystrophy UK, to help councils consider where Changing Places toilets are most needed in their communities and how they can be installed without delay.</p>

<p>This prospectus also includes tips and advice for councils to work with charities on the ground along with a series of useful case studies from pioneering local authorities who are blazing a trail for others to follow.</p>

<p>With central government, local government and the third sector working more closely together than ever before, we will put the right facilities in the right places for those who need them the most â extending freedom, accessibility and dignity to all.</p>

<p><strong>Eddie Hughes MP</strong><br>
<strong>Minister for Rough Sleeping and Housing</strong></p>

<h2>Foreword from Catherine Woodhead, Chief Executive of MDUK</h2>

<p>Itâs incredible that in 2022 as this programme enters its second stage, we are still striving to improve something that many of us take for granted: local access to suitable toilet and changing facilities for disabled people.</p>

<p>Muscular Dystrophy UK (MDUK) is the charity that supports people who are impacted by more than 60 rare and very rare progressive muscle-weakening and wasting conditions, affecting around 110,000 children and adults in the UK. A key part of our mission is to ensure that people with muscle-wasting conditions can live well and can access all areas of society.</p>

<p>Thatâs why, since 2018, MDUK has been a proud co-chair of the Changing Places Consortium, which seeks the installation of Changing Places toilets in public spaces so that children, adults, and families can access their community. The Changing Places Consortium also officially registers Changing Places toilets and promotes their availability, ensuring that the people who need to use them can find them, by displaying their location on an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.changing-places.org/find" rel="external">online map</a>.</p>

<p>Changing Places toilets go beyond the provision of standard accessible toilets offering more space and necessary equipment. Itâs estimated that well over a quarter of a million people, including many with muscle-wasting conditions, need these facilities to enable them to get out and about and enjoy day-to-day activities that many of us take for granted.</p>

<p>We have warmly welcomed the governmentâs investment of Â£30 million for the installation of Changing Places toilets in existing buildings in England and support the commitment to this second phase allocation of funding. We are delighted to continue working with the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities to jointly guide the distribution of this funding and to provide information and advice to local authorities as they plan and manage installations in their area.</p>

<p>We urge all local authorities to engage with this scheme, particularly if you missed the first round, or are in an area with a low number of Changing Places toilets. We hope you will make your community as open and inclusive to disabled people as possible. Please be part of this transformation, for your local community, and for travel to and tourism in your local area.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine Woodhead</strong><br>
<strong>CEO Muscular Dystrophy UK</strong></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Background</h2>

<p>1.1 Over 250,000 severely disabled people across the UK do not have access to public toilet facilities that meet their needs. Changing Places toilets open up public places to this group and their families, enabling them to enjoy the same experiences as everyone else.</p>

<p>1.2 Changing Places toilets are larger accessible toilets for severely disabled people, with equipment such as hoists, privacy screens, adult-sized changing benches, peninsula toilets and space for carers.</p>

<p>1.3 The government wants to see a step change in the number of Changing Places toilets across the country. This is why we previously announced a fund of up to Â£30 million, the Changing Places Fund (CPF), to accelerate provision in existing buildings in England. This prospectus builds on the outcome of the first round of the CPF, which <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/changing-places-fund-allocation-of-funding-following-round-1-assessment/changing-places-fund-local-authority-allocations">allocated Â£23.5 million to 191 local authorities</a>, to set out how eligible local authorities can access this second and final round.</p>

<p>1.4 This programme is a key part of the governmentâs wider plans to increase the provision of Changing Places toilets including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/805195/changing-places-capital-funding-for-nhs-hospitals-prospectus.pdf" rel="external">Department of Health and Social Care</a> announced in 2018 that Â£2 million would be made available for additional Changing Places toilets in NHS hospitals.</li>
  <li>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/disabled-people-to-benefit-from-better-journeys-thanks-to-service-station-funding">Department for Transport</a> awarded funding to 59 motorway service stations across 2019 and 2020 for the installation of Changing Places toilets.</li>
  <li>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/changing-places-toilets-for-severely-disabled-people-to-be-compulsory-in-new-public-buildings">major change to building rules in England</a> in 2020 making it compulsory for Changing Places toilets to be included in certain newly built or majorly refurbished facilities including stadiums and art venues.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.5 To be classified as a Changing Places toilet, facilities must meet set specifications and be registered by the Changing Places Consortium. Muscular Dystrophy UK (MDUK) as co-Chairs of the Consortium have brought their expertise to work in partnership with the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities to deliver this exciting funding programme.</p>

<p>1.6 There are around 1,300 registered Changing Places toilets in England but demand for provision continues to far outstrip supply. Where people shop, go out, or travel should not be determined by their disability. That is why the provision of Changing Places toilets is so important for people who cannot use standard accessible toilets. The funding agreed under round 1 will support over 500 additional facilities but the number of Changing Places toilets still needs to increase to meet demand.</p>

<p>1.7 The government has committed to launch Round 2 of the Changing Places Fund in August 2022. Local authorities eligible to apply to the second round are listed at <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-c-list-of-local-authorities-eligible-to-participate-in-round-2">Annex C</a> and are being invited to submit an expression of interest to receive a proportion of this funding, to install these vital facilities in their communities.</p>

<p>1.8 The government has decided to build on the outcome of round 1 by targeting support to those areas where there is currently zero provision and those areas of greatest need identified by reference to the updated index of need. Please note that because of the targeted nature of our approach we have decided to use a limited call rather than the opt-in approach used previously. An explanation of the governmentâs approach to updating the index of need is set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#funding-details">paragraphs 6.1 to 6.3</a>, and a full list of the 155 local authorities eligible to submit an expression of interest under round 2 is set out at <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-c-list-of-local-authorities-eligible-to-participate-in-round-2">Annex C</a>.</p>

<p>1.9 The Changing Places Fund was designed based on feedback and engagement following the largest consultation to date of users of Changing Places toilets in England to help develop our understanding of their needs and priorities.</p>

<p>1.10 This knowledge was built on through engagement with Industry and local authorities, to understand better the risks and needs and how those eligible local authorities could be supported with expert advice and training to aid in the delivery of these facilities.</p>

<p>1.11 This prospectus sets out the scope of the funding programme, the support available and provides details of how eligible local authorities can access funding under round 2.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Case studies and user insights</h2>

<h3>What does having access to a Changing Places toilet mean to you?</h3>

<p>âIt means not having the constant worry of whether I would actually be able to have adequate space to transfer safely. It would mean that I am able to go out more, instead of having to limit my fluid intake.â</p>

<p>âIt means fairness and being included.â</p>

<p>âAccess to Changing Places toilets means I can travel, can work, see my friends, go to conferences, have a meal without needing to be in an embarrassing situation.â</p>

<h3>Trafford Centre, Manchester</h3>

<p>2.1 The Trafford Centre in Manchester is one of the largest shopping centres in the UK and attracts approximately 600,000 customers from across the UK every week, some of whom suffer from severe learning and physical disabilities and require a Changing Places toilet for themselves and their families and carers.</p>

<p>2.2 The Changing Places toilet at the Trafford Centre includes all the required equipment, including an adult sized height adjustable changing bench, ceiling track hoist, ample space for the disabled person and 2 carers, a&nbsp;toilet, movable&nbsp;sink&nbsp;and emergency alarm. The toilet is in regular use and customers and local disability organisations have provided positive feedback.</p>

<h3>What difference would having access to Changing Places toilets make to you as a family member or professional carer/supporter?</h3>

<p>âLife changing. My son is 5 and full care, non-mobile and non-verbal. We currently struggle to use nappy changing tables still, but this wonât be possible much longer. Not being able to safely change him in a clean and appropriate environment will limit our life immeasurably.â</p>

<p>âIt would mean in future my child would not be limited in being able to access different areasâ¦itâll mean that I donât have to tell him ânoâ all the time and he will be able to go and enjoy life how he wants to spend it.â</p>

<p>âI can maintain my daughterâs dignity and comfort â the alternative is to change her on the floor of our van or the floor of the disabled toilet.â</p>

<h3>The Deep, Hull</h3>

<p>2.3 The Deep in Hull is one of the UKâs biggest aquariums and is an award winning, inclusive, and fully accessible attraction.</p>

<p>2.4 By listening to the disabled communityâs feedback, The Deep opened its exemplar Changing Places facility in 2018 and continues to welcome visitors with all varieties of needs, from the total 250,000 people in the UK who require additional support.</p>

<p>2.5 The facility offers all the necessary Changing Places equipment including: Nirvano (CTE) Changing Table, overhead hoist, ABW6 height adjustable wash basin, centrally located toilet and portable privacy screen. It has a marine theme that ties in with its unique location. The facility is greatly valued by all with exemplary customer feedback.</p>

<h3>What difference would having access to Changing Places toilets make to your life?</h3>

<p>âI would be able to leave the house more and have more of a life. I use a mobility scooter and when I have shopping etc and am on my own I have to be able to use somewhere that has plenty of room for a bulky scooter and give me space to move freely as well.â</p>

<p>âConfidence to go out with family and not have to worry all the time about incontinence issues.â</p>

<p>âHaving access to hoists would give me peace of mind knowing I will not fall whilst transferring.â</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Definition of a Changing Places toilet and the target user group</h2>

<p>3.1 Changing Places toilets were created to meet the needs of disabled children and adults with complex care needs who need carer support, appropriate equipment and more space. This is because standard accessible toilets were designed to meet the needs of disabled people who can use a toilet independently.</p>

<p>3.2 Standard accessible toilets are unsuitable for this different group of profoundly disabled children and adults. Children and adults with complex care needs require carer support and standard disabled toilets cannot accommodate a wheelchair and carers, have no specialist equipment and are simply not designed for complex care needs and large wheelchairs.</p>

<p>3.3 The Target User Groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Those with complex disabilities who require hoisting from their wheelchair onto the toilet and providing support once on the toilet.</li>
  <li>Those who are incontinent and who require hoisting from their wheelchair onto a height adjustable adult sized changing bench to have their continence pads changed.</li>
  <li>Those who are not wheelchair users but whose other complex needs are not met in current public toilet provision. This includes disabled children and adults who have balance or health/size issues, or severe autism or challenging behaviours who are not easy to toilet and need adequate space for carer support on both sides of the toilet, or to manage behaviour and hyperactivity.</li>
  <li>To enable family or professional carers to use the toilet with dignity whilst keeping the wheelchair user safe.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changing Places toilet design overview</h3>

<p>3.4 To meet their needs, a design was created after extensive consultation with various professionals working in the field of: care, access, building design, physiotherapy and occupational therapy. After consultation with carers and with a strong evidence base driving the standard, a 12sqm design became included in British Standard BS8300 in 2009.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Height adjustable adult sized changing bench:</strong> The main driver for Changing Places toilets has been carers who for some time have had to lay disabled children and adults on dirty public toilet floors to change their continence pads. This facility is therefore essential in any Changing Places toilet .</li>
  <li>
<strong>Ceiling hoist (preferably H frame):</strong> Is also essential in order to lift someone out of their wheelchair onto a height adjustable changing bench or toilet depending on their needs. An H frame hoist enables the whole room to be covered by the hoist should someone accidentally fall out of their wheelchair. A mobile hoist is not the preferred option as carers use ceiling hoists in their home and are not familiar with using mobile hoists, which can be cumbersome and take up valuable floor space.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Peninsular toilet:</strong> Is essential as many disabled children and adults needing carer support cannot use standard accessible toilets as they require support from both sides whilst on the toilet due to balance or health/size needs, severe autism, or challenging behaviours which cause them to be unable to sit on the toilet by themselves due to hyperactivity. A peninsular toilet also enables someone to be lowered onto the toilet with support from the carer. (A corner toilet is not suitable for this group of people.)</li>
  <li>
<strong>Size (12sqm):</strong> After test driving various sized layouts, the most suitable size was 12sqm. This could meet the needs of the widest range of users with different needs from within our target group. It became clear that although a smaller room can meet the needs of many children and their carers, adults (many with larger wheelchairs/leg extensions) have great difficulty turning in a smaller space, and for some large wheelchairs it is impossible. A smaller space could also pose a health and safety issue for carers reversing out of the room into a public corridor (e.g., a shopping centre or street).</li>
</ul>

<p>3.5 Recognising that this is potentially new for many local authorities, in advance of round 1, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities partnered with Muscular Dystrophy UK to provide expertise and support in the form of training sessions, dedicated officer support and the production of a Changing Places manual setting out the requirements of a Changing Places toilet to support local authorities to successfully deliver this programme and increase the number of facilities within their communities. MDUK will continue to provide this support to local authorities under round 2.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Programme aims and scope</h2>

<p>4.1 The Changing Places Fund as previously announced is intended to invest up to Â£30 million over 3 financial years from 2021/22 to increase the number of Changing Places toilets in existing buildings that are accessible to the public and small-scale infrastructure that is not covered by new building rules introduced in 2020.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.2 The funding will therefore work alongside <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/changing-places-toilets-for-severely-disabled-people-to-be-compulsory-in-new-public-buildings">changes that have already been made to building regulations</a> and associated statutory guidance<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> requiring Changing Places toilets to be included in many new buildings such as shopping centres, sports stadiums and arts venues to deliver an outcome of thousands of people with complex needs and their families having greater access to public places and services that many of us take for granted.</p>

<p>4.3 This will work towards all disabled people being able to take part in everyday activities with the same dignity as everyone else â to go to the shops, attend hospital appointments, enjoy community life, socialise, and travel.</p>

<p>4.4 The aims of the programme are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Substantially boost the number of Changing Places toilets in existing buildings across England.</li>
  <li>Improve the geographical spread of Changing Places toilets by addressing areas that are underserved.</li>
  <li>Increase provision in sectors and venue types of greatest need (based on Insight research carried out by MDUK and set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-a-research-institute-for-disabled-consumers-ridc-insight-research">Annex A</a>) to ensure that more disabled people can take part in everyday activities that have the greatest impact on their quality of life.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is in scope?</h3>

<p>4.5 All venue and location types are in scope. The available funding aims to increase the number of Changing Places toilets in publicly accessible places.</p>

<p>4.6 Publicly accessible means a venue or place where one of the primary purposes is access to the general public for recreational, social or related activities. This includes but is not limited to buildings owned or operated by public sector organisations and could include buildings owned or operated by the private or voluntary and community sectors.</p>

<p>4.7 For example, Changing Places toilets in art galleries, cinemas, concert halls, shopping centres, recreation and entertainment buildings, libraries, museums, visitor centres, beaches, parks and gardens would all be in scope.</p>

<p>4.8 To aid local authorities in the delivery of facilities in places where users, their families and carers want to see Changing Places toilets installed, we have worked with MDUK to undertake the largest consultation on Changing Places toilets. This research (available at <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-a-research-institute-for-disabled-consumers-ridc-insight-research">Annex A</a>) provides insight as to where facilities are best placed to help users, their families and carers, to enable them to achieve their goals to be able to âhave a day outâ and undertake social and recreational activities with dignity, confidence and freedom.</p>

<p>4.9 The venue types specified do not represent an exhaustive list and all venue types are in scope if they meet the requirement of being publicly accessible.</p>

<p>4.10 Care should be taken not to duplicate support available through existing schemes for installation of Changing Places toilets in specific venue types i.e. funding available through Department for Transport for motorway service stations and the Department of Health and Social Care scheme for NHS premises. However, as the transport network is crucial to peopleâs mobility and hospital premises are important hubs in many places, both will be in scope where there is no duplication of provision.</p>

<p>4.11 In some circumstances, purchase of an external modular Changing Places toilet may be appropriate if space within an identified venue isnât available.</p>

<p>4.12 Although the main focus of the funding is to increase provision in existing buildings, extending Changing Places toilet provision through investment in small scale infrastructure (that is not covered by statutory guidance Part M section 5.7e introduced in 2020) or the use of mobile Changing Places toilets which could align and contribute to activities supporting economic recovery (e.g. events to encourage people back to town centres) may also be considered. However, it is clear from User engagement that it is critical that they know that facilities are available in order to plan their visits.</p>

<p>4.13 For the avoidance of doubt, the hire of temporary facilities, either mobile or static is not eligible under the fund.</p>

<p>4.14 Local authorities will be responsible for identifying local places that would be best placed to house a Changing Places toilet and working with relevant partners to build or install the facility.</p>

<p>4.15 The programme seeks to increase the number of Changing Places toilets without detracting from existing toilet facilities â accessible or otherwise. When considering location, local authorities will need to take this into account.</p>

<p>4.16 Expressions of Interest will only be accepted from eligible local authorities. However, we expect there to be close cooperation with counties, town, and parish councils where applicable, as well as clear engagement with community, delivery partners e.g., tourism locations, country parks etc and other interested partners. Local authorities in areas subject to boundary changes from 2023 remain eligible to apply in this round.</p>

<p>4.17 Round 2 will operate over the financial year 2023/24. To be eligible for support under round 2 local authorities must confirm in their expression of interest that they can commission and complete the building and registration of the Changing Place toilet facility by the end of the financial year 2023/24.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Support available from Muscular Dystrophy UK</h2>

<p>5.1 To make this easier for local authorities, Muscular Dystrophy UK have been engaged to provide a full package of support to assist in applying, navigating and delivering Changing Places toilets across England under both rounds 1 and 2 of the CPF.</p>

<h3>Dedicated advice and information</h3>

<p>5.2 Local authorities will have access to advice and information from dedicated Changing Places Support Officers. They will help to guide local authorities through the process for choosing the location, to designing and planning the installation through to registration as a Changing Places toilet.</p>

<p>5.3 Through the Changing Places Support Officers, local authorities will also have access to support with more complex queries that might require specific technical expertise from members of the Changing Places Consortium and other experts. Installing a Changing Places toilet in an existing building can present more complicated challenges and the Changing Places Support Officers will be on hand to support and signpost local authorities every step of the way.</p>

<h3>Changing Places manual</h3>

<p>5.4 A comprehensive Changing Places manual will be available to local authorities covering all aspects of the installation and management of a Changing Places toilet. Information covered incudes; the legislative and regulatory background around Changing Places toilets; the planning and design of a Changing Places toilet; the equipment and environment required in and around a Changing Places toilet; and the management and maintenance required of a Changing Places toilet.</p>

<h3>Training</h3>

<p>5.5 Local authorities in receipt of funding from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities will be expected to access bespoke virtual training sessions that will accompany the Changing Places manual. These training sessions will explain the full process and key points to consider around the installation and registration of a Changing Places toilet in an existing building and their safe maintenance and upkeep. Further training on specific aspects of Changing Places may also be made available as the programme develops.</p>

<h3>Learning from others</h3>

<p>5.6 With over 1,300 Changing Places toilets registered in England there is a wealth of case studies and testimonials that we can share with local authorities about Changing Places toilet installations in a wide variety of settings, venues and sectors.</p>

<h3>Connecting local authorities with local partners</h3>

<p>5.7 Local authorities will be connected with local organisations, charities, Changing Places toilet users and community groups to help ensure that communities can assist and support local authorities on where new Changing Places toilets should be located â and celebrate their participation in the programme.</p>

<h3>Suppliers and installation companies</h3>

<p>5.8 Signposting, information, and contact details will be available about the leading Changing Places toilet suppliers and manufacturers that install and provide equipment.</p>

<h3>Promotion and publicity</h3>

<p>5.9 Throughout the programme MDUK will work with local authorities to publicise their participation and the availability of new Changing Places toilets as they are completed through website updates, social media and national and local press activity.</p>

<h3>Registration</h3>

<p>5.10 Only officially registered Changing Places toilets are able to use the Changing Places branding and signage and appear on the digital Changing Places map. Local authorities will be supported through that process â and by engaging with Muscular Dystrophy UK throughout the full planning and installation processes it can be ensured that there are no issues at this final stage and that facilities meet the&nbsp;required registration criteria. Advice will also be available on service and maintenance contract&nbsp;requirements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Funding details</h2>

<h3>How funding will be allocated</h3>

<p>6.1 Round 2 CPF will seek to target up to Â£6.5 million in areas where there remains no existing provision and where greatest need is identified.</p>

<p>6.2 Officials have updated the index of need for round 2. This is a local authority level measure created through a combination of an assessment of the supply (the number of current Changing Places toilets registered and funded) and demand (the population of individuals who have a disability). The number of Changing Places toilets used in the supply measure adds together the total MDUK registrations of Changing Places toilets as of 14 April 2022 and the number of Changing Places toilets that will be funded under round 1 of the allocations. The demand score is based on the number of individuals with disabilities living in the local authority from the 2011 Census (latest available data). An index standardised from 0 to 50 is created from each of the supply and demand score, and the sum of these scores gives the total need index.</p>

<p>6.3 The updated need index is used to produce a list of local authorities ranked in order of need. From this list the department has identified the Local Authorities who have zero existing and proposed Changing Places toilets and those who are in the top quartile and second quartile of need. The ordered list of eligible local authorities by need score is set out at <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-c-list-of-local-authorities-eligible-to-participate-in-round-2">Annex C</a>.</p>

<p>6.4 In view of the resource available to round 2 we have decided to open a limited call targeting those areas where there is no existing provision and those who are ranked within the top 50% of need according to the updated index of need.</p>

<p>6.5 This approach will enable us to target 155 individual local authorities under round 2 and invite them to submit an Expression of Interest for up to 3 Changing Places toilet facilities, which should be ranked in order of preference. Assessment under round 2 will be based primarily on a gateway and pass/fail approach using the benchmark award of Â£40,000 as a factor in its assessment of value for money.</p>

<p>6.6 This will allow officials to move more quickly to establish a list of appointable projects which can then be mapped against the updated index of need but which retain a core focus on essential criteria such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>eligibility</li>
  <li>deliverability</li>
  <li>rationale (including evidence of research and consultation with users/ stakeholders)</li>
  <li>value for money (including confirmation of co-funding).</li>
</ul>

<p>6.7 In mapping against areas of zero provision and the updated index of need, we will consider the first, second and third preference of applicants in the assessment process.</p>

<p>6.8 With support from MDUK we will assess expressions of interest received from local authorities to establish a list of appointable expression of interests for recommendation to the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (<abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr>) minister. It is important to note that there is no guarantee that any or all bids considered appointable will be funded.</p>

<p>6.9 MDUK will advise <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> on strategic rationale and consultation undertaken in relation to the Changing Places toilet(s) in the bid. Appointable expressions of interest will then be mapped against the index of need.</p>

<p>6.10 All decisions will be made by the <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> minister who may exercise discretion to concentrate support in areas of high need or for particular sectors or venue types identified as high priority in the research set out at <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-a-research-institute-for-disabled-consumers-ridc-insight-research">Annex A</a>. Alternatively, the minister may decide to seek the widest possible geographical distribution and spread of support.</p>

<h3>What do eligible local authorities need to do?</h3>

<p>6.11 Eligible local authorities listed at <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-c-list-of-local-authorities-eligible-to-participate-in-round-2">Annex C</a> are therefore invited to submit an expression of interest in this Round 2 of the programme by 30 September 2022 to receive funding.</p>

<p>6.12 Local authorities should work with local partners including voluntary and community groups, parish and town councils and others to identify the potential to install new Changing Places toilets in their area and work with building owners to assess the viability of potential projects.</p>

<p>6.13 The funding provided will be capital only. Local authorities will be expected to cover the ongoing costs of maintenance of the facilities. Where a Changing Places toilet facility will be delivered by a third party, the local authority remains responsible to ensure the third party commits to maintain the facility.</p>

<p>6.14 Local authorities must submit an expression of interest in response to the limited call in order to be considered for funding.</p>

<p>6.15 Expressions of interest should be signed by an officer with appropriate authority and be counter-signed by the section 151 officer to confirm the proposals are deliverable and that ongoing revenue costs of maintaining and cleaning facilities have been identified and committed.</p>

<p>6.16 It is expected that local authorities will provide co-funding in order to maximise the impact of government funding and to manage the development and ongoing maintenance of new Changing Places toilets. As part of the expression of interest we are keen to understand the level of co-funding available.</p>

<p>6.17 Local authorities should set out what co-funding they and partners can bring to the project. This should include the value and source of the funding. Eligible co-funding includes capital contributions and any in-kind contributions directly related to the delivery of new Changing Places toilets (e.g., dedicated staff time and technical support such as surveys and plans). Recognising that once delivered Changing Places toilets will need to be regularly cleaned and maintained, it is likely this will be as part of variation to an existing contract. Noting from consultation this can be a barrier to delivery, where they can be clearly identified, we will allow the first 3 years of these costs to be eligible as co-funding. For the avoidance of doubt, maintenance costs incurred after the 3 years are not eligible to be considered as co-funding and the relevant operators of the Changing Places toilets will be responsible for their ongoing maintenance and cleaning for their lifetime.</p>

<p>6.18 The <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> minister will make decisions on final funding allocations taking into account the number of expression of interests and Changing Places toilets that can be delivered, sectors and venue types and/ or their geographical spread.</p>

<p>6.19 The duration of a Changing Places toilet installation can vary greatly depending on the complexity of the individual project and any specific challenges that are created by the space identified, building issues encountered or funding complexity â this is particularly true of installations in existing buildings. Installations can take as little as 3 months but have been known to take up to 24 months in rare and difficult development circumstances. Local authorities will need to consider deliverability within their expression of interest.</p>

<p>6.20 Funding will be allocated via a ring-fenced section 31 payment. Upon confirmation of funding allocations, Grant Determination Agreements will be issued detailing the purpose and associated requirements of the funding.</p>

<p>6.21 <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> will work with successful local authorities to agree a profile for the expenditure. Work on new Changing Places toilets must be completed during the financial year 2023/24.</p>

<p>6.22 A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/changing-places-toilets-programme-round-2-prospectus">template expression of interest form</a> is also available. The expression of interest must be completed and submitted via the DELTA system.</p>

<p>6.23 All applicants must also consider how they will deliver in line with subsidy control as per <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/subsidy-control-designing-a-new-approach-for-the-uk">government guidance</a>, as well as all other relevant legal obligations such as procurement.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Monitoring</h2>

<p>7.1 It is important that <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> is able to fully account for public funds. Therefore, we will require quarterly monitoring reporting from successful local authorities that will provide details of actual and forecast spend as well as project updates. This will be supported by individual bilateral meetings with specific local authorities as required.</p>

<p>7.2 It is also important that we understand the impact that the funding is having. Local authorities will be expected to engage in programme evaluation where required. In addition, we will be working with Muscular Dystrophy UK to produce a quarterly insight report based on engagement with local authorities which will help to understand barriers to delivery and identify as well as amplify and celebrate delivery success.</p>

<h3>Detailed summary of approach</h3>

<p>As previously indicated, the agreed second round of funding of the Changing Places Fund has a potential remaining allocation of up to Â£6.5 million of the Â£30 million Changing Places Fund allocation up to 2023/24 subject to ministerial agreement. The list above shows the District and Unitary local authorities eligible to apply to the second round of funding with a view to target support to those areas where there is currently zero provision and/or those areas of greatest need.</p>

<p>We have estimated the need in each local authority by firstly understanding the âsupplyâ of toilets and then the âdemandâ for toilets. To measure current provision we have used a list of current toilets within each local authority as provided to us by MDUK. This is based on the total registrations of Changing Places toilets with MDUK as of 14 April 2022.</p>

<p>We have added to this current total the number of toilets allocated within Round 1 to get the âsupplyâ of total toilets per local authority.</p>

<p>The âdemandâ figure is estimated from the number of disabled people living in the area. This is sourced from Census 2011 using the definition of those who were limited in their daily activities by disability.</p>

<p>An index standardised from 0 to 50 is created from each of the supply and demand score, with 0 at the lowest demand/highest supply in a local authority and 50 the highest demand/lowest supply. The sum of these scores gives the total need index<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>, from which we have ranked local authority need.</p>

      <p>In practice this means that the additional costs of incorporating a Changing Places toilet facility into the construction of a new building â such as a library that is too small to have to install a Changing Places toilet under the new guidelines set out in amended statutory guidance â is eligible; similarly, the construction of a new toilet block to include a Changing Places toilet in a public location such as a park or beach is potentially eligible if not covered by new 2020 guidelines.&nbsp;<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">â©</a></p>
