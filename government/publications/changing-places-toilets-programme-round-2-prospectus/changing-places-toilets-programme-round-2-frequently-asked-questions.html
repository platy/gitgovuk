<h2>Process and application</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.&nbsp;When </span> is the deadline?</h3>

<p>30 September 2022.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.&nbsp;How </span> much information is needed to submit a bid?</h3>

<p>See the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/changing-places-toilets-programme-round-2-prospectus">template expression of interest</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.&nbsp;What </span> is the timescale between submission of an expression of interest and receiving the grant?</h3>

<p>Local authorities should expect to receive initial grant funding in autumn 2022, subject to ministerial approval.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Which local authorities can apply for Changing Places Fund support?</h3>

<p>The following tiers of local government are eligible to apply for funding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>District Councils</li>
  <li>Unitary Authorities (single tier)</li>
  <li>London Boroughs</li>
  <li>Metropolitan Boroughs</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5. </span> Can any eligible local authority submit an expression of interest under round 2?</h3>

<p>No, in 2020 the government committed to a fund of up to £30 million to support the installation of changing places toilets across England. Following round 1, the government allocated £23.5 million to 190 local authorities. In round 2 up to £6.5 million will be available. In this context the government has decided to target support to those areas where there is currently demand but no existing Changing Places toilet provision, and those areas that are within the top 50% of local authorities according to the updated index of need.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.&nbsp;Can </span> I apply for funding if I am not included in the 155 targeted local authorities?</h3>

<p>No, this is a limited call to address those areas in England with no current or limited Changing Places toilet provision. According to the updated Index of Need only those eligible local authorities in the top 50% can apply. The list of eligible authorities is set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/changing-places-toilets-programme-round-2-prospectus/changing-places-toilets-programme-round-2-prospectus#annex-c-list-of-local-authorities-eligible-to-participate-in-round-2">Annex C of the prospectus</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.&nbsp;Is </span> there a limit to the number of Changing Places Toilets that can be applied for?</h3>

<p>Local authorities can bid for a maximum of 3 Changing Places toilets and they should be ranked in order of preference (first, second, third). It is important to note that under round 2 there is no guarantee that any or all bids considered will be funded.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.&nbsp;We </span> can only provide estimated costs – is this, OK?</h3>

<p>Local authorities should endeavour to identify costs as accurately as possible, but we recognise that cost estimates will fluctuate once contracting for projects begins. Any additional costs will need to be met by the local authority and / or its delivery partners. DLUHC will not provide additional funding beyond your grant allocation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.&nbsp;How </span> will allocation decisions be made?</h3>

<p>The approach taken is set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/changing-places-toilets-programme-round-2-prospectus/changing-places-toilets-programme-round-2-prospectus#funding-details">section 6</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/changing-places-toilets-programme-round-2-prospectus/changing-places-toilets-programme-round-2-prospectus#annex-c-list-of-local-authorities-eligible-to-participate-in-round-2">Annex C</a> of the funding prospectus. Round 2 differs from the first round in using a limited call to target 155 local authorities who have limited Changing Places toilet provision according to need or no current provision in their local area.</p>

<p>Assessment under round 2 will be based on a gateway and pass/fail approach using the benchmark award of £40k as a factor in its assessment of value for money.</p>

<p>DLUHC will work with MDUK to establish a list of appointable projects which can then be mapped against the updated index of need but which retain a core focus on essential criteria such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eligibility</li>
  <li>Deliverability</li>
  <li>Rationale (including evidence of research, consultation with stakeholders)</li>
  <li>Value for money (including confirmation of co-funding)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.&nbsp;Can </span> we upload other documents?</h3>

<p>DLUHC is not requesting that any further documents be provided at this stage. Any documents emailed will not be considered as part of the assessment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.&nbsp;Can </span> funding be used retrospectively?</h3>

<p>Following the award of a grant, capital costs incurred in the creation of new Changing Places toilets is eligible expenditure. The purpose of the fund is to ensure additional activity and local authorities must ensure that funding is not used to replace funding already secured for Changing Places toilets already built or in progress.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.&nbsp;If </span> we do not receive the full amount requested, can we decide not to accept the funding offer?</h3>

<p>Yes. Local authorities are not obliged to apply for or to accept grant funding that is offered.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13. </span> If we had a successful application in Round 1, can we apply for further funding to cover costings for those venues?</h3>

<p>No, your application must be for a new venue, funding should not be used as a top up for venues successful in the first round.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.&nbsp;If </span> a local authority is applying to the fund simply to reflect projects submitted by third parties, how do we decide on the allocation of that funding? What if we have some projects that are well advanced and some that are weaker?</h3>

<p>Applications will be considered as a whole, and the strategic rationale of proposals will be taken into account as part of the assessment of quality. It is for local authorities to propose projects that they consider to be deliverable, and which best fit the goals of the programme and needs of local users.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.&nbsp;Are </span> we expected to have planning, design etc prior to expression of interest?</h3>

<p>No, although some projects will have. We recognise that projects will be at different stages of development. However, grant allocations will be determined by the contents of expression of interests and further advice can be sought from the MDUK Changing Places Support Officers.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.&nbsp;What </span> extent of consultation are you looking for?</h3>

<p>At a minimum local authorities should consult the Research Institute for Disabled Consumers Insight Research into the user preference of venue and location, this can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/changing-places-toilets-programme-round-2-prospectus/changing-places-toilets-programme-round-2-prospectus#annex-a-research-institute-for-disabled-consumers-ridc-insight-research">Annex A</a> of the prospectus and highlights regional variations in preference. A good application should have also engaged with local users to produce an appointable application reflective of the needs of your local community.</p>

<h2>Co-funding</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.&nbsp;What </span> if we cannot secure co-funding?</h3>

<p>The funding prospectus sets out the expectation that co-funding will be provided by local authorities and partners. Local authorities (or third parties) must commit to ensure the ongoing maintenance and cleaning of new Changing Places toilets to be eligible for support and the first 3 years of these costs may be included as co-funding.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.&nbsp;Can </span> you advise on where we can source co-funding to fund the ongoing maintenance, cleaning and admin costs?</h3>

<p>Local authorities are responsible for identifying co-funding and must commit to ensure ongoing maintenance and cleaning costs are in place. Examples are provided in the funding prospectus of where private sector partners have developed Changing Places toilets.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">19.&nbsp;If </span> the project underspends, will the amount of co-funding need to remain at the same level as at approval stage?</h3>

<p>We expect co-funding levels to remain as set out in expressions of interest. Any changes would need to secure prior agreement from DLUHC as part of our monitoring approach during the delivery stage.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">20.&nbsp;Could </span> local authority officer time be counted as co-funding?</h3>

<p>Eligible co-funding includes capital contributions, the first 3 years of revenue maintenance and cleaning costs and any in-kind contributions directly related to the delivery of new Changing Places toilets (e.g., dedicated staff time and technical support such as surveys and plans).</p>

<h2>Contract management and funding</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">21.&nbsp;If </span> projects prove to be unfeasible at a later stage can we rework our bid?</h3>

<p>Local authorities are expected to manage project delivery on the basis of the expression of interest and grant offer letter. Any changes would need to be agreed with DLUHC through our Project Change Request process.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">22.&nbsp;Will </span> local authorities be expected to directly procure and deliver this installation work themselves, or will it be possible for the receiving authority to grant funding to a partner organisation (for example, a local voluntary sector organisation running a community building, or a local leisure attraction)?</h3>

<p>Local authorities are responsible for any contracting and procurement arrangements. Where a third party is to receive the funding, local authorities must satisfy themselves that sufficient contractual arrangements are in place. Local authorities remain accountable to DLUHC for expenditure and must report on project progress.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">23.&nbsp;Is </span> there any guidance around state aid and commercially / private buildings, e.g. shopping centres?</h3>

<p>Local authorities providing funds to third parties should assure themselves that any grant payments are in compliance with subsidy control rules. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/complying-with-the-uks-international-obligations-on-subsidy-control-guidance-for-public-authorities/technical-guidance-on-the-uks-international-subsidy-control-commitments">guidance on UK regime</a>.</p>

<h2>Monitoring</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">24.&nbsp;How </span> often will DLUHC require monitoring reports?</h3>

<p>It is expected that local authorities will provide monitoring reports to DLUHC quarterly. Further details will be set out in grant offer letters.</p>

<h2>In/out of scope</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">25.&nbsp;Are </span> mobile facilities in scope?</h3>

<p>Although the main focus of the funding is to increase provision in existing buildings, or buildings not covered by the statutory guidance issued in 2020, extending Changing Places toilet provision through the use of mobile Changing Places toilets which could align and contribute to activities supporting economic recovery (e.g. events to encourage people back to town centres) may also be considered.</p>

<p>However, it is clear from user engagement that it is critical that users know that facilities are available in order to plan their movements. Therefore, whilst mobile units may play a part in local authority plans this must be carefully considered and balanced with the fact that due to their peripatetic nature users will find it more difficult to plan journeys. For the avoidance of doubt, the hire of temporary facilities, either mobile or static is not eligible under the fund.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">26.&nbsp;If </span> we need to reconfigure existing non-Changing Places toilets in order to fit in the new Changing Places toilet, would that expenditure be in scope?</h3>

<p>Yes, as long as there is no net loss of existing toilet provision across the local authority and the new Changing Places toilet is additional to existing provision.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">27.&nbsp;Would </span> a ‘pod’ attached to or adjacent to an existing building be eligible under the current programme?</h3>

<p>This would be in scope as long as the structure is i) an addition to an existing structure, ii) permanent, iii) publicly accessible, iv) does not detract from existing toilet facilities of any kind and v) meets government requirements and the required specifications as outlined in the prospectus and vi) is able to be registered by the Changing Places consortium.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">28.&nbsp;Does </span> all of the funding have to be used to create the Changing Places toilet itself or can we use some of it to provide additional access (e.g. a ramp or footpath to access a Changing Places toilet in a park or at a beach?)</h3>

<p>Capital costs that ensure that a newly installed Changing Places toilet is accessible will be in scope for this funding. Local authorities must assure themselves that any expenditure relates directly to the provision of the Changing Places toilet.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">29.&nbsp;Where </span> a building already has a high number of accessible toilets would funding for conversion still be considered?</h3>

<p>Conversion and reconfiguration is permitted only where it does not detract from existing toilet provision of any kind across your local authority area.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">30.&nbsp;I </span> have a facility that is not compliant with the rules for it to be considered a Changing Places toilet and which will require some amendments to bring it up to spec. Is this reasonable to include in the application?</h3>

<p>Yes, you can use this funding to convert a non-spec Changing Places toilet into a registered Changing Places toilet.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">31.&nbsp;Can </span> we make an application to include a Changing Places toilet in a new building under construction?</h3>

<p>Our primary aim is to increase the number of Changing Places toilets in existing buildings however applications can be made for those buildings which are not covered by statutory guidance as set out at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/990362/Approved_Document_M_vol_2.pdf" rel="external">paragraph 5.7e of Approved Document M, Volume 2 of the building rules introduced in 2020</a>. Those new buildings or those under constructions that are required to install a Changing Places toilet as part of these regulations will not be eligible.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">32.&nbsp;Can </span> we apply for a Changing Places toilet to be installed on a popular ferry crossing?</h3>

<p>Ferries and other modes of transport are not eligible for funding as they are not considered a building in the recognised sense and are therefore not covered by building regulations.</p>

<h2>Public access</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">33.&nbsp;Is </span> there an expectation that Changing Places toilets will need to remain in use for a certain period of time?</h3>

<p>DLUHC expects that local authorities assure themselves that any Changing Places toilet funded through this programme should be sustainable.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">34.&nbsp;What </span> if a venue closes or changes its opening hours?</h3>

<p>Local authorities should assure themselves that any Changing Places toilet project is deliverable and will remain accessible to the people that need it on a sustainable basis. Any change to access hours will need to be reported to the MDUK Changing Places Support Officers to ensure the access information for users is updated.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">35.&nbsp;What </span> if a venue has paid entry to the public?</h3>

<p>Changing Places toilets may be funded in premises where it is necessary to pay an entry charge if the general public have accessibility. Changing Places toilets may not be funded in privately accessed premises.</p>

<h2>Registration</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">36. </span> What best practice should we follow to ensure our Changing Places toilet gets registered?</h3>

<p>Local authorities are expected to consult MDUK Support Officers throughout the planning and delivery phases of the projects. This includes attendance at training sessions and sharing business plans, to ensure that the Changing Places toilet meets the required standard for registration.</p>

<p>Projects that do not meet the required standard for registration will not qualify for funding and will be deemed ineligible.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">37. </span> How do I get my Changing Places toilet registered with MDUK Support Officers?</h3>

<p>Local authorities can register their Changing Places toilet through MDUK Support Officers at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:cpt.support@musculardystrophyuk.org">cpt.support@musculardystrophyuk.org</a>. Local authorities are expected to share planning information with MDUK Support Officers to ensure registration and comply with their standard practises regarding promotion.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">38. </span> Can you provide any training regarding the specifications of the Changing Places toilet?</h3>

<p>Training is available for all local authorities on the requirement through the MDUK support officers please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:cpt.support@musculardystrophyuk.org">cpt.support@musculardystrophyuk.org</a> for more details.</p>
