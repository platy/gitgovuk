<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>1.1 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/regulatory-standards">The Value for Money Standard</a> requires registered providers to annually report on their performance against a suite of measures defined by the regulator along with their own value for money measures and targets, with which to measure economy, efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

<p>1.2 This document sets out the detail of the regulator’s <abbr title="Value for money">VFM</abbr> metrics and how these metrics are defined. It also sets out how these metrics are calculated from the 2022 Electronic Annual Accounts (referred to as <abbr title="Financial Viability Assessment">FVA</abbr>). The regulator’s <abbr title="Value for money">VFM</abbr> metrics remain the most appropriate set of measures to capture performance across the sector in a fair and comparable way.</p>

<p>1.3 Registered providers should submit regulatory returns as soon as practicable. The latest submission date for the <abbr title="Financial Viability Assessment">FVA</abbr> return is six months after a provider’s year end. For most of the sector this will be 30 September 2022.</p>

<p>1.4 Small registered providers (those owning or managing fewer than 1,000 homes), should refer to Annex B which sets out how the <abbr title="Value for money">VFM</abbr> metrics are calculated, using designated lines from providers’ Annual Accounts (Financial statements).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Reporting expectations</h2>

<p>2.1	The regulator has selected the <abbr title="Value for money">VFM</abbr> metrics that work for the majority of providers. However, we acknowledge that any metric, however calculated, will inevitably be more appropriate for some providers than others, and there may be a minority of cases where reporting on a particular basis is difficult, or inappropriate, given the unusual nature of a given organisation’s business or differences in accounting practice.</p>

<p>2.2	The regulator cannot change the required <abbr title="Value for money">VFM</abbr> metrics on this basis, where it works for the majority of the sector. However, where a provider’s reported data is affected by a factor particular to that organisation, they should clarify this in the commentary accompanying the publication of their data.</p>

<p>2.3	If registered providers are reporting on a wide range of different bases, then this clearly undermines the overall objectives of transparency and comparability. All registered providers are required to follow the calculations in this technical note and, in their reporting in the Annual Accounts, should not seek to make adjustments to the <abbr title="Value for money">VFM</abbr> metrics themselves.</p>

<p>2.4	One of the regulator’s key objectives in defining a set of standard <abbr title="Value for money">VFM</abbr> metrics was to support transparency and allow providers to analyse their performance alongside that of their peers on a comparable basis. To support this objective the regulator has published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/value-for-money-guidance-and-reports">metrics</a> for all providers with more than 1,000 properties alongside Global Accounts datasets for each of the last three years. In order to drive better reporting performance, the regulator has provided commentary set out in the Value for money metrics and reporting 2021 publication accompanying the datasets to help boards with future reporting.</p>

<p>2.5	The regulator will continue to seek assurance that providers make best use of their resources and of their assets and have on-going plans in place to make improvements to the value for money in their organisations. As a part of that assurance work, the regulator will use the value for money metrics to support its understanding of providers overall strategic delivery performance. Where we become aware of non-compliance with the requirements of the Value for Money Standard, we will determine the most appropriate regulatory engagement route.</p>

<p>2.6	The specific reporting expectations on value for money are set out in 2.2a and 2.2b of the <abbr title="Value for money">VFM</abbr> Standard and amplified in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/value-for-money-standard"><abbr title="Value for money">VFM</abbr> Code of Practice</a>.</p>

<p>2.7 Further detail of the regulator’s approach to value for money regulation is set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulating-the-standards">Regulating the Standards</a>.</p>

<h2>Metric 1 – Reinvestment %</h2>

<p>3.1 The Reinvestment metric looks at the investment in properties (Existing stock and New Supply) as a percentage of the value of total properties held <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>Metric 2 – New supply delivered %</h2>

<p>3.2 The New Supply metric sets out the number of new social housing and non-social housing units that have been acquired or developed in the year as a proportion of total social housing units and non-social housing units owned at period end.</p>

<p>3.3 Registered providers will report on two New Supply delivered ratios:</p>

<p>A: New Supply delivered (Social housing units)</p>

<p>B: New Supply delivered (Non-social housing units)</p>

<h2>Metric 3 – Gearing %</h2>

<p>3.4 The gearing metric assesses how much of the adjusted assets are made up of debt and the degree of dependence on debt finance. It is often a key indicator of a registered provider’s appetite for growth.</p>

<p>3.5 Note: Registered providers can be restricted by lenders’ covenants and therefore may not have the ability in which to increase the loan portfolio despite showing a relatively average gearing result.</p>

<h2>Metric 4 – Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, Amortisation, Major Repairs Included Interest Cover %</h2>

<p>3.6 The EBITDA MRI interest cover measure is a key indicator for liquidity and investment capacity. It seeks to measure the level of surplus that a registered provider generates compared to interest payable; the measure avoids any distortions stemming from the depreciation charge.</p>

<h2>Metric 6 – Operating Margin %</h2>

<p>3.8 The Operating Margin demonstrates the profitability of operating assets before exceptional expenses are taken into account. Increasing margins are one way to improve the financial efficiency of a business. In assessing this ratio, it is important that consideration is given to registered providers’ purpose and objectives (including their social objectives). Further consideration should also be given to specialist providers who tend to have lower margins than average.</p>

<p>3.9 Registered providers will report on two Operating Margin ratios:</p>

<p>A. Operating Margin (social housing lettings only)</p>

<p>B. Operating Margin (overall)</p>

<h2>Annex B: Guidance note on the Value for Money metrics reporting for small providers</h2>

<p>(Registered providers with fewer than 1,000 units)</p>

<p>This part of the guidance should be used by registered providers with a stock holding of fewer than 1,000 units, (those providers that are not required to submit an electronic copy of the Annual Accounts, to the regulator).</p>

<p>The Value for Money Standard requires registered providers to report on all of the <abbr title="Value for money">VFM</abbr> metrics, including the two sub-metrics, within the Annual Accounts. For reporting purposes, registered providers should discuss and agree the format of their Annual Accounts (Financial statements) with their Auditor or their Accountant.</p>

<p>This guidance note is intended to help small providers calculate the <abbr title="Value for money">VFM</abbr> metrics from their Annual Accounts (Financial statements).</p>

<p>The regulator is aware that not all the <abbr title="Value for money">VFM</abbr> metrics will be applicable to every small provider given the diversity of business models across the sector. In the spirit of transparency and accountability, where the value of a <abbr title="Value for money">VFM</abbr> metric is calculated as zero, this should be reported as so.</p>
