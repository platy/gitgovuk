<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Our forestry Environmental Impact Assessments (<abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessments">EIA</abbr>) have changed</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>We’ve introduced new forms and clearer guidance to make <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessments">EIA</abbr> easier for everyone.</h3>

<p>Lots of people find <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessments">EIA</abbr> challenging. To help applicants make better applications to the Forestry Commission, we’ve changed the format of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/environmental-impact-assessments-for-woodland" class="govuk-link">our forestry <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessments">EIA</abbr> forms and provided clearer guidance</a> to help you through the process.</p>

<p>We’ve also clarified when you can proceed without the need to submit an <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessments">EIA</abbr> application. The <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessments">EIA</abbr> process is compliant with the UK Forestry Standard, and compatible with your Woodland Creation Planning Grant.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Who is this for?</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/environmental-impact-assessments-for-woodland" class="govuk-link">new forms</a> can be used by anyone who is looking to apply for a non-grant funded <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessments">EIA</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you are planning to apply to the Forestry Commission (<abbr title="Forestry Commission">FC</abbr>) for a non-grant funded <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessments">EIA</abbr>, the new forms can be found on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/environmental-impact-assessments-for-woodland" class="govuk-link">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Forestry Commission">FC</abbr> will continue to accept old format forms for 6 months (until 31 March 2022).</p>

<p>If you have already applied for an <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessments">EIA</abbr>, or are applying for an <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessments">EIA</abbr> through a <abbr title="Forestry Commission">FC</abbr> administered woodland creation grant scheme, these changes won’t affect you.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>What have we changed?</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessments">EIA</abbr> regulations have not changed, what’s different are our application forms and guidance.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessments">EIA</abbr> application forms have been improved to help applicants make better applications and receive faster decisions from the <abbr title="Forestry Commission">FC</abbr>. The new forms will help you demonstrate exactly how your proposal presents good forestry practice and how it complies with the UKFS.</p>

<p>Importantly, not every proposal needs to submit a forestry <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessments">EIA</abbr>, so we’ve updated <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/environmental-impact-assessments-for-woodland" class="govuk-link">our guidance</a> to make it clear that you don’t always need to apply.</p>

<p>What’s more, the new <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessments">EIA</abbr> forms are now compatible with the Woodland Creation Planning Grant; if you have an approved stage 2 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/woodland-creation-planning-grant">Woodland Creation Planning Grant</a> plan it is now much easier to apply for a non-grant funded afforestation <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessments">EIA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>What help is out there?</h3>
<p>We’ve also improved our <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessments">EIA</abbr> guidance.</p>

<p>The forestry <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/environmental-impact-assessments-for-woodland"><abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessments">EIA</abbr> home page on GOV.UK</a> helps you decide whether you need to apply for a forestry <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessments">EIA</abbr>, and tells you everything you need to know about applying.</p>

<p>Each <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessments">EIA</abbr> application form now comes with accompanying guidance, providing you with a question-by-question guide for those environmental issues you may not be familiar with.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span>Need more help on <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessments">EIA</abbr>?</h3>
<p>We’ve also introduced two support pages to help you make sure you’ve considered key environmental constraints on your land before you apply to the <abbr title="Forestry Commission">FC</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/forestry-project-checks-all-projects">Forestry Project Checks: all projects</a> is a handy checklist of actions for all forestry project proposers.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/forestry-project-checks-constraints" class="govuk-link">Forestry Project Checks: constraints</a> helps you interpret constraints on your land that you find using Land Information Search on the <abbr title="Forestry Commission">FC</abbr> Map Browser, or other map browsers.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/forestry-commission/about/access-and-opening#area-offices">contact your local Woodland Officer</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Updates to the Forestry Commission Map Browser and Land Information Search</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>The Forestry Commission is making improvements to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/use-the-land-information-search" class="govuk-link">map browser and Land Information Search (<abbr title="Land Information Search">LIS</abbr>)</a> which enable users to view spatial data layers published by the Forestry Commission.</h3>

<p>Users are able to see how these data layers interact with areas of land in which they have an interest, and can identify various agreements for forestry and woodland management activity that has been approved.</p>

<p>The map browser and <abbr title="Land Information Search">LIS</abbr> were launched in their current form in December 2018. In 2021, the Forestry Commission launched the first of a series of developments to give users access to better information about land in England. A total of 54 new data layers have been added to the map browser, and the <abbr title="Land Information Search">LIS</abbr> tool has been reconfigured to make it easier to interpret, as well as providing more detailed scoring information for the different grants on offer.</p>

<p>The Forestry Commission works with other organisations to ensure that we are able to access the most up-to-date and relevant data to aid woodland creation. Further developments to improve the user experience are ongoing, and will be launched in the coming months.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The updates to the external map browser and LIS are expected to go live on Friday 1st October. On this day, the map browser and LIS will be unavailable between 08:00 and 18:00</p>

<span class="number">3. </span>Woodlands for Water launches</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Project to support landowners and farmers to plant trees along riverbanks and water courses.</h3>
<p>‘Woodlands for Water’ aims to create 3,150 hectares of trees in six river catchment areas from Devon to Cumbria by March 2025.</p>

<p>Farmers and landowners will be able to apply for funding through the <a rel="external" href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fguidance%2Fengland-woodland-creation-offer&amp;data=04%7C01%7CPhoebe.Brown%40defra.gov.uk%7Ca3e55ceb617844d2c2ed08d97d0e2310%7C770a245002274c6290c74e38537f1102%7C0%7C0%7C637678321981251774%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=3ehSmWA6%2FdERuPerRU7E%2F8zifRjjYZILWcnUYUqWUK8%3D&amp;reserved=0" class="govuk-link">England Woodland Creation Offer</a> grant scheme.</p>

<p>There are 242,262km of watercourses in England, and it is hoped that by planting trees in this way they will contribute to a natural network of habitats across the country as part of our plans to expand, improve and connect these places across our towns, cities and countryside.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>The Northern Forest has been awarded £14.8 million from the Nature for Climate Fund</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>This funding from the Nature for Climate Fund will support over 1 million trees to be planted in the north of England over the next year.</h3>

<p>The Northern Forest has already established over 3 million new trees since 2018 and is transforming the landscape from coast to coast and in and around cities such as Liverpool, Chester, Manchester, Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield, York and Hull.</p>
