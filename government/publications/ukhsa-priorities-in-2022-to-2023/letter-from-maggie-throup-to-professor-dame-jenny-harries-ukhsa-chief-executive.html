<p>Dear Jenny,</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Health Security Agency strategic remit and priorities</h2>

<p>This letter sets out the government’s priorities for the United Kingdom Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) for the period April 2022 to March 2023. Given the urgent work on the Omicron response and the implications for the spending review, which were agreed in late March, I acknowledge with thanks your work in the last 4 months before this letter has been issued.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> has brought together staff and capabilities of NHS Test and Trace, the health protection elements of Public Health England, the Joint Biosecurity Centre and, since April 2022, the Managed Quarantine Service to strengthen health protection capability across the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>I would like to thank all <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>’s staff for their:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tireless efforts to establish the agency in a complex and challenging context</li>
  <li>significant achievements in responding to coronavirus (COVID-19), and in other areas including monkeypox, hepatitis C and HIV</li>
  <li>work to build relationships with partners across the health and care system, government and the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is our permanent standing capacity to prepare for, prevent and respond to threats to health. Its responsibilities are for England, across the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> on reserved health matters, and in partnership with lead agencies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on devolved issues where relevant.</p>

<p>Since its creation, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> has necessarily dedicated a significant proportion of its time and expertise towards responding to COVID-19. The agency’s capacity to continue to respond to resurgences and new COVID-19 variants is being maintained in line with the government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-living-with-covid-19">COVID-19 Response: Living with COVID-19</a> strategy, and this capacity to respond is scalable within funding limits. This is enabling <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> to continue the response to COVID-19 alongside focusing on a broader range of health security priorities during the year ahead.</p>

<p>As agreed in principle, the transfer of responsibilities of the Vaccine Taskforce (<abbr title="Vaccine Taskforce">VTF</abbr>) from September 2022 to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> provides an opportunity for <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> to harness the strengths of the <abbr title="Vaccine Taskforce">VTF</abbr>, including its:</p>

<ul>
  <li>excellent relationships with industry</li>
  <li>culture of delivering at pace</li>
  <li>expertise in innovation</li>
</ul>

<p>Once responsibilities have been moved to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, progress will be assessed at an agreed point in the year.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>’s core remit</h2>

<p>The Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) delivers its responsibilities on behalf of the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care through <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and other delivery partners, and is accountable to Parliament for effective delivery of their remit and services.</p>

<p>As an executive agency of the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> with operational autonomy, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide strong national leadership on health security and health protection</li>
  <li>ensure a cohesive response across public health functions</li>
  <li>embed effective clinical, scientific and operational functions in the public health system</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will develop its global-to-local reach, working with international and domestic partners, and combining robust science and analytics, insightful planning and responsive operational excellence, to keep the nation’s health secure.</p>

<p>As the nation’s expert dedicated health security agency, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prevent: anticipate threats to health and help build the nation’s readiness, defences, and domestic and global health security</li>
  <li>detect: use environmental, digital and biological surveillance to proactively detect and monitor infectious diseases and threats to health</li>
  <li>analyse: use science and data analytics to assess and continually monitor threats to health, identifying how best to control and mitigate risks and impacts across all communities</li>
  <li>respond: take rapid, collaborative and effective actions globally, nationally and locally to mitigate and recover from threats to health when they materialise</li>
  <li>lead: lead strong and sustainable global, national, regional and local partnerships designed to save lives, protect the nation from public health threats, and systematically reduce disparities at scale</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will be expected to align with and, wherever applicable, input to relevant cross-system work including:</p>

</ul>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will co-ordinate closely with the Office for Life Sciences to support delivery of the government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/life-sciences-vision">Life Sciences Vision</a> including the healthcare missions, and with <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> on global health security policy. Research will be a high priority, including through collaborative programmes with academia and industry, particularly playing an important role in signalling to research funders key priorities for research.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will be proactive in its approach to infection control and collaborate effectively across the public health system in order to prepare for, respond to and recover from all health hazards. This will involve building and sustaining strong, impactful relationships across local and national government, including with agencies in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, the Crown dependencies, local authorities and other system partners across the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to ensure threats are effectively identified, mitigated and addressed at home and abroad.</p>

<p>The agency will work alongside <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> – including the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (<abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>), NHS England (<abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr>) and NHS public health teams – on priority programmes.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will also set out how it will work with tripartite partners (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and <abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr>) to plan for and respond to health emergencies, including infectious diseases and other health hazards.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will work closely with the Chief Medical Officer (<abbr title="Chief Medical Officer">CMO</abbr>), who is the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s most senior medical adviser and head of the public health profession. The <abbr title="Chief Medical Officer">CMO</abbr> will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the ultimate arbiter for advice on scientific and medical matters</li>
  <li>formally consulted on wider health protection strategy</li>
  <li>the professional lead for <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>’s most senior medical professional</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Chief Medical Officer">CMO</abbr> will co-ordinate closely with <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> in support of the agency’s global health remit.</p>

<p>Additionally, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will be a trusted source of public health advice and scientific expertise to government, and will also work closely with <abbr title="Chief Medical Officers">CMOs</abbr> for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will synthesise its multiple areas of expertise into an organisational view, which can be used to advise the system, <abbr title="Chief Medical Officers">CMOs</abbr> and relevant ministers.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will need to develop a culture that invests in its people and nurtures talent, enabling it to attract and retain highly talented individuals in public health. To empower and enable its workforce to succeed, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will create a working environment where innovation, collaboration and continuous improvement are at the heart of everything it does. Underpinning this are <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>’s values of being impactful, insightful and inclusive, which are fundamental to achieving this goal. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will strive to improve its capability to ensure that <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>’s future workforce is equipped to deal with health hazards.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will develop and agree specific deliverables, and ensure that the agency operates at optimal effectiveness and efficiency, and provides value for money. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will plan to use its resources in an affordable and sustainable manner, and within agreed limits as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/framework-document-between-the-department-of-health-and-social-care-and-the-uk-health-security-agency">framework document between <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr></a>, and in accordance with its obligations to the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> with regard to financial management, forecasting and reporting. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will look to take advantage of any income generation streams that may arise from assets such as <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>’s laboratory network.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will prepare comprehensively for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://covid19.public-inquiry.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> COVID-19 Inquiry</a> and communicate transparently with <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will fully engage with the inquiry, including responding to evidence requests as required and providing appropriate support to any witnesses to the inquiry for whom <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> are responsible.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>’s priorities for 2022 to 2023</h2>

<p>The detailed priorities are attached at Annex A. In summary, organised in 3 areas, during 2022 to 2023, the government expects <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> to:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>1. Reduce harm from infectious disease and other health security hazards, and achieve more equitable outcomes.</p>
</div>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will look to reduce the harm from threats to health, including COVID-19, by ensuring effective emergency preparedness, resilience, response and the ability to flex capacity where required in response to health emergencies, including infectious diseases and other health hazards.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take on relevant COVID-19 responsibilities of the <abbr title="Vaccine Taskforce">VTF</abbr> from September 2022, ensuring that key elements of its legacy are retained and strengthened through close engagement with industry, harnessing technical and commercial expertise, and centralised procurement</li>
  <li>provide public health expertise to support <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> as the system leader in delivering chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear (<abbr title="chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear">CBRN</abbr>) planning and response work</li>
  <li>continue to improve our immunisation programmes and combat antimicrobial resistance domestically and globally</li>
  <li>embed lessons learnt from COVID-19 by providing technical expertise, and contribute to the evidence base for how we respond in the future to improve the health and social care system</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>2. Prepare for future health security hazards so that our health, society, public services and economy are less impacted.</p>
</div>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will strengthen pandemic preparedness to ensure that it becomes embedded within national security structures so that the country is well positioned to respond to all threats to health. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will learn lessons from and build on the legacy of the response to COVID-19, while delivering a resilient and scalable infrastructure to protect against future pandemics, and health threats, including waves of COVID-19.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>deliver a resilient and scalable infrastructure, including testing to protect against future waves of COVID-19, future pandemics and wider health threats</li>
  <li>develop a new strategic approach to pandemic preparedness to prevent, detect, track and respond to public health threats rapidly, harnessing the power of advances in technology and data science such as genomic surveillance</li>
  <li>continue to maintain and deploy robust emergency clinical countermeasures and stockpiled medicines</li>
  <li>ensure robust response capacity and capability to respond to health hazards, including <abbr title="chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear">CBRN</abbr> incidents</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>3. Strengthen health security capability to improve the effectiveness of our local, national and global response.</p>
</div>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will look to deepen the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s role in global health security through playing a leading role on the global stage and fulfilling international responsibilities.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improve links to disease surveillance and detection beyond <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> borders through ongoing collaboration, and information and data-sharing with international partners, and supporting delivery of the cross-government global health strategy</li>
  <li>ensure that the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> is playing a leading part in the development and implementation of international health security initiatives, and will drive improvements in global health security</li>
  <li>engage effectively with the World Health Organization (<abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>) and other international partners on global surveillance initiatives to:
    <ul>
      <li>promote <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> expertise</li>
      <li>enable <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> to be at the forefront of the response to global threats to health, and to be pre-warned and prepared for health threats to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> that may arise outside its borders – this has to be co-ordinated with and under the strategic direction of the wider <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> government</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Much of <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>’s work outlined during 2022 to 2023 is vital core activity that is central to the function and capabilities of the agency, and that it should be carrying out on a continuous basis year to year. This remit letter distinguishes this core activity from the specific actions for the year. Going forward, core activity will not be formally re-commissioned each year for the remit letter, streamlining the process.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is still in a development phase. Notwithstanding this, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will undertake an efficient, effective and robust transition of the agency’s functions in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-living-with-covid-19">Response COVID-19: Living with COVID-19</a> strategy and the spending review settlement, through a staged process of reorientation, transformation and re-design of internal structures.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will take the necessary time to develop and agree pragmatic and specific deliverables aligned to this remit letter.</p>

<h2>Annex A: detailed priorities for <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> in 2022 to 2023</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Reduce harm from infectious disease and other health security hazards</h3>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will support a joined-up and <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-mindful approach to health security and health protection, embedding <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> governance and engagement across all <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-wide programmes by building on collaborative action already in train, and drawing on lessons and experiences as appropriate.</p>
