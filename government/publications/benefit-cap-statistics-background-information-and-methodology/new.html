<h2>Context of the statistics</h2>

<p>There is a limit on the total amount of benefits that most working age people can get. This is called the benefit cap.</p>

<h2>Benefits affected by the cap</h2>

<p>The benefit cap applies to the combined income from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bereavement Allowance</li>
  <li>Child Benefit</li>
  <li>Child Tax Credit</li>
  <li>Employment and Support Allowance (except when the Support Component is in payment)</li>
  <li>Housing Benefit (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Incapacity Benefit</li>
  <li>Income Support</li>
  <li>Jobseeker’s Allowance</li>
  <li>Maternity Allowance</li>
  <li>Severe Disablement Allowance</li>
  <li>Widowed Parent’s Allowance (or Widowed Mother’s Allowance or Widow’s Pension if you started getting it before 9 April 2001)</li>
  <li>Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The cap is applied by reducing the amount of benefit a household receives, so that the total household benefit no longer sums to more than the cap level. The benefit cap can be applied through either:</p>

<ul>
  <li><abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr></li>
  <li><abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr></li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike legacy benefits, <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> is assessed and paid monthly and it is calculated based on the household circumstances. The benefit cap is applied to the full <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> award, not just to housing costs.</p>

<p>The benefit cap for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> is calculated as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Calculate the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> maximum amount (the standard allowance plus any elements, for example housing costs and child elements)</li>
  <li>Deduct for any earnings or income (for example, savings)</li>
  <li>Compare this revised <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> amount with the cap level</li>
  <li>Reduce the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> amount to the cap level, if relevant</li>
  <li>Take into account any loans, advances or penalties</li>
</ul>

<h2>Benefits not included in the cap</h2>

<p>A household is not capped if someone in the household is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>working enough hours to get Working Tax Credit (<abbr title="Working Tax Credit">WTC</abbr>), even if not claiming it</li>
  <li>over Pension Credit age</li>
  <li>getting <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> because of a disability or health condition that stops them from working (this is called ‘limited capability for work and work-related activity’)</li>
  <li>getting <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> because they care for someone with a disability</li>
  <li>getting <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and the household earns more than £604<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> a month combined, after tax and National Insurance contributions.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also a grace period during which the cap will not be applied:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for households where the cap is applied through <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> there is a grace period of 39 weeks during which time the cap will not apply to households where the claimant or, if applicable, their partner has worked for 50 weeks out of the 52 weeks preceding their last day of work</li>
  <li>for households where the cap is applied through <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> there is a grace period of 9 months during which time the cap will not apply to those who have been in work for the previous 12 months, with household earnings above the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> earnings threshold, currently more than £604 a month combined, after tax and National Insurance contributions.</li>
</ul>

<p>A household is also not affected by the cap if someone in the household, including any children under 18, is in receipt of an exempt benefit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Armed Forces Compensation Scheme</li>
  <li>Armed Forces Independence Payment</li>
  <li>Attendance Allowance</li>
  <li>Carer’s Allowance</li>
  <li>Disability Living Allowance (<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Employment and Support Allowance (Support component)</li>
  <li>Guardian’s Allowance</li>
  <li>Industrial Injuries Benefits (and equivalent payments as part of a War Disablement - Pension or the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme)</li>
  <li>Personal Independence Payment (<abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>War pensions</li>
  <li>War Widow’s or War Widower’s Pension</li>
</ul>

<p>Households in receipt of Carer’s Allowance or Guardian’s Allowance became exempt from the benefit cap on 7 November 2016. This was announced in Parliament during the passage of the Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016.</p>

<p>One-off payments are not included in the assessment of benefit income.</p>

<h2>Benefit Cap amounts</h2>

<p>The benefit cap was introduced from 15 April 2013 in Bromley, Croydon, Enfield and Haringey Local Authorities (<abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr>), with all other <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> applying the cap to households in receipt of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> between 15 July 2013 and the end of September 2013. The initial level of the benefit cap was £26,000 a year (£18,200 for single adults with no children).</p>

<p>The Summer Budget 2015 announced changes to the level of the benefit cap to £20,000 a year (£13,400 for single adults with no children) nationally or £23,000 a year (£15,410 for single adults with no children) in Greater London (the 32 London boroughs and the City of London). These changes were introduced from 7 November 2016. They were applied to all households that were already capped on 7 November and rolled-out to newly affected households from 7 November 2016 to 20 January 2017 by <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Discretionary Housing Payment (<abbr title="Discretionary Housing Payments">DHP</abbr>) is a discretionary scheme that allows <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> to make monetary awards to people experiencing financial difficulty with housing costs who qualify for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> or the housing costs element of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>. As part of the welfare reforms package introduced from 2011, the government has contributed over £1 billion towards <abbr title="Discretionary Housing Payment">DHPs</abbr> to help <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> support those affected by some of the key changes to <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>, including the introduction of the benefit cap.</p>

<h2>Uses of the statistics</h2>

<p>The statistics allow people to see how many households have had their <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> capped since the introduction of the policy, how many households currently have their <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> capped and how many households have moved off the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> cap, along with the characteristics of these households, such as family type and geographical location.</p>

<p>From February 2018 the statistics included experimental statistics on the number of households that have had their <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> capped by geographical location, family type and amount of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> capped.</p>

<p>From August 2018 the statistics on households that have had their <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> capped were expanded to include the cumulative caseload and off-flows from the cap under <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>. Off-flows are broken down to show the number of households that became exempt from the cap due to their earnings.</p>

<p>From August 2019 the statistics were further expanded to include total combined figures for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> and <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> capped households. These figures became available when the method to identify whether households who move from having their <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> capped to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> are then capped under <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>, was developed. Totals are available for the point in time caseload, cumulative caseload, and off-flows from the cap. The proportion of capped households containing children has since referred to all capped households, rather than only those claiming <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>. From August 2019, average (mean) cap amounts for both benefits were added, as well as further statistics on <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> capped households.</p>

<p>As set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/universal-credit-statistics-background-information/universal-credit-statistics-release-strategy">Universal Credit statistics consultation response</a>, we will develop further breakdowns of off-flows from the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> cap for future publications, as quality assurance of data from the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> systems is progressed.</p>

<p>The statistics are used by a variety of people within the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>), other central government Departments, Scotland and Wales devolved administrations and <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> and councils across Great Britain (GB).</p>

<p>The statistics are used to answer Parliamentary Questions and requests under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<h3>Point-in-time caseload</h3>

<p>The number of capped households at each month.</p>

<p>Point-in-time datasets contain one record per household, per month capped. From these datasets it is possible to identify the capped caseload at each month. <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> source data, <a class="govuk-link" href="#UC-data"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Quarterly Statistics</a>, are subject to revision. The most recent quarter of data are therefore provisional and will be subject to revision in subsequent releases. It is expected that the overall provisional figures will be within two per cent of their revised figure in future releases.</p>

<h3>Cumulative caseload</h3>

<p>The number of households that have ever been capped from the introduction of the benefit cap (or October 2016 for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) to the latest month.</p>

<p>Cumulative datasets contain one record per household that has ever been capped on either <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> or <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>. Characteristics (such as family type, <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr>, region) are based on when the household was first capped and may have subsequently changed.</p>

<h3>Off-flows</h3>

<p>The number of previously capped households that are no longer capped on either benefit (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> or <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>).</p>

<p>These are true off-flows i.e. no longer capped on either benefit. However, it is possible to talk about households that are off-flows from the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> cap or off-flows from the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> cap. Where this is the case it will clearly state <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> off-flows or <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> off-flows, if it is not stated then it is assumed to be a true off-flow.</p>

<h3>On-flows</h3>

<p>The number of households that are capped on their respective benefit (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> or <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) for the first time.</p>

<p>It is possible to be capped on <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> and when no longer capped on <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> to immediately on-flow to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and remain capped i.e. the household is capped on <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> for the first time.</p>

<h3>Newly capped</h3>

<p>The number of households that have their benefits capped for the very first time.</p>

<p>Unlike on-flows, newly capped is the first time a household is capped irrespective of the benefit (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> or <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>). This means that households that on-flow to the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> cap having immediately off-flowed from the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> cap are not newly capped because they have been capped previously.</p>

<p>Due to limitations of current methodology, it is not possible to identify a household that off-flows the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> cap and later (however, not immediately) on-flows to the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> cap. This would currently be counted as newly capped because they did not immediately flow from the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> cap to the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> cap.</p>

<h3>Household</h3>

<p>One or two adults, living together as a couple, plus any dependent children they are living with.</p>

<p>This definition applies to the benefit cap policy and hence this analysis. A household may also be referred to as a ‘benefit unit’. This definition differs from the Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>) definition that defines a household as one person alone; or a group of people (not necessarily related) living at the same address who share cooking facilities and share a living room or sitting room or dining area. A household by the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> definition may contain multiple benefit units.</p>

<p>There are a small number of cases where an individual or household has more than one <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim, for these cases, only the most recent claim is reported on.</p>

<h3>Reporting month</h3>

<p>For <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> data, <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> extract and return their data to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> over a four week rolling period based on an extraction schedule for each <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr>. For example, “February 2020” data shown last quarter was typically extracted between 28 January and 21 February 2020. Each <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> may extract their data up to a week before the date it is scheduled to be returned to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. Consequently, the statistics do not directly relate to a particular date but rather show the position of capped cases over a monthly cycle.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> data, a household must have an assessment period spanning the ‘count date’ for a particular month. An assessment period is the period of a month for which a <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> payment is made. The count date is the second Thursday of the month. Entitlement to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> must also have been calculated.</p>

<h3>Administrative geographies</h3>

<p>In this release, <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> data are presented using two sets of geographies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Administrative</li>
  <li>Residential</li>
</ul>

<p>Administrative geographies represent the administrative body responsible for administering the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>, and is therefore only meaningful at <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> level. There are cases where the administrative <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> is responsible for administering <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> outside the geographical boundaries of the <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr>, and the responsibility for particular dwellings can also change with time.</p>

<h3>Residential geographies</h3>

<p>In this release, <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> data are presented using two sets of geographies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Administrative</li>
  <li>Residential</li>
</ul>

<p>Residential geographies represent the geographic boundaries of the <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> area and is determined by the location of the dwelling that the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> relates to. Residential geographies can be presented using a wide range of geographies based on the postcode level of the dwelling itself, usually ranging from the output areas (<abbr title="output areas">OAs</abbr>), which comprise a few postcodes only, up to country level. Residential geographies may change if there is a change in the geographical boundaries, and affect all the dwellings affected by the boundary change.</p>

<h2>Data sources</h2>

<p>Data used to create the statistics come from administrative databases. For these, accuracy is determined by how well the information is recorded and transmitted.</p>

<h3>Change in methodology – source data</h3>

<p>From November 2020 (data to August 2020) methodology to use existing <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> and <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> data sources to produce this release has been implemented. Using existing data sources for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> and <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> allows for:</p>

<ul>

<h3>Housing Benefit data – from November 2020</h3>

<p><abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> capped household data have been sourced from the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Caseload Statistics since November 2020. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/housing-benefit-caseload-statistics">Read more about <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Caseload Statistics (including their methodology)</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Caseload Statistics data source is the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> 100% Single Housing Benefit Extract (<abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr>). Read <a class="govuk-link" href="#HB-to-Nov">Housing Benefit data – to November 2020</a> for further details on <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> and how data are matched to other data sources.</p>

<h3>Housing Benefit data – to November 2020</h3>

<p>In the historical data up to November 2020, the main source of data on households that had their <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> capped is the <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr>. <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> is a monthly electronic scan of claimant level data direct from <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> computer systems. It has been designed to provide sufficient information for all current and future statistical purposes and is now the single source of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> data. From April 2013, a Benefit Cap field was added to the <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> which provides the weekly amount that the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> of a household had been capped by. This marker is central to the production of the statistics on households that have had their <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> capped.</p>

<p>The proportion of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claiming households that have their benefits capped is created by taking the latest published <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload statistics from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/jsf/login.xhtml" rel="external">Stat Xplore</a>, and calculating the percentage of these households that appear in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> cap caseload at that month. These statistics have an additional 3-month lag compared to the rest of the statistics in the publication. This is due to the availability of published <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload data.</p>

<p>The age of the youngest child dependant in a household is calculated by merging data held on <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> child benefit systems to <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> data on capped households. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefits data is merged with <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> data on capped households to give information on the types of benefits claimed by capped households.
Data on those households that have (previously) had their <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> capped that are no longer capped is linked to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefits data to determine why households are no longer capped.</p>

<h3>Universal Credit data – from November 2020</h3>

<p><abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> capped household data have been sourced from the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Quarterly Statistics since November 2020. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/universal-credit-statistics#latest-quarterly-bulletin">Read more about <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Quarterly Statistics (including their methodology)</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Quarterly Statistics data source is the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Official Statistics database. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="#UC-to-Nov">Universal Credit data – to November 2020</a> for further details on the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Official Statistics database and how data are matched to other data sources.</p>

<h3>Universal Credit data – to November 2020</h3>

<p>In the historical data up to November 2020, data on households that have had their <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> capped is taken from the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Official Statistics database, which is compiled using data from systems within local offices and records of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> benefit payments made by the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. This database includes a field that contains the amount of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> that a household has been capped by for an assessment period. This marker is used in the production of statistics on households that have had their <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> capped.</p>

<p>This database only contains information for households that have had their <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Full Service (<abbr title="UC Full Service">UCFS</abbr>) capped. This data is available from October 2016 onwards. Due to data quality and reporting it is not possible to produce robust experimental statistics on the number of households that were capped under Universal Credit Live Service (<abbr title="UC Live Service">UCLS</abbr>).</p>

<p>Data on households that had their <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> capped is merged with the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Customer Information System (<abbr title="Customer Information System">CIS</abbr>) address file so that the number of capped households can be broken down by region and <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The proportion of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> claiming households who have their benefits capped is created by taking the latest published <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> household caseload statistics from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/jsf/login.xhtml" rel="external">Stat Xplore</a>, and calculating the percentage of these households that appear in the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> cap caseload at that month. These statistics have an additional 3-month lag compared to the rest of the statistics in the publication. This is due to the availability of published <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> household caseload data.</p>

<p>Before the September 2021 publication, covering data to June 2021, the age of the youngest child dependant and number of children in a household was calculated by merging data held on <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> child benefit systems to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> data on capped households.</p>

<p>From the September 2022 publication onwards <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> have provided new measures in the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Quarterly Statistics, which is the source data for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> capped households. The new measures are, the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>number of children in <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> households</li>
  <li>age of the youngest child in <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> households</li>
</ul>

<p>The source data for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> capped households will now provide these measures, for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> only. This means that the methodology of merging two administrative data sources, can be replaced by a single data source – giving improved coherence throughout the Benefit Cap statistics. The methodology of obtaining these measures for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> remain unchanged.</p>

<p>Data on households that have had their <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> capped is matched with the full <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Official Statistics database to obtain information on earnings, which is used to determine which households flowed off the cap under <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> due to becoming exempt due to their earnings.</p>

<h3>Data cleansing</h3>

<p>As part of our general data cleaning, we review the cases. From the March 2022 release we have introduced some additional cleaning which has made some minor revisions to previous published figures. There is no material impact on the published statistics.</p>

<h3>Change in methodology – proportion of capped households</h3>

<p>The proportion of benefit claiming households that are capped, is calculated by summing <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> capped households then dividing this, by the sum of all <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claiming households. Figures for the number of capped households are taken from the Benefit Cap <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> point-in-time caseload and the Benefit Cap <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> point-in-time caseload in Stat-Xplore. Figures for the total number of households claiming benefit are taken from Universal Credit Households on Universal Credit and Housing Benefit Housing Benefit – Data from April 2018 in Stat-Xplore for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> respectively.</p>

<p>Prior to June 2021, this calculation included claimants of state pension age whom are not in scope for the benefit cap. Therefore, to ensure fairer comparisons, from June 2021 (data to February 2021) this calculation selects only working age claimants (claimant type) from the Housing Benefit Housing Benefit – Data from April 2018 in Stat-Xplore.</p>

<h2>Geography</h2>

<h3>Improvements to geography in National and Official statistics releases</h3>

<p>Given the increased demand from users, the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is making improvements to the published geography information in its National and Official statistics releases. Read further information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dwp-statistical-geographies-in-national-and-official-statistics/changes-to-dwp-statistical-geographies-in-national-and-official-statistics">Changes to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> statistical geographies in National and Official statistics</a>.</p>

<h3>Census Output Area data – from November 2020</h3>

<p>Since November 2020, in line with improvements to National and Official Statistics, geography data have been taken from the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Caseload Statistics and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Quarterly Statistics for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> and <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>, respectively. These datasets provide geography data on the 2011 Census Output Area (<abbr title="Census Output Areas">COA</abbr>) geographies.</p>

<h3>Census Output Area data – from August 2020</h3>

<p>In August 2020 (data to May 2020), a new methodology was used to assign residential geographies by matching the address data for households with <abbr title="Customer Information System">CIS</abbr> data to obtain the most recent address information. The methodology is consistent with the methodology used in other statistical publications in <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Since August 2020 all residential data, in the accompanying ODS tables and Stat-Xplore, have been presented on the 2011 <abbr title="Census Output Areas">COA</abbr> geographies. Methodology introduced in August matches that of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Caseload Statistics and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Quarterly Statistics.</p>

<h3>Census Output Area data – to August 2020</h3>

<p>Prior to August 2020 all residential data were presented on 2001 <abbr title="Census Output Areas">COA</abbr> geographies. For comparison purposes, users can access residential data presented on the 2001 <abbr title="Census Output Areas">COA</abbr> geographies for the period of April 2013 to February 2018 via Stat-Xplore. This data is currently only presented for <abbr title="Parliamentary Constituency">PCs</abbr> but the range will be updated in future releases.</p>

<h2>Limitations of the statistics</h2>

<h3>Housing Benefit disruption</h3>

<p>After recovering from a cyber-attack in October 2020, Hackney Borough Council have now restored their supply of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claimant data to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> statistics for this Local Authority from August 2021 have been estimated using this new feed, with some additional data management.</p>

<h3>Housing Benefit data</h3>

<p>The statistics may not report on very short term capped households. This will occur in instances where a household is capped and then ceases to be capped all between the monthly snapshots taken from the source data – the <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr>. In any such cases, the recorded <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> data will not flag that a household has been capped, as at the times when scans were taken they were not. Therefore, whilst accurate at the time of scan, it does not capture these households.</p>

<p>When looking at the off-flows and outcomes statistics, the following points should be noted:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is no single source of outcomes and reasons for households to flow off the cap – the latest 100% <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefit scans, weekly <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> tax credit data, the <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> extract and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Official Statistics database are used to determine the most appropriate household benefits status</li>
  <li>an open <abbr title="Working Tax Credit">WTC</abbr> claim is a proxy for movements into work – this is not a comprehensive measure of moves into work; some individuals may go into work but not be eligible to claim <abbr title="Working Tax Credit">WTC</abbr> if their earnings are too high or the hours worked do not meet the claim requirements</li>
  <li>due to churn in on-flows and off-flows, the number of off-flows could fall from one month to the next if households move back onto the cap</li>
  <li>some of the lower category outcomes are not specifically a reason in themselves to come off the cap but are a measurable change in circumstance that may lead to an off-flow, for example a change in <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>from August 2018 the method for determining off-flow outcomes, and the outcome categories used, have changed – this means that off-flow outcome statistics published from August 2018 are not comparable with those published before August 2018. Read more detail on <a class="govuk-link" href="#HB-off">housing benefit data</a>
</li>
  <li>from August 2018 we report on households that have flowed off the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> cap as they have stopped claiming <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> and have a <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> claim. From August 2019 we identify whether these households have their <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> capped at the end of the quarter during which they leave the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> cap. Households who do move from the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> cap to the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> cap during the quarter are not counted as off flows from the benefit cap, only as having left the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> cap caseload</li>
</ul>

<h3>Universal Credit data</h3>

<p>The statistics for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> capped households include <abbr title="UC Full Service">UCFS</abbr> only. This data is available from October 2016 onwards. Due to data quality and reporting it is not possible to produce robust experimental statistics on the number of households that were capped under <abbr title="UC Live Service">UCLS</abbr>. <abbr title="UC Full Service">UCFS</abbr> is available to all claimant types, with all Live Service cases having moved across to Full Service, which has been available in every Jobcentre across the country since December 2018. Read more about the <a class="govuk-link" href="#UC-hist">introduction of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> cap statistics within the release</a>.</p>

<p>Figures may be revised in future publications, as in some instances <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> awards may be retrospectively revised.</p>

<p>For example, the amount of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> due to be paid for a past assessment period may go up where it’s identified that a household should have been entitled to a <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> element (such as housing costs), that wasn’t included in an earlier calculation of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>. This in turn could see their award being capped. In other circumstances there can be changes which means a household has the cap removed for a past assessment period.</p>

<p>The level of revision between previously published figures and the revised series varies across time periods, by geographical area and by other available breakdowns. More recent periods tend to be subject to a greater degree of revision than more distant ones. Read more on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/universal-credit-statistics-background-information-and-methodology">revision of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> data</a>.</p>

<h2>Characteristics of a household</h2>

<p>The characteristics of a capped household (for example family type, number of children, cap amount) are reported differently for point-in-time caseload and cumulative caseload statistics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>point-in-time caseload – the characteristics are reported as at the reporting month</li>
  <li>cumulative caseload – the characteristics are reported as at the first time a household was capped. This means they may have subsequently changed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Age of youngest child dependant</h3>

<p>This is calculated differently for point-in-time caseload and cumulative caseload statistics. In both cases the age of the youngest child dependant in a household is calculated by merging data held on <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> child benefit systems to <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> data on capped households.</p>

<ul>
  <li>point-in-time caseload – figures are based on the point-in-time caseload; the age of the youngest child dependant in a household is calculated at the reporting month (not at the time of initial cap) and household type is also given as at the reporting month</li>
  <li>cumulative caseload (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> only) – figures are based on the cumulative caseload; the age of the youngest child dependant in a household is calculated at the last month they were capped (not at the time of initial cap), which can be any month between April 2013 and the reporting month. Household type is reported as at the time of the initial cap and therefore, the household structure may have subsequently changed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Number of children</h3>

<p>This is calculated differently for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> and <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> statistics. <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> data are populated from the <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> and <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> capped household data are merged with data held on <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> child benefit systems.</p>

<p>From February 2020 (statistics for November 2019) a method to identify households who had no children and those with an unknown number of children has been developed for number of children in <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> capped households. This means that <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> number of children statistics published from February 2020 are not comparable with those published before February 2020.</p>

<h3>Benefit cap off-flows by outcome</h3>

<h4>Housing Benefit data</h4>

<p>From August 2018 (statistics for May 2018) the method for determining off-flow outcomes, and the outcome categories used, have changed. This means that off-flow outcome statistics published from August 2018 are not comparable with those published before August 2018.</p>

<p>In August 2018, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/benefit-cap-number-of-households-capped-to-may-2018">statistics for May 2018</a> were published using both the old and new methods, to allow users to understand the effect of the changes.</p>

<p>The way the total number of off-flows is determined is unchanged, so these statistics are comparable with those published before August 2018.</p>

<p>Households may flow on and off the cap numerous times as their circumstances change. The benefit cap official statistics contain data on the number of households no longer subject to the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> cap as at the reporting month. For example, in the August 2018 publication, the statistics show the total off-flows from the cap as at May 2018.</p>

<p>Before August 2018, the reason for off-flow from the benefit cap was given as at the reporting month, regardless of when a household moved off the cap. This meant that the outcome could change if a household remained off the cap.</p>

<p>From August 2018 onwards the outcome is reported as at the end of the quarter in which a household moved off the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> cap. This means the outcome is fixed at that point, unless a household is re-capped at a later date; if a household has multiple spells on and off the cap, the outcome after the latest spell will be reported.</p>

<p>For example, a household moved off the cap and at the end of that quarter had an open <abbr title="Working Tax Credit">WTC</abbr> claim. The household remained off the cap and by the next quarter had stopped claiming <abbr title="Working Tax Credit">WTC</abbr> and was instead claiming Personal Independence Payment (<abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>), which is an exempt benefit. Before August 2018 the off-flow outcome for this household would have been reported as “open <abbr title="Working Tax Credit">WTC</abbr> claim” until they moved to <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>, when the outcome would change to “in receipt of an exempt benefit”. From August 2018 the outcome would be reported as “open <abbr title="Working Tax Credit">WTC</abbr> claim”, and stay like that for as long as the household remained off the cap, as this is the outcome at the end of the quarter the household flowed off the cap.</p>

<p>The reason for this change was the migration of households on <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> as the roll-out of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> continued.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> If we kept reporting outcomes at the latest reporting month, eventually all households would fall into the “No longer claiming <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>” group as they move from <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>. The change ensures the outcome is a more timely representation of what happened to a household when they flowed off the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> cap.</p>

<p>We have also updated the outcome categories from August 2018:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the “Household is no longer claiming <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>” category has been broken down to show those who have moved off <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> and started claiming <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>. This is simply a measure of the number of households that had their <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> capped that moved to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>. From August 2019 we identify whether these households have their <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> capped at the end of the quarter during which they leave the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> cap. These households are considered off flows from the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> cap (as they are no longer a part of that caseload) but are not off flows from the cap. Due to this, total off flows from the benefit cap do not equal to the sum of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> cap and <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> cap off flows</li>
  <li>some of the lower order outcome categories (such as “Change in Household Structure” and “Change in Local Authority”) have been grouped together. These outcomes are not in themselves reasons for moving off the cap, but show a change of circumstance which may be indicative of why a household is no longer being capped. These outcomes have been grouped to allow outcomes to be reported as at the end of the quarter in which a household moved off the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> cap; it was not possible to retrospectively update these outcomes for households that moved off the cap before the latest quarter as the data is no longer available. It also creates a set of outcomes that, in time, can broadly be replicated for off-flows from the cap under <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The following table shows how the old outcomes map to the new outcomes.</p>

</table>

<p>There may be multiple reasons for the cap to no longer apply. To avoid multiple counts for a household, a hierarchical approach to outcome is used for reporting, as set out in the table above, with only the top-most reason for which a household is eligible being reported on.</p>

<p>The hierarchical ordering of outcomes was determined in discussions with policy colleagues. The <abbr title="Working Tax Credit">WTC</abbr> exemption was deemed to be the most important reason (indicating a movement into work), followed by other exemptions from the cap (such as a household starting to claim an exempt benefit, such as Disability Living Allowance).</p>

<h4>Universal Credit data</h4>

<p>As with the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> cap, households may flow on and off the cap under <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> numerous times as their circumstances change. The <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> cap statistics report on the number of households no longer subject to the cap as at the reporting month. For example, in the August 2018 publication, the statistics show the total off-flows from the cap as at May 2018.</p>

<p>The outcome for a household flowing off the cap under <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> is reported as at the next assessment period following the one in which a household was last capped. This means the outcome is fixed at that point, unless a household is re-capped at a later date; if a household has multiple spells on and off the cap, the outcome after the latest spell will be reported.</p>

<p>From August 2018 the only outcome reported on for households moving off the cap under <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> is if they become exempt because of their earnings. This means that their earnings in the assessment period following the assessment period in which they were last capped exceed an earnings threshold. The earnings thresholds are given in the table below. The threshold applies for assessment periods that begin on or after 1 April for the given financial year.</p>

<p>We are working on developing further off-flow outcome categories for future publications, as quality assurance of data from the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> systems is progressed. We plan to broadly replicate the outcome categories used for off-flows from the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> cap.</p>

<h2>Data confidentiality</h2>

<p>The Code of Practice for Statistics states that “appropriate disclosure control methods should be applied before releasing statistics and data”.</p>

<p>Most of the figures in the benefit cap statistical release are derived from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/" rel="external">Stat-Xplore</a> and are subject to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/metadata/Data%20Confidentiality.html?dbid=Benefit_Cap_Cumulative" rel="external">Introduced Random Error</a> to ensure that no data is released which could risk the identification of individuals. The relative effect of using a statistical disclosure control on small value cells will be greater than high value cells, therefore calculating percentages based on very small value cells should be treated with caution. There may be occasions where disclosure control creates illogical values; for example, in rows containing small values, sub-category totals may be larger than the category total. In this case any percentages would be capped at 100% of the total.</p>

<p>Where figures are not derived from Stat-Xplore figures less than 10 have been supressed and figures greater than 10 are rounded to the nearest 10.</p>

<p>From November 2016, all figures contained within the statistical release are subject to rounding unless otherwise stated. The level of rounding applied, which is dependent on the magnitude of the figure being quoted, is shown in the table below.</p>

<p>Users should note that percentages shown within the statistical release are calculated using figures prior to rounding.</p>

<h2>Revisions</h2>

<p>The Department’s policy statement describes <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/policy-statement-on-the-revision-of-dwp-statistics">how <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will handle revisions</a>.</p>

<p>The statistics on households capped under <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> may be revised because awards may be subject to retrospective revision. For example, the amount of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> due to be paid for a past assessment period may go up where it’s identified that a household should have been entitled to a <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> element (such as housing costs), that wasn’t included in an earlier calculation of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>. This in turn could see their award being capped. In other circumstances there can be changes which means a household has the cap removed for a past assessment period.</p>

<p>The level of revision between previously published figures and the revised series varies across time periods, by geographical area and by other available breakdowns. However, more recent periods tend to be subject to a greater degree of revision than more distant ones.</p>

<h2>Status of the statistics</h2>

<h3>Official statistics</h3>

<p>In developing these Benefit Cap Statistics, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has acted in accordance with the Code of Practice for Official Statistics and supporting Principles.</p>

<h3>Experimental statistics</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> elements of these statistics are badged as “Experimental” because they are not yet fully developed. As such, all total figures which combine <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> and <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> data are also badged as “Experimental”. As <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> rolls out across the country, and as <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> computer systems are introduced and become more established, this will enable the statistics to have better coverage and a more stable methodology.</p>

      <p>A household could move, or migrate, from Housing Benefit to Universal Credit in 2 ways: 1) if a household had a change in circumstance and Universal Credit had rolled out in their area then they may have needed to claim Universal Credit rather than continuing to claim Housing Benefit and 2) now that Universal Credit is fully rolled out working age households that are claiming Housing Benefit will gradually be moved onto Universal Credit.&nbsp;<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
