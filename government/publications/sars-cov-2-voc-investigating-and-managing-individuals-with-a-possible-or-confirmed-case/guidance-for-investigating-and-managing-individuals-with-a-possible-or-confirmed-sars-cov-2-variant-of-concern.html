<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In response to the emergence and spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (<abbr title="variant of concern">VOC</abbr>) and variants under investigation (<abbr title="variants under investigation">VUI</abbr>)  in different countries and regions, specific precautions and actions are required in relation to the management of patients who have recently returned from areas where these <abbr title="variant of concern">VOC</abbr> or <abbr title="variants under investigation">VUI</abbr> are known or are believed to be circulating, as well as their contacts. Specific precautions are also required for the management of patients with a <abbr title="variant of concern">VOC</abbr> or <abbr title="variants under investigation">VUI</abbr> identified by genomic sequencing even where there is no travel history.</p>

<p>This guidance is for healthcare staff in primary and secondary care and provides advice on the investigation and management of patients who may be infected with a new SARS-CoV-2 <abbr title="variant of concern">VOC</abbr> or <abbr title="variants under investigation">VUI</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Identifying those requiring specific measures to manage SARS-CoV-2 variant risk</h2>

<p>This guidance applies to ‘persons at risk’ of infection from SARS-CoV-2 <abbr title="variant of concern">VOC</abbr> or <abbr title="variants under investigation">VUI</abbr>.</p>

<p>Persons at risk include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>those who have been in or transited through any of the countries listed within the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transport-measures-to-protect-the-uk-from-variant-strains-of-covid-19" class="govuk-link">travel ban to the UK</a> and who develop symptoms of COVID-19 within 10 days of departure or transit (or date of sampling for a positive SARS-CoV-2 test if asymptomatic)</li>
  <li>those known to be infected with a <abbr title="variant of concern">VOC</abbr> or <abbr title="variants under investigation">VUI</abbr> listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#table1">Table 1</a>, based on sequencing results and regardless of travel history</li>
  <li>contacts of individuals described above</li>
</ul>

<p>Travel-associated risk alone is sufficient to take action; actions should not be delayed pending sequencing results.</p>

<h2>Entry and isolation guidance</h2>

<p>Travel measures to protect the UK against new international variants may change over time. The latest information of travel measures is available from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport" class="govuk-link">Department for Transport</a>.</p>

<p>Travellers who are permitted to enter the UK from countries listed within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transport-measures-to-protect-the-uk-from-variant-strains-of-covid-19">travel ban</a> to the UK are currently required to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival along with their household. Any contacts identified in the UK should also self-isolate for 10 days from the last date of contact after the traveller returns to the UK.</p>

<p>From 15 February 2021, travellers to the UK will be <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tested for SARS-CoV-2 at Day 2 and Day 8.</p>

<h2>General principles relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the context of risk from a new <abbr title="variant of concern">VOC</abbr> or <abbr title="variants under investigation">VUI</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Current evidence is that the mechanism of transmission of novel variants is no different to those for SARS-CoV-2 generally. The following principles apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>anyone seeking routine or emergency care (whether or not they present with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-initial-investigation-of-possible-cases" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 symptoms</a>) should be asked about recent travel to the countries listed in the travel ban and whether they are a contact of a returning traveller from these countries</li>
  <li>all persons at risk in the community should be advised to follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">stay at home guidance</a> if they develop COVID-19 symptoms</li>
  <li>healthcare workers should continue to follow current <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>)</a> advice and use the recommended personal protective protection (PPE) for individuals on the high risk pathway</li>
  <li>commonly used <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> assays are expected to be able to detect both <abbr title="variant of concern">VOC</abbr> and <abbr title="variants under investigation">VUI</abbr>, and should continue to be used for testing patients with possible COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<h2>Persons at risk seeking routine or elective care</h2>

<p>Any person at risk seeking access to non-urgent outpatient, ambulatory or primary care, or elective treatment, should defer their appointment until their 10-day isolation period has ended unless their need is considered urgent (see below).</p>

<h2>Persons at risk seeking emergency care</h2>

<p>Any person at risk who requires urgent care should continue to access emergency NHS services whether for COVD-19 symptoms or for other, non-COVID reasons.</p>

<p>Regardless of the reason for their presentation, any person at risk requiring emergency admission or care should immediately be isolated in a single room with en-suite bathroom facilities and tested for COVID-19 using a standard <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. They should remain in a single room under strict isolation for the duration of their stay. If these facilities are not available, they should seek <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> advice.</p>

<p>Information on dates and places of travel, and any contact with possible or confirmed cases of COVID-19 should be recorded. Healthcare staff should ensure systems are in place that enable these cases to be easily flagged and identified.</p>

<h2>Persons at risk admitted to hospital with a negative test on admission</h2>

<p>Persons at risk should be managed in isolation in a single room with en-suite bathroom facilities, and with appropriate infection control procedures, for the duration of their isolation period.</p>

<p>These patients should have a SARS-CoV-2 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test on admission. If negative, subsequent testing should be according to NHS testing regimes while in hospital. If the patient develops new symptoms compatible with COVID-19, they should be tested again immediately.</p>

<h2>Management of persons at risk admitted to hospital with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test on admission or who subsequently test positive</h2>

<p>If a person at risk has a positive test for SARS-CoV-2, discuss further risk assessment and appropriate case-management with the <a href="#list" class="govuk-link">local/regional specialist infectious diseases centre</a>.</p>

<p>Hospitals must also contact their <a href="https://www.gov.uk/health-protection-team" class="govuk-link">local health protection team</a> with the details of these individuals.</p>

<h2>Guidance on sample handling for laboratory staff</h2>

<p>Samples from persons at risk, and where the SARS-CoV-2 infection status is unknown, should be handled at containment level 2 plus<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link">[footnote 1]</a></sup> (or higher) but with no attempt at virus culture.</p>

<p>All samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 <abbr title="Ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr> from persons at risk should be sent to the Respiratory Virus Unit, PHE Colindale for whole genome sequencing.</p>

<p>For positive samples, further laboratory handling of any untreated sample should be at containment level 3, again with no attempt at virus culture. Samples that have undergone a validated inactivation process may be handled at containment level 2 (or above). Viral culture should be performed in the Colindale Reference laboratories along with fast tracking of samples for further analysis.</p>
