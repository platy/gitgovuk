<p>Any person can make a representation about a coastal access report.</p>

<p>Representations must be made on the correct form (there is a different form for objections, which only landowners and occupiers may make). The form is available alongside <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/england-coast-path-at-mersea-island-comment-on-changes-to-the-proposed-route">our proposals</a> or you can contact us at the address shown later in these notes.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Use the same form for all representations about the same land parcel (or several adjoining ones).</p>

<p>Complete a different form for each land parcel if you wish to make representations about separate land parcels.</p>
</div>

<h2>Notes on each question</h2>

<p>These notes will help you answer the questions on the form.</p>

<h3>Question 1</h3>

<p>This asks for the number of the report and map which relates to the land about which you are making the representation. For example: ‘Report MR1, Map MR1b’.</p>

<h3>Question 2</h3>

<p>Clearly identify the land to which the representation relates here.</p>

<p>If your representation is about the proposed route, write the numbers of the relevant route sections here. Route section numbers are shown on the maps in the reports. For example: ‘Route section MSI-MR1-S001’.</p>

<p>If your representation is not about the proposed route, write a description of the land and the numbers of the route sections that are closest to it. For example: ‘field seaward of route sections MSI-MR1-S002 to MSI-MR1-S004’.</p>

<p>You may also wish to send a separate map showing the land – see question 6.</p>

<p>Multiple areas/sections: should your representation relate to several specific route sections, list each in this section, and number them 1, 2, 3 and so on, for easy reference later in the form.</p>

<h3>Question 3</h3>

<p>This asks who is making the representation.</p>

<p>There are various tick boxes in this section to be completed as relevant, including 1 for ‘A person specified in Schedule 1 to the Coastal Access Reports (Consideration and Modification Procedure) (England) Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/1976)’. You should tick this box only if you are a person with sporting rights over the land in question, or if you represent one of the national organisations listed in the first section of the Appendix to this guidance.</p>

<p>Multiple areas/sections: should the answer to this question vary in relation to different land areas you have listed in section 2, use the same numbering system to help you explain the position here.</p>

<h3>Question 4</h3>

<p>This asks if you are a person with a ‘relevant interest’ in land to which the report relates.</p>

<p>Tick the box only if you are the owner, tenant or occupier of such land. (Note that this does not include those with different legal interests such as holders of rights of common, private access rights or easements over another person’s land.)</p>

<p>Multiple areas/sections: should the answer to this question vary in relation to different land areas you have listed in section 2, use the same numbering system to help you explain the position here.</p>

<h3>Question 5</h3>

<p>This asks you to give details of, and reasons for, the representations you are making about our proposals.</p>

<p>Multiple areas/sections: reference your comments to any specific areas of land you have listed in section 2, using the same numbering system you have used there.</p>

<h3>Question 6</h3>

<p>If there is not enough room on the form for all the information you wish to include, you can send additional information with the form.</p>

<p>Write on this part of the form a description of each additional document you are sending. For example: ‘Document 1- additional information in answer to question 5; Document 2 – map of land to which the representation relates’.</p>

<p>You should also label any separate documents or attachments in a way that enables us to match it to your representation form. For example: ‘Representation – Mrs J. Smith – MSI-MR1-S002 - Document 2: map of land to which representation relates’.</p>

<h3>Question 7</h3>

<p>This asks you to tell us whether you have made any other representations about this report.</p>

<p>This will not normally be the case, in which case just leave this blank.</p>

<h3>Question 8</h3>

<p>This asks you to tell us whether (if you are the owner or occupier of some land to which these reports relate) you have also made any objections about the same report in relation to that land.</p>

<p>This will help ensure that the 2 things can be considered together as appropriate.</p>

<h3>Question 9</h3>

<p>This asks for your contact details.</p>

<p>Without these details we are unable to process your representation. See our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/natural-england-privacy-notices/england-coast-path-objections-and-representations-privacy-notice">privacy notice</a>.</p>

<p>Send any representations (and any additional supporting information) by email or post to the relevant address shown on the form.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Your form must reach us by midnight, Wednesday 20 July 2022.</p>
</div>

<p>This date allows 8 weeks from when our report for this stretch of coast is first advertised on the relevant website. Note that any representation received after this date will not be considered.</p>

<p>We will send you an acknowledgement when we receive your representation. If you do not receive an acknowledgement, or if you have any further queries about the representations process, please contact us at:</p>

<h2>What happens once representations are submitted</h2>

<p>Once the closing date for receipt of representations has passed, Natural England will send in full to the Secretary of State representations made by or on behalf of the bodies and persons listed in either of the first 2 sections of the Appendix to this guidance.</p>

<p>Representations from all other persons will be summarised by Natural England, as required by the legislation, in a report sent to the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>In either case, any comments from Natural England on the representation or summarised representation will also be included.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State must consider all such representations and summaries, and any comments from Natural England on them, before reaching a decision on the proposals set out in the relevant reports.</p>

<p>A representation may be withdrawn at any time by giving notice in writing to Natural England.</p>
