<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Overview</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Objectives</h3>
<p>The overseas superannuation pension schemes cover the payments of pensions and grants under various unfunded defined benefit schemes relating to service overseas by former colonial public servants.  Payments to entitled pensioners and their dependants are fully financed by the Exchequer.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Spending controls</h3>

<p>The overseas superannuation pension schemes’ budgets are not subject to pre-set Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL) control totals; they sit within a category of spending known as Resource Annually Managed Expenditure (AME), which can be revised and reforecast regularly.  This is because net expenditure and cash payments are largely outside the control of the schemes’ administrators on a day to day basis, instead being affected by factors such as membership numbers; mortality rates; the age profile of members, and annual pension increases.</p>

<p>The Resource AME sought in this Estimate is primarily the interest cost arising during the year.  The interest rate is charged on the opening discounted provision for future pension payments adjusted for pension payments made in year.</p>

<p>In addition, the Net Cash Requirement represents the estimated net cash required for the year to cover payments of pensions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> Comparison of net spending totals sought</h3>

<p>The table below shows how the totals sought for the pension schemes compare with last year:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>Net Spending total: amounts sought this year (Supplementary Estimate 2021 to 22)</td>
      <td>Difference (+/-) £million compared to original budget this year (Main Estimate 2021 to 2022)</td>
      <td>Difference (+/-) % compared to original budget this year</td>
      <td>Difference (+/-) £million compared to original budget this year (Outturn 2021 to 2022)</td>
      <td>Difference (+/-) % compared to original budget this year (Outturn 2020-21)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Resource AME</td>
      <td>9.5</td>
      <td>+1.5</td>
      <td>18.8</td>
      <td>+1.7</td>
      <td>-15.2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Net Cash Requirement</td>
      <td>49.5</td>
      <td>0.0</td>
      <td>0.0</td>
      <td>-0.6</td>
      <td>-1.2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The increase in Resource AME requested is based on an anticipated increase in expected credit losses required to be recognised under accounting standard IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ in relation to overpayment receivables.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span> Key drivers of spending changes since last year</h3>

<p>The provision sought under Resource AME is lower than last year. This is largely due to the Treasury-set interest rate on scheme liabilities decreasing from 1.80% to 1.25%, partially offset by an anticipated increase in expected credit losses on overpayment receivables.</p>

<p>The reduction in the Net Cash Requirement reflects an anticipated reduction in the number of pension payments under existing schemes, partially offset by pension increases.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span> Spending trends</h3>

<p>The chart below shows Resource AME spending trends for the last five years and plans presented in Estimates for 2021-22.  As AME is re-forecast on an annual basis, there are no future plans beyond the current Estimate.</p>

      <th scope="col">£ million</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>2016 to 2017 outturn</td>
      <td>28.4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2017 to 2018 outturn</td>
      <td>23.6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2018 to 2019 outturn</td>
      <td>54.1</td>

      <td>18.8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2020 to 2021 outturn</td>
      <td>11.2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2021 to 2022 plans</td>
      <td>9.5</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The underlying trend is downwards, as the number of pensioners reduces over time. The spike in 2018-19 Resource AME was primarily due to the initial recognition of a £35.2m liability associated with the pensions for beneficiaries and former beneficiaries of the Gibraltar Social Insurance Fund.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span> Administration costs and efficiency plans</h3>

<p>The costs of the administration of the schemes are borne by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and are forecast to amount to £0.8m in 2021-22 (2020-21: £0.8m).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Changes to contingent liabilities</h3>
<p>The contingent liability primarily relating to the Hong Kong (Overseas Public Servants) Act 1996, Sterling Safeguard Scheme for value of public service pensions, was £73.0m at 31 March 2021.  No new contingent liabilities are expected in 2021-22.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Estimated scheme liabilities</h3>

<p>The latest full valuation of scheme liabilities was performed with a calculation date of 31 March 2018, using membership data as at 31 December 2017 (30 November 2017 for the Gibraltar Social Insurance Fund, which subsequently transferred to overseas superannuation on 1 April 2018).  The total valuation, including the Gibraltar Social Insurance Fund, was £771.7m.  At that time there were a total of 11,647 pensioners. The average age, excluding Hong Kong members, was 88 years and 79 years for Hong Kong members.</p>

<p>The next full valuation will take place with a calculation date of 31 March 2022, using membership data as at December 2021.</p>

<p>The latest interim valuation assessment of scheme liabilities was performed as at 31 March 2021. The valuation was £604.2m.</p>
