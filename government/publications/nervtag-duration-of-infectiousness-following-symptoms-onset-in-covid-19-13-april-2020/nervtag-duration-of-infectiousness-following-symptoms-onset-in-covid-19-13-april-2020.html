<p>This issue was considered in the context of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> cases who were clinically well enough to be managed at home.</p>

<p>The committee highlighted the importance of distinguishing the detection of viral <abbr title="Ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr> by <abbr title="Polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>, which may not represent infectious virus, and the detection infectious virus, which requires virus isolation techniques. It was also noted that there was not a lot of definitive data in relation to infectious virus versus <abbr title="Polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> positives.</p>

<p>The committee highlighted the general lack of data on infectious load, transmissibility risk and onset of acquired immunity.</p>

<p>Available scientific literature on the detection of <abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> <abbr title="Ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr>, reviewed at this meeting suggested that on average up <abbr title="Polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> results falls below the limit of detection of available <abbr title="Polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests at about 10 to 14 days after the date of onset of symptoms. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1">[footnote 1]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> In the largest study, of 292 confirmed cases, the median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative <abbr title="Reverse transcription Polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> results for oropharyngeal swabs of convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0 to 11.0) days.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote" class="govuk-link">[footnote 3]</a></sup> However, some patients can remain <abbr title="Polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> positive for a month or longer days.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4">[footnote 4]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:5" class="govuk-link">[footnote 5]</a></sup> This is also true for prolonged detection of viral <abbr title="Ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr> in faeces. A <abbr title="Polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> positive sample does not necessarily mean the person is infectious.</p>

<p>Three pieces of data were discussed in some detail:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Unpublished <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> data reported the mean time of the first 16 patients that <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> had reviewed for virus shedding as detected by <abbr title="Polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> was 11.6 days. However, culturable virus was not detectable after day 7. It was also reported that an analysis of sera from patients does show the detection of antibody from around day 10.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Woelfel et al. provided detailed virologic data on nine hospitalised but mildly unwell patients. Although the last <abbr title="Polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> positive swabs was at day 28 after onset, “no isolates were obtained from samples taken after day 8 in spite of ongoing high viral loads”.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:5">[footnote 5]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A modelling study by He et al. used data from 414 throat swabs collected from 94 patients moderately ill patients and data on the serial interval in 77 transmission pairs to estimate the infectiousness profile of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>. The authors concluded that “Infectiousness was estimated to decline relatively quickly within 7 days of illness onset.“<sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:6" class="govuk-link">[footnote 6]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Based on the available, but very limited, information it is <abbr title="New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group">NERVTAG</abbr>’s opinion that for mildly unwell individuals managed in the community, a period of 7 days of self-isolation after illness onset is reasonable. This may need to be revisited as additional evidence on the duration of infectiousness arises.</p>

<p>A longer period of isolation (14 days) may be warranted for certain groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>people who care for vulnerable individuals at home or in institutions where infection prevention and control measures are not in place</li>
  <li>immunocompromised individuals and those on steroids (including those with lung disease) who may have a more prolonged period of viral replication and infectiousness</li>
  <li>moderately or severely ill, hospitalised patients, who are likely to have higher viral loads and more prolonged viral replication, and therefore a more prolonged period of infectiousness</li>
</ul>

<p>Particular caution should be exercised in <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> patients discharged from hospital to nursing homes, homeless shelters, or other institutions where there are vulnerable individuals.</p>
