<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Rules</h2>

<p>The rules governing customs procedure applying to the introduction of goods to the UK from places outside the UK and EU from their arrival until they’re entered to free circulation or another customs procedure are prescribed in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UCC Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013 (Articles 12 to 14)</li>
  <li>Commission Regulations 2015/2446 and 2015/2447</li>
  <li>Statutory Instrument 1991</li>
  <li>No. 2724 (The Customs Controls on Importation of Goods Regulations 1991) as amended by Statutory Instrument 1992</li>
  <li>No. 3095 (The Customs and Excise (Single Market etc) Regulations 1992) prescribe forms, procedures and the penalties for breaches of the rules</li>
</ul>

<p>When an importing ship or aircraft arrives at the place where goods are to be unloaded, the goods must be ‘presented’ to customs by the person who brought them into the UK or EU or by the person who assumes responsibility for their onward carriage (this includes freight haulage companies, shipping and aircraft lines).</p>

<p>Goods may be presented by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>using an approved computerised trade inventory system linked to customs</li>
  <li>lodging <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-presentation-of-third-country-goods-c1600a">form C1600A</a> at the designated customs office</li>
</ul>

<p>Goods which have been moved under a transit procedure should be presented to customs under the rules applicable to that procedure.</p>

<p>All goods must be electronically presented immediately upon arrival at the designated customs office approved by customs authorities. If the customs office is closed, presentation must be made within an hour of it re-opening.</p>

<p>Goods can only be ‘presented’ to customs when they’ve actually arrived at the place of unloading.</p>

<p>After presentation the goods must be covered by a declaration to a customs procedure or a temporary storage declaration containing the information needed to identify the goods. The declaration should normally be made at the same customs office as presentation.</p>

<p>The declaration must be made by any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the person who conveyed the goods into the UK or EU</li>
  <li>the person who assumes responsibility for their onward carriage</li>
  <li>the shipping, airline or haulage company</li>
  <li>the representative of any of the above</li>
</ul>

<p>Use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-single-administrative-document-full-8-part-set-c88-1-8">form C88</a> for declarations in the UK. Customs may accept commercial documents or computer records if they contain the necessary details. Acceptable commercial documents include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bills of lading</li>
  <li>air way-bills</li>
  <li>container manifests</li>
  <li>load lists</li>
  <li>manifests</li>
  <li>consignment records (on computerised inventory systems)</li>
</ul>

<p>Where goods have travelled under a transit procedure, the copy of the transit document retained by the office of destination will be the declaration.</p>

<p>A declaration must be made 24 hours after presentation. If the goods are entered or re-exported from the UK or EU, or destroyed before declaration has been made the declaration might be waived. Contact the customs office at the place of unloading for advice about these waivers.</p>

<p>Following declaration the goods may be put to a prescribed procedure (for example, entry to free circulation, a transit procedure or warehousing regime). Goods which are placed under the EU transit procedure must be presented at the office of destination together with the Transit Accompanying Document (<abbr title="Transit Accompanying Document">TAD</abbr>) (or copies 4 and 5 of the Single Administrative Document (<abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>) under the fallback procedure) to end the transit movement before they can be placed under another prescribed customs procedure.</p>

<p>An import declaration is only required for the following categories of goods on arrival in the UK:</p>

<ul>
  <li>goods from a non- UK and non-EU country direct</li>
  <li>goods from a non-UK and non-EU country via an EU country which have not already been cleared into free circulation</li>
  <li>
    <p>goods from the Channel Islands and the following special territories of the EU:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>French Overseas Departments of Martinique</li>
      <li>Guadeloupe</li>
      <li>Reunion and French Guiana</li>
      <li>Canary Islands</li>
      <li>Mount Athos</li>
      <li>Vatican City</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When goods are imported into the UK it’s the responsibility of the importer or their authorised agent to declare them to customs. In most cases a <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> is used for this purpose.</p>

<p>You can read about the exceptions for the <a class="govuk-link" href="#import-control-system-ics">Import Control System</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#other-import-procedures">other import procedures</a>.</p>

<p>When the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> is used as an import declaration a plain paper print of the information may need to be declared after the input of data by the importer or agent to the customs entry processing computer (<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>). The <a class="govuk-link" href="#plainpaperdec">plain paper print</a> must conform, in terms of the location of the information, to the standard document laid down by EU legislation. Alternatively pre-printed forms may be used, this includes forms that have been partially completed in an EU member state, any missing information must be added to the forms before they are signed and submitted to customs at the place of import clearance.</p>

<p>The input of data by traders to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> is known as Direct Trader Input (<abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr>). The use of these facilities where they exist, though of substantial benefit to traders and customs alike, is not compulsory. Goods imported for clearance at these locations may be declared to customs on pre-printed <abbr title="Single Administrative DocumentS">SADs</abbr> instead, without using <abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr>. These declarations will then normally be input to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> by customs staff before the goods are cleared for importation. This method is known as customs input of entries (<abbr title="customs input of entries">CIE</abbr>).</p>

<p>Where declarations are lodged at a customs computerised locations, such as the National Clearance Hub (<abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr>) they should be given on a single copy of plain paper or pre-printed stationery (printed pads of copy 6 are available from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/vat-enquiries">VAT: general enquiries helpline</a>). Copy 6 of a set originating in an EU member state, properly completed and signed in the UK may also be used.</p>

<p>Where goods are declared by the use of manual declarations the dual purpose 4-part set provided in the UK should be used with the reference to export copy numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 deleted. It’s necessary for carbon paper to be inserted between the last 2 copies if the declarant requires a copy for their own use. Copies 6, 7 and 8 of a set originating in an EU member state, properly completed and signed in the UK may also be used, but carbon paper has to be inserted between all copies prior to completion.</p>

<p>Manual declarations consist of copies 6, 7 and 8. On declarations at <abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr> and <abbr title="customs input of entries">CIE</abbr> locations a copy 6 is required.</p>

<p>In signing an import declaration the signatory accepts full legal responsibility for all the information it contains, including that which was provided in the export country, or utilizing the specified requirement in a ‘paperless entries’ environment, the signatory accepts full legal responsibility for all the information. The accuracy of the information already on the form must be checked. Any inaccuracies must be corrected and these corrections must be drawn to customs’ attention when the declaration is presented. If necessary a fresh import declaration should be completed.</p>

<p>Information declared on a <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> completed in the export country must not be erased.</p>

<p>Additional copies of the declaration may be required when the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-customs-procedure-codes">goods are subject to certain procedures</a>. These additional copies will be either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>extra plain paper prints</li>
  <li>extra copy 6s from UK produced pads</li>
  <li>photocopies of copy 6</li>
</ul>

<p>This part provides detailed information about how to use the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> as an import declaration, additional documents which may have to be provided, the range of special import facilities available and special requirements relating to certain goods or the circumstances under which they are being imported.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Standard import procedures (including customs warehouse removals - general requirements)</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Completion of import declarations</h3>

<p>This part explains in detail the information to be declared under each box heading on an import declaration. Customs staff at the place of entry presentation should be consulted if there is any doubt about the way in which particular boxes are to be completed.</p>

<p>The importance of declaring correct information cannot be over-stressed. Errors can lead to delayed clearance, the imposition of penalties and the seizure of goods which is costly to importers and agents alike. Additionally, there are heavy penalties for making false declarations.</p>

<p>Not all of the information which must be included on a paper declaration made at a <abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr> location has to be input to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>. Indications are provided under each box heading, of <abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr> input requirements and the circumstances in which the information should (or should not) be declared.</p>

<p>Each box description in this section is preceded by 4 statements which specify the circumstances in which the information must be provided. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr> input – an indication of whether the information must be input to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> by traders using <abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr>
</li>
  <li>declaration methods – an indication of whether the information must appear on paper declarations presented when <abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr> or <abbr title="customs input of entries">CIE</abbr> are used, or when declarations are presented at manual locations</li>
  <li>entry types – an indication of whether this box appears on a <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>, C21 – Customs Clearance Request, <abbr title="Warehouse Removal Declaration">WRD</abbr> – Warehouse Removal Declaration, or one of the following <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> declarations:
    <ul>
      <li>
<abbr title="Simplified Frontier Declaration">SFD</abbr> – Simplified Frontier Declaration</li>
      <li>
<abbr title="Final Supplementary Declaration">FSD</abbr> – Final Supplementary Declaration</li>
      <li>
<abbr title="Supplementary Declaration for Imports">SDI</abbr> – Supplementary Declaration for Imports</li>
      <li>
<abbr title="Supplementary Declaration for customs warehouse removals">SDW</abbr> – Supplementary Declaration for customs warehouse removals</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>exceptions – an explanation of the circumstances when certain information should not be declared</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to understand that when information is required to appear on a declaration, it must also appear on <abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr> plain paper declarations, even when that information is not input to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>In several cases the following instructions indicate that boxes are to be left blank. Some of these boxes may have been completed on <abbr title="Single Administrative DocumentS">SADs</abbr> arriving from EU member states. Where that is so and the forms are being used as import declarations in this country the information must be allowed to stand – it must not be deleted or erased.
<br><br>
For <abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr> entries <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> converts lower case letters into upper case and displays data accordingly.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Trader identification</h3>

<p>The identity of a trader is a combination of the country code of the issuing country and the Identity reference allocated by that country. For UK traders enter ‘GB’ followed by the trader’s Economic Operator Registration and Identification (<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>) number.</p>

<p>In the UK, identities are <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> numbers which are (with a few minor exceptions) 12 characters long and are usually a 9 digit VAT number followed by a 3 digit suffix (typically 000). Traders who are <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number members of a VAT group registration will have already been issued with a 3 digit suffix as part of their registration for VAT. Where exports are made by VAT group members they should use this same 3 digit suffix as the <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number suffix on export declarations.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>Some government departments and agencies have been issued with special registration numbers.
<br><br>
If a UK trader is not registered for VAT they can <a class="govuk-link" href="#EORI">apply for an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number</a>. Private individuals can use GBPR where there’s no commercial purpose involved (for example, household effects). <br> <br>
Non UK traders who have an identity issued by an EU country can enter those details. If a trader has a UK allocated <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number then this must be declared, even if the trader also has non-UK identities.
<br><br>
Show identities on paper declarations after ‘No’. 
<br><br>
Non-UK and non-EU traders declaring goods for relief under temporary admission (such as the customs procedure code (<abbr title="customs procedure code">CPC</abbr>) in Box 37 is in the 53 series (excluding <abbr title="customs procedure code">CPC</abbr> 53 00 002) or where a non-UK and non-EU issued ATA carnet is used), don’t need to apply for an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number.</p>

<p>A consignor is the party which, by contract with a carrier, consigns or sends goods with the carrier, or has them conveyed by the carrier.
<br><br>
An exporter is the person on whose behalf the export declaration is made and who is the owner of the goods or has a similar right of disposal over them at the time when the declaration is accepted.
<br><br>
For paper and C21 declarations only one consignor/exporter is to be declared. For all other declarations, if there is only one consignor/exporter then the consignor/exporter details are to be supplied at header level. If there is more than one consignor/exporter then consignor/exporter details are to be supplied at item level (one consignor/exporter per item).

<h4>Notes</h4>

<p>For paper and C21 declarations only one consignee is to be declared. For all other declarations, if there is only one consignee then the consignee’s details are to be supplied at header level, but if there is more than one consignee then consignee details are to be supplied at item level (one consignee per item).
<br><br>
‘Consignee’ includes any owner of the goods or any other person possessing, or beneficially interested in them at any time between their importation and their clearance by customs or the person to whom goods have to be delivered.
<br><br>
When goods are being entered for a private customs warehouse, the name, address and Identity of the approved Warehouse trader is required unless shown in Box 14 as the declarant.
<br><br>
Names and addresses of persons declared as consignees on declarations of imported goods are liable to be disseminated and published as part of overseas trade data. Therefore it is important that consignee details are accurate.
<br><br>
For bulk declarations when the consignee is declared at item level, deferred payment cannot be to the consignees account (such as only <abbr title="Deferment approval number">DAN</abbr> prefix A is permitted unless the consignee is declared at header level) and payment can’t be secured by consignee (such as. method of payments U, V and X are not allowed if consignee is declared at item level).
<br><br>
An import VAT certificate C79 will only be issued when the consignee <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number is declared at the header level. In the absence of an import VAT certificate, a copy of the declaration will need to be kept as evidence of the importation.</p>

<h4>Direct representation</h4>

<p>Where an agent is acting as a ‘direct’ representative, in the name and on behalf of another person – the ‘declarant’, the agent must hold (and be able to produce on customs request), written authority of their powers to act as the declarant’s representative. Failure to produce written authority will result in liability resting with the agent.</p>

<p>Where an agent delegates the making of a declaration to a sub-agent and the sub-agent makes the declaration in a ‘direct’ capacity, in the name and on behalf of the first agent, the sub-agent must hold (and be able to produce on request to customs) written authority of their power to act. Failure to produce written authority will result in liability resting with the sub-agent.</p>

<h4>Indirect representation</h4>

<p>Where the declarant is acting as an ‘indirect’ representative in their own name, but on behalf of another person, both parties accept joint liability for all information provided.</p>

<p>Where an agent delegates the making of a declaration to a sub-agent in an indirect capacity on behalf of the first agent, then the sub-agent becomes the customs debtor. The original agent ceases to be a customs debtor because they neither make the declaration nor have responsibility for performing the acts and formalities laid down by customs rules.</p>

<p>This field must be completed except on <abbr title="final supplementary declarations">FSDs</abbr>.</p>

<p>The goods described in this box must all be subject to the same Binding Tariff Information Reference Number if held for the goods commodity code.</p>

<p>Enter a description of the goods that will identify them. If the goods described here don’t comprise the whole contents of a package, container or trailer this should be made clear by adding the words ‘part case’, ‘part container’, ‘part trailer’.</p>

<p>The description of the goods must be the normal trade description and detailed enough for immediate, precise identification and classification. This doesn’t mean copying out the full description as set out in the tariff. For example ‘magnesium potassium sulphate’ (heading 31.04 commodity code 310490000) should be described in those terms and not as ‘other mineral or chemical fertilisers, potassic’.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> purposes, enter a description of the goods which is enough to allow the identification and examination of goods.</p>

<p>Where the commodity code to be used depends on size, weight or other physical criteria, the description should include that information.</p>

<p>Chemicals classified in chapters 28 and 29 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff/sections">UK Trade Tariff</a> should be described using their precise chemical name and the appropriate 5 digit reference number.</p>

<p>Certain imports requiring an additional code (such as goods subject to variable charges), certain anti-dumping duties, wine reference prices.</p>

<p>For excise goods, a full description of the goods including the volume, brand name, container sizes and strength etc. must always be provided, for example 1000 c/s Old St Andrews golf ball whisky miniatures 12×5cl at 40%, rot 232/02.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Package counts and package marks are conditional, depending on whether ‘bulk’ or ‘unpacked’ is used.</p>

<p>Identify the packaging that holds the packaging that immediately surrounds the goods, such as ‘the number of individual items packaged in such a way that they cannot be divided without first undoing the packing, or number of pieces, if unpackaged’.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<p>For beer the packaging might be the crate or carton and not the bottle in which the beer is contained or if the goods are contained immediately within cartons contained on a pallet (for examples, books), the pallet instead should be declared.
<br><br>
For a single consignment in one or a number of containers, the containers themselves can be deemed to be the outer packaging. There is only a need to supply the marks and numbers, quantity and container numbers. In effect, in this example, the container number(s) will be the marks and need only be entered as container details but with reference to this entered in the marks, for example ‘Package kind <abbr title="Combined Nomenclature">CN</abbr> – see container id details entered’.</p>

<p>Where the goods are subject to different duty or VAT rates (for example mixtures of red and white wine or children and adults clothing) the lowest divisible level of packaging must be declared in order to aid identification. Thus, bottles, wrapping or other packaging will be more appropriate in these examples.</p>

<p>For each kind of package, enter:</p>

<p>a) Any marks and numbers on the packages. Taking into account the packaging examples given above, where there is one common identifying number for all of the packaging then only this number need be entered.</p>

<p>If there isn’t enough space to record all the information, create another set of package details with the same kind of packages code. On paper declarations put PM=’ in front of the marks and numbers – for example ‘PM=ABC123’.</p>

<p>b) The quantity of packages, or for unpackaged goods) the number of pieces. On Paper declarations precede the quantity by ‘PN=’ for example ‘PN=99’.</p>

<p>c) A ‘Kind of package’ code. On paper declarations put PC=’ in front of the package code – for example ‘PC=AE’.</p>

<p>On paper declarations if for an item there is more than one set of package marks/number/kind, separate each set of details by a semi-colon ‘;’.</p>

  <li>if the goods are not containerised or it is not known whether they are containerised then leave this field blank</li>
</ul>

<p>To avoid duplication, the container number should only be declared against the first item of a declaration. Where further items on the same declaration are packed into different containers, Box 31 will need to show the correct container number at item level.</p>

<p>On paper declarations precede the (list of) container numbers by ‘<abbr title="Combined Nomenclature">CN</abbr>=’ or, for part containers, by ’Part Container=’, and separate each container number by a comma, for example ‘Part Container=ABCD12345, BCDE234567, WXYZ98765’.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<p>The term ‘container’ covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>large, re-usable containers, for example ISO types designed to be transported by road, rail, sea, or air</li>
  <li>smaller re-usable types of containers of an internal volume of a cubic metre or more designed to be transported by road, rail, sea or air and capable of specialised handling without unloading</li>
  <li>specialised re-usable containers designed to be used for particular goods and transported by road, rail, sea or air</li>

For goods not wholly produced in one country, the country of origin to be declared is the country where the final substantial processing took place, resulting in the manufacture of a new product or representing an important stage in its manufacture.</p>

<p>If claiming preference and the trade agreement is with a group of countries, enter the exporter’s country. If this is unknown, it is acceptable to enter any country within that group of countries involved in the production of the good.  For example, for preference claims made in the UK under the UK-EU Trade Cooperation Agreement (<abbr title="Trade Cooperation Agreement">TCA</abbr>), enter the exporter’s EU Member State.  This should be the individual code for the country, e.g. ‘FR’ for France. If this is unknown, it is acceptable to enter any Member State involved in the production of the good. The Member State may be identified through the accompanying commercial documentation or the Registered Exporter system (REX) code on a ‘statement on origin’.</p>

<p>Please note, this level of information only applies to entries on UK custom declarations: the origin stated on the proof of origin must be at the group of country level.  For example, a ‘statement on origin’ made out under the UK-EU <abbr title="Trade Cooperation Agreement">TCA</abbr> should be completed in accordance with Annex 7 of that agreement and refer to ‘the Union’ as the preferential origin of the goods.</p>

<p>This level of information is required purely for UK domestic statistical analysis purposes and does not affect the applicability for preference.</p>

<p>If claiming preference and the country of non-preferential origin is different from the country of origin, enter the country of origin as determined above.</p>

<p>Enter the invoice price for the goods described in the relevant Box 31 in the currency used in Box 22.</p>

<p>In deciding which of these amounts to enter, the following rules must be used:</p>

<p>The invoice price must be declared for each item where the goods are in free circulation. It must also be declared for each item where the goods are not in free circulation unless the rules for declaring the customs value (see below) apply.</p>

<p>Where Valuation Method 1 or 6 is being used for Customs Duty purposes the invoice price per item must be adjusted to include:</p>

<p>For Valuation Method 1:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any deduction allowable from a purchase price which is not shown in another box must be made manually and the net amount entered in this box (evidence to support the deduction is to be attached)</li>
  <li>any addition to be made to a post CIF invoice or selling price for example for royalty or license fees must be made manually and the gross amount entered in this box</li>
</ul>

<p>For Valuation Method 6 all calculations other than:</p>

<ul>
  <li>percentage adjustments advised by either Customs Valuation Advisory Section or the local office of Revenue and Customs (which must be shown in Box 45)</li>
  <li>freight costs (which must be shown in Box 63), must be made manually and the adjusted amount entered in this box</li>
</ul>

<p>When the invoice price/value being declared is duty inclusive, the total invoice amount per item must include Customs Duty (including any secured duty), definitive anti-dumping duty, definitive countervailing duty and retaliatory duty.</p>

<h4>Customs value</h4>

<p>The customs value of goods is defined in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-252-valuation-of-imported-goods-for-customs-purposes-vat-and-trade-statistics">Notice 252</a>. It must be declared when:</p>

  <li>a UK or EU Simplified Procedure Value (<abbr title="Simplified Procedure Value">SPV</abbr>) applies</li>
  <li>the valuation method used to determine the customs value is Method 2, 3, 4(a) or 5</li>
  <li>the customs value using Method 4(b) is used for security purposes</li>
  <li>the declaration is an <abbr title="Simplified Frontier Declaration">SFD</abbr> for controlled goods on which a full licensing declaration at the frontier is required</li>
</ul>

<p>When importers or agents use their own valuation methods the customs value must also be declared in this box.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<p>On multi-item declarations, the total of all the Boxes 42 must equal the amount shown in Box 22.
<br><br>
<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> will convert any amounts declared in foreign currencies to sterling, using the rate of exchange current at the time the declaration is accepted by customs. If the current rate is not being used (for example because a fixed rate has been stipulated in the contract for sale of the goods-see Box 22) the amount shown in this box must be in sterling.</p>

<p>If any of the goods on the declaration are subject to ad valorem Customs Duty and the total declaration value exceeds £6,500, this box must be completed for all items on the declaration to indicate the valuation method to be used to calculate the value for Customs Duty. For <abbr title="Simplified Procedure Value">SPV</abbr> (code 7), Box 43 must always be completed irrespective of the value of the goods.</p>

<p>Where the value has been established using a standard import value (<abbr title="standard import value">SIV</abbr>) and declared under <abbr title="customs procedure code">CPC</abbr> 40 00 E02 Box 43 must be left blank.</p>

<p>Enter the appropriate valuation method code in this field and declare the document (and relevant status code) in Box 44 which supports the valuation method. The following table should be used to find the correct Document Code, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-document-certificate-and-authorisation-codes-for-harmonised-declarations">UK Trade Tariff: document, certificate and authorisation codes for harmonised declarations</a> for further information:</p>

<p>Valuation Method 4 comprises of both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Method 4(a) – with adjustment code (Box 45) not ‘M’</li>
  <li>Method 4(b) – with adjustment code (Box 45) ‘M’ See Box 45 for further information</li>
</ul>

<p>For goods exceeding £6,500 in value which are not chargeable with ad valorem duty but are subject to a positive rate of VAT which is being paid or deferred at importation, and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the importation is made by an unregistered person</li>
  <li>the importation is made by a registered person but the goods are not for the purposes of his/her business</li>
  <li>input deduction is not allowable, for example because the goods are used motor cars</li>

The same <abbr title="Declaration unique consignment reference">DUCR</abbr> must be supplied on both the <abbr title="Simplified Frontier Declaration">SFD</abbr> and linked supplementary declaration.</p>

<p>It is highly recommended that <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> authorised traders generate their own <abbr title="Declaration unique consignment reference">DUCR</abbr>/Part for all declarations,  as the <abbr title="Declaration unique consignment reference">DUCR</abbr>/Part is the main reference to the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> declaration and can incorporate commercial references so that there is a single reference for accessing related information  in trade and customs computer systems. The declaration of a <abbr title="Declaration unique consignment reference">DUCR</abbr>/Part also allows <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> to detect duplicates and identify potential problems at an early stage. The <abbr title="Declaration unique consignment reference">DUCR</abbr> must contain the <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number of the <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> authorised trader.</p>

<p>This field is mandatory for C21s but optional in all other cases. It must be completed at all locations where computerised inventory control operates. In other places if in doubt leave this field blank.</p>

<p>For imports the only master UCR format that is currently supported is the inventory consignment reference as follows.</p>

</ul>

<p><abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> allows just the inventory consignment reference to be supplied in this element when the associated inventory system is defined for the submitting trader role.</p>

<p>The rules about what other characters are allowed in a <abbr title="Master unique consignment reference">MUCR</abbr> are the same as for declaration unique consignment reference (<abbr title="Declaration unique consignment reference">DUCR</abbr>), such as restricted to numbers, upper case letters and certain special characters viz. ‘0’ to ‘9’, ‘A’ to ‘Z’, ‘-‘, ‘(‘ and ‘)’.</p>

<p>A preferential proof of origin, such as a ‘statement on origin’, should identify the preference being claimed, for example, <abbr title="Generalised System of Preferences">GSP</abbr>, and the origin of the goods in accordance with the specific agreement under which it is being claimed, for example, ‘Japan’ if under the UK-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (<abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr>) or ‘the Union’ if under the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement.</p>

<p>Document codes are mostly set out on screens in a generic structure. For each document code a status code, document reference, part, quantity and reason are entered as required.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-document-certificate-and-authorisation-codes-for-harmonised-declarations">UK Trade Tariff: document, certificate and authorisation codes for harmonised declarations</a> identifies what details have to be supplied for each document code along with permitted status codes (see the full list in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-document-status-codes-for-harmonised-declarations">UK Trade Tariff: document status codes for harmonised declarations</a>) and whether a reason has to be given.</p>

<p>Important and often used documents have specific screen and EDI data element names, as set out below. The document code must also be given on paper declarations.</p>

<p>For other documents enter the relevant document code.</p>

<p>For each document, a status code and a document reference will usually have to be provided. The status code identifies the availability and reason for not supplying a document or the action to be taken with the document. You don’t have to enter a document reference for some status codes.</p>

<h4>Status code</h4>

<p>Except for some special purpose document codes (often with data entered in specific elements/fields) a status code will have to be provided. The status code identifies the availability and reason for not supplying a document or the action to be taken with the document.</p>

<p>A full list of status codes can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-document-status-codes-for-harmonised-declarations">UK Trade Tariff: document status codes for harmonised declarations</a>.</p>

<h4>Reference</h4>

<p>Except for some document codes and status values (which are shown in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-document-status-codes-for-harmonised-declarations">UK Trade Tariff: document status codes for harmonised declarations</a>) a reference is always entered.</p>

<p>Enter code ‘XX’ if the actual goods don’t need the document code or status value and they’re identified by a commodity code that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>covers some goods subject to a documentary requirement – for example a licence</li>
  <li>others that aren’t – known as ‘ex-heading goods’</li>
</ul>

<h4>Part/quantity</h4>

<p>Enter the part and quantity as required for the particular document. For example, some licence cover many products each identified by a line number which is declared in the part field.</p>

<h4>Reason</h4>

<p>Below are some details of how to declare some common types of documents. Others are detailed in the relevant <abbr title="customs procedure codes">CPCs</abbr> in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-customs-procedure-codes">UK Trade Tariff: customs procedure codes</a>.</p>

<h4>Customs schemes</h4>

<p>Authorisation to use a customs special procedure.</p>

<p>Customs schemes are declared as the document reference for a document declaration using the document code identified in the table below for the scheme.</p>

<p>If 2 procedures apply (for example <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> and <abbr title="Inward Processing Relief">IPR</abbr>) the details for both should be entered.</p>

<p>The supervising office name and address must be declared. Only the name ‘NIRU’ need be entered for a simplified authorisation.</p>

<p>The document reference has the format:</p>

<p>&lt; customs scheme &gt; / &lt; supervising office &gt; / &lt; reference &gt; / &lt; year &gt;</p>

<p>A licence is declared as a document with the code given in the above tables for the particular licence type being declared.</p>

<p>A status code and a document reference must always be declared. The document reference is currently required when the status identifies that a particular licence should not be supplied (x-series status codes). This is to identify the licence type because the document code is not currently enough to identify other details that can be declared for a document depend on the status and the licence.</p>

<h4>Status code</h4>

<p>Enter the appropriate status code for the type of licence from the table below (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-document-status-codes-for-harmonised-declarations">UK Trade Tariff: document status codes for harmonised declarations</a> for status code definitions).

<p>If there is no percentage adjustment, enter ‘0’. For duty inclusive values, codes D, E, I, and J, the percentage adjustment must be ‘0’.</p>

<p>Where a negative percentage adjustment notified to the importer by HMRC is used to calculate the value for duty purposes, a separate worksheet must be attached to the declaration and the relevant calculations included in the total invoice amount and item price, boxes 22 and 42 respectively.</p>

<p>For multi-item declarations, all codes on the declaration must be either pre CIF (codes A and F), CIF (codes B, D, G or I), C and F (codes K or L) or post CIF (codes C, E, H or J). Different terms of trade (Incoterms) cannot be mixed on the same declaration. Where code M is used, it must apply to all items.</p>

<h4>Notes on particular codes</h4>

<p>If codes A or F are used Box 63 must be completed. Boxes 64-67 may also be completed.
<br><br>
If codes K or L are used Box 66 (or Box 67) must be completed.
<br><br>
If codes B, C, D, E, G, H, I or J are used Box 63 must be left blank.
<br><br>
If codes C or E are used and an addition is required to arrive at the customs value, this must be calculated outside <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> and the result shown in Boxes 22 and 42.
<br><br>
If codes D, E, I or J are used then any Anti-Dumping Duty payable outright or on deposit pending the outcome of a claim to exemption (declared by entering code <abbr title="Anti-Dumping Duty">ADD</abbr> in the rate column of Box 47) must be included in the totals declared in Boxes 22 and 42.
<br><br>
If codes D, E, I or J are used then any provisional Anti-Dumping Duty must however be excluded from the totals declared in Boxes 22 and 42.</p>

<p>Where required by the <abbr title="customs procedure code">CPC</abbr> enter the statistical value for the item, in terms of the declaration currency, currently pound sterling (£) (see Box 44 Declaration currency).</p>

<p>For goods subject to ad valorem duty, the value for Customs Duty (as determined in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-valuing-goods">UK Trade Tariff: valuing goods</a>) is to be taken as the statistical value.</p>

<p>For all other goods (such as, goods free from or exempted from duty, including those imported from EU member states, and goods subject to a specific duty), the statistical value is to be determined in relation to the point at which the goods enter the UK. This means that the value must include freight, insurance, commission and all other costs, charges and expenses incidental to the sale and delivery of the goods to the port or place of importation into the UK. Any duty or tax chargeable in the UK is excluded.</p>

<p>When the goods are re-imported after process or repair abroad, the value to be declared must include the cost of the process or repair and the value of the goods when exported.</p>

<p><abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> allows more than one method of payment for a tax type using separate lines, for example, to allow some of the revenue to be paid outright and any revenue in dispute to be secured.</p>

<p>A summary box is provided on all continuation sheets, but it is to be used only on the final continuation sheet on paper declarations to show the total of each duty or tax payable for all the items covered by the declaration and its continuation sheets.</p>

<p>Each tax line requires up to 5 fields (4 on a C21) to be completed. The 5 columns are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>type: codes which identify the kinds of duty or tax (Customs Duty, VAT, Excise) being declared – any manual calculations made in conjunction with these codes are to be attached to the declaration</li>
  <li>tax base: the actual value or quantity on which the tax or duty is to be calculated</li>
  <li>rate: information about the rate of tax or duty to be applied; codes (see below) which are asterisked don’t apply, but any Customs Duty rate and/or suspension rate code must be entered</li>
  <li>amount: the actual or potential amount payable</li>
  <li>MP: the method of payment (for example deferment, security by bond) being adopted</li>
</ul>

<p>The rules for completing each column are explained below.</p>

<p>The payment of tax and duty (other than excise duty on certain petrol substitutes), may be deferred at importation by consignees and declarants approved by customs for this purpose. All the duty and tax may be deferred to either the consignee’s or the declarant’s account, or alternatively, the charges can be split between the 2 accounts. When payment is being deferred to both the consignee’s and the declarant’s accounts, both deferment approval numbers (DANs) must be entered in this box.</p>

<p>When 2 deferment numbers are present, VAT amounts will be processed against the deferment account for <abbr title="Deferment approval number">DAN</abbr> 2. All other amounts deferred will be processed against the deferment account for <abbr title="Deferment approval number">DAN</abbr> 1. There is no restriction to which <abbr title="Deferment approval number">DAN</abbr> (the consignee’s or the declarant’s) is used for <abbr title="Deferment approval number">DAN</abbr> 2 usage.</p>

<p>The deferment approval number(s) entered in this box, (which must belong to the consignee shown in Box 8 and/or the declarant shown in Box 14), must be preceded by a code to indicate which account is being used. Where a declarant is using a consignee’s deferment approval number the code indicates whether a specific or standing authority is held.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<p>A declarant acting on behalf of a consignee may not use the consignee’s deferment approval number without first being authorised to do so. This authority may either be a ‘specific authority’ which relates to one particular consignment and must be presented to customs with the declaration, or alternatively, a consignee may give a standing authority which covers all consignments (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-101-deferring-duty-vat-and-other-charges">Notice 101 Deferring duty, VAT and other charges</a> for full details and examples on giving authority to use deferment accounts). If the declaration is processed as a paperless declaration, this authority must be retained at the traders registered premises (for 4 years) and may be subject to audit by customs.
<br><br>
Declarants must not quote third party deferment accounts without first being authorised to do so.
<br><br>
Consignee’s account (codes B, C, D) can only be used if the consignee is identified by a GB <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number at the header level.</p>

<p>2) Reference</p>

<p>Enter the reference allocated to the approval by the authorising country. In the UK:</p>

<ul>
  <li>customs warehouses have a 7 digit reference</li>
  <li>excise warehouses have a 13 digit reference</li>
  <li>the Free Zone is 0000006 – Isle of Man</li>
</ul>

<p>3) Country code</p>

<p>Enter the country code for the EU country which issued the warehouse reference. For UK warehouses the code is ‘GB’.</p>

<p>An example of a Customs warehouse identity is ‘A1234567GB’. An example of an Excise warehouse identity is
‘YGB00001234567GB’, where:</p>

<p>Y = warehouse type (see table above);</p>

<p>GB00001234567 = 13 character excise warehouse reference; GB = country code.</p>

<p>Where, as a result of declaration processing, it is determined that customs will accept a declaration without the need for the presentation of the paper copy, the <abbr title="Community System Provider">CSP</abbr> badge/user identity will replace the hand-written signature as the authentication credential for that declaration.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> role and location identified by the <abbr title="Community System Provider">CSP</abbr> badge/user identity will determine the liability for all data transmitted in that declaration. In a paperless environment the <abbr title="Community System Provider">CSP</abbr> badge will have the same legal status as the hand-written signature on the paper declaration.</p>

<p>Individual liability will rest with the signatory within the company for the use of that credential (such as the <abbr title="Community System Provider">CSP</abbr> badge/user identity). If there is to be a change of person who will act as signatory, this must be notified immediately to HMRC in writing, whereupon its records will be updated.</p>

<p>Where the declarant is completing the declaration themselves under ‘self-representation’, they shall be liable for the content of all declarations so completed and submitted.</p>

<p>Where the declarant is acting as a ‘direct’ representative, in the name of and on behalf of another person, and is transmitting the declaration under the declarant’s own <abbr title="Community System Provider">CSP</abbr> badge/user identity, the declarant must hold (and be able to produce on request to customs) written authority of their powers to act. Failure to do so will result in liability resting with the representative.</p>

<p>Where an agent delegates the making of a declaration to a sub- agent, and the sub-agent makes the declaration in a ‘direct’ capacity, in the name of and on behalf of the first agent, but using the sub-agent’s <abbr title="Community System Provider">CSP</abbr> badge/user identity as the authentication credential; the sub-agent must hold (and be able to produce on request to customs) written authority of their powers to act. Failure to produce written authority will result in liability resting with the sub-agent.</p>

<p>Where the declarant is acting as an ‘indirect’ representative in his/her own name, but on behalf of another person, both parties accept joint liability for all data transmitted under the <abbr title="Community System Provider">CSP</abbr> badge/user identity. A declarant failing to state the level of representation on the electronic declaration will be deemed to be acting in his/her own name and on his/her own behalf.</p>

<p>Where an agent delegates the making of a declaration to a sub- agent, in an ‘indirect’ capacity on behalf of the first agent (but using the sub-agent’s <abbr title="Community System Provider">CSP</abbr> badge/user identity as the authentication credential), then the sub-agent becomes the customs debtor. The original agent ceases to be a customs debtor because they neither make the declaration nor have responsibility for performing the acts and formalities laid down by customs rules.</p>

<p>The declaration must be signed according to the following rules. If the consignee is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an individual, by that individual or an employee who has been authorised in writing</li>
  <li>a partnership, by one of the partners, or one of their employees authorised in writing by a partner</li>
  <li>a company incorporated in the UK under the Companies Acts, by a director or the secretary, or an employee of the company authorised in writing by a director or the secretary</li>
  <li>a corporation incorporated in the UK by statute, by a person authorised by law to sign for the corporation, or an employee of the corporation authorised in writing by such a person</li>
  <li>a foreign firm or company, or a corporation incorporated abroad by statute, by a person authorised by the law of the country in which the firm or company, is established</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively the declaration may be signed on behalf of the consignee by any firm, company or individual to whom the consignee has given the authority to act as a declarant for customs purposes. The manner of authorisation is a matter of arrangement between consignees and their declarant but, in giving authority to a declarant, the consignee will be assumed to have given authority to the clerks and servants authorised by the agent to carry out all of the consignee’s customs business. Customs may at any time require evidence that a declarant has been authorised by a consignee to sign declarations on the consignee’s behalf.</p>

<p>Under direct representation enter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the place at which the declaration was made and the date</li>
  <li>the name of the declarant</li>
  <li>‘pp’ or ‘by’ the name of the agent</li>
  <li>the handwritten signature/or approved electronic equivalent of the person completing the form</li>
  <li>the full name of the person completing the form</li>
  <li>the status of the person completing the form (for example director, clerk)</li>
</ul>

<p>Under indirect representation enter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the place at which the declaration was made and the date</li>
  <li>the name of the agent</li>
  <li>the handwritten signature/or approved electronic equivalent of the person completing the form</li>
  <li>the full name of the person completing the form</li>
  <li>the status of the person completing the form (for example director, clerk)</li>
</ul>

<p>In signing Box 54 a legal declaration is being made that the details shown on the form and any continuation sheets are true and complete and that the requirements of any national or EU legislation have been met.</p>

<p>When a <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> partly completed in an EU member state is being used as the import declaration, the person signing Box 54 is committing themselves to the accuracy of all the information on the form, including that which was already completed when they received the document.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Value build-up</h3>

<p>Value build-up is a facility which, in conjunction with the declared <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> details, allows <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> to calculate the value for Customs Duty, when the invoice price is not ‘CIF EU frontier’, and to arrive at the values for VAT, statistical and other purposes. The value build up facility applies to Full, <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration for Imports">SDI</abbr>, <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration for customs warehouse removals">SDW</abbr> and <abbr title="Warehouse Removal Declaration">WRD</abbr> declarations.</p>

<p>Value build-up is only compulsory where the invoice price is not also the basis of value for Customs Duty purposes. Even at those locations its use is optional for goods where the invoice price is the basis of value for Customs Duty purposes.</p>

<p>Additionally, there is the option to use the facility at customs computerised locations to avoid the need to calculate values for <abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr> traders, and to have computer comparison of declared amounts for traders submitting paper declarations.</p>

<p>When <abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr> is used, the elements of the value build-up appear as fields on the screen format and print out on the entry acceptance advice. The results of the system’s calculations are printed out on the paper declaration (or have to be entered in the appropriate boxes if the declaration is not printed out by the system).</p>

<p>For paper declarations the information must be declared on a separate document (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-value-build-up-sheet-c89">form C89</a>), but the person making the declaration must also calculate the values themselves and enter them in the appropriate places on the declaration (Box 46 in Box 22 (Total amount invoiced) and Box 47) before presentation to customs.</p>

<p>At all customs computerised locations value build-up is not required when the value is calculated manually and the trader’s own worksheet is being attached to the declaration (Boxes 46 and 47).</p>

<p>The following directions must be followed when value build-up is used.</p>

<p>To arrive at the customs value <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> adds the amount to the other elements of the value, except when the code declared in Box 45 indicates a post CIF price (like codes C, E, H or J have been entered in that box) in which case the amount will be deducted.

<p>For multi-item declarations, <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> divides the charges/deductions entered in this box between the items in proportion to the value of the items.</p>

<p><abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> calculates the value for VAT by adding any duties, levies or additional costs to be included in the VAT value, to the value declared in Box 22. This box must only be used when there are any additional costs, not included in the total invoice value (Box 22) which need to be added to arrive at the value for VAT, for example freight charges covering transport within the UK and EU (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-252-valuation-of-imported-goods-for-customs-purposes-vat-and-trade-statistics">Notices 252</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-702-imports">Notice 702</a>).</p>

<p>If the value for VAT is less than <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> would normally calculate for Customs Duty purposes, the amount of VAT payable must be calculated manually. The code ‘VAT’ is to be entered in the rate column of Box 47 followed by the calculated payment due in the amount column.</p>

<p>Enter in the first subdivision the code from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-country-and-currency-codes">country and currency codes</a> for the currency in which the amount is being declared.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Presentation of import declarations to HMRC</h3>

<p>Import declarations (but excluding certain <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> and paperless Route 6 entries) must be presented to the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr>:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

BT-NCH
<br>HM Revenue and Customs
<br>BX9 1GZ
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>Fax: 0800 496 0699</p>

<p>Email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:%20Northregionepuoperations@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk">Northregionepuoperations@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:%20NCHLAP@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk">NCHLAP@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>Import declarations must be made directly following presentation of the goods to HMRC.</p>

<p>Import declarations can be pre-entered onto <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> up to 30 days prior to the arrival of the vessel/goods. This period includes weekends and public holidays. For declarations entered by <abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr>, goods which have not arrived within 30 days are expected to be removed from <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> by the importer or their agent until the necessary system changes have been made to allow the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> auto delete facility to function in tandem with [air]port inventory systems.</p>

<p>The paper copy of the import declaration and any supporting papers for those entries which importers and/or their agents believe will be allocated a Route 1, 2 or 3 can be pre-lodged with the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> up to 5 actual days prior to the arrival of the goods / vessel. This period includes weekends and public holidays.</p>

<p>Customs clearance is normally linked to the port or airport of importation but clearance facilities for goods transported in secure vehicles or containers are, with some exceptions, provided at specified inland clearance depots.</p>

<p>Goods must not be removed from the place of importation or clearance without customs authority.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>Acceptance of import declarations</h3>

<p>Legal acceptance of a declaration submitted in advance of the goods’ arrival will only occur:</p>

<ul>
  <li>after the vehicle, vessel or aircraft has arrived at its intended place of discharge, or another place designated by customs</li>
  <li>the arrival of the goods in the UK has been notified to customs</li>
  <li>the declaration is valid and contains no apparent errors</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice of arrival will generally be effected by the delivery to customs of a manifest showing details of all goods carried by the ship, aircraft or vehicle. In certain circumstances (see schedule below) an individual notice of arrival (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-notice-of-arrival-c27">form C27</a>) must be submitted to customs if the free circulation or home use declaration is presented prior to the arrival of the goods. This requirement does not apply to <abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr> declarations, where an electronic notification is required from either the declarant or the inventory system operator.</p>

<p>However, acceptance of a declaration input to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> by a <abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr> agent after arrival of the goods, shall (except for SDIs and SDWs) be the date and time that the computers’ acceptance responses are output on the VDU screen of the <abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr> agent. This date and time is printed on the entry acceptance advice and is recorded on <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>.</p>

<p>The rates and amounts of import duties, and other rules and provisions relating to goods released for free circulation or home use, are those in force at the time the declaration is legally accepted by customs.</p>

<p>Where the rate of exchange advised by customs for the expected date of acceptance of the declaration differs from that in force on the date of presentation, the rate of exchange which will be in force when the declaration is accepted must be used when calculating any duties and taxes.</p>

<p>The circumstances when form C27 must be provided with the declaration are:</p>

<p>When the declaration covers more than one of the above classes the most restrictive period applicable operates.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span>Selection of imported goods for examination (including removal to private premises for this purpose)</h3>

<p>All imported goods are liable to be examined by customs. If goods are selected for examination, the opening, unpacking and repacking must normally be done by employees of the dock company or an agent of the importer.</p>

<p>The examination of goods normally occurs at the place where they are being declared for importation. However, goods may be removed to private premises for examination subject to customs approval if, for example, they are dangerous or sensitive and need to be unpacked by people familiar with the risks involved. Customs retain the right to require goods to be examined at the place of importation.</p>

<p>Importers who wish to have any goods which are selected for examination removed to private premises for this purpose should consult customs before the goods are imported to prevent delay when the goods arrive. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-112a-attendance-at-private-premises-by-hm-revenue-and-customs">Notice 112A</a> provides information about the charges which will be raised for the attendance of customs officers at private premises. It also gives directions as to how requests for such attendances are to be made.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.7 </span>Payment of customs duties and other charges</h3>

<p>Customs duties and other charges that are due must be paid, deferred or secured before the goods are cleared by customs. The deferred payment of customs duties and other charges is subject to the provision of adequate security and to other conditions (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-101-deferring-duty-vat-and-other-charges">Notice 101: deferring duty, VAT and other charges</a>). Notice 101 also contains details of the Simplified Import VAT Accounting (<abbr title="Simplified Import VAT Accounting">SIVA</abbr>) scheme which allows approved businesses to reduce the security requirement for deferred import VAT.</p>

<p>Customs duties and other charges due for immediate payment are charged to a <abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr> authorised trader through an account maintained in <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>. This accounting procedure is known as the Flexible Accounting System (<abbr title="Flexible Accounting System">FAS</abbr>) and goods will not be cleared from customs control unless the credit balance in the account is enough to cover all the charges due.</p>

<p>When the precise amount of duty or other charges payable cannot be assessed at the time the declaration is presented, clearance can usually be allowed on payment of a deposit or provision of security to cover that element of duty considered to be in dispute. This may be equal to the full duty amount or the difference between 20 potential duty amounts. For non-VAT registered traders, the amount of VAT consequently in dispute must be secured. For VAT registered traders VAT is normally paid outright based on the value which includes the highest potential duty regardless of whether this is secured by cash or cashless security. These traders also have the option to secure the disputed element of VAT.</p>

<p>The following methods of securing revenue charges are available.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<p>All cash deposits will be by Miscellaneous Cash Deposit.
<br><br>
Dependent on the reasons for securing of charges, adjustment of the entry will be carried out by either National Temporary Admission Seat (<abbr title="National Temporary Admission TEAM">NTAS</abbr>) or the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr>.
<br><br>
In the majority of circumstances where there is a need for security, <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> is able to identify from other details on the entry, the Reason for Security Code (<abbr title="Reason for Security Code">RFS</abbr>) which the system will automatically generate after clearance.
<br><br>
The <abbr title="Reason for Security Code">RFS</abbr> code is an aid to the department for post clearance adjustment and will not appear on the declarants <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> screens or paper outputs.
<br><br>
In some circumstances there will be a need to insert a manual <abbr title="Reason for Security Code">RFS</abbr> code in Box 44. A list of manual <abbr title="Reason for Security Code">RFS</abbr> codes is in paragraph 3.1.1 under the information to be declared in Box 44.</p>

<h4>A. Miscellaneous Cash Deposit (<abbr title="Miscellaneous Cash Deposit">MCD</abbr>)</h4>

<p><abbr title="Miscellaneous Cash Deposits">MCDs</abbr> are cash securities held in a suspense account by customs pending confirmation of correct charges/eligibility for refund. Payment of an <abbr title="Miscellaneous Cash Deposit">MCD</abbr> may be deferred when it is payable at the time of passing the entry.</p>

<p>Form C&amp;E955 or C&amp;E955D, as appropriate, must accompany all <abbr title="Miscellaneous Cash Deposit">MCD</abbr> entries.</p>

<h4>B. Security by guarantee</h4>

<p>As an alternative to cash securities, importers have the option of securing charges by the lodgement of a guarantee from an approved bank or financial institution. Such guarantees are available for one entry only, (individual guarantee) or for a number of entries (guarantee account).</p>

<p>i. Individual Guarantee</p>

<p>Blank forms are available from <abbr title="National Temporary Admission TEAM">NTAS</abbr> and the approved guarantee must accompany the entry.</p>

<p>ii. Guarantee account</p>

<p>Blank guarantee forms are available only from <abbr title="National Temporary Admission TEAM">NTAS</abbr> who will also require details of authorised users.</p>

<p>Telephone: 03000 579 0554</p>

<p>The level of the guarantee is to be set to cover the maximum amount of security considered to be necessary. The guarantee level will be monitored by <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>. Processing of the entry will be suspended if the guarantee level is insufficient.</p>

<p>Adjustment of <abbr title="Miscellaneous Cash Deposits">MCDs</abbr> and securities by guarantee</p>

<p>The following list shows the conditions under which goods cleared by securing the revenue in dispute will be controlled by <abbr title="National Temporary Admission TEAM">NTAS</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>evidence of value at the time of presentation of the entry is incomplete or unsatisfactory</li>
  <li>an instruction authorising acceptance of a provisional value is in force</li>
  <li>the goods are of a kind allowed to be entered for ‘official test’</li>
  <li>admission is claimed under intra-EU or preference arrangements but the evidence is incomplete or unsatisfactory</li>
  <li>exemption is claimed from levy but the evidence is incomplete or unsatisfactory</li>
  <li>exemption is claimed from Anti-Dumping Duty but the evidence is incomplete or unsatisfactory</li>
  <li>a quota rate is claimed but evidence is incomplete or unsatisfactory or quota critical procedure has been introduced</li>
  <li>tariff classification is in dispute (note that this applies to genuine disputes and entries are not acceptable with security if the importer, or their authorised agent, has simply failed to determine and declare the Tariff declaration)</li>
  <li>specific directions have been issued by a customs headquarters branch allowing entry by security</li>
</ul>

<h4>C. Bonds and undertakings</h4>

<p>(i) A bond is an instrument, under seal, by which the person entering into it bind themselves to pay to the Crown specified sums of money on breach of any of the terms mentioned.</p>

<p>Bonds should not be used for securing customs duties and similar UK or EU import duties.  This will also include Anti-Dumping Duty and all customs duties on agricultural goods. Alternative methods of security need to be used.</p>

<p>Bonds are classified as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ordinary bonds each covering a specific transaction.</li>
  <li>General bonds covering a number of transactions of a similar kind, or relating to conditions which are likely to be observed for an indefinite period or during the continuance of a concession; or given by a parent company to cover transactions by that company and associated companies.</li>
  <li>Premises bond covering both the premises and their contents.</li>
  <li>Comprehensive bonds covering liabilities under both general and premises bonds.</li>
</ul>

<p>(ii) An undertaking is an official document, signed by an importer, or an authorised agent, by which they undertake to pay duty and any other charges due on goods imported under duty relief provisions, if there is a breach of any of the conditions of the relief. Undertakings may also be made for the subsequent production of certain documents.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.8 </span>Diversion of imported goods including part and/or split consignments from one location to the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If, after a declaration has been presented at and all or part of the consignment of goods are diverted solely on account of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>unforeseen transport or labour difficulties</li>
  <li>being short shipped</li>
  <li>being on carried</li>
  <li>being imported through a place of discharge and/or examination other than that entered</li>
</ul>

<p>The goods may be cleared without the need for a new entry at the other location. This concession is subject to the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>after the goods have been landed the application must be made to the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> where the entry was originally presented</li>
  <li>the application must be made on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-application-to-clear-diverted-goods-c61">form C6</a>, fully completed in duplicate, supported by a copy of the entry and the removal note (if already issued by customs)</li>
</ul>

<p>During the period between the date of presentation of the entry and the date of importation of the goods there must have been no change in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the value for duty and/or VAT</li>
  <li>the period rate of exchange except where invoiced in sterling</li>
  <li>the rate of duty and/or VAT</li>
  <li>other charges payable on importation  or any relief or restriction affecting the goods</li>
</ul>

<p>Where there have been changes a fresh entry is required.</p>

<p>Goods normally subject to Notice of Arrival (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-notice-of-arrival-c27">form C27</a>) procedure, for example tariff quota and <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> goods, are not included (these goods are not eligible for C6 diversion procedures).</p>

<h4>Minor diversion within the same port</h4>

<p>Where a ship is diverted to another wharf in the same port, an application by letter to use and amend the original entry is normally acceptable. A letter of request would also apply to entries where the import vessel has been amended from the entered vessel.</p>

<h4>‘No Goods’ Entries</h4>

<p>As an alternative to the above procedure a consignee/declarant can request an entry to be made ‘NO GOODS’ at the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr>, supporting invoices will be returned if necessary, and a new entry submitted for the second location if this is more convenient.</p>

<h4>Note to container operators</h4>

<p>Certain intentional transport arrangements known prior to importation are not covered by these special concessions. An example of such arrangements are mixed consignments of containers entered to one entry, the full loads (<abbr title="full loads">FCL</abbr>) intended for clearance at the port of import and the part loads (<abbr title="part loads">LCL</abbr>) intended for removal to an <abbr title="Inland Clearance Depots">ICD</abbr> for clearance. Requests for such arrangements will not be accepted.</p>

<h4>Goods diverted to an inventory linked location</h4>

<p>When goods are diverted to an inventory linked location, a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-customs-clearance-request-c21">form C21</a> (using <abbr title="customs procedure code">CPC</abbr> 00 09 00) will be required.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.9 </span>Examination of the goods by the consignee or declarant before a declaration is made</h3>

<p>When a consignee or their declarant is unable to complete a declaration because they don’t have enough information about the goods they may ask customs at the place of clearance for permission to examine or sample the goods under their supervision.</p>

<p>Whenever sampling is requested (and in some other cases) a written application will be required, signed by the person making the request and containing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the name and address of the applicant</li>
  <li>the location of the goods</li>
  <li>all other information  necessary to identify the goods</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.10 </span>Economic Operator Registration Identification (<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> was introduced in the UK and EU on 1 July 2009.</p>

<p><abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> replaced the previous national system Trader Unique Reference Number (<abbr title="Trader Unique Reference Number">TURN</abbr>). A UK <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number is prefixed with GB followed by a 9 digit VAT or Non VAT number suffixed by 3 digits normally 000. VAT Group registration numbers will have suffixes higher than 000.</p>

<p>Example <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number is: GB123456789000.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number will be required if you are submitting a customs declaration a C88.</p>

<p>Evidence of import VAT is in the form of a monthly VAT certificate, form C79, direct to importers at their VAT registered address. Individual declarations are listed on the certificate under the <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number.</p>

<p>Consignees must ensure that they pass details of their <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number to their agent or courier acting on their behalf. The <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number is used in the production of the VAT certificate C79. Use of incorrect or out of date <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> numbers could lead to a VAT certificate not being issued.</p>

<p>Under the old <abbr title="Trader Unique Reference Number">TURN</abbr> system it was possible to identify imports/exports and revenue due against individual branches/divisions. Under EU legislation branches and divisions will not qualify for an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number. HMRC has designed some solutions to assist economic operators to associate declarations to individual branches/divisions. These are optional.</p>

<h4>Option 1</h4>

<p>HMRC have set up 2 additional information codes statements (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-additional-information-codes-for-harmonised-declarations">UK Trade Tariff: additional information codes for harmonised declarations</a>) at header level in Box 44 of the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> (C88) declaration. The codes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>BR followed by a 3 digit numeric code for importers/exporters</li>
  <li>AG followed by a 3 digit numeric code for agents/declarants</li>
</ul>

<p>These codes allow identification of the branch importing, exporting or acting as declarants as appropriate for example BR001, AG008 when a customs declaration is made. It is likely the 3 digit numeric code could be the same as the old <abbr title="Trader Unique Reference Number">TURN</abbr> suffix, however you are free to choose any number you wish. It is acceptable for both codes to appear on the same declaration if necessary.</p>

<p>There are 4 <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> branch code reports available to importers and exporters and agents/declarants as appropriate on a monthly basis. These reports are provided free of charge. They list all entries made where the BR or AG code has been entered in box 44 to assist reconciliation to be carried out, in particular C79s. If no code is entered in the box 44, the entry will not appear on the MSS report.</p>

<p>The 4 reports available will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>BR imports</li>
  <li>BR exports</li>
  <li>AG imports</li>
  <li>AG exports</li>
</ul>

<p>Information on the reports include entry number, date, EPU, agent’s reference and BR/AG code in box 44.</p>

<p>Import reports will be provided from the 4th working day of the month and export reports will normally be provided from the 19th of the month.</p>

<h4>Option 2</h4>

<p>This solution applies to importers only and involves including the branch identifier as part of the agent’s reference in box 7 of the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> (C88) declaration for example TGR12867498/002 or 001— FWAYU561829. Box 7 of the declaration also appears on the C79. The C79 is a form detailing each month all your imports where VAT has been charged. Adding the agent’s identifier to box 7 may help with reconciliation of your imports against branch(es) and may be used in conjunction with or instead of the MSS report option.</p>

<p>Submitting traders/paying agents authorised before 1 April 2009.</p>

<p>If you are submitting trader/paying agent with more than one branch/<abbr title="Trader Unique Reference Number">TURN</abbr> who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>also acts as an agent to submit declarations on behalf of others</li>
  <li>submits declarations for your own business</li>
</ul>

<p>The following will apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you will need to acquire an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number for your parent company/head office if your details are required in Box 2, 8 or 14 of the customs declaration</li>
  <li>however you may continue to use your existing badge/role (to submit declarations) as well as access existing <abbr title="Flexible Accounting System">FAS</abbr> accounts</li>
</ul>

<p>This concession will not apply to any new badges/roles which are set up on <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> after 1st April 2009 which will only be set up against an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number.</p>

<h4>Applying for an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number</h4>

<p>The Eori application form is available from the HMRC website <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eori">www.gov.uk/eori</a></p>

<p>You can also phone the HMRC helpline on 0300 200 3700.</p>

<p>If you are not VAT registered you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/economic-operator-registration-and-identification-eori-scheme#how-to-get-an-eori-number">apply for a non VAT <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number</a>. Once you become VAT registered it is in your own interest to apply for a VAT <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number by completing another <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/economic-operator-registration-and-identification-eori-scheme#how-to-get-an-eori-number">application form</a>.</p>

<p>Only a UK VAT <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number will generate a C79 VAT certificate which is required to reclaim import VAT paid.</p>

<p>A non VAT <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number is required if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you wish to enter goods to a public (type A/R) customs warehouse and remove them from there to free circulation or to another customs procedure</li>
  <li>you are the person removing goods to free circulation or to another customs procedure from a private (type A, D, E or U) customs warehouse</li>
</ul>

<p>For private importations, GBPR should be entered in Box 8 of the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> when the ‘goods’ being entered are for Personal use.</p>

<p>There are certain goods that need special treatment.</p>

<p>Motor vehicles – for private importations, goods classified under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff/sections">UK Trade Tariff</a> chapters 8703 and 8711 should be entered using <abbr title="customs procedure code">CPC</abbr> 40 00 074 (‘means of transport permanently imported by private persons on payment of Customs Duty and VAT’). For commercial imports where a VAT registration number is not in existence, a non VAT <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number should be used.</p>

<p>Firearms – if you are importing firearms classified within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">the UK Trade Tariff</a> chapter 93 that require a Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) licence you should not enter these goods to GB PR, even if they are for private use. BIS require the importer to be in possession of either a non VAT <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number or an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number prior to issuing an import license.</p>

<p>Racehorses – if privately owned and for non-business use, GBPR should be entered. If the horse is owned by a syndicate/other legal entity for business use then an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number should be obtained.</p>

<p>Personal effects – for example personal possessions, holiday purchases, human remains - further guidance on relevant forms to be used in specific circumstances is found below.</p>

<p>GBPR has no value limit and therefore should be used for all non-commercial, non-business related entries regardless of value.</p>

<span class="number">3. </span>Import Control System Northern Ireland (<abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> NI)</h2>

<p>This section of the Tariff covers the operation of the <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> NI.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Security and Safety legislation relating to imports into Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>The implementation of Security and Safety legislation is laid down in Commission Regulation 2015/2446. The transitional data elements for <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> NI are in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2015/2446/attachment/3?view=extent#extent%3Dwales" rel="external">Annex B of Regulation 2015/2446/EU</a>. From August 2021, when the <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> system is upgraded to ICS2, the data elements for ICS2 can be found in Regulation 2016/341.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Import Control System Northern Ireland (<abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> NI)</h3>

<p><abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> NI requires the electronic submission of an Entry Summary Declaration (<abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr>) providing pre-arrival information for all goods brought into Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>The responsibility for ensuring that ENSs are submitted lies with the ‘carrier’. The carrier is defined as the ‘operator of the active means of transport on or in which the goods are brought into Northern Ireland (for example the vessel, aircraft, train or road vehicle)’.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-control-system"><abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> guidance</a> outlines the processes carriers will need to follow when bringing goods into Northern Ireland via Great Britain.</p>

<p>The free Trader Support Service can help if you move goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, or bring goods into Northern Ireland from outside the UK.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>
<abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> NI main principles</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> NI Entry Summary Declaration (<abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr>):</p>

<ul>
  <li>should be submitted (within the deadlines set by the legislation) to the <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> NI system where the first [air]port of entry into Northern Ireland is situated (the ‘Office of First Entry’ (<abbr title="Office of First Entry">OoFE</abbr>))</li>
  <li>
    <p>should include, in the specified format, the data elements of Annex B of Regulation 2015/2446/EU including information to identify:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the cargo</li>
      <li>the traders involved in the movement</li>
      <li>the vessel/aircraft</li>
      <li>the envisaged route into Northern Ireland and across Great Britain or the EU</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is the responsibility of the carrier to ensure that an <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> is submitted for all goods on board the vessel/aircraft entering Northern Ireland even where they remain on board during the passage of the vessel/aircraft through Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>It should be noted in particular that an <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> for cargo arriving in deep sea containers must be submitted before loading of the goods on the vessel in the third country. Information may have to be provided many weeks in advance of actual arrival of the cargo.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>Time limits for lodging entry declarations</h3>

<p>The time limits laid down in Article 105 to 110 of Commission Regulation 2015/2446 for all modes of transport are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maritime containerised cargo (except short sea containerised shipping) – at least 24 hours before commencement of loading of the vessel that brings the goods into Northern Ireland at the port of departure</li>
  <li>maritime bulk/break bulk cargo (except short sea bulk/break bulk shipping) – at least 4 hours before arrival at the first port in Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>
    <p>short sea shipping movements between:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Greenland</li>
      <li>Faroe Islands</li>
      <li>Norway</li>
      <li>Iceland</li>
      <li>ports on the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea at least 2 hours before arrival at the first port in the UK or EU</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Movements between a territory outside the UK and EU and French overseas departments, Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands where the duration is less than 24 hours – at least 2 hours before arrival at the first port in the UK or EU:</p>

<ul>
  <li>short haul flights (less than 4 hours duration) – at least by the time of the actual take off of the aircraft</li>
  <li>long haul flights (more than 4 hours duration) – at least 4 hours before arrival at the first airport in the UK or EU</li>
  <li>road traffic – at least 1 hour before arrival at the customs <abbr title="Office of First Entry">OoFE</abbr> in Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>Movement Reference Number (<abbr title="Movement Reference Number">MRN</abbr>) – inclusion on <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Import Declaration</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Movement Reference Number">MRN</abbr> number is automatically generated by the <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> System and allocated to each <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> after successful validation, acceptance and registration. Importers or agents should include the information in Box 44 of the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> import declaration.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span>
<abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> Risk Assessment</h3>

<p>All information submitted to <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> NI will be assessed against a set of risk criteria and any positive risks identified at the first [air]port of entry into Northern Ireland will be passed on to subsequent [air]ports in EU member states (Offices of Subsequent Entry (<abbr title="Offices of Subsequent Entry">OoSE</abbr>)).</p>

<p>Where positive risk results are detected, the UK Border Force (UKBF) (as delivery partners for HMRC at the UK frontier) will assess whether to intervene. This may mean issuing a ‘Do Not Load’ message (for maritime deep sea cargo sector only), intercepting the goods on arrival in Northern Ireland, and/or forwarding the positive risk results to customs administration(s) in subsequent identified [air]port(s) in the EU.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.7 </span>The <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> arrival notification</h3>

<p>Where Northern Ireland is either an <abbr title="Office of First Entry">OoFE</abbr> or an <abbr title="Offices of Subsequent Entry">OoSE</abbr>, the lead carrier should arrange for the electronic submission of an <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> ‘Arrival Notification’ to the <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> NI system when the means of transport carrying the goods reaches Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>The existing process for [air]port/inventory arrivals by inventory systems for legal presentation and customs entry purposes will not change, the <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> Arrival Notification is in addition to this. However, some inventory systems may include this additional functionality within existing processing – carriers should contact their EU Systems Provider for information on whether this functionality is available. At locations where Arrival Notification functionality is not being provided by the inventory system or where an inventory system is not in use, carriers must make provision for an electronic Arrival Notification (IE347) to be submitted to the <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> NI system – in common with all <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> NI functionality, no manual (paper) submission option is available.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.8 </span>The <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> Diversion Request</h3>

<p>Where the active means of transport (vessel/aircraft/lorry) is to be diverted to an Office of First Entry in the EU which was not identified on the original <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr>, the carrier must lodge a ‘Diversion Request’ to the initially declared <abbr title="Office of First Entry">OoFE</abbr>. This office then transmits information to the actual <abbr title="Office of First Entry">OoFE</abbr> about any consignments for which a positive risk was identified. If the declared <abbr title="Office of First Entry">OoFE</abbr> did not find any risks, no information will be forwarded to the actual <abbr title="Office of First Entry">OoFE</abbr>. The Diversion Request (IE323) must be submitted electronically.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.9 </span>
<abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> operation in EU member states</h3>

<p>Where cargo destined for Northern Ireland initially arrives via an EU member state traders will need to consult any <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> guidance issued by the EU member state responsible for the <abbr title="Office of First Entry">OoFE</abbr>. The UK guidance can only cover the <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> process where Northern Ireland is <abbr title="Office of First Entry">OoFE</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.11 </span>UK Fallback Arrangements for the <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr>
</h3>

<h4>If an Economic Operators system is unavailable</h4>

<p>The UK will not accept <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> declarations by ‘other means’ for example by paper, data key or email. Economic Operators will need to make arrangements for the Entry Summary Declaration (<abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr>) to be submitted by another Economic Operator on their behalf, or keep trying to submit an <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> up to the point that the Arrival Notification is processed. The later the <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> is sent in these circumstances the greater the possibility of encountering delays upon arrival.</p>

<p>A valid <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> declaration will be required to be submitted to allow Economic Operators to fulfil their legal obligations.</p>

<p>Not being able to declare <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> data from their own systems due to system failure will not automatically be accepted as a valid excuse for not declaring an <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> to <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> NI.</p>

<h4>If a <abbr title="Community System Provider">CSP</abbr> system is unavailable</h4>

<p>If a <abbr title="Community System Provider">CSP</abbr> system is unavailable, Economic Operators should operate under their individual CSPs fallback arrangements (usually by use of another <abbr title="Community System Provider">CSP</abbr> system) or submit their declaration via the Trader Front End (<abbr title="Trader Front End">TFE</abbr>).</p>

<p>If all <abbr title="Community System Provider">CSP</abbr> systems are unavailable, Economic Operators will need to either use the published <abbr title="Community System Provider">CSP</abbr> fallback provisions or use an alternative electronic method (such as, another traders system where the trader links to the front end) to allow the <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> to be declared.</p>

<h4>If the core <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> NI system, including <abbr title="Trader Front End">TFE</abbr>, is unavailable to both UK and Economic Operators</h4>

<p>Economic Operators and CSPs should continue to send messages to <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> NI until HMRC confirm the non-availability of the core <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> NI system. These will be queued until the system is restored. When the <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> NI system is restored, an <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> can be sent for consignments en-route that have not yet had the Arrival Notification processed.</p>

<p>HMRC will advise EU member states when the UK <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> is not available so other MS can be aware that some consignments, particularly involving short flights, may not have a <abbr title="Movement Reference Number">MRN</abbr> allocated.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Movement Reference Number">MRN</abbr> number is automatically generated by the S&amp;S GB service and allocated to each <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> after successful validation and acceptance. Importers or agents should include the <abbr title="Movement Reference Number">MRN</abbr> of the <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> in Box 44 of the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> import declaration.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span>S&amp;S GB Risk Assessment</h3>

<p>All information submitted to S&amp;S GB will be assessed against a set of risk criteria. The results of the risk assessment will be used by the UK Border Force (UKBF) (as delivery partners for HMRC at the UK frontier) to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify shipments they wish to prevent being loaded onto the vessel entering GB (see Do Not Load section)</li>
  <li>identify imports they may wish to control on entering GB</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.7 </span>‘Do Not Load’ message</h3>

<p>For deep-sea containerised shipments only, a Do Not Load (DNL) message, the IE351, may be issued. This will be sent to the person submitting the declaration.</p>

<p>There are a number of steps which must be followed to ensure that the carrier will be made aware that a DNL has been issued where a third party (e.g. a freight forwarder) has made the <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> filing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the third-party may only file the <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> with the ocean carrier’s knowledge and consent</li>
  <li>in its <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> filing, the third-party must identify the ocean carrier with the ocean carrier’s <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number</li>
  <li>the third-party must also include both the container number(s) and the ocean carrier’s transport document number (that is, the master bill of lading number/booking reference number) in addition to its own (house) bill of lading number in its <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> filing</li>
</ul>

<p>Provided these data elements are included in the <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr>, and provided that the ocean carrier is IT-connected to S&amp;S GB the ocean carrier would automatically be notified not only of the <abbr title="Movement Reference Number">MRN</abbr> for the third-party filing (which will serve as proof that the carrier’s obligation that an <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> is filed has been met) but also of any DNL messages.</p>

<p>Based on the container and transportation document numbers included in the DNL message, the ocean carrier would be able to identify the containerised shipment that may not be loaded. Moreover, it is not unrealistic to expect that if a Customs Administration believed that a consignment posed such a serious threat that a DNL is appropriate then they would not simply rely on the sending of an electronic message to interested parties.</p>

<p>The UK Border Force will tell you what to do if you receive a Do Not Load message.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.8 </span>S&amp;S GB interaction with EU member states</h3>

<p>S&amp;S GB does not interact with, or share information with, the Import Control Systems (<abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr>) in any EU member states. This also includes the Import Control System (Northern Ireland (<abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> (NI)). Where cargo destined for Great Britain initially arrives via an EU member state, carriers will need to consult any <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> guidance issued by the EU member state responsible for the <abbr title="Office of First Entry">OoFE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where cargo arrives in Great Britain before travelling to Northern Ireland an <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> will be required firstly into the S&amp;S GB service and then a subsequent <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> into the <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> (NI).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.9 </span>UK Fallback Arrangements for S&amp;S GB</h3>

<h4>If an Economic Operator’s system is unavailable</h4>

<p>The UK will not accept <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> declarations by ‘other means’ for example by paper, data key or email. Economic Operators will need to make arrangements for the Entry Summary Declaration (<abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr>) to be submitted by another Economic Operator on their behalf or keep trying to submit an <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> up to the point that the goods arrive. The later the <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> is sent in these circumstances the greater the possibility of encountering delays upon arrival.</p>

<p>A valid <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> declaration will be required to be submitted to allow Economic Operators to fulfil their legal obligations.</p>

<p>Not being able to declare <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> data from their own systems due to system failure will not automatically be accepted as a valid excuse for not declaring an <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> to S&amp;S GB.</p>

<h4>If a <abbr title="Community System Provider">CSP</abbr> system is unavailable</h4>

<p>If a <abbr title="Community System Provider">CSP</abbr> system is unavailable, Economic Operators should operate under their individual CSPs fallback arrangements (usually by use of another <abbr title="Community System Provider">CSP</abbr> system) or submit their declaration via the Trader Front End (<abbr title="Trader Front End">TFE</abbr>).</p>

<p>If all <abbr title="Community System Provider">CSP</abbr> systems are unavailable, Economic Operators will need to either use the published <abbr title="Community System Provider">CSP</abbr> fallback provisions or use an alternative electronic method (such as, another traders system where the trader links to the front end) to allow the <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> to be declared.</p>

<h4>If the core S&amp;S GB service, including <abbr title="Trader Front End">TFE</abbr>, is unavailable to both UK and Economic Operators</h4>

<p>Economic Operators and CSPs should continue to send messages to S&amp;S GB until HMRC confirm the non-availability of the core S&amp;S GB service. These will be queued until the service is restored. When the S&amp;S GB service is restored, an <abbr title="Entry Summary Declaration">ENS</abbr> can be sent for consignments en-route that have not yet arrived.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Other import procedures</h2>

<p>In addition to the procedures already detailed for declaring goods at import a number of special arrangements exist to facilitate trade in a variety of different circumstances. These facilities are summarised in this section.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Bulk consignments procedures</h3>

<p>Bulking of consignments of documents eligible for admission under <abbr title="customs procedure codes">CPCs</abbr> 4000C31, 4000C34, 4000C35, 4000C36, 4900C31, 4900C34, 4900C35 and 4900C36.</p>

The country code field (for Box 2) should contain the code for the country from which the goods have been exported. For the name field ‘00200 – see list attached’ should be entered. These details will need to be entered at header level.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Customs Freight Simplified Procedures (<abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> offers a 2 part declaration procedure. The initial declaration will have a reduced number of boxes to complete in comparison to a full declaration. The second part of the declaration is where the duty and import VAT due is calculated and declared to HMRC. Get authorisation to use <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> by completing a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-simplified-procedures-application-ce48">C&amp;E48 form</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Goods imported by post</h3>

<p>Consignments of goods imported by letter or parcel post must comply with internationally agreed arrangements which are embodied in UK postal and customs regulations. One essential requirement is that postal packages must be accompanied by a properly completed customs declaration, either on <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.royalmail.com/business/help/sending/customs" rel="external">form CN22 or CN23</a> (a ‘green label’) as appropriate, which describes in full the nature, quantity and value of the goods contained in the package.</p>

<p>Most imported postal packages are cleared by customs under this arrangement, but a full import declaration, on a <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>, must be presented for high value consignments and for goods which are eligible for certain duty or tax reliefs or when further information about the goods is required.</p>

<p>Full information about the customs procedures for postal imports are contained in the Post Office guide, copies of which are available for reference at most main post offices.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span>Imports of personal and household effects</h3>

<p>Standard import declarations are replaced by declarations on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-bringing-belongings-to-uk-from-outside-the-ec-c3">form C3</a> for all personal and household effects imported as freight.</p>

<p>A written declaration is not normally required when these goods are imported in accompanied baggage.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span>Imports of privately owned motor vehicles or pleasure craft</h3>

<p>Standard import declarations are not required for privately owned motor vehicles or pleasure craft accompanied at import by the owner if they are for their personal use. Full details about the special declarations required in these circumstances are contained in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-8-sailing-your-pleasure-craft-to-and-from-the-uk">Notice 8</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3-bringing-your-belongings-pets-and-private-motor-vehicles-to-uk-from-outside-the-eu">Notice 3</a>.</p>

<p>Commercially imported motor vehicles and pleasure craft are subject to normal declaration requirements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.7 </span>Goods imported in a passenger’s baggage</h3>

<p>Commercial importations in a passenger’s accompanied baggage must be declared to customs in the normal way. Procedures relating to merchandise in baggage are described in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-6-merchandise-in-baggage">Notice 6</a>.</p>

<p>A formal written declaration on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/import-and-export-forms#c-series-c513-c1299">form C88</a> is not usually required if the goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a value of less than £800</li>
  <li>are covered by an ATA Carnet</li>
  <li>are re-imported samples covered by the simplified procedures as described in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-236-returned-goods-relief">Notice 236</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.8 </span>ATA Carnets</h3>

<p>An ATA carnet is an international customs document that can be used in place of normal customs documents to temporarily export certain goods for use outside the UK and EU. It can also be used to temporarily import non-UK and non-EU goods for use in the UK/EU.</p>

<p>Full information about the use of ATA carnets can be obtained from Chambers of Commerce or can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-104-ata-and-cpd-carnets">Notice 104</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.9 </span>Customs Clearance Request (<abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr>) form C21</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>The customs clearance request (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-customs-clearance-request-c21">form C21</a>) is only for use at locations with computerised inventory links. The clearance request is required in order to clear inventory records and contains the minimum of information necessary to identify the goods and declare any revenue due.</p>

<h4>Conditions of use</h4>

<p>The C21 is used for inventory clearance purposes when a declaration is not required for <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>. The <abbr title="customs procedure codes">CPCs</abbr> which relate to these situations are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>00 00 010</li>
  <li>00 00 020</li>
  <li>00 00 011</li>
  <li>00 00 040</li>
  <li>00 00 041</li>
  <li>00 00 042</li>
  <li>00 02 090</li>
  <li>00 08 020</li>
  <li>00 09 090</li>
</ul>

<p>Full details of the customs procedures which relate to these <abbr title="customs procedure codes">CPCs</abbr> are contained in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-customs-procedure-codes">customs procedure codes</a>.</p>

<h4>Plain paper option</h4>

<p><abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr> traders may opt to present computer produced plain paper versions of the clearance request. The conditions of use are the same as for the <a class="govuk-link" href="#plainpaperdec">plain paper <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Plain paper forms must be fully completed in the same way as the printed form.</p>

<h4>VAT</h4>

<p>Evidence of VAT paid will normally be issued direct to consignees in the form of a monthly form C79 VAT certificate. To avoid incorrect claims and delays in VAT recovery, it is essential that declarants/consignees <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number details are shown correctly. See Box 8 and Box 14.</p>

<h4>Documents to be presented with the C21</h4>

<p>Items such as commercial invoices, airway bills and packing lists.</p>

<p>If appropriate, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-deferment-of-duty-payment-c1207s">form C1207S</a> where charges are to be deferred under specific authority from the importer.</p>

<p>E2 output-acceptance advice, and if appropriate</p>

<p>E1 output-examination advice.</p>

<p>Preference forms, or UK or EU transit/status forms where appropriate.</p>

<p>Any other documents required under <abbr title="customs procedure code">CPC</abbr> instructions.</p>

<h4>Examination, Amendment and Clearance Procedures</h4>

<p>All of these will follow the same principles that apply to the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Imports to certain regimes</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Customs Warehousing</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<p>This is a UK and  EU customs procedure under which non-UK and non-EU goods may be stored without payment of the Customs Duty and import VAT due.</p>

<p>Type R is a public warehouse authorised for use by warehouse keepers whose main business is the storage of goods deposited by other traders.</p>

<p>Type U is a private warehouse authorised for use by individual traders for the storage of goods. Although the warehouse keeper has to be the same person as the depositor, meaning the person bound by the declaration placing the goods under the warehousing procedure, it is not necessary that they also have to own the goods.</p>

<h4>Entry to customs warehousing procedure</h4>

<p>Goods imported for customs warehousing must be declared to customs in the normal way using the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>. However, goods can be entered to customs warehousing by the simplified declaration procedure and Entry in the Declarant’s Records (<abbr title="Entry in the Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr>) by authorised <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> traders.</p>

<h4>Removal from customs warehousing procedure</h4>

<p>a) Removals from customs warehousing for export to non-UK and non-EU countries must be declared on a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/import-and-export-forms#c-series-c513-c1299">form C88</a>. Read about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-community-and-common-transit-outwards">UK Trade Tariff: community and common transit outwards</a>.</p>

<p>b) For removals from customs warehousing to free circulation and other suspensive procedures, declarations can be made on a form C88 for each individual removal or by using <abbr title="Entry in the Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr>.</p>

<p>Information on valuation for removals from customs warehouse is contained in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-252-valuation-of-imported-goods-for-customs-purposes-vat-and-trade-statistics">Notice 252</a> for Customs Duty and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-702-imports">Notice 702 VAT: Imports and warehoused goods for import VAT</a>.</p>

<h4>Further information</h4>

<p>You can get more information about customs warehousing, including simplified procedures for removals in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code">Notice 3001</a> or from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/customs-international-trade-and-excise-enquiries">Imports and exports: general enquiries helpline</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Excise Warehousing</h3>

<p>Goods liable to Excise Duty and VAT may also be imported for warehousing. Excise warehousing takes place at premises specifically approved for this purpose and, unless the premises are also authorised as a customs warehouse, the goods must be in free circulation before they can enter the warehouse. Goods imported from non-UK and non-EU countries must be declared in the normal way using a <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> before entering an excise warehouse. Goods acquired from EU member states should be covered by an Administrative Accompanying Document (<abbr title="Administrative Accompanying Document">AAD</abbr>).</p>

<p>Goods imported for excise warehousing are not subject to any requirement that they should be re-exported.</p>

<p>When goods are subject to both customs and excise warehousing the procedure for putting them into free circulation (normally a declaration on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/import-and-export-forms#c-series-c513-c1299">form C88</a> is separate from the arrangements for entry into home use (which requires payment of the excise duties and VAT) even though the 2 events may be simultaneous.</p>

<p>Similar rules apply to tobacco products imported into registered or entered excise premises except that the products cannot be simultaneously declared for customs warehousing.</p>

<p>More information  about the procedures for importation  into excise warehouses or into registered or entered excise premises can be found in:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>Temporary Admissions (TA)</h3>

<h4>Goods to be re-exported without alteration</h4>

<p>Relief from customs charges is available for goods which are imported for temporary use in the UK in a wide range of circumstances. The ‘total’ duty reliefs extend to import VAT for goods temporarily imported into the UK. For most goods security will be required for the full amount of duties and import VAT potentially due.</p>

<p>To claim relief an authorisation is required. Application can be made at the time of entry for an authorisation by declaration using the appropriate <abbr title="customs procedure code">CPC</abbr> in the ‘53’ series on a full customs import declaration, this constitutes an application for relief under TA and a formal declaration, that the conditions for the relief claimed are met and will be observed. Prior written application for full authorisation can also be made using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-apply-for-temporary-admission-sp5">form SP5</a>.</p>

<p>If relief has been granted but the goods are subsequently released to home use instead of being re-exported, a diversion entry declaration must be made and any charges paid.</p>

<p>Details of the goods and uses for which relief may be available, the qualifying conditions and the various <abbr title="customs procedure codes">CPCs</abbr> are  in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code">Notice 3001</a>. The <abbr title="customs procedure codes">CPCs</abbr> in the ‘53’ series are listed in the Imports: summary of temporary admission relief customs procedure codes guide in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-customs-procedure-codes">UK Trade Tariff: customs procedure codes</a> section of the Trade Tariff.</p>

<h4>Goods to be re-exported after processing</h4>

<p>Goods may be imported for processing (for example, for use in manufacture in the UK) with relief from customs duties or agricultural levies and eventually re-exported to a non-UK non-EU country. The procedure (which is governed by Council regulation 950/2013) is known as Inward Processing (IP).</p>

<p>IP duty suspension means duty or levy is not paid at the time of import on goods incorporated in products re-exported but is payable if goods are placed to the home market in the UK. Deferment may be used as a method of payment.</p>

<p>Importers using <abbr title="Inward Processing Relief">IPR</abbr> must be authorised.</p>

<p>Further information about these reliefs can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code">Notice 3001</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span>Re-importations</h3>

<p>Goods may be reimported into the UK, after processing outside the UK and EU, with total or partial relief from duty if they were originally exported under Outward Processing Relief (<abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr>) arrangements, and the conditions of that procedure have been met. The rules governing <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> are contained in EEC Council Regulation 950/2013.</p>

<p>For the simplified procedure, official evidence of the original exportation, obtained from customs at the time of export, must be presented with the import declaration. The relief is also available for goods which were originally exported from an EU member state if documentary evidence issued by customs in that EU member state is presented with the import declaration.</p>

<p>The relief is confined to that proportion of the imported goods which was originally exported.</p>

<p>More information about <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code">Notice 3001</a>.</p>

<p>For reimported goods which have not been processed outside the UK and EU, Returned Goods Relief (<abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr>) exists.</p>

<p>Under this procedure, goods exported from the UK and EU may be wholly or partially relieved from import duty (which includes anti-dumping duties and agricultural levies) when they are returned providing this occurs within 3 years of their exportation.</p>

<p>VAT relief is available to registered and unregistered traders reimporting goods in the same state in which they were last exported, subject to the conditions of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-702-imports">Notice 702</a>, paragraph 5.4. There are also special arrangements for reimported works of art. More details about these arrangements can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-718-the-vat-margin-scheme-and-global-accounting">Notice 718</a>.</p>

<p>Full details of the conditions for claiming <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr> can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-236-returned-goods-relief">Notice 236</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Special requirements for certain goods</h2>

<p>There are a number of situations when additional  information to that required for the generality of imports has to be entered on the import declaration. Some of these requirements arise relatively rarely and are described in Notices or other special instructions. In some cases their application is fairly common and these are summarised in this part, which should be read in conjunction with the notes on completion of Box 44, the additional information codes in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-quantity-codes">quantity codes</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-customs-procedure-codes">customs procedure codes</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Common Agricultural Policy (<abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr>) goods</h3>

<p>Agricultural goods imported from non-UK non-EU countries may be liable to Customs Duty and under the <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>countervailing charges</li>
  <li>variable charges (specific element of duty)</li>
  <li>safeguard charges</li>
</ul>

<p>They may also be subject to <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> licensing requirements.</p>

<p>A list of goods subject to the <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> is contained in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-780-common-agricultural-policy-import-procedures-and-special-directions-for-goods">Notice 780</a>. <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> works out all but the most complex <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> charges at the rate applicable at the time of acceptance of the entry.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> is unable to calculate the charges, code VCL as appropriate and the amount(s) payable must be entered in Box 47.</p>

<p>Further details of the special provisions that apply to imports of <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> goods, including the application of <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> licensing are in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-import-prohibitions-and-restrictions">import prohibitions and restrictions</a> and in a series of leaflets and notices published by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/rural-payments-agency">Rural Payments Agency</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>Hydrocarbon oil goods</h3>

<p>When hydrocarbon oil (including chargeable road fuel additives or substitutes liable to Excise Duty) is imported the description of the hydrocarbon oil in Box 31 of the import declaration must be enough to show whether or not it is liable at a reduced or rebated rate of Excise Duty. For additional information on excise classification, reduced and rebated rates of Excise Duty, and chargeable road fuel additives or substitutes, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-excise-duties-reliefs-drawbacks-and-allowances">UK Trade Tariff: excise duties, reliefs, drawbacks and allowances</a>.</p>

<p>If rebate is claimed on imported hydrocarbon oil, or on the chargeable road fuel additives or substitutes the import declaration at manual locations must include in Box 47:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the appropriate ‘rebated rate’ Tax Type code</li>
  <li>the effective (such as rebated) Excise Duty rate</li>
  <li>the actual net charge</li>
</ul>

<p>If the effective rate is NIL this must be shown, and the amount column of Box 47 left blank.</p>

<p>If a conditionally reduced or rebated rate of hydrocarbon oil Excise Duty is being claimed (for example, for unmarked oil imported under a marking waiver), or if hydrocarbon oil goods are being conditionally relieved of Excise Duty (such as ‘tied’ oil), an appropriate coded statement of compliance with the relevant conditions, with any additional plain language information required, must be shown in Box 44 of the import declaration (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-quantity-codes">UK Trade Tariff: quantity codes</a>).</p>

<p>An additional copy of the declaration (copy 6 of the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>), must be provided for tied oil importations. The extra copy must be marked ‘TIED OIL’ in red at the top of the form. Information about tied oil imports is given in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-184a-mineral-oil-put-to-certain-use-excise-duty-relief">Notice No.184A</a>.</p>

<p>The quantity in standard litres (See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-excise-duties-reliefs-drawbacks-and-allowances">UK Trade Tariff: excise duties, reliefs, drawbacks and allowances</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-179-motor-and-heating-fuels-general-information-and-accounting-for-excise-duty-and-vat">Notice 179</a>) must be shown in Box 41 (Supplementary Units).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span>Animals, plants and fur skins</h3>

<p>When animals (other than common, domestic or farm animals), reptiles, birds, plants, fur skins and articles containing fur skin and plumage are imported and these are not covered by a permit or certificate issued under the EU CITES Regulations, the import declaration must include a coded statement in Box 44 (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-quantity-codes">quantity codes</a>) indicating the species being imported or from which the imported goods are derived and stating that they are not subject to restriction under that Act, or those regulations, if that is the case.</p>

<p>Box 44 should also be used to state the presence of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ivory or tortoise-shell incorporated in goods which are not classified in commodity codes 050710, 050790, 960110  or 960190</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span>Containers and pallets</h3>

<p>When containers or pallets are imported with other goods a coded statement must be entered in Box 44. A full list of these codes (additional information codes) can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-quantity-codes">quantity codes</a>. For temporarily imported containers or pallets see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code">Notice 3001</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.5 </span>Supplementary statistical requirements</h3>

<p>Supplementary statistics are compiled about chemicals of a value exceeding £1,000 and falling within Chapters 28 and 29 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff/sections">UK Trade Tariff</a>. For this purpose the precise chemical name and the 5-digit reference Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number shown in the EU Commission’s publication ‘European Customs Inventory of Chemicals’ must be declared in the Packages and Description of Goods box (Box 31) on the entry, or, if the chemical is not listed, the full description of the goods must be declared in the Packages and Descriptions of Goods area (Box 31) on the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.6 </span>Beer</h3>

<p>The Excise Duty on beer imported is assessed on the percentage of alcohol by volume.</p>

<p>The total net weight should be shown in box 38 and the number of litres of beer in Box 41.</p>

<p>The percentage of alcohol by volume is to be declared in the additional information Box 44 using code ‘3Q=’ followed by the percentage figure.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Documents to accompany declarations</h2>

<p>The rules regarding documents in support of <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> declarations are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-760-customs-freight-simplified-procedures">Notice 760</a>. Where declarations are processed as paperless declarations all accompanying documentation specified within this section should be retained for customs audit purposes at the company’s registered premises.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span>Notice of arrival</h3>

<p>When declarations are submitted before the ship, aircraft or vehicle carrying the goods has arrived and an individual notice of arrival is required this must be provided on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-notice-of-arrival-c27">form C27</a>. The form will be stamped with the number of the declaration and returned to the consignee or their declarant. When the ship, aircraft or vehicle arrives at the place where the goods are to be unloaded the declaration on the notice of arrival must be completed and the form re-submitted to customs. If any details on the declaration require amendment, the re-submitted notice of arrival must be accompanied by a request to this effect.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span>Removal note</h3>

<p>Except at locations with computerised inventory links, or when free zone goods which are to remain in the free zone are being declared, a removal note (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-removal-note-c130">form C130</a>) or locally produced removal note must be attached to the declaration. When the goods have been cleared, the removal note will be stamped by customs to indicate that the goods can be removed and the note will be returned to the consignee or their declarant.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span>Commercial invoices and packing lists</h3>

<p>Declarations must normally be accompanied by the commercial invoice for the goods. If a consignee wishes to have this invoice returned to them they must supply an extra copy for retention by customs. The invoice should include a clear description of the goods. If they are described in a foreign language a translation may be required.</p>

<p>When the invoice is made out to a person established in an EU member state and a declaration of value (for example, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-declaration-of-particulars-relating-to-customs-value-c105a">form C105A</a>) is required, an additional copy of the invoice must be provided for certification by customs. This certified copy invoice will then be returned to the consignee so that it can be forwarded to the person to whom the invoice is made out.</p>

<p>Unless details of the contents of individual packages are shown on the invoice, a packing list, weight note or similar advice is usually needed as well. Facsimile copies of the invoice and of other supporting commercial documents are normally accepted.</p>

<p>Find detailed information about the <a class="govuk-link" href="#releasegoodsMCD">acceptance of telexed information, facsimile documents and undertakings to produce documents</a>.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances an extra copy of the commercial invoice is required.</p>

<p>When end-use relief (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code">see Notice 3001</a>) is claimed on used goods and the original invoices are not available, a detailed list with estimated values is acceptable in place of invoices, as long as the detail is enough for the items to be identified.</p>

<p>If clearance of the goods is required urgently and any of the documents described above have not been received or need correction, alternative evidence in the form of telex or similar messages can be submitted instead. Customs will decide whether it is acceptable and whether subsequent confirmation is required.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.4 </span>Value build-up</h3>

<p>At <abbr title="customs input of entries">CIE</abbr> locations where the value build-up facility is used <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-value-build-up-sheet-c89">form C89</a> must be presented with the declaration. When <abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr> is used the information must be input as part of the declaration but printed out separately on the entry acceptance advice. The form contains everything needed to convert the invoice price to the values for duty and other purposes.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#valuebuildup">Find full details about how to use the form</a>.</p>

<p>At manual locations the declarant’s own worksheets must be attached.</p>

<p>If the documentary evidence is not available when the declaration is presented, the goods will usually be released against suitable security, normally a deposit equal to the charges that would be payable if relief were not granted. The deposit will be refunded when the evidence is produced.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.5 </span>Valuation declaration and general valuation statement (<abbr title="general valuation statement">GVS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Importers are no longer required to complete a valuation declaration when the value of the imported goods exceeds the legal threshold limit of £6,500 or hold a signed copy of a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/import-and-export-forms#c-series-c96-c384">C105 form</a> at their registered premises for electronic entry declarations. HMRC will retain the right to request the completion of a valuation declaration at any time, for example in respect of import declarations examined by our officers on a post importation audit.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.6 </span>Documents supporting application for relief</h3>

<p>When relief from duty is claimed, the declaration must be supported by either documentary evidence to show that the conditions of the relief are met and/or an undertaking that they will be met, depending on the nature of the relief appropriate. Further details of such reliefs are given in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-export-prohibitions-and-restrictions">export prohibitions and restrictions</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.7 </span>Documents supporting declarations for goods claimed to be in free circulation or claims to preferential rates of duty and/or tariff quota reliefs</h3>

<p>When goods are claimed to be in free circulation or a claim to a preferential rate of duty is made, the declaration must normally be supported by the appropriate documentary evidence.</p>

<p>Information about reduced or nil rates of duty available under EU preferential trade arrangements is in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">the UK Trade Tariff</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-preferential-trade-arrangements-for-countries-outside-the-eu">UK Trade Tariff: trade arrangements for countries outside the UK and EU</a>.</p>

<p>Information about tariff quota reliefs is in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">the UK Trade Tariff</a> and tariff quotas and ceilings.</p>

<p>Further guidance about procedures for making claims on declarations for imported goods is  in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-826-tariff-preferences-imports">Notice 826</a> (for UK and EU preferential treatment) and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-375-tariff-quotas">Notice 375</a> (for tariff quota reliefs).</p>

<p>Claims for Turkish preference must be supported by the appropriate movement certificate (ATR). Further information on claiming preferential treatment for Turkish goods is  in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-812-european-community-preferences-trade-with-turkey">Notice 812</a>.</p>

<p>If supporting documents are not available when the declaration is presented, the claim should still be made using the appropriate rate code in Box 47 and document identifier code in Box 44. Where appropriate, any serial number for tariff quota relief should be entered in Box 39. The claim will normally be accepted provisionally and the goods will be released against suitable security, normally a guarantee or a deposit equal to the duty that would be payable if the claim were not granted. The guarantee will be discharged or the deposit refunded when the evidence is produced, provided duty at the full rate has not been re-imposed or any applicable tariff quota has not exhausted.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.8 </span>Import licences, permits and certificates</h3>

<p>If the goods require a UK, EU or individual import licence, permit or certificate for their importation, the document, other than an open individual licence, must be attached to the declaration or declared either as being with the goods or the reason for its non-availability explained in Box 44.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.9 </span>Assembly of supporting documents</h3>

<p>The processing of declarations will be made easier if, as far as possible, the documents are assembled (when they are required), by pinning rather than stapling, in the following order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>notice of arrival (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-notice-of-arrival-c27">form C27</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>removal note (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-removal-note-c130">form C130</a>)</li>
  <li>original copy (6) of the declaration</li>
  <li>value build-up sheet (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-value-build-up-sheet-c89">form C89</a>)</li>
  <li>bulk entry details (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-bulk-importer-details-c515">form C515</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-bulk-exporter-details-c515a">form C515A continuation</a>) or (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-registered-consignee-details-c516">forms C516 and C516A continuation</a>)</li>
  <li>supporting documents, for example CT documents, preference certificates and invoices</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-declaration-of-particulars-relating-to-customs-value-c105a">form C105A</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-declaration-of-particulars-relating-to-customs-value-methods-other-than-method-1-c105b">form C105B</a>
</li>
  <li>statistical copy (7) of the declaration (manual locations only)</li>
  <li>additional copy of the declaration when required, for example <abbr title="customs procedure code">CPC</abbr> 71 00 000, 730000</li>
  <li>consignee’s  copy (8) of the declaration (VAT copy if required)</li>
  <li>declarant’s  copy if required</li>
</ul>

<p>Any continuation sheets are to be positioned with the original, statistical or other copies of the declaration.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.10 </span>Consignee’s/declarant’s request for return of documents</h3>

<p>Consignees or declarants who wish to have certain documents supporting the declaration returned to them must complete form C1394.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.11 </span>Acceptance of telexed information, facsimile documents and undertakings to produce documents</h3>

<p>The table at the end of this section explains when telexed information or facsimile copies (including documents produced by other electronic means) are normally acceptable in support of declarations and when an undertaking to produce documents may be given.</p>

<p>The acceptance of these documents and undertakings is a concession which may be withdrawn from anyone who does not comply with the conditions specified here or by the local customs.</p>

<p>The concession which allows belated production of a valuation declaration is limited to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-declaration-of-particulars-relating-to-customs-value-c105a">form C105A</a> (item 2 of the table) and is granted only if customs are satisfied that urgent clearance is essential. It may well be preferable to use a general valuation statement.</p>

<p>The examples given in the table are for guidance and are not necessarily exhaustive. For certain types of importation, original documents must be produced with the declaration. Information about documents not referred to in the table can be obtained from the customs office where the declaration is to be presented.</p>

<p>Entitlement to a preferential rate of duty is established only if the original document or proof of origin is declared on the declaration and is in the declarant’s possession and at customs disposal. If this rate ceases to apply before the original document is produced, the non-preferential rate of duty must be paid.</p>

<p>When subsequent production of an original document is required, security may have to be in the form of a deposit, although in most cases security is acceptable in the form of an individual undertaking or guarantee. Details of the types of security acceptable in particular circumstances and the time limits for production of the original document are shown in the table.</p>

<p>When consignees or declarants wish to obtain release of goods pending production of evidence of entitlement to preference by paying the preferential rate of duty outright and securing the balance by cashless security, the guidelines in paragraph 3.8.15 should be followed.</p>

<p>In all cases customs reserve the right to require production of the original document when the declaration is presented, or before the goods are cleared or after clearance has been given.</p>

<p>Supporting documents which were not available when the declaration was submitted to customs have to be produced subsequently. They must be presented within 14 days (unless the following table indicates otherwise) at the place where the declaration was originally presented.</p>

<p>Please note that for goods imported through London airports, this post clearance aspect is controlled at Dover and documents should be sent to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

London Airport (LAP) Correspondence
<br>HM Revenue and Customs

<p>However, when security is controlled by Lytham Sub Office, the documents must be sent, quoting the number of the declaration, to:</p>

<p>Release of goods can be obtained by paying the undisputed charges outright and securing the balance by a cash or cashless security.</p>

<p>Enter more than one line for the same tax type in Box 47 of the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> to do this. The first tax line should show details for the undisputed amount using the appropriate tax type, and the appropriate Method of Payment (<abbr title="Method of Payment">MOP</abbr>)Code , if required, in column 47e.</p>

<p>The second tax line should show the details for the amount to be secured, using the appropriate tax type and in column 47e the <abbr title="Method of Payment">MOP</abbr> indicating the form of security.</p>

<p>The following examples demonstrate the additional information required to be input on the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>.</p>

<h4>A preferential rate of Customs Duty has been claimed but the preference document is not available and no facsimile produced</h4>

<p>The following information will be required on the entry:</p>

<p>Box 44 - additional information</p>

<p>DT - Document Identifier</p>

<p>First character (Document Type) must have ‘C’ input. Second character (document status) must have ‘1’ input.</p>

<p>Box 47 - calculation of taxes</p>

<p>The amount to be secured is the difference between the full rate and the preferential rate.</p>

<p>i) The preferential rate claimed is positive:</p>

<p>The first Customs Duty tax line should show the charges due using the preferential rate code, for example G and <abbr title="Method of Payment">MOP</abbr> Code A, D or F as applicable. The second Customs Duty tax line should show the amount to be secured using the full rate code, such as F and the appropriate security <abbr title="Method of Payment">MOP</abbr> Code.</p>

<p>ii)  The preferential rate claimed is zero:</p>

<p>In addition to completing column 47a, the first Customs Duty tax line should show the appropriate preferential rate code in column 47c; all other columns should be left blank.</p>

<p>The second Customs Duty tax line should show the amount to be secured using the full rate code, such as F and the appropriate security <abbr title="Method of Payment">MOP</abbr> Code.</p>

<h4>A claim is made to a critical tariff quota and the quota rate claimed is a zero rate of duty.</h4>

<p>Box 44 – additional information</p>

<p>DT – Document Identifier</p>

<p>First character (Document Type) ‘C’ or ‘L’ to be input as appropriate.</p>

<p>Second character (Document Status) ‘2’, ‘3’, ‘5’ or ‘6’ as appropriate.</p>

<p>Box 47 – calculation of taxes</p>

<p>The amount to be secured is the full rate.</p>

<p>In addition to completing column 47a, the first Customs Duty tax line should show the appropriate quota rate Code in column 47c, all other columns should be left blank.</p>

<p>The second Customs Duty tax line should show the amount to be secured using the full rate code, such as F and the appropriate security <abbr title="Method of Payment">MOP</abbr> Code.</p>

<h4>An entry is made but there is a classification dispute.</h4>

<p>The amount to be secured will be the difference between the 2 possible duty rates. The following information will be required on the entry:</p>

<p>Box 33 – commodity code</p>

<p>This should show the commodity code attracting the higher duty rate.</p>

<p>Box 44 – additional information</p>

<p>IR – Item Request Identifier must have ‘H’ input.</p>

<p>RS – Reason for Security must have ‘2M’ input.</p>

<p>The additional information miscellaneous text should include details of the commodity code attracting the lower duty rate together with any appropriate customs reference.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Non-availability of computer systems: fallback</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.1 </span>Introduction</h3>

<p>For a variety of reasons there may be occasions where the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> computer and/or the local computerised inventory control system is not available. The procedures which will be introduced in these circumstances are known as ‘fallback’.</p>

<p>Fallback procedures may involve manual processing of declarations and/or other documents by customs. To assist this processing, declarations and related forms may need to be completed differently, and/or other forms may need completing – see below for details.</p>

<p>If the local computerised inventory control system is not available special procedures will apply. Even if the inventory system is available, the operation of these general instructions might cause certain problems with recovery which require the operation of a modified procedure. As local system differ from place to place these special procedures will be notified by the collector.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.2 </span>Accounting procedures</h3>

<p>When the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> computer system is not available, all locations (such as <abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr>, <abbr title="customs input of entries">CIE</abbr> and Manual) may be affected and revised accounting procedures may have to be introduced. This may affect entry processing procedures and the production and distribution of, for example, <abbr title="Flexible Accounting System">FAS</abbr> and deferment statements. If revised accounting procedures have to be introduced, instructions will be issued to affected traders by the collector.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.3 </span>Notice to traders</h3>

<p>Notice that the computerised entry processing system (<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>) is not available and that fallback procedures are to be introduced will be given to traders in each locality by the collector, in association with the local computer system operator. Notification of restoration of the system and the ending of fallback procedures will similarly be given.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.4 </span>Types of fallback procedures</h3>

<p>There are 2 types of fallback procedures, short term (when the system isn’t available for up to 24 hours), and long term (when the system isn’t available for over 24 hours). Short term procedures allow for the manual clearance of goods during fallback but require that the declaration information is later keyed into the computer system. Long term procedures don’t require the declaration information to be keyed in.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.5 </span>Entry forms</h3>

<p>When short term fallback procedures are introduced entry forms should still be completed in the normal way. <abbr title="customs input of entries">CIE</abbr> and Manual procedures are not affected by short term fallback procedures.</p>

<p>When long term fallback procedures are introduced, declarations are to be completed as if they were being presented at a manual location and modified as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all declarations and copy declarations presented to customs are to be marked in red in the top right hand corner
‘FALLBACK’</li>
  <li>at inventory linked locations all declarations are to be accompanied by a manual removal note (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-removal-note-c130">form C130</a> or similar locally approved form)</li>
  <li>form C21 should not be used – if revenue charges are found to be due on consignments for which a clearance request would normally be lodged, the examining officer will issue form C102A, in triplicate to the paying agent, payment is to be made to the appropriate cashier who will return 2 copies of the form C102A to the paying agent</li>
</ul>

<p>These must then be presented to the examining officer to obtain clearance of the goods.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> Imports</h4>

<p>Electronic and paper <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> licence details should be included on the declaration, in Box 44. Copies of paper licences must also be sent to the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> for stamping.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> will return this copy which must be presented along with the original to your nearest office for the stamp to be transferred.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.6 </span>
<abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr> fallback committee</h3>

<p>In long established <abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr> locations it has been found that the creation of a fallback committee is useful for the smooth introduction to, and recovery from, fallback procedures.</p>

<p>The committee is made up of representatives from the local systems operator, customs and other trade bodies. It advises and takes decisions on all matters relating to fallback. Ideally, the decision making group should be quite small but should not stop wider representation to plan procedures for implementation and dissemination of information. The committee will need contact points in all companies represented so that decisions may be communicated with the greatest speed and certainty.</p>

<p>Any special arrangements relating to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> would be separately notified to the local trading UK or EU by the collector.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.7 </span>
<abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr> Categories of fallback</h3>

<p>The committee may well decide to categorise declarations according to the anticipated length of the break in service, and issue instructions in advance for each category. A possible breakdown into categories is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>break in service of less than 1 hour</li>
  <li>break in service of 1 to 24 hours (short term fallback)</li>
  <li>break in service of more than 24 hours anticipated (long term fallback)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.8 </span>
<abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr> system unavailable for less than 1 hour, or limited in availability</h3>

<p>Usually fallback procedures will not need to be introduced. Traders should apply to the appropriate customs office for clearance of consignments of special urgency.</p>

<p>Occasionally an interruption to the system may occur for a short time only during peak hours of working, not requiring fallback procedures to be adopted. During such times a one-line broadcast will be sent to the system, such as ‘system in recovery – please make essential inputs only’.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.9 </span>
<abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr> Short term fallback procedures</h3>

<h4>Entry forms and clearance requests (Including plain paper versions)</h4>

<p>The declaration or clearance request is to be prepared in the normal manner. The form, accompanied by a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-chief-direct-trader-input-short-term-fallback-c1402-f">form C1402 (F)</a> Copy 1 and a manual removal note (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-removal-note-c130">form C130</a> or similar local form), is to be lodged at the usual customs office with the normal supporting documents. A duplicate of the entry or clearance request, and form C1402 (F) Copy 2 is to be retained by the agent.</p>

<p>If release of the goods is required and charges are payable, form C1402 (F) Copy 1 should be noted with the type of security being offered – for example deferment, bond, guarantee, deposit. Acceptance of this security is subject to the collector’s approval.</p>

<p>On resumption of service the charges due will be collected in the normal way and the security offered will (where appropriate) be cancelled or refunded.</p>

<h4>Recovery</h4>

<p>As soon as practicable after the system recovers, the information  contained on the duplicate declaration or customs clearance request is to be input to the system in the normal manner. If the original declaration has been amended, the amended version must be input. If the declaration is not accepted by the computer, any necessary amendments are to be made and a form C20X (obtained from the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr>) completed, listing the amendments.</p>

<p>When the declaration is accepted, the output E2 (and E1 if produced) is to be attached to the form C1402 (F) Copy 2. The declaration is to be signed and the form lodged with any forms C20X (obtained from the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr>) within the agent’s normal time out period.</p>

<h4>Changes to rate of exchange or rates of charges</h4>

<p>The rate of exchange and the rates of any charges payable are those current at the time of acceptance of the paper declaration by customs. If, between the lodging of the paper declaration and the subsequent inputting  of the details from the duplicate declaration, there have been changes which affect any charges on the declaration, the charges obtaining at the time of lodging the paper declaration must be calculated and shown in Box 47 of the declaration. A form C20X (obtained from the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr>) should be completed showing these amendments and submitted with the form C1402 (F) Copy 2.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.10 </span>
<abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr> long term fallback procedures</h3>

<h4>Declarations and clearance requests (Including plain paper versions)</h4>

<p>Form C21 should not to be used. Declarations are to be completed as if they were being presented at manual locations – see <a class="govuk-link" href="#entryforms">entry forms</a>.</p>

<h4>Presentation of declarations</h4>

<p>Declarations are to be presented to the appropriate customs office accompanied by a manual removal note (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-removal-note-c130">form C130</a> or similar locally approved form). Local instructions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>will detail how and where the forms are to be presented</li>
  <li>may require that the declarations be listed on local schedules before presentation</li>
  <li>will explain how traders will be advised of route selection and declarations numbers</li>
</ul>

<h4>Recovery</h4>

<p>After restoration of the system, fallback procedures will continue at inventory linked EPUs for consignments that were received when the system was not available. After a period, which the local fallback committee will specify at the time, transit shed operators will be required to input details of consignments received during the period of failure and for which a declaration has not been made. The use of fallback procedures for declarations will then cease.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.11 </span>
<abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr> queries and amendments</h3>

<p>Form C20X (obtained from the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr>) will be used for the notification of queries and amendments.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.12 </span>
<abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr> Clearance</h3>

<p>Clearance will be notified by the issue of the manual removal note.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.13 </span>
<abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr> uncleared declarations input when the system was available</h3>

<p>If clearance is required for uncleared declarations input when the system was available a manual removal note (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-removal-note-c130">form C130</a> or similar locally approved form) stating the declaration number, date and route, is to be presented to the place where the declaration was originally lodged.</p>

<abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> Interim <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Import Fallback Arrangements</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.1 </span>Introduction</h3>

<p>This information forms the basis of how the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> will deal with <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> outages for Imports. It is considered a short term solution in the absence of agreed National Fallback arrangements.</p>

<p>This will not cover every eventuality and the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> roster duty manager, with <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> senior management, will still have the authority to deal with any situation that arises in the most appropriate manner.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.2 </span>Timescales</h3>

<p>All of the procedures listed refer to short term fallback only and will allow for the manual processing of goods during <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> downtime.</p>

<p>Short Term Fallback is for outages of up to 4 hours only. Any system disruption that continues for over 4 hours will require further detailed arrangements.</p>

<p>Long term fallback requires Grade 7 approval or above, and the decision to invoke this will be made by either an <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> or ECSM Senior Manager.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.3 </span>Imports Short Term Fallback</h3>

<p>For the first 4 hours of any outage the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> will only clear entries as follows:</p>

<p>Under 1 hour – on presentation of entry paperwork or a completed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-chief-direct-trader-input-short-term-fallback-c1402-f">form C1402 fallback request</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-removal-note-c130">form C130</a> manual release note, manual C88 and supporting docs, clearance will be given to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>life or death consignments only</li>
  <li>serum</li>
  <li>transplant tissue</li>
  <li>medical radioactive for hospitals, pacemakers</li>
</ul>

<p>Between 2-4 hours  – on presentation of entry paperwork or a completed C1402 fallback request, C130 manual release note, manual C88 and supporting documents, clearance will also be given to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>live animals</li>
  <li>human remains</li>
  <li>urgent medical supplies on dry ice</li>
  <li>dangerous goods</li>
  <li>firearms</li>
  <li>explosives on key side</li>
  <li>extremely high value goods (for example, artwork)</li>
  <li>perishable goods</li>
  <li>aircraft on ground</li>
</ul>

<p>For the port of Dover only – after 1 hour the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> will liaise with <abbr title="UK Border Agency">UKBA</abbr> and put in place a local fallback arrangement which <abbr title="UK Border Agency">UKBA</abbr> will manage.</p>

<p>After 4 hours, and with the agreement of the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> senior managers, the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> will continue to require presentation of paperwork for the above categories but all other consignments will be allowed to be cleared.</p>

<p>These would effectively be route 6s and importers/agents will have to guarantee to submit all paperwork once the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Service is restored.</p>

<p>All of the above may be a challenge for the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> to achieve and if work volumes became a problem, then priority will continue to be given to the above categories of goods and airfreight traffic.</p>
