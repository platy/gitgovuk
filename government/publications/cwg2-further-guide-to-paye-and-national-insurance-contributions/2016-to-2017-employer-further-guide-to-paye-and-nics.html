<p>You can use this guide from 6 April 2017.</p>

<p>Use the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Index">index</a> to find out about a specific subject.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<h4>Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>)</h4>

<p>The following guidance applies to all employers. Guidance for reporting <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/topic/business-tax/paye">Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>)</a> in real time is also available.</p>

<h3>About this guide</h3>

<p>Welcome to the Employer Further Guide to <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and National Insurance contributions (<abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>) for the tax year 2017 to 2018. This edition replaces the CWG2 (2016).</p>

<p>All examples in this guide show tax calculated using the tax tables, not the new Scottish rate tables – remember you must use the Scottish rate tables for an employee with a prefix S code.</p>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/topic/business-tax/paye"><abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and paying <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr></a>, for more information about the day-to-day tasks in operation.</p>

<p>This guidance gives more detailed information and covers some less common situations.</p>

<p>You may be asked to produce evidence of how you’ve worked out <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>. It’s important that you keep your records either in paper form or on a computer. In either case, these records must be made available to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> on request.</p>

<p>There are legal requirements that mean employers must comply with their obligations. At the time of writing, this guidance sets out <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s view on how these legal requirements can be met.</p>

<p>It will be updated annually and was last updated December 2016.</p>

<p>The operation of <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> is based on the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2003/2682/contents/made" rel="external">Income Tax (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) Regulations 2003</a> and the payment of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> is based on the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992</li>
  <li>Social Security Administration Act 1992</li>
  <li>Social Security (Contributions) Regulations 2001, as amended</li>
  <li>Social Security (Categorisation of Earners) Regulations 1978, as amended</li>
</ul>

<h4>If you’re unhappy with our service</h4>

<p>If you’re unhappy with our service, usually a phone call to the person or office you’ve been dealing with will allow us to put things right quickly. Their number will be on any papers they’ve sent.</p>

<p>However, if you’re still unhappy, or you would like to deal with someone else, then you may want to complain. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/complain-to-hm-revenue-and-customs">Complain to HM Revenue and Customs</a> or contact the Complaints Manager at the office you’ve been dealing with.</p>

<h3>Terms used in this guide</h3>

<h4>Gross pay</h4>

<p>The amount the employee is due to receive before any deductions are made. What counts as gross pay for <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes is defined in more detail in <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec5">Section 5</a>.</p>

<h4>Income Tax year (tax year)</h4>

<p>A tax year is a period starting on 6 April in one year and ending on 5 April in the following year. For example, the 2017 to 2018 tax year starts on 6 April 2017 and ends on 5 April 2018.</p>

<h4>Income Tax weeks (tax weeks)</h4>

<p>Tax weeks are periods of 7 days which follow on from each other starting on 6 April each year. The first tax week is 6 to 12 April inclusive, the second tax week is 13 to 19 April inclusive, and so on.</p>

<p>The odd day or days at the end of the last complete tax week in the year, (5 April or in leap years, 4 and 5 April) are treated as a whole tax week, which is tax week 53.</p>

<h4>Income Tax months (tax months)</h4>

<p>Income Tax months are periods following on from each other in an Income Tax year. They start on the 6th of one month and finish on the 5th of the following month. The first Income Tax month is 6 April to 5 May inclusive, the second Income Tax month is 6 May to 5 June inclusive, and so on.</p>

<p>For details of relevant dates within a tax year, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/running-payroll/paying-hmrc">Running payroll</a>.</p>

<h4>Pay interval</h4>

<p>The period of time between one payment and the next. Pay intervals can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘regular’, that is every week, month and so on</li>
  <li>‘irregular’, that is with no fixed period of time between – for example, an employee is paid after working for 10 days, then again after a further 25 days and again after a further 40 days</li>
</ul>

<h4>Payroll record</h4>

<p>A payroll record shows <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and NIC deductions for each of your employees. It’s important that you keep payroll records, either in paper form or on a computer.</p>

<h4>Recorded gender</h4>

<p>This refers to the gender which a transgender person was registered with at birth.</p>

<h4>Acquired gender</h4>

<p>This refers to the gender which a transgender person presents to the world, it’s not the gender that they were registered with at birth.</p>

<h4>Full Gender Recognition Certificate (<abbr title="Gender Recognition Certificate">GRC</abbr>)</h4>

<p>A certificate issued by the Gender Recognition Panel, that shows a person has satisfied the criteria for legal recognition in their acquired gender. From the date of issue the person is recognised in their acquired gender and will benefit from any rights and responsibilities that are associated with that acquired gender.</p>

<h4>Interim <abbr title="Gender Recognition Certificate">GRC</abbr>
</h4>

<p>A certificate issued by the Gender Recognition Panel that shows a person has met the criteria to be recognised in their acquired gender subject to them annulling their marriage. A full <abbr title="Gender Recognition Certificate">GRC</abbr> will be issued following the annulment of the marriage.</p>

<h4>Transgender female</h4>

<p>A person who at birth was recorded as male but chooses to live as a female, should be referred to in female terms (‘she’, ‘her’, ‘Ms’).</p>

<h4>Transgender male</h4>

<p>A person who at birth was recorded as female but chooses to live as a male, should be referred to in male terms (‘he’, ‘him’, ‘Mr’).</p>

<h3>Online filing</h3>

<p>There are a wide range of <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> notices, forms and returns that can be sent and received online.</p>

<p>Online filing is a fast, convenient and secure way of exchanging information with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. It cuts down on time, administration and errors, and it means that you’ll get up to date <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> information, such as updated employee tax codes much faster.</p>

<p>As part of operating <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>, almost all employers must report their payroll information online using a Full Payment Submission (<abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>) for each pay period.</p>

<p>There are, however, a small number of employers who may be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>exempt from submitting this information online</li>
  <li>unable due to exceptional circumstances to submit information online</li>
</ul>

<p>There are very few exceptions. For more information about the exceptions, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-out-which-employers-are-exempt-from-online-payroll-reporting">Find out which employers are exempt from online payroll reporting</a>.</p>

<p>For more information about online filing and sending starter and leaver information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/paye-online"><abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Online for employers</a>.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Online – your filing options</h4>

<p>You report your payroll information by submitting an <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> and an Employer Payment Summary (<abbr title="Employer Payment Summaries">EPS</abbr>). You also use an <abbr title="Employer Payment Summaries">EPS</abbr> to tell <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> if you haven’t paid any employees in a pay period and have no return to make. These submissions and other returns and reports are sent electronically by your payroll system to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>You can send forms and returns online using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/paye-online"><abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Online for employers</a> internet service, choosing either
    <ul>
      <li>our free ‘Online Return and Forms – <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>’ product (this is designed for small employers who have up to and including 49 employees and don’t send large numbers of forms to us)</li>
      <li>third party (commercial) payroll software</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Electronic Data Interchange (<abbr title="Electronic Data Interchange">EDI</abbr>) – more suitable for large employers who typically have employee numbers in the thousands and/or a very high staff turnover</li>
  <li>an agent or payroll bureau who can file online on your behalf, using our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/payecis-for-agents-online-service"><abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Online for Agents service</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Online – Expenses and Benefits</h4>

<p>In addition to the above filing options, we provide a service that allows you to send your expenses and benefits information electronically, if your software doesn’t do this automatically.</p>

<p>For more information on completing your expenses and benefits forms, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits">Expenses and benefits for employers</a>.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Online – Direct Debit payment</h4>

<p>When you enrol for the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Online for Employers service, you’re given instant access to the Direct Debit Online service. This allows you to set up a Direct Debit Instruction which you can use to pay your monthly or quarterly <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> payments.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> General Procedures</h2>

<p>The following guidance applies to all employers. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/topic/business-tax/paye"><abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr></a> for guidance on reporting <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> in real time.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1Who </span> is an ‘employee’ for the purposes of <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>?</h3>

<p>In this guide, ‘employee’ means anyone who is gainfully employed in the UK and is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>engaged under a ‘contract of service’, where you pay somebody to work for you, that arrangement will normally amount to either, a contract of service (employment) or a contract for services (self-employment), almost everyone who works for an employer will be employed under a contract of service, including full-time, part-time, casual or temporary employment, a contract need not be written, but can be a verbal or implied working agreement</li>
  <li>an office holder with earnings chargeable to tax, an office holder is someone appointed to hold a titled office (including an elective office), for example, a company director</li>
  <li>engaged through an agency or some other third party – for more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para42">paragraph 4.2</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>In addition, ‘employee’ includes, for most <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes, pension recipients and others who get <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> income (for example, ex-employees).</p>

<p>Similarly ‘employer’ includes, for most <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes, agencies, pension-payers and others who make payments of <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> income.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>In addition to the above, if certain conditions are met, a person in any of the following occupations is treated as being an employee. The conditions are set out in the Social Security (Categorisation of Earners) Regulations 1978, as amended. The occupations are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>office cleaners</li>
  <li>ministers of religion</li>
  <li>people employed by their husband or wife or civil partner for the purpose of his or her employment</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re not sure if someone is an ‘employee’ or if you’re an ‘employer’ for <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> or <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/employment-status-indicator">Employment Status Indicator</a> and use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hmrc-tools-and-calculators"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> calculators and tools</a>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2National </span> Insurance numbers</h3>

<h4>1.2.1 What is a National Insurance number?</h4>

<p>A National Insurance number is the unique reference number used by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to identify an individual’s <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> record. It ensures that contributions paid by, and credited to, an individual are put on the right record so that whenever a claim to benefit is made, the correct amount can be paid.</p>

<p>You’re required to record an employee’s National Insurance number on payroll records. It’s important, therefore, that you ask employees for their National Insurance number as soon as possible after they start working for you.</p>

<p>Your employees are required by law to give their National Insurance number to you, although they can start work before providing the number.</p>

<p>For each employee, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>record their date of birth, gender and address including postcode</li>
  <li>arrange for them to let you know of any change of name, gender and/or address</li>
</ul>

<p>Your employee remains accountable for their own records but receiving this information from you’ll help <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> keep records up to date.</p>

<h4>Temporary National Insurance numbers</h4>

<p>We don’t accept temporary National Insurance numbers on Employer Returns. In all cases you should try to get the National Insurance number (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para124">paragraph 1.2.4</a>) and enter it on your payroll record.</p>

<p>If you’re unable to get the National Insurance number you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>leave the National Insurance number field blank</li>
  <li>enter the date of birth and gender</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.2.2 When the National Insurance number used by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> differs from the one you already hold</h4>

<p>If the National Insurance number used by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> for an employee differs from the one you already hold, use the National Insurance number given to you by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. If your employee disputes this is the correct National Insurance number advise them to contact <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<h4>1.2.3 National Insurance number and identity</h4>

<p>The National Insurance number card should not be accepted by anyone as proof of identity.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> can issue written confirmation to a person who requests a reminder of their National Insurance number. If your new employee doesn’t know their National Insurance number and you haven’t yet included them on an <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>, you should ask them if they’ve an old payslip or form P60, you’ll usually be able to find it there.</p>

<p>If you can’t get a National Insurance number from a new employee, you must still send their details on the first <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> that includes a payment to them, but you must leave the National Insurance number field blank for that employee. You mustn’t use an incorrect or ‘dummy’ National Insurance number.</p>

<p>When you submit the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will try to match the employee’s details to their National Insurance number, and where <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> are able to match the employee’s National Insurance number with the details you provided, you’ll get a message through the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> submission route telling you the correct National Insurance number.</p>

<p>If you don’t receive a message from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> telling you the correct National Insurance number, continue to leave the National Insurance number field blank for that employee until notified.</p>

<p>The fact that a person has a National Insurance number doesn’t mean that the person has the right to work or live in the UK. It’s not a passport to employment.</p>

<p>For more information on a person’s right to work in the UK, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employers-checks-job-applicants">Checks employers can make on job applicants</a> or phone the Home Office on 0300 123 4699.</p>

<h4>1.2.4 How to get an employee’s National Insurance number</h4>

<p>To find out how to get an employee’s National Insurance number, or if you want to check an employee’s National Insurance number before including it on the employee’s payroll record, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/topic/business-tax/paye"><abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3When </span> to work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>
</h3>

<p>As a general rule, both <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> are operated when a payment of earnings is made to an employee.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>If the employee isn’t a director, operate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> on the earlier of when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you actually make the payment</li>
  <li>the employee is entitled to be paid, even if the pay isn’t drawn until later</li>
</ul>

<p>If the employee is a director, operate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> on the earlier of when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you actually make the payment</li>
  <li>the director becomes entitled to be paid</li>
  <li>the payment is credited in the company accounts or records, even if the
    <ul>
      <li>director can’t draw the money straightaway because there’s a block on the right to payment</li>
      <li>credit isn’t specifically in an account in the director’s name</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the remuneration is fixed or determined, if the amount
    <ul>
      <li>for a particular accounting period is determined before the end of that period, take the date as being when the period ends</li>
      <li>is determined after the period ends, take the date as being when the amount is determined</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>The point of payment is that at which the earnings are placed unreservedly at the disposal of the employee. If the employee is a director, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ca44-national-insurance-for-company-directors">CA44: National Insurance for company directors</a>.</p>

<p>You can seek advice on what to do for <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes by phoning the <a class="govuk-link" href="#emphelp">Employer Helpline</a>.</p>

<h4>Late notification of marginal items of pay</h4>

<p>Occasionally, payroll sections don’t get to know about certain marginal items of pay, for example, expenses, until some time after they’ve been paid or treated as paid. So they include the item in a later earnings period because it’s time-consuming to have to revisit the correct earnings period and recalculate the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will allow you to use a later earnings period when calculating the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due, even on the rare occasions when such payments are notified late and the most convenient earnings period falls within the next tax year. But the marginal item of pay must be included in the gross pay for the purposes of calculating <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> without any undue delay.</p>

<p>Marginal items of pay included in a later earnings period don’t have to be reported to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> when paid. They should be reported when they’re included in the later earnings period at the time that the earnings paid in that later period are paid.</p>

<p>You must allocate marginal items of pay to the correct earnings period and recalculate the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> where the deferred calculation may have a material effect on an individual’s benefit entitlement. For example, where an employee earns around the Lower Earnings Limit (<abbr title="Lower Earnings Limit">LEL</abbr>).</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will also ask you to include the marginal item of pay in the correct earnings period and recalculate the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due where it appears that you’re deferring the calculation to avoid or reduce <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you must allocate the marginal item of pay to the correct earnings period and recalculate the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, you’ll need to ensure that the year to date National Insurance information submitted on a <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> reflects the correct values.
‘Marginal items of pay’ don’t include amounts paid, or treated as paid, by way of securities, for example, shares or share options.</p>

<p>If an item of pay isn’t marginal and your payroll section doesn’t find out about the item in time to include it in the correct earnings period, the pay records must be adjusted to allocate the item to the correct earnings period.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4National </span> Insurance contributions (<abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>)</h3>

<h4>Abolition of Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> contracted out rebate</h4>

<p>From April 2016 the primary and secondary Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> contracted-out rebate is no longer available due to the abolition of contracting out for Defined Benefit schemes, known as Contracted Out Salary Related (<abbr title="Contracted Out Salary Related">COSR</abbr>) schemes.</p>

<h4>Abolition of Secondary <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> for those employees under the age of 21</h4>

<p>From April 2015 the rate of employer’s (secondary) Class 1 contributions is 0% for employees under the age of 21 whose earnings are up to the Upper Secondary Threshold (<abbr title="Upper Secondary Threshold">UST</abbr>). Earnings above the <abbr title="Upper Secondary Threshold">UST</abbr> are charged at the normal rate of Secondary Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Employee’s (primary) contributions aren’t affected. Employer’s contributions continue to be payable at the usual rate on earnings above the <abbr title="Upper Secondary Threshold">UST</abbr>. Employers should ensure they hold the employee’s correct date of birth.</p>

<p>For more information read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para385">paragraph 3.8.5</a>.</p>

<h4>Abolition of Secondary <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> for Apprentices under the age of 25</h4>

<p>The rate of employer’s (secondary) Class 1 contributions is 0% for apprentices under the age of 25 up to the Apprentice Upper Secondary Threshold (<abbr title="Apprentice Upper Secondary Threshold">AUST</abbr>).</p>

<p>Employee’s (primary) contributions aren’t affected. Employer’s (secondary) contributions continue to be payable at the usual rate on earnings above the <abbr title="Apprentice Upper Secondary Threshold">AUST</abbr>.</p>

<p>Employers should ensure they hold the apprentice’s correct date of birth. The apprentice will need to be following a government recognised apprenticeship in the UK for the 0% rate to apply – that is those which follow government arrangements or approved frameworks, and have a written agreement, specifying the government recognised apprentice framework/standard, with a start and expected completion date.</p>

<p>This will be an agreement, between the training provider, apprentice and employer. It will be the evidence the employer needs to retain when applying the zero-rate of employer Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> for an apprentice under 25.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5Employment </span> Allowance</h3>

<p>The £3,000 Employment Allowance for businesses, charities and Community Amateur Sports Clubs may be offset against their employer Class 1 secondary <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>. Businesses, charities, certain individuals employing care and support workers and Community Amateur Sports Clubs may claim the Employment Allowance if the earnings they pay give rise to a secondary Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> liability.</p>

<p>Service companies have limited eligibility for Employment Allowance (they’re not able to claim in respect of deemed payments of employment income).</p>

<p>From April 2015 the Employment Allowance was extended to be available to certain individuals employing carers.</p>

<p>From April 2016 the Employment Allowance was restricted so that companies with one employee paid above the Secondary Threshold, the director, were no longer eligible.</p>

<p>You’ll need to determine your eligibility. For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-employment-allowance">Employment Allowance</a> on details of eligibility and how to claim.</p>

<h4>Apprenticeship Levy</h4>

<p>From April 2017 employers have a liability to pay the Apprenticeship Levy. The levy is charged at a rate of 0.5% of an employer’s annual pay bill. Pay bill is defined as earnings which are liable to Class 1 secondary <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, including earnings below the Secondary Threshold. Employers have an annual allowance of £15,000 with which to offset their levy liability. You’ll need to determine your levy liability.

<span class="number">1.7How </span> to work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> for various pay intervals</h3>

<p>The following information will help you work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> for most pay intervals. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hmrc-tools-and-calculators">calculators</a> on our website can be used for those pay intervals marked * below.</p>

<p>If you use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/payroll-software">Basic <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Tools</a> to calculate all payroll deductions and carry out real-time reporting, it will handle the pay intervals marked ^ below.</p>

<p>For examples of how to calculate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> using the exact percentage method, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/how-to-manually-check-your-payroll-calculations">How to manually check your payroll calculations</a>.</p>

<h4>Pay interval – weekly * ^</h4>

<p>For the weekly pay interval the earnings period is weekly. To work out the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, use either the appropriate weekly table or the exact percentage method to calculate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>

<p>When working out <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> using Tax Tables A, if you’re using a code on a cumulative basis, use the table for the tax week that includes the date of payment. If a payday is in week 53, use the table for week 1 again on a non-cumulative basis.</p>

<p>If you’re using a code on a week 1 or month 1 basis, use the table for week 1 on each payday.</p>

<h4>Pay interval – fortnightly * ^</h4>

<p>For the fortnightly pay interval the earnings period is 2 weekly. To work out the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, use either the appropriate weekly table or the exact percentage method to calculate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>. If you use the tables divide the earnings on which <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are payable by 2, look up this figure in the appropriate weekly table and multiply the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> shown in the table by 2. This will give you the amount of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due.</p>

<p>When working out <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> using Tax Tables A, if you’re using a code on a cumulative basis, use the table for week 2 for the first payment after 5 April; even if the payment is made in the first week of the tax year. Use the table for week 4 for the second payment and so on up to week 52. If there’s a 27th payday in the tax year use the table for week 2 again on a non-cumulative basis.</p>

<p>If you’re using a code on a week 1 or month 1 basis, use the tables for week 2 on each payday.</p>

<h4>Pay interval – 4 weekly * ^</h4>

<p>For the 4 weekly pay interval the earnings period is 4 weekly. To work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, use either the appropriate weekly table or the exact percentage method to calculate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>. If you use the tables divide the earnings on which <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are payable by 4, look up this figure in the appropriate weekly table and multiply the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> shown in the table by 4. This will be the amount of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due.</p>

<p>When working out <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> using Tax Tables A, if you’re using a code on a cumulative basis, use the table for week 4 for the first payment after 5 April; even if the payment is made in the first, second or third week of the tax year. Use the table for week 8 for the second payment and so on up to week 52. If there’s a 14th payday in the tax year, use the table for week 4 again on a non-cumulative basis.</p>

<p>If you’re using a code on a week 1 or month 1 basis, use the table for week 4 on each payday.</p>

<h4>Pay interval – monthly * ^</h4>

<p>For the monthly pay interval the earnings period is monthly. To work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, use either the appropriate monthly table or the exact percentage method to calculate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>

<p>When working out <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> using Tax Tables A, if you’re using a code on a cumulative basis, use the table for the month that includes the date of payment.</p>

<p>If you’re using a code on a week 1 or month 1 basis, use the table for month 1 on each payday.</p>

<h4>Pay interval – quarterly ^</h4>

<p>For the quarterly pay interval the earnings period is quarterly. To work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, use either the appropriate monthly table or the exact percentage method to calculate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>. If you use the tables, divide the earnings on which <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are payable by 3, look up this figure in the appropriate monthly table and multiply the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> shown in the table by 3. This is the amount of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due.</p>

<p>When working out <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> using Tax Tables A, if you’re using a code on a cumulative basis, use the table for month 3 for the first payment after 5 April; even if the payment is made in an earlier month. Use the table for month 6 for the second payment and so on.</p>

<p>If you’re using a code on a week 1 or month 1 basis, use the table for month 3 on each payday.</p>

<h4>Pay interval – half-yearly ^</h4>

<p>For the half-yearly pay interval the earnings period is half-yearly. To work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, use either the appropriate monthly table or the exact percentage method to calculate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>. If you use the tables, divide the earnings on which <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are payable by 6, look up this figure in the appropriate monthly table and multiply the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> shown in the table by 6. This is the amount of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> that are due.</p>

<p>When working out <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> using Tax Tables A, if you’re using a code on a cumulative basis, use the table for month 6 for the first payment in the tax year, and the table for month 12 for the second payment.</p>

<p>If you’re using a code on a week 1 or month 1 basis, use the table for month 6 on each payday.</p>

<h4>Pay interval – annually ^</h4>

<p>For the annually pay interval the earnings period is annually. To work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, use either the appropriate monthly table or the exact percentage method to calculate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>. If you use the tables divide the earnings on which <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are payable by 12, look up this figure in the appropriate monthly table and multiply the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> shown in the table by 12. This is the amount of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> that are due.</p>

<p>When working out <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> using Tax Tables A, if you’re using a code on a cumulative basis, use the table for month 12.</p>

<p>If you’re using a code on a week 1 or month 1 basis, use the table for month 12.</p>

<h4>Pay interval – less than a week ^</h4>

<p>For pay intervals of less than a week the earnings period is one week. To work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, add together all the payments made in an Income Tax week and if the total goes over the weekly lower earnings limit and the Primary and Secondary Thresholds, <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are due. Use either the appropriate weekly table or the exact percentage method to calculate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> from the employer and employee respectively.</p>

<p>When working out <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> using Tax Tables A, if you’re using a code on a cumulative basis, use the table for the tax week that includes the date of payment. If a payment is in week 53, use the table for week 52 again.</p>

<p>If you’re using a code on a week 1 or month 1 basis, use the table for week 1 for each payment. Add to each payment any payments made earlier in the same Income Tax week when working out the tax to be deducted.</p>

<h4>Pay interval – irregular pay intervals of more than a week but not multiples of weeks or months</h4>

<p>For irregular pay intervals of more than a week but not multiples of weeks or months, the earnings period is the interval the payment covers. To work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due, you must use the exact percentage method. To do this work out the daily lower earnings limit by dividing the weekly limit by 7, multiply the answer by the number of calendar days in the period which the payment covers. Work out the daily Primary Threshold, Secondary Threshold and Upper Earnings Limit (<abbr title="Upper Earnings Limit">UEL</abbr>)/<abbr title="Upper Secondary Threshold">UST</abbr> by dividing the annual figures by 365. Then, the multiply the answers for the Primary Threshold, Secondary Threshold and <abbr title="Upper Earnings Limit">UEL</abbr>/<abbr title="Upper Secondary Threshold">UST</abbr> by the number of calendar days in the period which the payment covers.</p>

<p>In all cases the resulting figures should be calculated to the nearest penny. Amounts of £0.005p or less should be disregarded. <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are due on earnings in each intervals if the earnings exceed the Primary Threshold and Secondary Threshold for employees and employers.</p>

<p>When working out <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> using Tax Tables A, if you’re using a code on a cumulative basis, use the table for the week that includes the date of the payment. If a payment is made in week 53. Use the table for week 52, unless you’re given written instructions by us.</p>

<p>If you’re using a code on a week 1 or month 1 basis, use the table for the week that includes the date of payment (where employment started after 5 April, deduct from that the number at the date of commencement).</p>

<p>After that, take into account the time elapsed between payments to the employee to work out the correct basis to use. For example, if the first payment is in week 4, use the table for week 4.</p>

<p>If the next payment is made in week 10, use the table for week 6 (10 minus 4), or if the next payment is in week 10 but the employment started in week 6, use the table for week 4 (10 minus 6). If the next payment is made in week 16, use the table for week 6 (16 minus 10).</p>

<h4>Pay interval – employees paid once only, or employees paid once only where the earnings period is one of those marked * ^ above</h4>

<p>For this pay interval the earnings period is the length of time you employ them or one week whichever is longer. To work out the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due, follow whichever rule above applies.</p>

<p>When working out <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> using Tax Tables A, if you’re using a code on a cumulative basis, if you employ them for less than a week, follow the roles in the first row above for intervals of less than a week. If you employ them for more than a week, use the table for the week the employment ends.</p>

<p>If you’re using a code on a week 1 or month 1 basis, use the table for the week the employment ends if the employment started before the start of the tax year. If the employment started after the end of the tax year use the table for the length of the employment. For example, if the employment starts in week 5 and ends in week 9 use the table for week 4 (9 minus 5).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.8Operation </span> of <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> when the regular date for payment is a non-banking day</h3>

<p>When a regular payday falls on a non-banking day (Saturday, Sunday or bank holiday) and because of this payment is made on the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>last working day before the regular payday</li>
  <li>next working day after the regular payday</li>
</ul>

<p>For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes the payment may be treated as having been made on the regular payday. This is also the date that should be reported on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> as the ‘payment date’ even if the actual payment is made slightly earlier or later. There’s a weekly/monthly chart at <a class="govuk-link" href="#para1132">paragraph 1.13.2</a>.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes the payment must be treated as if it had been made at its regular time, if the actual and regular payment days are in the same tax year. The payment may also be treated as having been made at its regular time when the payment dates cross a tax year.</p>

<h4>Example 1</h4>

<h4>Regular payday falls on a non-banking day but payment made on the last working day before the regular payday.</h4>

<p>Pay due on Saturday 6 January 2018 (tax month 10) but paid on Friday 5 January 2018, should be treated for <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes as being paid on 6 January 2018.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes the payment must be treated as having been paid on 6 January 2018. The ‘payment date’ on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> should be the 6 January 2018 and payments should be reported on or before 6 January 2018.</p>

<h4>Payment made on the first working day after the regular payday.</h4>

<p>Pay due on Saturday 6 January 2018 (tax month 10) but paid on Monday 8 January 2018, should be treated for <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes as being paid on 6 January 2018.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes the payment must be treated as having been paid on 6 January 2018. The ‘payment date’ on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> should be the 6 January 2018 and in these cases you should either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>report the payment on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> sent in advance of the actual payment date (on or before the 6 January 2018)</li>
  <li>send the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> on the actual payment date (8 January 2018) and complete the ‘late reporting reason code’ G on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>, this is because if the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> is sent on the 8th, showing a payment date of the 6th, it will appear to be late and a penalty may be charged</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<h4>Regular payday and actual payday cross a tax year.</h4>

<p>Regular payday on Friday 6 April 2018, (tax year 2018 to 2019) but paid on Thursday 5 April 2018 (tax year 2017 to 2018) may be treated for <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>/<abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes as being paid on 6 April. Payments should be reported on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> on or before 6 April 2018 with a ‘payment date’ on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> showing 6 April 2018.</p>

<p>Regular payday on Thursday 5 April 2018 (tax year 2016 to 2017) and payment made on Friday 6 April 2018. Payments may be treated for <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>/<abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes as being paid on Thursday 5 April 2018 and the payment date of the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> would be the 5 April 2018. In this case employers should either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>report the payment on an <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> sent in advance of the actual payment date (on or before the 5 April 2018)</li>
  <li>send the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> on the actual payment date (6 April 2018) and complete the ‘late reporting reason code’ G on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>, this is because if the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> is sent on the 6th, showing a payment date of the 5th it will appear to be late and a penalty may be charged</li>
</ul>

<p>All other payments you make on regular paydays that fall on banking days and the deductions due must be reported on or before the date of payment unless an exception applies, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/running-payroll/fps-after-payday">Running payroll</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.9Change </span> of pay interval to a shorter interval</h3>

<p>If the interval between the payments of an employee’s earnings changes to a shorter interval, for example, monthly paid to weekly paid, take the following action.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>Work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> from the first payment after the change based on the new earnings period. Do this even if the first weekly payday falls within the same tax month as the previous monthly payday. Use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/how-to-manually-check-your-payroll-calculations"><abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> calculator</a>.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>A monthly paid employee changes to being weekly paid on the first day of the month, after receiving a monthly salary the day before. The first weekly payday is the 5th. Although this payment is in the same tax month as the monthly salary, treat it completely separately and work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the payment using a weekly earnings period.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>Work out <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> using the weekly table on the first payment after the change if you’ve not already paid the employee in the month.</p>

<p>If you’ve already paid the employee in the month of change, use the same monthly table for the rest of that month and then use the weekly table from the beginning of the next tax month. For both <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes use the same payroll record as before.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.10Change </span> of pay interval to a longer interval</h3>

<p>If the interval between the payments of an employee’s earnings changes to a longer interval, for example, weekly paid to monthly paid, take the following action.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>Work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> from the first payment after the change based on the new earnings period. If you’ve already made a payment using the old shorter earnings period in the first of the new longer periods, the payment you’ve made, and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> worked out on it, should be taken into account when working out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> for the new period as a whole.</p>

<h4>Example<br>
</h4>

<p>A weekly paid employee changes to being monthly paid on 9 July 2016 and receives their last 2 weekly payments on 29 June and 6 July. The new earnings period is a month and will coincide with the tax month which always starts on the 6th of every month. The first monthly payday is 31 July.</p>

<p>Work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due on the first monthly pay taking into account the earnings and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> worked out on the payment made on 6 July. The total <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> payable mustn’t exceed that which would have been payable had the 2 payments been added together and monthly <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> worked out on the total. Amend the payroll record.</p>

<p>The weekly payment made on 29 June isn’t in the new earnings period and isn’t included in the calculation.</p>

<p>The rules for Contracted-out occupational pension schemes changed from 6 April 2016. Further information is contained at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension/youve-been-in-a-workplace-personal-or-stakeholder-pension">the new State Pension</a>.</p>

<p>Where, exceptionally, it’s not practicable for you to aggregate the earnings in the first new earnings period, calculate the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due on payments made before and after the change separately, in the normal way.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>Work out <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> using the appropriate monthly table on the first payment after the change. For both <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes use the same payroll record as before.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.11Employees’ </span> payday changed but same pay interval kept</h3>

<p>Take the following action if you change your employees’ payday but keep the same pay interval. For example, you change from making monthly salary payments on the 15th of the month to the 1st of the month.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>To find out the correct tax week/month look up the <a class="govuk-link" href="#weekmonthchart">table</a> further down this guidance. If the month or week number in which you’re making the payment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>follows on from the tax month or week of the previous payment – complete your payroll record and operate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> in the normal way, your next <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> should reflect the payment and tax month</li>
  <li>is the same as the tax month or week of the previous payment
    <ul>
      <li>treat the first ‘new date’ payment as an extra payment for the month or week</li>
      <li>as only one amount of free pay can be given in a pay period the free pay due is the figure used when the previous payment was made, for paydays after the first ‘new date’ payment, complete your payroll record and operate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> in the normal way, send a further <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> to report the revised data</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>Work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> using the normal earnings period on each of the paydays.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.12Extra </span> payments made on a separate payday from normal pay</h3>

<p>Where you make extra payments (such as overtime, commission, bonuses and so on) on a separate payday from other pay, take the following action.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>Treat extra payments as part of the total pay at the time they’re paid, no matter when they were earned. If you’ve paid an employee and then make another payment to them in the same earnings period, <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> have to be worked out again on the total payment.</p>

<h4>Example<br>
</h4>

<p>An employee who is normally paid on a Friday receives a payment of £200 on Thursday 3 November 2016 and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> have been worked out on that sum.</p>

<p>On Friday 4 November 2016 the employee is paid a normal weekly wage of £300 making a total of £500 paid in that week.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> must be recalculated based on £500.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> has already been sent send a further <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> to report the revised data.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>It’s important to remember that only one amount of free pay can be given (or in a K code case one amount of additional pay can be added) in any pay period.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> was operated in the normal way at the time any additional payment is made it could result in an employee receiving a tax refund and then (in effect) repaying that refund on the normal payday.</p>

<p>To prevent this, there are special rules if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>normally pay an employee weekly or at longer regular intervals</li>
  <li>make an extra payment before the normal pay for the week, month or other pay period</li>
  <li>use the employee’s code on the cumulative basis</li>
  <li>for cumulative suffix codes – extra payment
    <ul>
      <li>enter the extra payment for the week in which you pay it</li>
      <li>calculate the tax in the usual way using the tables you would use for the next normal payment taking account of the Regulatory limit for the payment if necessary</li>
      <li>if there’s tax to be deducted, then deduct it from the payment as usual, but</li>
      <li>if there’s tax to be repaid don’t repay it when you make the extra payment</li>
      <li>the repayment should be added to the total tax due and used as your starting point when you next pay the employee</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>for cumulative suffix codes – main payment
    <ul>
      <li>enter the main payment for the week/month in which you pay it</li>
      <li>calculate the tax in the normal way but using the same figure of ‘free pay’ used for the extra payment taking account of the Regulatory limit for the payment if necessary</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>for K codes
    <ul>
      <li>enter the extra payment for the week in which you pay it</li>
      <li>the ‘additional pay’ should be added and tax worked out on this payment, taking account of the Regulatory limit for the payment if necessary</li>
      <li>when you pay the employee the normal main pay don’t add the ‘additional pay’ for the week or month, add the normal pay to the total taxable pay you used when the previous payment was made, work out the tax on this amount using Tables B to D and complete your payroll record in the normal way</li>
      <li>if the K code is being operated on a week 1 or month 1 basis the tax already deducted on the extra payment should be deducted from the tax due for the week or the month</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>From 6 April 2015 remember that the Regulatory limit ensuring employees have no more than 50% of their pay deducted has been extended to all tax codes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.13Payments </span> made in Week 53</h3>

<p>Where you pay an employee weekly, fortnightly or 4 weekly, there will be some tax years when you’ve either 53 weekly paydays, 27 fortnightly paydays, or 14 4 weekly paydays instead of the usual 52, 26 or 13.</p>

<p>This extra payday is called:</p>

<ul>
  <li>week 53 for weekly paid employees</li>
  <li>week 54 for fortnightly paid employees</li>
  <li>week 56 for 4 weekly paid employees</li>
</ul>

<p>When you make a ‘week 53’ payment, to submit your employee pay details to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> on an <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>, you should enter one of the following tax week numbers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘53’ if there are 53 weekly payments in the year</li>
  <li>‘54’ if there are 27 fortnightly payments in the year</li>
  <li>‘56’ if there are 14 4 weekly payments in the year</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t change the final tax code to week 1 if the only reason you’ve used the WK1 table is to calculate a payment on week 53.</p>

<h4>1.13.1 Week 53 and suffix codes</h4>

<p>For employees on a week 1 coding, simply treat the extra payday as another week 1 payment.</p>

<p>For employees on a cumulative code, take the following action. If the total free pay to date at week 52 is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>equal to or more than the total pay for the year (that is the week 52 total plus the extra payday amount):
    <ul>
      <li>don’t deduct any <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> from the payment to the employee</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>less than the total pay for the year
    <ul>
      <li>work out how much <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> to deduct by reference to the pay for week 53, 54 or 56 less the amount of pay adjustment (that is, free pay) shown in Tax Tables A</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Use Tax Tables A for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>week 1 if the employee is weekly paid</li>
  <li>week 2 if the employee is fortnightly paid</li>
  <li>week 4 if the employee is 4 weekly paid</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.13.2 Week 53 and K codes</h4>

<p>Work out how much tax to deduct by reference to the pay for week 53, 54 or 56 plus the amount of pay adjustment (that is ‘additional pay’) shown in Tax Tables A using the table for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>week 1 if the employee is weekly paid</li>
  <li>week 2 if the employee is fortnightly paid</li>
  <li>week 4 if the employee is 4 weekly paid</li>
</ul>

<p>If after following the above guidance you’re approached by an employee who has been advised by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> that they’ve underpaid <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>, you should confirm to them that you’ve not made an error in your payroll and advise the employee to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read the notes enclosed with the calculation</li>
  <li>read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-overpayments-and-underpayments">Tax overpayments and underpayments</a> for more information</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.14 </span> Standard payments made when, or after, an employee leaves</h3>

<p>For the purposes of this guidance, ‘standard’ payments mean such items as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the final payment of salary or wages</li>
  <li>holiday pay</li>
  <li>week-in-hand payments</li>
  <li>bonuses</li>
</ul>

<p>It doesn’t mean additional one-off payments such as retirement, redundancy, lump sums and so on, these payments are dealt with in <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec2">Section 2</a>.</p>

<p>It also doesn’t mean arrears of pay such as those arising from National Minimum Wage or Equal Pay reviews.  These payments should be dealt with in accordance with the guidance in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para119">Section 1.19</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are due in the normal way on any standard payments you make to employees when they leave or after they have left. The payments should be recorded as normal on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>. Make sure the revised year to date figures include the payment.</p>

<p>If the payment is made in a later tax year to the one in which the employee left, record the payments accordingly on your <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>. The year to date figures on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> should reflect only the additional payment.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>If you’ve already given an employee a form P45 you should deduct <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> using code 0T (non-cumulatively on a week 1 or month 1 basis) using the normal pay period for the employee (for example, monthly or weekly), at the time you make the payment.</p>

<p>Payments in connection with employment related securities, including cash payments arising from those securities, made to an employee after leaving should also be taxed using code 0T (week 1 or month 1 basis non-cumulatively).</p>

<p>In such cases, you should provide the employee with documentary confirmation of the payment (for example, by letter, payslip or other printed/printable document) giving the following details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the date of the payment(s)</li>
  <li>the gross amount of each payment</li>
  <li>the amount of <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> deducted from each payment</li>
  <li>confirmation that the payment is a post-leaving payment</li>
</ul>

<p>Include the details, set the ‘Payment after leaving’ indicator and show the original date of leaving on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> when you make the payment. You mustn’t give the employee another form P45.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<h4>Payment made when an employee reaches the age of 21 or an apprentice reaches the age of 25</h4>

<p>If the payment is made on or after the employee reaches his 21st birthday or the apprentice reaches his 25th birthday, work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> using the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>usual earnings period</li>
  <li>contributions rates and limits current at the time</li>
  <li>correct National Insurance category letter for an employee over the age of 21 or an apprentice over the age of 25</li>
</ul>

<h4>Payment made before an employee reaches the age of 21 or an apprentice reaches the age of 25</h4>

<p>If the payment is made when the employee is under 21 years of age or the apprentice is under 25, work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> using the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>usual earnings period</li>
  <li>contributions rates and limits current at the time</li>
  <li>correct National Insurance category letter for an employee under the age of 21 or an apprentice over the age of 25</li>
</ul>

<p>The category letters for those under the age of 21 and apprentices under 25 are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>H apprentice under 25</li>
  <li>M standard rate</li>
  <li>Z Under 21 deferred rate</li>
</ul>

<p>It’ll be the responsibility of the employer to ensure they hold the employee’s correct date of birth and ensure they use the correct National Insurance category letter.</p>

<h4>Payment made when an employee leaves</h4>

<p>If the payment is made when the employee leaves, work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> using the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>usual earnings period</li>
  <li>contributions rates and limits current at the time of payment</li>
  <li>usual category letter</li>
</ul>

<h4>Payment made after an employee leaves</h4>

<p>If the payment is made after the employee has left, that is after their contract has ended, the earnings period to use is dependent on whether the payment is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a regular payment such as a final payment of salary or wage including, for example, an employee who’s required to work a week-in-hand and receives their last pay after the contract has ended, or an expected bonus</li>
  <li>an irregular sum, such as
    <ul>
      <li>accrued holiday pay</li>
      <li>an unexpected bonus</li>
      <li>arrears of pay following a backdated pay award</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the payment is a regular payment such as the final payment of salary or wage, work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> using the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>usual earnings period</li>
  <li>contributions rates and limits current at the time of payment</li>
  <li>usual category letter</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example<br>
</h4>

<p>The final salary to a monthly paid employee leaving in the middle of the month is paid at the usual time at the end of the month. Work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> using a monthly earnings period even though the payment is only for part of the month.</p>

<p>If the payment is an irregular sum, work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a weekly earnings period</li>
  <li>the contributions rates and limits current at the time of payment</li>
  <li>the usual category letter</li>
</ul>

<p>If the employee has turned 21 or the apprentice has turned 25 or the apprenticeship has ended, category letters M, Z or H aren’t appropriate. Category A must be used.</p>

<h4>Example<br>
</h4>

<p>A 20 year old apprentice terminates the apprenticeship and receives an irregular payment after leaving the employment. Category H can’t be used as the apprenticeship has ended. Whether Category M, Z or A should be used depends on whether the ex-apprentice is still 20 or has turned 21.</p>

<h4>Two or more payments together</h4>

<p>If an employee gets 2 or more payments together after leaving, the earnings period is dependent on what those payments are.</p>

<p>If all the payments are salary or wages (including one which may be a ‘week-in-hand’ payment) work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on each payment separately using the usual earnings period.</p>

<p>If some payments are salary and others are irregular sums, add the payments together and work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the total using the usual earnings period for the payment of salary.</p>

<p>If all payments are irregular sums, add them together and work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> using a weekly earnings period.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.15 </span> Payments made when an employee has died</h3>

<h4>Death of an employee</h4>

<h4>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>No <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are due on the earnings of an employee who dies before payment of those earnings is made.</p>

<h4>1.15.1 For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>When you learn of the death of an employee you should enter a leaving date, this will be the date of death, on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> with the last payment for the deceased, don’t issue a P45.</p>

<p><abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> should be deducted using the employee’s code, from any payments which were due to the deceased employee after the date the employee died but before you’ve completed the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>, if they’re paid in the tax year the employee died. You must provide a date of leaving on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>, which in this case will be the employee’s date of death.</p>

<p>If you make a further payment after notifying <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> of the date of death on an <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>, <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> should be deducted using code 0T (on a week 1 or month 1 basis). You should record the deduction on the employee’s payroll record as follows, if the payment is made in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the same tax year as the one in which the employee died, record the details on the employee’s payroll record, the date of leaving on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> should be the date of death and the ‘Payment after leaving’ indicator should be set, ensure the revised year to date figures include the additional payment</li>
  <li>a later tax year, record the details on the payroll record in the name of the deceased employee and include details on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>, the date of leaving should be the date of death and the ‘Payment after leaving’ indicator should be set, the year to date figures should only reflect the additional payment</li>
</ul>

<p>Check with your software provider whether the package you use will complete these calculations automatically for you. You can use <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s online <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hmrc-tools-and-calculators#paye"><abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax calculator</a> to assist in your calculations.</p>

<h4>1.15.2 Death of pension recipient</h4>

<p>When you learn of the death of a pension recipient you should enter the leaving date, this will be the date of death, on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> with the last payment for the deceased, don’t issue P45.</p>

<p><abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> should be deducted using the pension recipient’s existing code, from any payments which were due to the deceased pension recipient, if they’re made in the tax year the pension recipient died. Record details of the payments on the pension recipient’s <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>If such payments are made in a later tax year to the one in which the pension recipient died, refer to the 2 examples below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the payment is made in a later tax year than the date of death but before you’ve notified <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> of the date of leaving the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>
    <ul>
      <li>use the tax code for the new year that you would have used if the pensioner had still been alive; record the payment details on the payroll record in the name of the deceased pensioner</li>
      <li>complete the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> using the new tax code only showing payments made in the new tax year, payments made in the earlier tax year will be recorded on the employee’s <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> for that year</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>if the payment is made in a later tax year than the date of death and after you’ve notified <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> of the date of leaving on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>
    <ul>
      <li>use the code 0T on a week 1 or month 1 basis</li>
      <li>record the details on the payroll record in the name of the deceased pensioner</li>
      <li>set the ‘Payment after leaving’ indicator on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.16 </span> Joint wages to spouses and civil partners</h3>

<p>Where you pay a joint wage to spouses or civil partners, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prepare separate payroll records for each spouse or civil partner</li>
  <li>divide the wage between them for both <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</li>
  <li>ask us to let you have individual tax codes</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.17 </span> Change of gender</h3>

<p>Transgender people can legally change their recorded gender and benefit from any rights and responsibilities associated with their acquired gender. In order to gain legal recognition in their acquired gender, transgender people must apply to the Gender Recognition Panel. If their application is successful, the Panel will grant a <abbr title="Gender Recognition Certificate">GRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>No verification is needed to change an employee’s name, but where you’re aware that an employee has changed gender (by providing you with a <abbr title="Gender Recognition Certificate">GRC</abbr> or a new birth certificate) you can update your records to show the employee’s acquired gender and the title by which they want to be known. If they provide you with a copy of their new birth certificate, you’ll need to take a copy of the certificate and update the employee’s gender and title on your records, if you’ve not already done so.  You can then operate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> to reflect the acquired gender (for example, a transgender female with a full <abbr title="Gender Recognition Certificate">GRC</abbr> will pay <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> up to the State Pension age for women).</p>

<p>Don’t review the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> position of the employee until you’re presented with a new birth certificate or <abbr title="Gender Recognition Certificate">GRC</abbr>. It’s only following the issue of the full <abbr title="Gender Recognition Certificate">GRC</abbr> that the person can obtain a new birth certificate and is accepted as having satisfied the criteria for legal recognition in their acquired gender.</p>

<p>Currently the State Pension age for men is 65. State Pension age for women born before 6 April 1950 was 60 and the State Pension age for women born on or after 6 April 1950 is gradually increasing from 60 to 65 between 2010 and March 2018.</p>

<p>For more information and the State Pension age calculator, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-age">Check your State Pension age</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.18 </span> Mistake in the amount of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> or <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> deducted</h3>

<p>For guidance about when and how to tell us about correcting errors, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/payroll-errors/correcting-pay-or-deductions">Fix problems with running payroll</a>.</p>

<h4>1.18.1 Mistake in the amount of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> or <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> deducted during the tax year</h4>

<p>If, during the tax year, you discover that a mistake has been made in the amount of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> or <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> deducted, take the following action:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you’ve deducted too much <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> or <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax from your employee, simply refund the extra amount on their next payday</li>
  <li>if your employee paid too little <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> or <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax you must pay the underpayment to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> as soon as you know you’ve paid too little</li>
</ul>

<p>However, there are special rules which allow you to recover underpayments of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> from your employees where the error was made in good faith. This is done by making extra deductions from any later earnings you pay that employee. There are 2 conditions that apply to these recoveries relating to the amount and the time in which you can recover.</p>

<p>The first condition is that the extra deduction you make from further payments of earnings can be no greater than the employee’s contribution due on that further payment of earnings.</p>

<h4>Example 1<br>
</h4>

<p>An employee is due to pay primary contributions of £20 on his next payment of earnings. The maximum extra deduction that can be made is £20, making a total deduction on those earnings of £40.</p>

<p>The second condition is that the extra deduction can be made during the remainder of the tax year in which the error occurred and the whole of the following tax year. If at the end of the second tax year you’ve been unable to recover the full amount under deducted, then you may not recover any more from the employee and you must bear the cost of the loss yourself. If the employee leaves your employment after the error occurred you must bear the cost of the loss yourself.</p>

<h4>Example 2<br>
</h4>

<p>An error occurred and was made in good faith on 30 April 2016. The employer may make extra deductions from any earnings paid to the employee during the period 1 May 2016 to 5 April 2017 until the underpayment is recovered.</p>

<p>For guidance about when and how to tell us about correcting errors, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/payroll-errors/correcting-pay-or-deductions">Fix problems with running payroll</a>.</p>

<h4>Correcting payroll reporting errors – current tax year</h4>

<p>You must send an <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> every time you pay your employees to let <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> know who has been paid, how much they’ve been paid and the deductions made for <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>. If you’ve made a mistake in the current tax year or you discover that information you’ve already reported is incorrect, the action you need to take depends on when you discover the error.</p>

<p>If you need to correct an error in a previous tax year, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/payroll-errors/correcting-pay-or-deductions">Fix problems with running payroll</a>.</p>

<h4>If you discover the error before you submit your next <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>
</h4>

<p>You can either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>correct the error by using revised year-to-date figures on your next regular <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> – this is often the easiest way to handle the correction</li>
  <li>show the adjustment by submitting an additional <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> for the pay period for the employee(s) the error relates to how you report a correction may depend on the payroll software you use</li>
</ul>

<h4>For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>You should try to recover the underpaid tax by making extra deductions from any later earnings you pay that employee by the end of the tax year. You should do this by agreement with the employee. Where you’re unable to recover the under deduction by the end of the tax year you can ask us to make a direction that your employee should pay the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax. We’ll issue a direction if an explanation is provided which demonstrates that reasonable care was taken to operate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and that the under deduction was an error made in good faith.</p>

<p>For more information and examples of errors, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/payroll-errors/correcting-pay-or-deductions">Fix problems with running payroll</a>. If you’re still unsure and you need advice, contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="#emphelp">Employer Helpline</a>.</p>

<h4>1.18.2 Mistake discovered after the end of the tax year</h4>

<h4>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>Errors in <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> submitted in the previous tax year, if you discover, on or before 19 April following the end of the tax year, that you’ve not submitted an <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> or you’ve reported incorrect year to date figures, you should submit an additional <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> with corrected year to date figures as at 5 April for the previous tax year.</p>

<p>If you discover the issue on or after 20 April in the following tax year, you should submit an <abbr title="Earlier Year Update">EYU</abbr>. You can submit an <abbr title="Earlier Year Update">EYU</abbr> to correct <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> information for up to 6 years after you filed your original <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> or <abbr title="Employer Payment Summaries">EPS</abbr>. You can find out how to do this by going to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/payroll-errors/correcting-pay-or-deductions">Fix problems with running payroll</a>.</p>

<p>Where you discover that you’ve over-deducted <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> by mistake for a tax year when you reported information using forms P35 or P14 you can ask us for a refund by writing to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

HM Revenue and Customs 
<br>National Insurance Contributions &amp; Employer Office 
<br>Multi Refunds BP2001 
<br>Benton Park View 
<br>Longbenton 
<br>NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE 
<br>NE98 1ZZ
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>You’ll need to include a full explanation of the over-deduction, with revised earnings and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> details, for each employee affected. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will refund any overpayment of primary <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> direct to the employee(s).</p>

<p>You must also tell any affected employee:</p>

<ul>
  <li>by letter showing the amendment</li>
  <li>giving them a new P60 marked ‘REPLACEMENT’</li>
</ul>

<p>Sending amended information means that your original return was either incomplete or inaccurate and could mean that you may be charged a penalty. As a general rule, you as the employer have to pay any underpayment of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> arising from an error.</p>

<p>Guidance on how you can recover under deducted Primary <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> from your employees is as at paragraph <a class="govuk-link" href="#para1181">1.18.1</a>.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>Where you discover that you’ve under deducted <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> by mistake you can ask us for a direction – see the advice for Mistakes made during the tax year, at paragraph <a class="govuk-link" href="#para1181">1.18.1</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.19 </span> Unintentional overpayments of salary or pension</h3>

<p>If you unintentionally overpay wages or pension, the following guidance explains what to do under <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>. For payments prior to <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> read paragraphs <a class="govuk-link" href="#para1223">1.22.3</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#para1224">1.22.4</a>.</p>

<p>Examples of unintentional overpayments are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an employee’s pay was recorded incorrectly, resulting in them receiving higher wages than they were entitled to</li>
  <li>an employee gets a payment of wages for the period after leaving as your payroll office doesn’t know they left</li>
  <li>a pensioner dies, but pension payments continue because the pension payer had not been informed</li>
  <li>an employee is paid for work/overtime they did not do</li>
</ul>

<h4>Adjustments during the tax year</h4>

<p>When an unintentional overpayment is made and the employee or pensioner continues to be entitled to employment or pension income, the mistake must be corrected in your next <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> by reporting the correct total payments to date and correct net tax to date. This means that the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax deducted on the overpayment can be set off by reducing your next monthly remittance to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>you should ensure you make a note in your records to explain the reason for the adjustment</li>
  <li>you must keep a record of the method used to recover the net pay or pension from the individual – for instance, the individual may pay you directly or you may have agreed with the individual to recover the overpayment as a post-tax deduction in their future pay or pension</li>
</ul>

<h4>Adjustments after the end of the tax year</h4>

<p>Where an unintentional overpayment is discovered after the 19th April, you can only submit an Earlier Year Update (<abbr title="Earlier Year Update">EYU</abbr>). You should report the correct total payments and net tax for the tax year.</p>

<ul>
  <li>you should make a note in your records to explain the reason for the <abbr title="Earlier Year Update">EYU</abbr>
</li>
  <li>you should have proper arrangements in place to recover net pay or pension from the individual and have evidence to demonstrate how the recovery was made or is being made</li>
  <li>once <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has processed the <abbr title="Earlier Year Update">EYU</abbr> subject to any security checks, the overpaid tax will be available to be either set off against future liabilities or be repaid</li>
  <li>you must give your employee, pensioner or representative details of the amendment either in a letter showing the amendment or in a new P60 marked ‘REPLACEMENT’</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.19.1 Deliberate under deductions of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>
</h4>

<p>In certain circumstances where we identify that an employee has received pay knowing that the employer has deliberately failed to deduct tax, a direction can be made for the employee to pay the underpayment. This will usually be where we can’t recover the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> from the employer. Where we also identify that an employee received pay knowing that the primary contributions had not been deducted or paid over, a decision can be made for the employee to pay those contributions.</p>

<h4>1.19.2 Arrears of pay for closed years</h4>

<p>Where you’re obliged to pay arrears of pay to employees in respect of closed tax years (for example, where a court orders an employer to pay arrears under equal pay legislation) you should proceed as shown in the following steps.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>Enter the full amount of the arrears paid on the current year payroll record at the time of payment and work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> in the normal way. Include on your next <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>Submit an <abbr title="Earlier Year Update">EYU</abbr> and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>calculate and deduct tax for each closed year as if the additional pay had been paid at week 53 for that year (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para113">paragraph 1.13</a>)</li>
  <li>use the employee’s tax code for each closed tax year, we’ll supply the appropriate tax codes for each of the closed tax years if you no longer have them</li>
  <li>give each employee a letter showing the revised pay for each tax year and the tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> deducted, each letter should also contain the following message: ‘If you think that you’ve overpaid tax or <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> for any of the years concerned you should contact <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> National Insurance Contributions and Employer Office.’</li>
</ul>

<h4>Special Arrangements, Pre <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> years where large numbers of employees need to be paid arrears or pay</h4>

<p>Where there are large numbers of employees involved for arrears of pay due to them for tax years prior to introduction of <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>, take the following action:</p>

<ul>
  <li>phone the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cwg2-further-guide-to-paye-and-national-insurance-contributions/2016-to-2017-employer-further-guide-to-paye-and-nics#emphelp">Employer Helpline</a> and explain the situation, quoting this guidance</li>
  <li>ask for a ‘special arrangement’ to deduct and pay the tax under an ‘Employer Amendment Class 6 Settlement’</li>
  <li>you must send us a list showing for each employee, their name, their National Insurance number, the pay and tax for each year</li>
</ul>

<p>A special arrangement for the deduction of tax is agreed on the basis that it’s impracticable to obtain details of tax codes for employees for both the employer and <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. Typically this might be authorisation by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> to use the BR (Basic rate) tax code.</p>

<p>Once <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> receives the request in writing along with an explanation why it’s impracticable to operate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and make deductions of tax, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will confirm whether a special arrangement can apply.</p>

<p>You should then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>follow the instructions for deduction of tax as set out by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and agree the Employer amendment Class 6 settlement:
    <ul>
      <li>the due date of payment of the tax will be 30 days from the date of payment of the arrears of pay to the employees</li>
      <li>interest will be chargeable on late paid tax from the due date</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>give each employee a letter showing the revised pay for each tax year and the tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> deducted, each letter should also contain the following message: ‘If you think that you’ve overpaid tax or NIC for any of the years concerned you should contact <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> National Insurance Contributions and Employer Office.’</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.20 </span> Paying a refund of tax when no payments are due to your employee</h3>

<p>If an employee on a cumulative code is due a refund of tax but isn’t entitled to receive any payment from you in a pay period because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they’re absent on unpaid leave</li>
  <li>they have no further entitlement to Statutory Sick Pay (<abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr>), Statutory Maternity Pay (<abbr title="Statutory Maternity Pay">SMP</abbr>), Statutory Paternity Pay (<abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr>), Statutory Shared Parental Pay (<abbr title="Statutory Shared Parental Pay">ShPP</abbr>), or Statutory Adoption Pay (<abbr title="Statutory Adoption Pay">SAP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>they’re not absent as the result of a trade dispute you must operate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> or run your payroll as if making a nil payment as long as the employee or their authorised representative has asked you to do so</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.21 </span> Different employer <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> references for separate groups of your employees</h3>

<p>You may choose to have different employer <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> references for separate groups of your employees, for example, for wages and salaries or for separate branches of your organisation.</p>

<p>To do this you make an election which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has to be made in writing</li>
  <li>can be made at any time before the beginning of the tax year, for example, an election received May 2017 to take effect from 6 April 2018</li>
</ul>

<p>Making the election results in each Employer <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> reference being treated separately for all <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes with separate payroll records being required for each one.</p>

<p>When calculating whether reimbursement for Small Employers is appropriate for <abbr title="Statutory Maternity Pay">SMP</abbr>, <abbr title="Statutory Adoption Pay">SAP</abbr>, <abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr> and <abbr title="Statutory Shared Parental Pay">ShPP</abbr>, employers with election don’t have to combine the total gross <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> for each separate Employer <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> reference. Where each <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme is a separate business. If each scheme is a part of the business as a whole, then the total NIC for all schemes would be taken into account when deciding if small employer relief is due.</p>

<p>If you wish to make an election fill in form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-employer-annual-return-election-p350">P350: Election – Employer Annual Return</a>, which gives more information and incorporates an election for you to complete.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.22 </span> End of year Final Submission</h3>

<p>At the end of the tax year, submit your final <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> and/or <abbr title="Employer Payment Summaries">EPS</abbr> for the pay period as normal. You must indicate on your last <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> or <abbr title="Employer Payment Summaries">EPS</abbr> for the year that it’s your ‘Final submission for the tax year’. You must do this even if you’ve not made any deductions of <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax or <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> from your employees in that pay period.</p>

<p>Your final submission is the last <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> or <abbr title="Employer Payment Summaries">EPS</abbr> you submit for the tax year, regardless of whether it relates to weekly or monthly payroll.</p>

<h4>1.22.1 No payments in final pay period</h4>

<p>If you’ve not made a payment to any of your employee’s in the final pay period for the tax year then you’re not required to submit an <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>. Instead you must submit an <abbr title="Employer Payment Summaries">EPS</abbr> indicating the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no Payment for Period</li>
  <li>Final Submission for the tax year</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re a limited company and wish to claim for <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> deductions suffered, you’ll need to complete 2 <abbr title="Employer Payment Summaries">EPS</abbr> submissions.</p>

<p>The first should indicate ‘No Payment for Period’, and the second should indicate ‘Final Submission for the tax year’ and report ‘<abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> Deductions Suffered for the tax year’.</p>

<h4>1.22.2 Correcting a current or previous year’s payroll entry for <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> tax years</h4>

<p>If, during a tax year, you submit a <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> containing information that later needs correcting, you can make the correction upon your next regular <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> or by submitting an additional <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> before your next regular <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> is due.</p>

<p><abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> reporting inaccuracies can be corrected this way if done before the 20th April which immediately follows the end of the tax year for which the correction is needed. After that date the correction must instead be done by submitting an <abbr title="Earlier Year Update">EYU</abbr>, which are to be used to correct reporting inaccuracies for closed tax years.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Earlier Year Update">EYU</abbr> must show the difference between what figure you’ve already reported and what that figure should be. If you’ve reported incorrect information on an <abbr title="Employer Payment Summaries">EPS</abbr>, you must submit another <abbr title="Employer Payment Summaries">EPS</abbr> to report the correct total year to date figures for all recovered payments within that tax year.</p>

<p>Your payroll software may include this function to allow you to submit an <abbr title="Earlier Year Update">EYU</abbr>, or you can use the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/payroll-software">Basic <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Tools</a> to do so, alongside your commercial software.</p>

<h4>1.22.3 Making amendments for years prior to <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Exceptionally, you may need to send an amended P35 return where you discover that an employee or pensioner received a payment that they were not entitled to and you wish to make a claim from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> for overpaid tax. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you discover that your employee was overpaid for work or hours they did not complete</li>
  <li>a pension payment was made to a pensioner for a period after they died</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need to make a claim for the overpaid tax you must send this information on a P35 and P14. We won’t accept it in any other format. In all cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you must send a letter explaining the reason for the amendment</li>
  <li>you should keep evidence of how recovery of the net pay or pension was made from the employee or pension recipient</li>
  <li>there’s a 4 year time limit after the end of the tax year</li>
  <li>you must give your employee, pensioner or representative details of the amendment either in a letter showing the amendment or in a new P60 marked ‘REPLACEMENT’</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.22.4 Sending amendments for years prior to <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>
</h4>

<p>You can make amendments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>online using your software</li>
  <li>by using the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Online Returns and Forms – <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> product</li>
  <li>on paper using approved stationery</li>
</ul>

<p>You must show only the amount of any amendment. For example, if your original P14 showed £100 too much tax, your amended P35/P14 must show - (minus) £100.</p>

<p>Employers who must file online won’t get a non-filing penalty if an amendment is sent on paper and the original return was sent on time.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Special procedures</h2>

<p>The following guidance applies to all Employers. Guidance for reporting <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> in real time is also available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/topic/business-tax/paye"><abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Pension contributions</h3>

<p>Since the introduction of the automatic enrolment legislation on 1 October 2012 employers no longer have to offer new workers a stakeholder pension. However employers do have obligations towards workers who are already members of existing employer stakeholder schemes.</p>

<p>There’s more information on the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/" rel="external">Pensions Regulator’s</a> website.</p>

<p>Automatic enrolment places new duties on employers to automatically enrol their eligible workers into a workplace pension scheme. It will be rolled out gradually starting with the largest employers. All employers will be included by February 2018.</p>

<p>You can find out what you need to do and when to do it, read <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en/employers/?xtor=CS1-3-%5Bactnow%5D-%5BAutoEnrolment%5D-%5BFURL%5D" rel="external">Automatic enrolment for employers</a>.</p>

<p>If you establish a pension scheme for your employees, you can arrange to have it registered for tax relief with us.
If you already had a pension scheme that was approved for tax relief prior to 6 April 2006 it will have automatically become a registered pension scheme at that time unless we had been advised that you did not wish that to happen.</p>

<p>If you deduct pension contributions from your employees’ pay and pay these to a registered pension scheme you may be able to use what is known as a ‘net pay arrangement’ to give your employees tax relief on their pension contributions.</p>

<p>You can use the net pay arrangement if the pension scheme you’ve established is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registered by us as an occupational pension scheme</li>
  <li>you use the net pay arrangement in respect of all of your employees who pay contributions to the scheme</li>
</ul>

<p>Under the net pay arrangement, tax relief is due on any contributions your employees make to the scheme (including any additional voluntary contributions) that you deduct from the employee’s gross pay.</p>

<p>You can only give your employees tax relief on pension contributions if your scheme is registered with us and you’re authorised to do so. If you reduce their taxable pay without registering you may be liable for any tax that you’ve failed to deduct from their pay.</p>

<p>If you wish to know more about registering a pension scheme, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/topic/business-tax/pension-scheme-administration">Pension scheme administration</a> or contact:</p>

<br>NG2 1BB 
<br>Phone 0300 123 1079
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>If you’re taking part in an existing group or ‘centralised’ scheme, you can use the net pay arrangement provided the scheme is registered with us and you’re able to use the arrangement in relation to the scheme. In all other circumstances you mustn’t use the net pay arrangement.</p>

<p>Where you deduct contributions under the net pay arrangement, remember that an employee is entitled only to tax relief, and not relief from <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>

<p>When completing your payroll records:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes deduct the pension contributions from the employee’s gross pay</li>
  <li>for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes don’t deduct the pension contributions from the employee’s gross pay</li>
</ul>

<p>Take the following action for each employee who is in the scheme:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to work out <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> due, deduct the total figure of pension contributions paid in the tax year to date from the employee’s gross pay figure on the first payday following notification of registration</li>
  <li>if pension contributions have been paid in a previous tax year, send us a list showing the names of the employees and the contributions each employee has paid</li>
</ul>

<p>Occupational pension scheme contributions deducted from employees’ pay must be with the pension scheme within 19 days of the end of the month that the deductions were made.</p>

<p>Failure to meet this deadline could lead to civil proceedings by <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/" rel="external">The Pensions Regulator</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Pension payments</h3>

<p>Pension payments, either to former employees or dependants of deceased employees:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are usually included in gross pay for <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</li>
  <li>for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes
    <ul>
      <li>aren’t included in gross pay if paid out of a registered pension scheme (use Category X if software requires a category)</li>
      <li>may need to be included in gross pay if paid out of an employer-financed retirement benefits scheme (use appropriate category)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Pension payments that may be wholly or partly exempt from tax are payments which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have been awarded because an employee has ceased to hold an employment because of disablement attributable to the performance of the duties of the employment</li>
  <li>aren’t paid out of a registered pension scheme, contact us before you make any such payments</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.2.1 Lump sum payments from pension schemes</h4>

<h4>Registered schemes</h4>

<p><abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> doesn’t apply to lump sums paid under or out of a registered pension scheme, except:</p>

<ul>
  <li>trivial commutation payments, which are paid when small pension or annuity rights are fully commuted for a lump sum</li>
  <li>Uncrystallised Funds Pension Lump Sums (<abbr title="Uncrystallised Funds Pension Lump Sums">UFPLS</abbr>), where a person receives a lump sum payment from a pension scheme from rights that haven’t previously come into payment, this may be either the fund in its entirety or part of the fund</li>
  <li>taxable lump sum payments made to a beneficiary of a deceased member, normal <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> rules apply to such payments</li>
</ul>

<p>For payments relating to benefit rights that have yet to come into payment, <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> is due on 75% of the lump sum. Where trivial commutation payments relate to benefit rights in payment, <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> is due on the entire amount.
Where the payment relates to a mixture of benefit rights in payment and not yet in payment, the lump sum is reduced by 25% of the value of the benefit rights that have yet to come into payment and <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> is applied to the balance.</p>

<p>However, <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> is due on 100% of a taxable lump sum death benefit paid to the beneficiary of a deceased member.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes, don’t include in gross pay any lump sum from a registered pension scheme.
For up-to-date guidance, including guidance covering the recent legislative changes, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/pensions-tax-manual">Pensions Tax Manual (<abbr title="Pensions Tax Manual">PTM</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<h4>Employer-financed schemes</h4>

<p>Most lump sum payments made under or out of an employer-financed retirement benefits scheme (essentially, an unregistered scheme) should be taxed in full under <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>. Exceptions and reductions include situations where the value underlying the sums in question was previously taxed, either at the contribution stage or when ‘earmarked’ for a specified employee or employees in the scheme.</p>

<p>You can find more information about these schemes in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual">Employment Income Manual</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/national-insurance-manual">National Insurance Manual</a>.</p>

<h4>2.2.2 Procedures for employer of either an employee retiring or a deceased employee whose dependant is entitled to a pension</h4>

<h4>Pension to be paid by you as the employer</h4>

<p>If you’re to pay the pension to a retiring employee:</p>

<ul>
  <li>don’t treat the employee as leaving your employment, continue paying them using the existing payroll record</li>
  <li>give the former employee a retirement statement, showing their previous employment details up to the date of their retirement</li>
  <li>indicate ‘Yes’ in the occupational pension indicator field on the first and every payment of pension</li>
  <li>include the annual amount of the occupational pension with the first pension payment don’t pro rata it from the start date</li>
  <li>include the tax code (see below)</li>
  <li>use a different Payroll ID for the pension payments and indicate on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> that the Payroll ID has changed, including details of the previous Payroll ID</li>
</ul>

<p>When you start to pay the pension, use the employee’s existing tax code on a week 1 or month 1 basis until you hear from us. If we haven’t contacted you by 5 April, (or the employee retires so late in the tax year that the first pension payment is made after 5 April), carry forward the existing tax code to the new tax year but use it on a cumulative basis.</p>

<p>If you’re to pay the pension to a dependant of a deceased employee, follow the procedures under ‘Pension recipient doesn’t give you form P45’ in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para224">paragraph 2.2.4</a>.</p>

<h4>Pension to be paid by the trustees of a pension fund</h4>

<p>If an employee retires and you’re not going to be paying them a pension, you need to include the leaving details on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> when making their final payment, as you would for any employee who is leaving.</p>

<h4>If an employee dies</h4>

<p>If an employee dies, you must pay any final payment due to the deceased’s personal representative, who is usually the executor of their will. You should only show the deceased’s personal details on their last <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>, not those of their representative.</p>

<p>There’s no specific date of death field on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>, so you must provide a date of leaving on the last <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> for the deceased, which in this instance will be the employee’s date of death. There’s no need for you to tell <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> that your employee has died as they’ll receive notification of this from other government sources. You don’t give the personal representative a form P45.</p>

<h4>2.2.3 Procedures for employer of an employee starting to receive a pension whilst continuing to work for the same employer</h4>

<h4>Pension to be paid by you as the employer</h4>

<p>If you’re to pay a pension to an employee who continues in employment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>don’t treat the employee as leaving your employment</li>
  <li>set up a separate payroll record for the pension</li>
  <li>indicate ‘Yes’ in the occupational pension indicator field on the first and every payment of pension</li>
  <li>include the annual amount of the occupational pension with the first pension payment, don’t pro rata it from the start date</li>
  <li>include the tax code (see below)</li>
  <li>use a different Payroll ID for the pension payments on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> from that used for their employment income</li>
</ul>

<p>When you start to pay the pension, deduct tax using code 0T on a week 1 or month 1 basis until you hear from us. Continue to use the same code as before on the employment income.</p>

<h4>2.2.4 Procedures for other pension and annuity payers</h4>

<p>All pensions and annuities from, or in respect of, a registered pension scheme are <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> pension income.</p>

<h4>Pension recipient gives you form P45</h4>

<ul>
  <li>set up a new payroll record for them</li>
  <li>include the date the pension started with the first pension payment</li>
  <li>indicate ‘Yes’ in the occupational pension indicator field on the first and every payment of pension</li>
  <li>include the annual amount of the occupational pension with the first pension payment, don’t pro rata it from the start date</li>
  <li>include the tax code (see below)</li>
  <li>include the Payroll ID, if you want to use one</li>
  <li>use the code from the P45 on a week 1 or month 1 basis until you hear from us</li>
  <li>if we haven’t contacted you by 5 April (or the first pension payment is to be made after 5 April), carry forward the existing code to the new tax year but use it on a cumulative basis</li>
  <li>if the pension recipient gives you form P45 after the pension/annuity has started and after you’ve received a code from us you must destroy the P45</li>
</ul>

<h4>Pension recipient doesn’t give you form P45</h4>

<ul>
  <li>set up a new payroll record for them</li>
  <li>include the date the pension started with the first pension payment</li>
  <li>indicate ‘Yes’ in the occupational pension indicator field on the first and every payment of pension</li>
  <li>include the annual amount of the occupational pension with the first pension payment, don’t pro rata it from the start date</li>
  <li>include the tax code – unless you’re told to use a new tax code by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, use the emergency tax code on a week 1 or month 1 basis</li>
  <li>include the Payroll ID, if you want to use one</li>
</ul>

<h4>Recipient is a non-individual</h4>

<p>Where such payments are made to third parties or non-individuals, such as Personal Representative, Trustee in Bankruptcy or a Body Corporate.</p>

<p>You must submit the following information under <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>operate code BR</li>
  <li>leave the National Insurance number field blank</li>
  <li>enter ‘male’ as the gender</li>
  <li>enter ‘RP’ as the forename</li>
  <li>enter the name of the recipient body as the surname</li>
  <li>enter the address of the recipient body</li>
  <li>indicate ‘Yes’ in the payment to a non-individual indicator field</li>
  <li>don’t enter a start date for the new recipient</li>
</ul>

<h4>Term Certain Pensions and Annuities</h4>

<p>Where such payments are made to a named beneficiary or beneficiary you must follow the usual procedures for new pensions and annuities. Pensions and annuities are paid from or in respect of registered pension schemes are <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> pension income under the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> system.</p>

<p>If such pensions or annuities are for a ‘term certain’ following the death of the pension recipient or annuitant or to a named beneficiary, the continuing pension and annuity instalments still remain as <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> pension income and should still be reported under <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where such payments are made to a named beneficiary or beneficiary you must follow the usual procedures for new pensions and annuities.</p>

<p>Where such payments are made to third parties or non-individuals, such as Personal Representative, Trustee in Bankruptcy, Body Corporate you must submit the following information under <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>operate code BR</li>
  <li>leave the National Insurance number field blank</li>
  <li>enter ‘male’ as the gender</li>
  <li>enter ‘RP’ as the forename</li>
  <li>enter the name of the recipient body as the surname</li>
  <li>enter the address of the recipient body</li>
  <li>indicate ‘Yes’ in the payment to a non-individual indicator field</li>
  <li>don’t enter a start date for the new recipient</li>
</ul>

<p>For named beneficiaries or new recipients of pensions or annuities you must follow the procedures at <a class="govuk-link" href="#para224">paragraph 2.2.4</a> .</p>

<h4>2.2.5 Trivial commutation payments relating to registered pension schemes</h4>

<p>Where a trivial commutation payment is taxable in whole or part as pension income, then tax has to be deducted through <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> from the taxable amount.</p>

<h4>Commutation where pension payments have already started</h4>

<p>In these cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>treat the trivial commutation payment in the same way as the earlier pension payments, and operate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> in the normal way</li>
  <li>complete form P45 including the taxable commutation payment and the pension payments made in the year</li>
  <li>give the P45 to the pension recipient</li>
  <li>enter the date of payment as the date of leaving on their payroll record so this is sent to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> when you report your payroll information</li>
  <li>indicate the trivial commutation type on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>
    <ul>
      <li>A: Trivial commutation lump sum (<abbr title="Trivial commutation lump sum">TCLS</abbr>)</li>
      <li>B: Other lump sum (from personal pension schemes)</li>
      <li>C: Other lump sum (lump sum from occupational/public service pension schemes)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>enter on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>
    <ul>
      <li>the total amount of the lump sum, or sums, paid in the ‘trivial commutation payment’ field</li>
      <li>the taxable element of the lump sum, or sums, paid in the ‘taxable pay to date’ and the ‘taxable pay in this period’ fields</li>
      <li>any non-taxable element of the lump sum, or sums, paid in the ‘non tax or <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> payment’ field</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Where payments are made to the same individual from separate pension pots, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>report these separately</li>
  <li>use separate payroll ID’s for each payment and complete the appropriate fields on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> – these can be reported on the same date or on different dates</li>
  <li>use different end dates if both are ‘one-off’ payments where both pots are being emptied</li>
</ul>

<h4>Commutation payment where pension payments haven’t started</h4>

<p>In these cases:</p>

<ul>

<h4>2.2.6 Pension Payment schemes</h4>

<p>This section covers the following pension payments (read below for a more detailed description of the different Pension Scheme payments):</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#flexipension">Pension flexibility payments relating to registered pension schemes</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#deathpension">Death Benefit payments relating to pension schemes</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#illhealthpension">Serious Ill Health payments relating to pension schemes</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Payments relating to registered pension schemes where a person has flexibly accessed their funds</h4>

<p>People will be counted as flexibly accessing their pension if they receive any of the following on or after 6 April 2015 a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>payment from a flexi-access drawdown fund – this includes a
    <ul>
      <li>pre-6 April 2015 drawdown pension fund where the member had made a valid notification for flexible drawdown before that date, the fund automatically becomes a flexi-access drawdown fund from 6 April 2015</li>
      <li>capped drawdown fund that existed before 6 April 2015 where the scheme has accepted the member’s notification that the fund is to become a flexi-access drawdown fund</li>
      <li>capped drawdown fund that existed before 6 April 2015 where the payment exceeds the 150% cap</li>
      <li>new flexi-access drawdown fund set up on or after 6 April 2015</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><abbr title="Uncrystallised Funds Pension Lump Sums">UFPLS</abbr></li>
  <li>payment under a flexible annuity contract where the member became entitled to the annuity on or after 6 April 2015</li>
  <li>payment from a money purchase scheme pension where there are fewer than 11 other pension members who became entitled to the scheme pension on or after 6 April 2015</li>
  <li>‘stand-alone’ lump sum from a money purchase arrangement where the individual was entitled to primary protection but was not also entitled to enhanced protection</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a payment of this kind is received it’s taxable (in whole or part) as pension income, and tax must be deducted from the taxable amount through <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> (and reported under <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>).</p>

<p>Pension Scheme Members can flexibly-access the whole or part of the funds in their Pension Scheme.</p>

<h4>Death Benefit payments relating to pension schemes</h4>

<p>Where certain death benefit lump sum payments are received it’s taxable as pension income and tax must be deducted from the taxable amount through <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> (and reported under <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>). These will be paid either lump sum or as an income stream.</p>

<p>More information about the tax treatment of death benefit payments can be found on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/pensions-tax-manual">The Pensions Tax Manual (<abbr title="Pensions Tax Manual">PTM</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<h4>Serious Ill Health payments relating to pension schemes</h4>

<p>If a member is suffering from serious ill-health then, provided certain conditions are met, the scheme administrator may commute any pension entitlement under an arrangement as a lump sum. This is referred to in the legislation as a serious ill-health lump sum.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/pensions-tax-manual/ptm063400">Member benefits: lump sums: serious ill-health lump sum</a> sets out the conditions that must be met for a payment to be a serious ill-health lump sum.</p>

<p>In all cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>treat the payment in the same way as other pension payments, and operate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> in the normal way</li>
  <li>tax must be deducted using emergency code on a week 1 or month 1 basis (unless you already have a tax code for the current tax year from the individuals P45, in which case you should operate that code on a week 1 or month 1 basis)</li>
</ul>

<p>For all new flexibly accessed/death benefit/serious ill health pension payments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>set up a new payroll record</li>
  <li>include the date the pension started with the first pension payment</li>
  <li>include the annual amount of the occupational pension with the first pension payment, don’t pro rata it from the start date.</li>
</ul>

<p>For death benefit pension payments where the payment is all ‘non-taxable’ enter 0.00 into the annual amount of occupational pension field and only where this occurs remove the start date previously entered.</p>

<p>Where payments are made to the same individual from separate pension pots for example, where an individual is receiving both a lump sum death benefit and a flexi access drawdown or a capped drawdown or annuity payment you should report these separately:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you should use separate payroll ID’s for each payment and complete the appropriate fields on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>these can be reported on the same date or on different dates</li>
  <li>if both are ‘one-off’ payments where both pots are being emptied you must use different end dates</li>
</ul>

<p>Enter on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the taxable element of the lump sum, or sums, paid in the ‘taxable pay to date’ and the ‘taxable pay in this period’ fields</li>
  <li>where payments are made by BACS any non-taxable element of the lump sum, or sums, paid in the ‘non tax or <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> payment’ field (data item 58A)</li>
  <li>indicate ‘Yes’ in the occupational pension indicator field on the first and every payment</li>
  <li>indicate ‘Yes’ in the ‘Irregular employment’ indicator field on the first and every payment</li>
  <li>indicate ‘yes’ in the appropriate data item:
    <ul>
      <li>168 ‘Flexibly accessing pension rights’ field</li>
      <li>171 ‘Pension death benefit’ field</li>
      <li>172 ‘Serious ill health benefit’ field</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>‘Taxable Payment’ (Data item 173) – enter the taxable element of the flexible accessed payment</li>
  <li>‘Non-taxable payment’ (Data item 174) – enter the non-taxable element of the flexible accessed pension payment</li>
  <li>for death benefit pension payments where the taxable amount reported is 0.00 enter 0T in the ‘tax code operated on this payment’ field and indicate ‘yes’ in week 1 or month 1 field</li>
</ul>

<p>And then depending on the type of payment:</p>

<p>1) If the whole fund is withdrawn or it’s a one-off lump sum payment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Pay Frequency’, select ‘One-Off’</li>
  <li>complete form P45, including the taxable flexible access payment, and give it to the member</li>
  <li>enter the date of payment as the date of leaving on their payroll record so this is sent to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> when you report your payroll information</li>
  <li>remember to indicate ‘Yes’ in the ‘Irregular employment’ indicator field</li>
  <li>remember to indicate ‘Yes’ in the occupational pension indicator field</li>
</ul>

<p>2) If part of the fund is withdrawn and/or pension payments are irregular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Pay frequency’, select ‘Irregular’</li>
  <li>remember to indicate ‘Yes’ in the occupational pension indicator field</li>
  <li>remember to indicate ‘Yes’ in the ‘Irregular employment’ indicator field</li>
</ul>

<p>3) If part of the fund is withdrawn and/or payments are regular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Pay frequency’, select ‘annual’</li>
  <li>remember to indicate ‘Yes’ in the occupational pension indicator field</li>
  <li>remember to indicate ‘Yes’ in the ‘Irregular employment’ indicator field</li>
</ul>

<p>4) Where further funds are withdrawn:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use the same pay frequency and indicators as previously reported</li>
  <li>remember to indicate ‘Yes’ in the occupational pension indicator field</li>
  <li>remember to indicate ‘Yes’ in the ‘Irregular employment’ indicator field</li>
</ul>

<p>5) Once the whole of the fund has been withdrawn on the final payment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enter the date of payment as the date of leaving on their payroll record</li>
  <li>complete form P45, including the pension payment, and give it to the member</li>
  <li>remember to indicate ‘Yes’ in the occupational pension indicator field</li>
  <li>remember to indicate ‘Yes’ in the ‘Irregular employment’ indicator field</li>
</ul>

<p>For both <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes <abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr>, <abbr title="Statutory Maternity Pay">SMP</abbr>, <abbr title="Statutory Adoption Pay">SAP</abbr>, <abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr> and <abbr title="Statutory Shared Parental Pay">ShPP</abbr> must be included in gross pay at the time it’s paid. <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are then worked out in the normal way.</p>

<h4>2.3.2 Payments of <abbr title="Statutory Maternity Pay">SMP</abbr>, <abbr title="Statutory Adoption Pay">SAP</abbr>, <abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr> and <abbr title="Statutory Shared Parental Pay">ShPP</abbr> to an employee after their contract of service has ended</h4>

<h4>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>If you pay <abbr title="Statutory Maternity Pay">SMP</abbr>, <abbr title="Statutory Adoption Pay">SAP</abbr>, <abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr> or <abbr title="Statutory Shared Parental Pay">ShPP</abbr> to an employee after their contract of service has ended and you pay it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in a lump sum: work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> using a weekly earnings period unless the lump sum is paid with the last regular payment of earnings, in that case, add the 2 payments together and work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> using the earnings period used before the employee left</li>
  <li>at the same interval as regular earnings, work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> using the earnings period used before the employee left</li>
  <li>at different intervals from regular earnings – work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> using the interval between payments</li>
</ul>

<h4>For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>Strictly speaking if the employee is dismissed or has decided not to exercise their right to return to work you should give them form P45 when they stop working for you. You should deduct <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> using code 0T on a week 1 or month 1 basis from any <abbr title="Statutory Maternity Pay">SMP</abbr>, <abbr title="Statutory Adoption Pay">SAP</abbr>, <abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr> or <abbr title="Statutory Shared Parental Pay">ShPP</abbr> you pay afterwards.</p>

<p>However, provided the employee doesn’t request a P45, you can deduct <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> from the payments of <abbr title="Statutory Maternity Pay">SMP</abbr>, <abbr title="Statutory Adoption Pay">SAP</abbr>, <abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr> or <abbr title="Statutory Shared Parental Pay">ShPP</abbr> using their normal tax code and delay completion of form P45 until you’ve made the final payment. If you do this, enter as the date of leaving on the P45 the date on which you make the final payment.</p>

<p>If an employee requests a P45, you should enter as the date of leaving the date on which you last made a payment of <abbr title="Statutory Maternity Pay">SMP</abbr>, <abbr title="Statutory Adoption Pay">SAP</abbr>, <abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr> or <abbr title="Statutory Shared Parental Pay">ShPP</abbr> prior to the request and deduct <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> using code 0T on a week 1 or month 1 basis from all future payments you make.</p>

<p>If the employee has not been dismissed or has not told you that they don’t intend to return to work, they remain your employee even after you make the final payment of <abbr title="Statutory Maternity Pay">SMP</abbr>, <abbr title="Statutory Adoption Pay">SAP</abbr>, <abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr> or <abbr title="Statutory Shared Parental Pay">ShPP</abbr> until either they:</p>

  <li>fail to return to work on the appointed day at which time you should complete form P45</li>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Payments paid ‘free of tax or <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>’</h3>

<h4>2.4.1 All of an employee’s earnings paid ‘free of tax’</h4>

<p>If you enter into an arrangement with an employee that all of his or her earnings are to be paid ‘cash in hand’ or ‘free of tax’, you should note that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it’s your responsibility to make sure that your employee understands and agrees with the terms under which the payment is made ‘free of tax’</li>
  <li>payments made ‘free of tax’ can increase your costs</li>
  <li>there are extra <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> duties involved</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the tax due is worked out by reference to the ‘true gross pay’, not the amount your employee is actually paid. It’s your responsibility to work out the ‘true gross pay’ figure. If you agree to make any payments that are free of tax, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/paying-employees-cash-in-hand-or-guaranteed-take-home-pay">Paying employees cash in hand or guaranteed take home pay
</a>.</p>

<h4>2.4.2 All of an employee’s earnings paid ‘free of tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>’</h4>

<p>If you enter into an arrangement with an employee that all of his or her earnings are to be paid ‘free of tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>’, you should contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="#emphelp">Employer Helpline</a> for advice.</p>

<h4>2.4.3 Part of an employee’s earnings paid ‘free of tax’</h4>

<p>If you enter into an agreement with an employee that only part of his or her earnings are to be paid ‘free of tax’, the figure to enter on your employee’s payroll record to calculate the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due is the total of the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘true gross pay’ of the ‘free of tax’ element of the earnings</li>
  <li>actual gross pay of the part of the earnings that haven’t been paid free of tax</li>
</ul>

<p>To work out the ‘true gross pay’ of the ‘free of tax’ element, you should use the following formula:</p>

<p>‘Free of Tax’ element of pay x 100 (100 - employee’s tax rate figure)<br> 
(the tax rate figure depends on which tax table you use for the employee).</p>

<p>If you use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Table B - the figure is 20 - basic rate<br>
</li>
  <li>Table D1 - the figure is 40 - higher rate or<br>
</li>
  <li>Table D2 - the figure is 45 - additional rate</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>You enter into an agreement to pay an employee a wage of £150 and £15 ‘free of tax’ towards travelling expenses. The employee is a Table B employee.</p>

<p>The figure to use to calculate the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due is the total of the ‘true gross pay’ of the ‘free of tax’ element.</p>

<p>£15 x 100 ÷ (100 - 20) = £18.75</p>

<p>The actual gross pay not within the ‘free of tax’ agreement = £150.00 Figure to be entered on your payroll records to calculate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> £168.75</p>

<h4>2.4.4 Part of an employee’s earnings paid ‘free of tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>’</h4>

<p>If you enter into an agreement with an employee that only part of his or her earnings are to be paid ‘free of tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>’, you should contact us for advice on how to work out the amount of <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due.</p>

<h4>2.4.5 Agreement to pay an employee’s share of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>
</h4>

<p>You should contact us if you decide to pay the employee’s share of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on his or her behalf. That is, you agree to pay the employee’s contributions yourself rather than deduct them from the employee’s pay.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> Payroll Giving – an easy way to give</h3>

<p>Payroll Giving is a voluntary scheme that allows employees to give money to any UK-registered charity direct from their pay and get tax relief on the donations they make. Employers who currently offer the scheme say they find it easy to run and valuable for promoting good employee and community relations.</p>

<p>You can get tax relief for the costs of administering the scheme. Agencies usually recover their costs by making a deduction from the donations they handle but, if you choose to fund any of the agency’s costs, or match your employees’ donations, you can get relief for that as well.</p>

<p>If you already offer Payroll Giving, remember that employees are entitled only to tax relief, not relief from <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>

<p>When completing your payroll records, therefore, you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>deduct the amount of the authorised donation from the employees’ gross pay for <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</li>
  <li>don’t deduct the amount of the authorised donation from the employee’s gross pay for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span> Incentive Awards</h3>

<p>Employees may receive incentive awards from you the employer, or a third party.</p>

<p>Awards may be made in cash, goods, holidays, prizes and so on, or vouchers exchangeable for them.</p>

<p>An example of a third party making awards is where in the course of a sales promotion, the manufacturer of the product gives awards to salespersons whose direct employer is actually selling the product in question.</p>

<h4>2.6.1 Cash awards and awards made by voucher which can be exchanged for cash</h4>

<h4>Cash awards</h4>

<p>If you provide a cash award, the value of that award must be included in the employee’s gross pay and <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> worked out on it in the normal way.</p>

<p>If a third party provides a cash award, the third party is responsible for deducting <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> from the award and should seek advice on what to do from us. The value of that award must also be reported to you to enable you to account for the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due.</p>

<h4>Awards made by voucher which can be exchanged for cash</h4>

<p>If you, or a third party, award a cash voucher you, as the contractual employer must include the value of that cash voucher in the employee’s gross pay and work out <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> in the normal way.</p>

<h4>Recording and reporting for cash awards and vouchers exchangeable for cash</h4>

<p>Include the amount in the field ‘pay subject to Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>’ on the employee’s payroll record and if it’s cash, also include the amount in the field ‘taxable pay in this pay period’. Then report these figures to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> by sending an <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>.</p>

<h4>2.6.2 Non-cash awards and vouchers which can’t be exchanged for cash</h4>

<h4>For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>If you provide the award, you can either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fill in the gross value of the award on form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-end-of-year-expenses-and-benefits-p11d">P11D</a>, or you can payroll if you’ve registered to payroll prior to 6 April 2017</li>
  <li>account for the tax by
    <ul>
      <li>entering into a Taxed Award Scheme (<abbr title="Taxed Award Scheme">TAS</abbr>) (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para267">paragraph 2.6.7</a>) the value of the award grossed at the basic or higher rate of tax</li>
      <li>entering into a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Settlement Agreement (<abbr title="PAYE Settlement Agreement">PSA</abbr>) (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec5">Section 5</a>) to pay in a lump sum the tax on the value of the award grossed up by reference to the employee’s rate of tax</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a third party provides the award they can only account for the tax by entering into a <abbr title="Taxed Award Scheme">TAS</abbr>.
Promoters who sell incentive schemes or operate them for others can’t account for tax on awards except those made for their own employees.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<h4>Non-cash awards other than non-cash vouchers</h4>

<p>Some non-cash awards attract Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and others Class 1A <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para51">paragraph 5.1</a> for details. You, the employer, are liable for any Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> even if a third party provides the awards to your employees. But, where the award attracts a Class 1A <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> liability, the third party is liable unless you arrange or facilitate the provision of the award.</p>

<p>They can account for the Class 1A <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> by entering into a <abbr title="Taxed Award Scheme">TAS</abbr>. For more advice, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cwg5-class-1a-national-insurance-contributions-on-benefits-in-kind/2016-class-1a-national-insurance-contributions-on-benefits-in-kind#part6">Part 6 – Third party benefits</a> within the CWG5 (2017).</p>

<p>Guidance on the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> to record and report can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/employee-incentive-awards">Employee incentive awards</a> under the heading ‘<abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on non-cash awards other than non-cash vouchers’.</p>

<h4>Non-cash vouchers</h4>

<p>Payments made by way of non-cash vouchers, with certain exemptions (see below), attract liability for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>. Unless exempt, a payment which is derived from the employee’s employment, made by you or by a third party under arrangement with you, must be included in gross pay and Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> accounted for in the normal way. That is, you must add the cost to you in providing those non-cash vouchers to any other earnings paid in the earnings period and work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the total.</p>

<p>You must report the value of the non–cash voucher and send an <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> to report these figures to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> at the time the voucher is provided, even if this is before the employee’s main pay is paid.</p>

<p>Include the amount in the fields for both ‘pay subject to Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>’ and ‘benefits on which Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are due’ on the employee’s payroll record, and send an <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> to report these figures to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>You don’t have to calculate or report any <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> for the pay period until the last payment is made in the same period. Then, you must add the value of the award to the employee’s pay that was paid in the same period the award was made and assess the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due on this revised figure. Deduct the employee’s share of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> from any cash earnings you pay them, update your payroll records and send an <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> to report them to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. Pay the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due on the revised gross pay figure.</p>

<p>Most non–cash vouchers provided by third parties, where the direct employer doesn’t arrange or facilitate the provision, are excluded from Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>. They’re liable for Class 1A <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> which is payable by the third party. For more details, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cwg5-class-1a-national-insurance-contributions-on-benefits-in-kind">CWG5 (2017): Class 1A National Insurance contributions on benefits in kind</a>.</p>

<p>However, vouchers provided by third parties in connection with the provision of Readily Convertible Assets (<abbr title="Readily Convertible Asset">RCA</abbr>) (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec5">Section 5</a>) always attract Class 1 liability and the direct employer is responsible for the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Employer pays an employee’s tax</h4>

<p>If, in addition to making an award, you pay all or part of an employee’s tax due on that award, the tax paid must also be included in the employee’s gross pay when calculating Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>. This is the case regardless of whether the tax is accounted for through a <abbr title="Taxed Award Scheme">TAS</abbr>. You must include the amount of tax paid in the employee’s gross pay at the time the tax is paid over to the accounts office.</p>

<h4>Third party pays an employee’s tax</h4>

<p>You should also include tax paid on an employee’s behalf by a third party where the tax is in relation to cash payments, cash vouchers or benefits in kind subject to Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> which the third party has provided to your employees.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions below for how to calculate, record, and report the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due on the amount of tax you paid.</p>

<p>Where the tax is in relation to benefits in kind or non-cash vouchers, which are subject to Class 1A <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, the third party will be responsible for paying Class 1A <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the amount of tax paid if they’ve arranged or facilitated the provision of the benefit or non-cash voucher. The third party will also have to account for that payment through a <abbr title="Taxed Award Scheme">TAS</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Calculating, recording and reporting <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Include the value of the tax paid on behalf of the employee, whether it was you or someone else who paid it for them, in ‘pay subject to Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>’ on their payroll record and report this to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> on an <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>. Do this when the tax is paid to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, even if this is before the employee’s main pay is paid in that pay period.</p>

<p>You don’t have to calculate or report any <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> for the pay period until the last payment to that employee is made in the same period. Then, you must add the value of the award to the employee’s pay that was paid in the same period the award was made and assess the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due on this revised figure. Deduct the employee’s share of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> from any cash earnings you pay them, update your payroll records and send an <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> to report them to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. Pay the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due on the revised gross pay figure.</p>

<h4><abbr title="PAYE Settlement Agreement">PSAs</abbr></h4>

<p>It’s acceptable for <abbr title="PAYE Settlement Agreement">PSAs</abbr> to include non-cash voucher awards you give to your employees as long as they’re ‘minor’ or ‘irregular’. In that event Class 1B <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> rather than Class 1 or Class 1A <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> will be due. If you’ve such an agreement and are in any doubt as to whether you’re complying with the terms of it, get in touch with us.</p>

<p>For more information about liability for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on items included in <abbr title="PAYE Settlement Agreement">PSAs</abbr>, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec5">Section 5</a>.</p>

<h4>Apportionment</h4>

<p>If an award is made for the benefit of more than one employee, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para265">paragraph 2.6.5</a> for details of how to apportion the award between those employees for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes.</p>

<h4>2.6.3 Valuing cash vouchers for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>Cash vouchers are vouchers that can be exchanged for an amount of money which isn’t much less than the expense the employer or third party incurs in providing them. The amount to include in gross pay is the surrender value of the voucher.</p>

<h4>2.6.4 Valuing non-cash vouchers for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>The ‘value’ of a non-cash voucher is, apart from 2 exceptions, the cost to you in providing it. If a third party is providing it, then it’s the cost to that third party. The cost in providing a non-cash voucher isn’t normally the face value unless, exceptionally, the cost in providing it and its face value are the same.</p>

<p>The exceptions are luncheon vouchers and childcare vouchers for which the ‘value’ is the face value of the voucher.</p>

<p>The ‘cost’ in providing a non-cash voucher includes the cost of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>buying the goods or providing the services</li>
  <li>selecting and testing those goods or services</li>
  <li>storing, distributing and installing the goods or services</li>
  <li>servicing and other ‘after sales’ expenses</li>
</ul>

<p>As such, a non-cash voucher is valued for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes in the same way as for tax.</p>

<h4>2.6.5 Apportioning the value of vouchers between employees for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>If you provide a voucher which attracts a <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> liability for the benefit of more than one employee, the value of the voucher must be apportioned between those employees. You must include in each employee’s gross pay the proportionate amount of the total value each employee enjoys.</p>

<p>If you’re unable to determine the correct proportionate amounts, you must split the total value equally and include that amount in each employee’s gross pay.</p>

<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>An employer buys a retail voucher at a cost of £300. They provide the voucher to 3 employees with the intention that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>employee A will receive 50% of the voucher’s value</li>
  <li>employee B will receive 30% and</li>
  <li>employee C will receive 20%</li>
</ul>

<p>The amount of earnings to be included in each employee’s gross pay is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>employee A – £300 x 50% = £150</li>
  <li>employee B – £300 x 30% = £90</li>
  <li>employee C – £300 x 20% = £60</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>An employer buys a retail voucher at a cost of £300. They provide the voucher to 3 employees with the intention each employee will receive an equal amount of the voucher’s value.</p>

<p>The amount of earnings to be included in each employee’s gross pay is: £300 ÷ 3 = £100 each.</p>

<h4>2.6.6 Non-cash vouchers exempt from <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>
</h4>

<p>The following types of non-cash voucher, provided to an employee, are exempt from <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> liability:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for leave travel facilities for members of Her Majesty’s forces</li>
  <li>for use to obtain fuel for a company car where a car fuel tax charge arises on that provision</li>
  <li>for motoring expenses for a van provided for private use where a tax charge arises on that provision</li>
  <li>for sports and recreational facilities so long as those facilities are available generally to all employees</li>
  <li>long service awards so long as the
    <ul>
      <li>length of service isn’t less than 20 years, and</li>
      <li>cost of providing the voucher isn’t more than £50 for each year of service and</li>
      <li>employee concerned has not received another long service award within the preceding 10 years</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>social functions, such as a Christmas party, so long as the
    <ul>
      <li>function is open to all employees, and</li>
      <li>cost of providing the voucher isn’t more than £150 a head</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>for travel by any means between home and work by an employee who is disabled</li>
  <li>for the hiring of a cycle or cyclist’s safety equipment so long as the
    <ul>
      <li>facility is available to all employees and</li>
      <li>cycle or equipment is used mainly for journeys from home to work</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>until the 5th April 2011, the first £55 a week of childcare vouchers provided to cover all or part of the cost and expenses of childcare where all conditions are met the childcare
    <ul>
      <li>is for a child or children up to 1 September after their 15th birthday (or 1 September after their 16th birthday if the child is disabled)</li>
      <li>is for a child of the employee or a child who lives with the employee for whom they’ve responsibility</li>
      <li>is registered or approved childcare</li>
      <li>vouchers are provided as part of a scheme available to all of your employees or all of your employees at a location where the scheme is offered</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>From 6 April 2011 changes were made to the rules about providing vouchers to employees for childcare. For those new to a childcare voucher scheme from that date the amount that is disregarded for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes is £55 a week for ordinary rate tax payers £28 for higher rate tax payers and £25 for additional rate tax payers.</p>

<p>From April 2011 employer supported childcare is exempt from <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> in line with the tax treatment under S318 and S318A-D <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/1/contents" rel="external">Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (<abbr title="Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act">ITEPA</abbr>)</a>. So long as the qualifying conditions are satisfied, <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are only payable on the cost of the childcare which exceeds the exempt amount.</p>

<p>It’s the responsibility of the employer to determine the tax liability of the employee before awarding vouchers so that they know how much can correctly be disregarded.</p>

<p>For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/employer-supported-childcare">Employer Supported Childcare</a>:</p>

<p>Under a <abbr title="Taxed Award Scheme">TAS</abbr>, providers will have to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>agree in advance how the awards are to be valued</li>
  <li>sign a contract with us under which they have to account for tax on the value of the awards grossed up at the appropriate rate</li>
  <li>make returns on the awards – note that the returns differ for basic rate and higher rate schemes – less information is needed for higher rate schemes</li>
  <li>give each employee receiving an award under a higher rate scheme a certificate showing the value of the award and the amount of tax paid on it – for basic rate schemes certificates need only be given to employees who request them</li>
</ul>

<p>Employers who use the <abbr title="Taxed Award Scheme">TAS</abbr> arrangements for incentive awards, and third parties who provide such awards, can report liability for Class 1A <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and account for the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> through the <abbr title="Taxed Award Scheme">TAS</abbr> arrangements. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cwg5-class-1a-national-insurance-contributions-on-benefits-in-kind">CWG5v(2017): Class 1A National Insurance contributions on benefits in kind</a> and the explanatory notes in the <abbr title="Taxed Award Scheme">TAS</abbr> information pack.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.7Holiday </span> pay</h3>

<p>This section describes the special rules for working out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and deducting <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> on certain types of holiday payments.</p>

<h4>2.7.1 Holiday pay in the construction industry and similar schemes</h4>

<p>The following information relates to schemes for holiday pay in the construction industry or similar schemes when a group of employers contribute to a central, independently managed holiday pay fund (such as electrical contracting, heating, ventilation and domestic engineering industries).</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>Include in gross pay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all holiday pay that is paid by you</li>
  <li>the cost of holiday pay stamps or credits from an unapproved scheme, these must be treated as pay at the time when they’re allocated to the employee</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t include in gross pay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the cost of holiday pay stamps or credits which are issued under a scheme approved by us</li>
  <li>any holiday pay that is paid under an approved scheme by the fund itself – in these cases the fund will deduct tax on this at the basic rate and give the employee a Certificate of Tax Deducted and make their own <abbr title="End of Year">EOY</abbr> return to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>Employment law instructs employers in the obligation of providing paid holidays to their employees, so each employer must calculate and pay their employee the payment due to them when taking holiday during the period of that employment. How to work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on holiday pay is described at <a class="govuk-link" href="#para275">paragraph 2.7.5</a>.</p>

<h4>2.7.2 Holiday pay from money set aside during the year</h4>

<p>For holiday pay made up of amounts voluntarily set aside from your employees’ pay during the year to be paid at a certain time, for example, Christmas or their annual holiday, for both <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes include the amount set aside in gross pay at the time it’s set aside.</p>

<h4>2.7.3 Holiday pay from a holiday credit scheme</h4>

<p>For holiday pay from a holiday credit scheme when money is set aside each payday to be paid in a lump sum when your employees take their holidays, for both <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes, include these amounts in gross pay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at the time they’re set aside if your employees have a right to be paid the money at any time</li>
  <li>when the payment is actually made if your employees can only have the money when they take their holiday</li>
</ul>

<p>In both cases, the figures must be included in their payroll record and sent to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> on your <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> when you report your payroll information.</p>

<h4>2.7.4 Working out <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> on holiday pay</h4>

<p>You should normally work out <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> using the tax tables for the week in which the holiday pay is paid and record it on the employee’s payroll record.</p>

<p>However, if the effect of the holiday pay is that the employee gets 2 or more weeks’ pay in one week and no pay in the following week(s) then you should account for <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax in the following way:</p>

<h4>For employees with a cumulative tax code</h4>

<p>If your employee is on a cumulative tax code, calculate and record the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax using the free pay for the last week in which no pay is received. For example, if an employee is on holiday in weeks 16 and 17 and the wages for those weeks are paid in week 15, together with the pay for week 15, <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax should be calculated on the holiday pay using week 17.</p>

<p>You must report the payment on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> in the week you make the payment. For the ‘Number of earnings period(s) covered by the payment’ on your <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>, in this example, you would enter ‘3’.</p>

<h4>For employees with a week 1 or month 1 tax code</h4>

<p>Where <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> is being worked out on a week 1 or month 1 basis, split the pay equally between the full weeks of the holiday and work out and record <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> on each amount separately for each week. You should report the payment on an <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> in the week that you make the payment. The total amount of <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> due for these weeks is the amount you should deduct from the total holiday pay.</p>

<h4>For employees leaving employment after their holiday</h4>

<p>If your employee will be leaving or retiring straight after their holiday, then work out the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax due on their holiday pay using the free pay for the week in which you pay it to them. You should report the payment on an <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> in the week that you make the payment.</p>

<h4>2.7.5 Working out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on holiday pay</h4>

<p>If weekly paid employees receive a payment which covers more than one week and it’s, or includes, holiday pay, you can work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> using one of 2 methods.</p>

<h4>Method A</h4>

<p>Split the sum up and work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the payment for each week separately.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>On the last payday before their holiday, you pay employees their ordinary weekly wage plus 2 weeks’ holiday pay.</p>

<p>Work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on each week’s pay separately and record them in the corresponding weeks on the employee’s payroll record.</p>

<h4>Method B</h4>

<p>Work out the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the whole sum based on the number of weeks it represents. Round up parts of a week.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>On the last payday before their holiday, you pay employees their ordinary weekly wage plus 2 weeks’ holiday pay.</p>

<h4>National Insurance Tables used to work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on a 3 week basis by dividing the total earnings on which <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are payable by 3, looking up this figure in the appropriate weekly table and multiplying the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> shown in the table by 3.</p>

<h4>Exact percentage method used to work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Any of the following methods for calculating <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> is acceptable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apply the 3 weekly Lower and <abbr title="Upper Earnings Limit">UEL</abbr> and Primary, Secondary and <abbr title="Upper Secondary Threshold">UST</abbr> to the total payment and round the resulting <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> figures to the nearest penny, rounding down exact amounts of £0.005, in the normal way</li>
  <li>divide the total payment by 3 to establish the average weekly earnings, work out the weekly <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> figures, round to the nearest penny, rounding down exact amounts of £0.005, then multiply the answers by 3 to get the total <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due</li>
  <li>divide the total payment by 3 to establish the average weekly earnings, work out the weekly <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> figures, multiply the answers by 3, then round to the nearest penny, rounding down exact amounts of £0.005, to get the total <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due</li>
</ul>

<h4>Method B can also be used:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>for employees who are paid at intervals which are multiples of a week, for example, fortnightly or 4 weekly, but if you use the exact percentage method to work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> you must use method A</li>
  <li>even if the employee doesn’t take the holiday but carries on working</li>
</ul>

<h4>Method B can’t be used:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>for monthly paid employees</li>
  <li>if holiday pay is from a holiday pay scheme in the construction industry or similar scheme</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don’t calculate holiday pay based on the length of the holiday but in some other way, for example, according to an employee’s length of service, treat the amount of holiday pay as spread evenly over the period of the paid holiday.</p>

<h4>Holiday pay paid in advance and the employee stays at work</h4>

<p>If an employee stays at work instead of taking their holiday and you’ve already worked out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the holiday pay, the additional <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due on their wages for working is dependent on how the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the holiday pay were calculated.</p>

<h4>If Method A was used:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>add together the pay now due and the holiday pay already paid for that week and work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the total amount</li>
  <li>subtract from the amount of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> calculated the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> already paid on the holiday pay for that week to get the amount of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> now due</li>
  <li>amend the employee’s payroll record to reflect the new figures</li>
</ul>

<h4>If Method B was used:</h4>

<p>Don’t add the holiday pay to the pay due for working but work out and record <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> separately on the pay due for working in the normal way.</p>

<h4>Holidays taken some time after the holiday pay is received</h4>

<p>If weekly paid employees don’t take their holiday until some time after receiving the pay for it, for example, a security guard who receives their holiday pay before the employer’s annual close down but stays on duty and takes the holiday later, work out and record <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the holiday pay at the time it’s actually paid.</p>

<h4>Holiday pay in advance or arrears</h4>

<p>If holiday pay is paid in advance or arrears and the actual date of payment and the usual payday are in different tax years and you’re using Method A, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para32">paragraph 3.2</a>.</p>

<h4>2.7.6 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on payments due to be paid during a holiday period</h4>

<p>If payments are due to be paid during a holiday period, the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due on the payment are dependent on how <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> were worked out on the holiday pay for the week in which payment is due to be made.</p>

<p>For example, an employee is due to be paid for overtime worked but because of the payroll arrangements the overtime doesn’t become payable until the employee is on holiday.</p>

<p>If Method A was used to work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the holiday pay, regardless of the week in which the payment is actually made:</p>

<ul>
  <li>treat the payment as belonging to the week in which it would normally have been made (had the employee not been on holiday)</li>
  <li>add the payment to the holiday pay due for that week</li>
  <li>work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the total</li>
  <li>take into account the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> already paid on the holiday pay for that week</li>
  <li>adjust the employee’s payroll record to reflect the correct <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> figures</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if the payment is actually made in a different tax year from the one in which it was due to be made, work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> separately on the payment based on the contribution rates and limits current at the time of payment.</p>

<p>If Method B was used to work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the holiday pay, and if payment is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>actually made in the week in which it was due to be made treat it separately from the holiday pay due for that week and work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on it in the normal way</li>
  <li>made at a later date for example, when the employee returns to work, add it to the payment due for that period and work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the total</li>
</ul>

<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>These examples are based on 2016 to 2017 contribution rates and limits for an employee paying <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> under category letter A. <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are worked out using the exact percentage method.</p>

<p>On 31 July the employee is paid<br>
Basic wages for working 25 July to 29 July = £205<br>
plus holiday pay for 31 July to 5 August = £155<br>
plus holiday pay for 6 to 12 August = £155<br>
Total = £515</p>

<p>On 19 August the employee is paid basic wages for working 15 to 19 August = £205</p>

<p>The employee worked overtime during the week 25 July and was due to receive the overtime payment of £80 on 5 August.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.8 </span> Tips, gratuities, service charges and troncs</h3>

<p>A tip or gratuity is an uncalled for and spontaneous payment offered by a customer either in cash, as part of a cheque payment, or as a specific gratuity on a credit/debit card slip.</p>

<p>A service charge is an amount added to a customer’s bill before it’s presented to the customer. If it’s made clear to the customer that the charge is a purely discretionary amount and that there’s no obligation to pay, the payment is a voluntary service charge. Where that isn’t the case, the payment is a compulsory service charge.
To establish the correct <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> treatment of the payments described above, you must identify both the nature of the payment and the arrangements under which it’s paid.</p>

<p><abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> isn’t due if cash tips are received directly from customers by your employees and are retained by them, and the monies never pass through your hands. Such tips are, however, taxable directly on the employee who should tell us the amounts they’ve received. Your employees should declare the money to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> who will usually adjust their tax code to collect any tax due.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>If, as an employer, you operate a scheme that pays your employees a share of tips/gratuities (including cash tips received by employees and handed to you by the employees for sharing) or service charges (whether voluntary or mandatory) you must include the amount paid to each employee in their gross pay and deduct <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> accordingly.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and tronc schemes</h4>

<p>A tronc is a separate organised pay arrangement used to distribute tips, gratuities and service charges. You must tell us when you first become aware of the existence of a tronc, telling us the troncmaster’s name and the arrangements in place.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> are satisfied that there’s a tronc scheme for sharing tips/gratuities and service charges then we’ll set up a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme in the troncmaster’s name. The troncmaster is responsible for operating <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> on all payments made from the tronc, including any share of cash tips. The troncmaster, or someone on their behalf, will need to operate a computerised payroll system and report payroll information to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> when or before the payments are made to employees.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>If you impose a mandatory service charge and the money is paid out to your employees, <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are due on the payments no matter what arrangements are in place to share out the money.
If your employees receive tips/gratuities/voluntary service charges you should use the flowchart right to decide if <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are due.</p>

<p>Where <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are due, the responsibility for working out and recording the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> will always be yours, as the employer.</p>

<p>If a troncmaster makes a payment to your employees on which <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are due, make sure you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>know the amount being paid and the date(s) of payment</li>
  <li>include the payments in gross pay when working out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>update the employee’s payroll record accordingly and ensure the information is reported to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The troncmaster should record the amounts on which <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are due separately from any tips or gratuities on which <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> aren’t payable.</p>

<p>If you’re not satisfied with the arrangements, it may be advisable to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>share out the payments yourself</li>
  <li>get the formula for sharing out the payments put into the job contract</li>
</ul>

<p>It may also be advisable if you take responsibility yourself for paying all earnings to any employee whose basic pay isn’t enough for full deductions of <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> to be made.

<h3>
<span class="number">2.9Employees </span> involved in a trade dispute or lock-out</h3>

<h4>2.9.1 When the special procedures apply and what they entail</h4>

<p>The special procedures must be applied to employees who are absent from work because they’re either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>taking part in a trade dispute</li>
  <li>laid off and have a direct interest in a trade dispute</li>
</ul>

<p>The special procedures for such employees are that you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>must withhold any tax refunds due to the employees for as long as they’re involved in the trade dispute, this applies even if an employee becomes sick after the trade dispute starts</li>
  <li>pay any tax refunds that you’ve withheld only when one of the following circumstances arise, the employee
    <ul>
      <li>returns to work</li>
      <li>leaves your employment</li>
      <li>dies</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>2.9.2 How to decide if an employee is involved in a trade dispute or lock-out</h4>

<p>It’s up to you, the employer, in the first place to decide if an employee is involved in a trade dispute. Make your decision in the same way as you do for a report called for by Jobcentre Plus, and contact them if you’re in any doubt or difficulty.</p>

<p>Where you decide an employee is involved in a trade dispute but he or she disagrees, advise the employee to contact Jobcentre Plus. If they uphold the employee’s view they’ll give the employee written confirmation that he or she isn’t disqualified from receiving Jobseeker’s Allowance for being involved in a trade dispute.</p>

<p>Where an employee produces such written confirmation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you can’t treat the employee as being involved in a trade dispute</li>
  <li>the special procedures don’t apply and you must pay the employee any tax refunds due</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.9.3 Working out <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> during the trade dispute</h4>

<p>If you’re not paying anything to employees involved in a trade dispute you may put off working out their <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> until the earlier of the end of the trade dispute or 5 April. You must indicate on payroll that it’s a trade dispute.</p>

<p>If you do put off working out their <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’ll not be able to deduct from your payments to the accounts office (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para294">paragraph 2.9.4</a> any refunds you’ve withheld)</li>
  <li>where during the dispute an employee leaves your employment or dies, you must work out his or her particular <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> in the normal way, and
    <ul>
      <li>pay any refund due including any refund withheld in a previous tax year</li>
      <li>complete form P45 in the usual way</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re paying anything to employees involved in a trade dispute or you’re not paying them anything but nevertheless choose to work out their <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> calculations in the normal way</li>
  <li>where the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> calculations show that
    <ul>
      <li>a tax refund is due, withhold the refund from the employee</li>
      <li>tax is deductible, make the deduction from any pay the employees are receiving, any tax deductible should be reduced by any tax refund that you’re already withholding from the employee, remember, however, to reduce the amount of refund owed to the employee by the amount used by the set-off</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>2.9.4 Payments to the accounts office during the trade dispute</h4>

<p>During a trade dispute the procedures that apply in relation to the payments you make to the accounts office are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>payments you’ve made to the accounts office for any tax month (or quarter where appropriate) ended before the trade dispute started, aren’t affected by the trade dispute</li>
  <li>you must continue to make your monthly (or quarterly) payments to the accounts office during the trade dispute</li>
  <li>if you’re owed money because you made tax refunds before the dispute started but did not make a claim to the accounts office, you may deduct what you’re owed from any amount you’re due to pay to the accounts office during the trade dispute</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve put off working out the tax refunds due to your employees, you’ll need to do your calculations at the earlier of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the end of the dispute</li>
  <li>when you complete your final submission for the tax year</li>
</ul>

<p>You can then deduct the refunds from the payments to the accounts office and/or claim what you’re owed back from the accounts office, who will deal with the matter urgently.</p>

<p>If you’ve chosen to continue as normal to work out the tax refunds due to your employees you should observe the following procedures when making your monthly (or quarterly) payments to the accounts office:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you may deduct from your payments to the accounts office, any refunds you actually make to employees because they’re no longer involved in the trade dispute (Remember, however, not to deduct from your accounts office payment any amount of withheld refund you’ve previously deducted under the procedure below)</li>
  <li>you may deduct from your payment to the accounts office, but only for the month (or quarter if appropriate) in which the refund arises, any refunds calculated but withheld</li>
  <li>where the amount of withheld refunds exceeds the tax due for that month (or quarter) you may deduct the excess from any payment of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due</li>
  <li>where the amount of withheld refunds exceeds the tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due for that month (or quarter), the excess refunds can’t be deducted from any subsequent payment to the accounts office or be claimed back from the accounts office until the refunds have actually been made to the employees</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.9.5 Trade dispute ends in the same tax year it began</h4>

<p>If the trade dispute ends in the same tax year it began, take the following action:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pay any refunds that you’ve withheld as soon as possible after the employees return to work</li>
  <li>follow the procedure at <a class="govuk-link" href="#para297">paragraph 2.9.7</a> for any employee whose withheld refund you can’t pay</li>
  <li>work out how much you owe to, or are owed by, the accounts office, remember to allow for any deductions from payments to the accounts office that you’ve already made</li>
  <li>where your calculations show that you’re owed by the accounts office you can either
    <ul>
      <li>deduct the amount you’re owed from future payments you make to the accounts office</li>
      <li>claim the money back from the accounts office who will deal with your claim urgently, your claim must be in writing and show how you’ve worked out the amount you’re claiming</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>2.9.6 Procedure at the end of the tax year if the trade dispute has not ended</h4>

<p>You must take the following action at the end of the tax year if the dispute has not ended:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fill in the normal final submission for the year as if you had actually paid the refunds you’re withholding</li>
  <li>complete form P60 to give to the employee, by 31 May and, either
    <ul>
      <li>enter a single figure of tax deducted on form P60 and give the employee a statement of tax withheld on form P61</li>
      <li>give a separate statement on form P60 of the tax withheld and give the employee a form P62</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>continue, for the following tax year, to
    <ul>
      <li>carry out normal <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> calculations</li>
      <li>withhold the tax refunds for as long as the employee is involved in the trade dispute</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can get forms P61 or P62 from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> National Insurance Contributions and Employer Office.</p>

<h4>2.9.7 Procedure for employees whose withheld refunds you can’t pay at the end of the trade dispute</h4>

<p>Where an employee doesn’t return to work at the end of the trade dispute, and you don’t know where he or
she is, you’ll not be able to pay the withheld refund to the employee. You should take the following action in such circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pay to the accounts office any tax you’ve not refunded to an employee within 42 days of the end of the trade dispute</li>
  <li>include the figure of tax not refunded on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>where the final <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> for a year has been submitted you’ll need to submit an <abbr title="Earlier Year Update">EYU</abbr> showing the amount of tax which has not been refunded</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> National Insurance only procedures</h2>

<p>The following guidance applies to all Employers. Guidance for reporting <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> in real time is also available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/employing-people/payroll">Payroll</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1Earnings </span> periods for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h3>

<p>Ordinarily, the earnings period for working out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> is the regular interval between which payments of earnings are made.</p>

<p>The following 5 paragraphs describe how to decide what the earnings period is in different circumstances. The rules described in those paragraphs ordinarily don’t apply to directors. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ca44-national-insurance-for-company-directors">CA44: National Insurance for company directors</a> for details on the earnings period to use for directors.</p>

<h4>3.1.1 Employees paid at regular intervals</h4>

<p>If you pay your employees at regular intervals, for example, weekly or monthly, the earnings period for working out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> is that regular interval.</p>

<p>If payments are made based on a regular interval but the actual day you pay them changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>treat them as paid at the regular interval</li>
  <li>work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> separately on each payment even if 2 or more payments are made in the same earnings period</li>
</ul>

<p>Refer to the weekly or monthly chart in <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec1">Section 1</a>.</p>

<h4>3.1.2 Employees not paid at regular intervals but can be treated as paid at regular intervals</h4>

<p>If a payment isn’t made at regular intervals, there may be a regular pattern covering the period for which each payment is made. In such cases, that regular pattern should be used as the earnings period.</p>

<p>For example, if you pay your employees once a month and their contract shows their pay as a monthly amount, treat them as monthly paid even if sometimes they’re paid for 4 weeks’ work and sometimes for 5 weeks’ work.</p>

<p>Refer to the monthly chart in <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec1">Section 1</a>.</p>

<h4>3.1.3 Employees paid at irregular intervals</h4>

<p>If the interval between payments to employees isn’t regular, and can’t be treated as being regular, the earnings period for working out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> is the period which the payment covers, or one week, whichever is longer.</p>

<p>If it’s not reasonably practicable to determine the earnings period in this way, the earnings period will be from the date:</p>

<ul>
  <li>of the previous payment to the date of the current payment</li>
  <li>the employment began to the date of the first payment</li>
</ul>

<p>If either period is less than one week, the earnings period is one week. The earnings period for a payment made before the employment begins or after it ends is one week.</p>

<p>If an employee is paid in irregular or unequal payments and it’s established that this avoids, or reduces, the payment of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, you can be directed to work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on a different basis. In such cases, we’ll inform you of the basis to use.</p>

<h4>3.1.4 More than one set of regular payments</h4>

<p>As a general rule, if an employee is paid more than one set of regular payments, all payments must be added together and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> worked out using the shorter of the regular intervals between payments.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>If an employee receives basic pay on a weekly basis and commission on a monthly basis, <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are worked out on the total pay based on a weekly earnings period.</p>

<p>However, if you pay an employee at more than one regular interval and it’s established by the National Insurance Contributions &amp; Employers Office that most of the earnings are paid at the longer (or longest) interval, you may be directed to work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> using the longer (or longest) interval.</p>

<p>If you’re directed to use an annual earnings period to work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, the earnings period for the rest of the tax year in which the direction is made will be the number of weeks left in that tax year.</p>

<h4>3.1.5 Working out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> when you first pay an employee</h4>

<p>When you first pay an employee, you must work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> based on what will be the normal earnings period for the employment using the contribution rates and limits current at the actual time of payment.</p>

<p>If the interval between an employee starting work and the first payday is less than the normal earnings period, still work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> using the normal earnings period.</p>

<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>A new employee starts work on 6 October and is due to be paid monthly on the last day of each month.
The earnings period is monthly and the first payday is 31 October. Work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> using a monthly earnings period.</p>

<p>If the interval between an employee starting work and the first payday spans 2 or more earnings periods, and each period is in the same tax year, work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the amounts due for each of those earnings periods separately using the normal earnings period.</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>A new employee starts work on 9 June and is due to be paid monthly on the last day of each month. The earnings period is monthly and the first payday is 31 July (mistimed payments). The employee receives £2,250 gross pay which is made up of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£750 for the period 9 June to 30 June</li>
  <li>£1,500 for the period 1 July to 31 July</li>
</ul>

<p>Work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> separately on the payment for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>June of £750 and record <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the employee’s payroll record in tax month 3</li>
  <li>July of £1,500 and record <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the employee’s payroll record in tax month 4</li>
</ul>

<p>If the interval between an employee starting work and the first payday spans 2 or more earnings periods, and the relevant earnings periods are in different tax years, work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the earnings due for each period separately using the normal earnings period. Use the contribution rates and limits current at the time the earnings are actually paid.</p>

<h4>Example 3</h4>

<p>A new employee starts work on 10 March and is due to be paid monthly on the last day of each month.
The earnings period is monthly and the first payday is 30 April. The employee receives £1,950 gross pay which is made up of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£450 for the period 10 March to 31 March</li>
  <li>£1,500 for the period 1 April to 30 April</li>
</ul>

<p>Work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> separately on the payment for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>March of £450 using 2017 to 2018 contribution rates and limits and record <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the employee’s payroll record in tax month 1 of 2017 to 2018</li>
  <li>April of £1,500 and record <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the employee’s payroll record in tax month 1</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Working out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> for employees not paid on their usual payday</h3>

<p>Take the following action if you pay employees on a day other than their usual payday, for example, you bring the payday forward because of a bank holiday or you pay 2 months’ salaries together to employees who submit their timesheets late (mistimed payments).</p>

<p>If the actual date of payment and the usual payday are in the same tax year, treat the early or late payment as if it had been made at its usual time.</p>

<h4>Example 1</h4>
<p>Two separate weeks’ wages for weeks ending 6 June and 13 June are paid on 13 June. Work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> separately on each week’s payment. Record the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> information for the late 6 June payment on the employee’s payroll record for 6 June and report to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> on or before the date of payment.</p>

<p>In different tax years, work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the early or late payment separately from any other payments made in that tax year, using the contribution rates and limits appropriate to the year in which the payment is actually made</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>
<p>Two separate weeks’ wages for weeks ending 30 March 2017 and 6 April 2017 are paid on 30 March. Work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on each set of earnings separately using the usual earnings period, but record the total <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> for both the early 6 April 2017 payment and the 30 March 2017 payment together on the employee’s payroll record for 30 March and report it to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> on or before the date of payment.</p>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para18">paragraph 1.8</a> if the payment is due to be made on a non-banking day.</p>

<p>In both the same and different tax years, look at each payment individually and decide which of the above rules applies to that payment.</p>

<h4>Example 3</h4>
<p>An employee is paid monthly on submission of a timesheet. The employee submits timesheets for February 2017, March 2017 and April 2017 during May 2016. Work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the payments due for February and March separately using the 2017 to 2018 contribution rates and limits. Record the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> separately in tax month 2. Work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the payments for April and May separately and record the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> in tax months 1 and 2 respectively.</p>

<p>The methods described for calculation of mistimed payments can only be used when nothing was paid on the usual payday(s).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Changing the method of working out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>You may work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> using either the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Contribution Tables supplied by us</li>
  <li>exact percentage method, this is when you apply the appropriate percentage rates to the gross pay for the earnings period</li>
</ul>

<p>You must use only one method for a particular employee in any tax year unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the employee changes to another payroll which already uses the other method</li>
  <li>you change your payroll system, for example, from manual to computer</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> Employees with more than one job</h3>

<p>This section describes the rules which govern the payment of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> if an employee has more than one job.</p>

<h4>3.4.1 An employee has 2 or more jobs with different employers and each one pays the employee</h4>

<p>If an employee has another job or jobs with a different employer or employers, work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> in the normal way on the earnings you pay the employee. Ignore the payments made to the employee in the other job(s).</p>

<p>However, if you carry on business in association with the other employer(s), you must add together the earnings from each job and work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the total unless it’s not reasonably practicable to do so. You may be asked to show why it has not been practicable to add together the earnings from each job.</p>

<p>For advice on the type of information we use if we review your decision, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para343">paragraph 3.4.3</a>.</p>

<p>In such cases, you should agree with the other employer(s) how to share out the payment of employer’s contributions.</p>

<p>Employers are considered to be carrying on business in association with each other if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their respective businesses serve a common purpose</li>
  <li>to a significant degree, they share such things as accommodation, personnel, equipment or customers</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/national-insurance-manual">National Insurance Manual</a>. Read aggregation of earnings at NIM10000 onwards.</p>

<h4>3.4.2 An employee receives one payment of earnings for separate jobs with different employers</h4>

<p>An employee may work for 2 or more employers in separate jobs but only get one payment of earnings.
If the employers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are carrying on business in association with each other (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para341">paragraph 3.4.1</a>), <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are due from the employer who actually pays the earnings</li>
  <li>aren’t carrying on business in association with each other, each employer has to pay <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on their share of the payment</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.4.3 An employee has 2 or more jobs with the same employer</h4>

<p>If an employee has 2 or more jobs with you at the same time, the general rule is that you must add all the earnings together and work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the total.</p>

<p>If the earnings from each job are separately calculated, you don’t have to add the earnings from the separate jobs together if it’s not reasonably practicable to do so.</p>

<p>For example, this might be if you operate a computerised payroll system which is unable to perform the separate calculation and you would then have to do it manually. In such cases, you may be required to show why it has not been reasonably practicable to add the earnings together from each job.</p>

<p>There’s no definition of the phrase ‘not reasonably practicable’ in National Insurance law. We rely upon the ordinary dictionary meaning and any relevant court decisions.</p>

<p>The onus is on you as the employer to show that aggregation isn’t reasonably practicable. You’ll need to take into account the costs, resources, and the effects on running the business.</p>

<p>We consider the following points if we review your decision:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is it a fact that your payroll software can’t aggregate earnings</li>
  <li>is your payroll software provided by an external supplier or provided by an internal IT section</li>
  <li>does the provider of an outside IT package give an update service that includes aggregation</li>
  <li>if the work has to be carried out manually, what are the costs</li>
  <li>how many employees are potentially affected</li>
  <li>has there been a material change in the labour force since the decision not to aggregate was taken</li>
</ul>

<p>If you would like more detailed information on the ‘not reasonably practicable’ test, refer to section 10009 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/national-insurance-manual">National Insurance Manual</a> or contact us for advice.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span> Working out and recording <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> when earnings from separate jobs are added together</h3>

<p>If you’re required to aggregate the earnings for separate jobs when working out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para351">paragraph 3.5.1</a> for guidance on how to calculate and report aggregation in real time.</p>

<p>For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/what-to-do-if-your-employee-has-more-than-1-job">What to do if your employee has more than 1 job</a>.</p>

<p>The rate of employer Class 1 secondary contributions is 0% for employees under the age of 21 up to the <abbr title="Upper Secondary Threshold">UST</abbr>. Class 1 secondary contributions continue to be payable at the standard rate on all earnings above this threshold.</p>

<p>The current way in which <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> is assessed remains unchanged, there’s no change to the principles of aggregation.</p>

<p>Employers should make sure they hold the employee’s correct date of birth and use the correct category letter, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para385">paragraph 3.8.5</a>.</p>

<p>From April 2016 the rate of secondary Class 1 contributions is 0% for Apprentices under the age of 25 up to the <abbr title="Apprentice Upper Secondary Threshold">AUST</abbr>.</p>

<p>Secondary Class 1 contributions continues to be payable on all earnings above the <abbr title="Apprentice Upper Secondary Threshold">AUST</abbr>.</p>

<p>The current way in which <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> is assessed remains unchanged. Employers should ensure that they hold the employee’s correct date of birth.</p>

<h4>3.5.1 Reporting NICS when earnings from separate jobs are added together</h4>

<p>NICS must be worked out on the total earnings using the exact percentage method rather than the Contribution Tables. This is because the calculation of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> in each Table takes into account that portion of an employee’s earnings which fall below the <abbr title="Primary Threshold">PT</abbr>. This portion of earnings can only be disregarded once.
The earnings period to be used is the shortest. The examples in this chapter explain what you need to do.
The examples use the rates and limits applicable to the 2016 to 2017 tax year. <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are worked out using the exact percentage method.</p>

<p>For more information on using the exact percentage method, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/how-to-manually-check-your-payroll-calculations">How to manually check your payroll calculations</a>.</p>

<p>The order in which to calculate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> is Z, M or H, J, B, A &amp; C.</p>

<p>Category M (under 21) and H (Apprentice under 25) are treated with the same priority.</p>

<p>If you feel that sections 65 to 71 apply to you, and you need more information or help in this area, you can find our address and phone number in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#helpandguide">Help and guidance</a> page or read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/what-to-do-if-your-employee-has-more-than-1-job">What to do if your employee has more than 1 job</a>.</p>

<p>This example tells you how to work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> when earnings from more than one job are added together and the jobs have different Earnings Periods.</p>

<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>Jason is 19, and his earnings are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£250 a week (Category M)</li>
  <li>£2,000 a month (Category M)</li>
</ul>

<p>Jason’s earnings period is weekly and his monthly earnings will be added to his weekly earnings in the week they’re paid. There will be 40 weeks where Jason earned £250. There will be 12 weeks where Jason earned £2,250.
This is how the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are worked out. Week 1, Jason earns £250, all at category M.</p>

<p>Employee contributions are due at 12% on earnings above the <abbr title="Primary Threshold">PT</abbr>.</p>

<p>Employee’s contribution:
<br>
(250-155) x 12%<br>
95 x 12% = 11.40</p>

<p>Employer contributions are due at 0% on earnings above the Secondary Threshold:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the appropriate standard percentage rate on the total earnings above the Secondary Threshold (£156).</li>
</ul>

<p>For the 40 weeks where Jason only receives his weekly salary:</p>

<p>Category: A<br>
Employee <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>: 11.40<br>
Employer <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>: 0.00<br></p>

<p>Employer’s contribution:
<br>
(250-156) x 0%<br>
94 x 0% = 0.00<br></p>

<p>In 12 weeks of the year, Jason receives his monthly salary as well as his weekly salary.</p>

<p>Employee contributions are due at 12% on earnings above the <abbr title="Primary Threshold">PT</abbr> up to the <abbr title="Upper Earnings Limit">UEL</abbr> and at 2% above the <abbr title="Upper Earnings Limit">UEL</abbr>.</p>

<p>Employee’s contribution:
<br>
(827-155) x 12% = 672 x 12% = 80.64<br>
(2250-827) x 2% = 1423 x 2% = 28.46<br>
80.64 + 28.46 = 109.10<br></p>

<p>Employer contributions are due at 0% on earnings above the Secondary Threshold up to the <abbr title="Upper Secondary Threshold">UST</abbr> and 13.8% above the <abbr title="Upper Secondary Threshold">UST</abbr>. For the 12 weeks where Jason receives both his weekly and monthly salary:</p>

<p>Employer’s contribution:
<br>
(827-156) x 0% = 671 x 0% = 0.00<br>
(2250-827) x 13.8% = 1423 x 13.8% = 196.37<br></p>

<p>Category: A<br>
Employee <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>: 109.10<br>
Employer <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>: 196.37<br></p>

<p>Total employee <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>:
<br>
(11.40 x 40) + (107.90 x 12) = 456.00 + 1294.80 = 1750.80</p>

<p>Total employer <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>:
<br>
(0.00 x 40) + (198.03 x 12) = 0.00 + 2376.36 = 2376.36</p>

<h4>Reporting <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> when earnings from separate jobs are added together</h4>

<p>If an employee has one payroll identity add together all the payments made in one earnings period under one category and report <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> data on the total amount.</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>Employee has one payroll ID and is paid on the same day for both jobs using one payroll identity — 2016 to 2017 rates.</p>

<p>Robert has 2 jobs with a hotel; one as a barman and one as a lifeguard.</p>

<p>He earns £200 per week as a barman and £100 per week as a lifeguard. The payments are made under one payroll ID.</p>

<p>You must add together all the payments made in one earnings period and calculate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due on the total amount.</p>

<h4>Employee has 2 different payroll IDs</h4>

<p>If an employee receives payments under 2 different payroll identities, you must use the following procedure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>every time you pay the employee, record and report the pay and employee <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> in this pay period for each job in the usual way</li>
  <li>
    <p>in addition, on one of the payroll records, you must also:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Add together the earnings from each job (the total is the ‘aggregated earnings’).</li>
      <li>Calculate and record the employer <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due on the aggregated earnings for the pay period.</li>
      <li>Calculate and record the employee <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due on the aggregated earnings, and so find out any additional
employee <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due (over and above what’s already been recorded for the 2 jobs separately for earnings paid in 
the same earnings period).</li>
      <li>Pay <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> all the employee and employer <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due on the aggregated earnings.</li>
      <li>Update the year-to-date <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> figures on the payroll record for the employee, to reflect the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> data for the aggregated earnings.</li>
      <li>Set the Aggregated Earnings Indicator on the payroll record.</li>
      <li>Report the payroll information to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need to decide under which Payroll ID you want to record the data for the aggregated earnings. This reference will be the one under which <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will expect payment for both the employer <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and employee <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> to be made.</p>

<p>For the other job or jobs, update the employee’s payroll record:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Put ‘0.00’ for the year-to-date <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> fields.</li>
  <li>Put ‘0.00’ for the employer <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> in this period.</li>
  <li>Set the Aggregated Earnings Indicator.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Example 3</h4>

<p>Employee has 2 jobs with same employer, paid using 2 payroll IDs</p>

<p>Dev is aged 23 and has 2 jobs with the County Council – one as an apprentice in the planning department and one with the Education Department. Each department has a separate payroll, and so different <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> references. 
With the Planning Department, Dev earns £3,000 per month and with the Education Department he earns £250 per month.</p>

<p>The National Insurance category letter for both jobs is ‘A and H’ Standard and Apprentice under 25.</p>

<p>The Council adds together Dev’s earnings for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes so that Dev and the Council pay employee and
employer <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on earnings of £3,250 per month. These are the aggregated earnings and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> must be
calculated using the guidance.</p>

<p>The Council must record Dev’s earnings every month and send the information to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>  when they report their payroll information on an <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> for each job.</p>

<p>For the job with the Planning Department the Council will record and report:</p>

<ul>
  <li>taxable pay and pay subject to <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> of £3,000 every month</li>
  <li>any employee <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> deducted from Dev’s earnings in the pay period</li>
  <li>‘Yes’ for the Aggregated Earnings Indicator</li>
  <li>National Insurance category letter ‘H’</li>
</ul>

<p>For the employment with Education Department the Council will record and report:</p>

<ul>
  <li>taxable pay and pay subject to <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> of £250 every month</li>
  <li>any employee <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> deducted from Dev’s earnings in the pay period</li>
  <li>‘Yes’ for the Aggregated Earnings Indicator</li>
  <li>National Insurance category letter ‘A’</li>
</ul>

<p>The Council decides to show the aggregated earnings on the job with the Planning Department. The records are
updated to show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the employer <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due on the aggregated earnings for the pay period</li>
  <li>any additional employee <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due, as a result of aggregating the earnings and calculating the employee
<abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due on the total, reflected in the year to date totals</li>
  <li>the year to date <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> data figures on the payroll record for the employee, to reflect the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> data for the
aggregated earnings</li>
</ul>

<p>The Education Department shows ‘0.00’ for year to date and Employer <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> in the pay period.</p>

<h4>3.5.2 Deferment of the payment of employee’s <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> for employees with more than one job</h4>

<p>Employees with more than one employment, who anticipate earning in excess of the <abbr title="Upper Earnings Limit">UEL</abbr> in one, or in a number of employments, can apply to the National Insurance Contributions &amp; Employer Office for permission to defer some of their contributions liability.</p>

<p>Where permission is granted the employee will pay a reduced main employee rate of 2% on all earnings from the <abbr title="Primary Threshold">PT</abbr> to the <abbr title="Upper Earnings Limit">UEL</abbr> and the additional employee rate of 2% on all earnings above the <abbr title="Upper Earnings Limit">UEL</abbr> in the deferred employments. If an application is allowed, our Deferment Services will send form CA2700 to the employer(s) concerned authorising them to deduct primary (employee) <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> at a rate of 2% on all earnings above the <abbr title="Primary Threshold">PT</abbr>.</p>

<p>Employer’s <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are still payable at the full standard rate. An application for deferment is required each year.</p>

<p>If you receive form CA2700 for an employee, use the appropriate category letter as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Category letter ‘J’ for an employee aged 21 or over</li>
  <li>Category letter ‘Z’ for an employee under the age of 21</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span> What to do if you’ve already deducted employee’s <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> in the tax year prior to receipt of form CA2700</h3>

<p>If you’ve already deducted employee’s <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>recalculate the employee <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due at 2% on all earnings above the <abbr title="Primary Threshold">PT</abbr>
</li>
  <li>refund to the employee the difference between the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> paid and the amount now due</li>
  <li>adjust your next payment to the accounts office as long as it’s for the same tax year</li>
  <li>adjust the category letter under which the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are due on the employee’s payroll record to the appropriate category letter for deferment (as indicated above)</li>
  <li>report the correct year to date information on your next <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>keep a record of earnings on which employee <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> would have been deducted</li>
</ul>

<p>Employees with more than one job who want to know about deferment of Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> should read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/516038/CA72A_Notes_04_16.pdf">Guidance Notes for form CA72A</a> or phone Deferment Services on Telephone: 0300 056 0631.</p>

<h4>3.6.1 Retrospective membership of an occupational pension scheme</h4>

<p>It may be decided that one or more of your employees can become retrospective members of your occupational pension scheme. This includes employees who have been reinstated retrospectively. You and the employee(s) will be entitled to a refund of the difference between the not contracted-out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> paid and the contracted-out rate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due since the retrospective membership date.</p>

<p>Retrospective membership is dependent on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the rules of the occupational pension scheme</li>
  <li>whether or not the employment in question is excluded from the contracting-out certificate issued by us</li>
</ul>

<p>Your occupational pension scheme will provide the information you need.</p>

<p>Refunds will only be applicable to tax years before 2017, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para375">paragraph 3.7.5</a>.</p>

<p>If a refund is due for a tax year which has ended and you’ve submitted information using P35 or P14’s, contact:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.7 </span> Special rules for some married women and widows</h3>

<p>Some married women and widows have the right to pay reduced rate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>. If an employee has such a right she must give you a valid ‘certificate of election’ before you can deduct <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> at the reduced rate.</p>

<h4>3.7.1 Certificates of election</h4>

<p>A certificate of election gives you the authority to deduct reduced rate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and you must keep the certificate until the woman:</p>

<ul>
  <li>stops working for you</li>
  <li>becomes liable to pay standard rate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>reaches State Pension age</li>
</ul>

<p>If you deduct reduced rate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> without a valid certificate of election, you’re responsible for any underpayment.
It’s also your responsibility to ensure the certificate of election you receive from your employee is valid. Check carefully any certificates you’re given.</p>

<p>The only valid certificates of election are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>form CA4139 or CF383 unless
    <ul>
      <li>either box A or box B shows a date which has passed</li>
      <li>the employee has not earned enough to pay <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> in any 2 consecutive tax years since 6 April 1978 and has not been self-employed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>form CF380A as long as the woman has worked for you continuously since 5 April 1980 and has paid reduced rate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> throughout that time</li>
</ul>

<h4>Getting a valid certificate of election</h4>

<p>If an employee gives you a certificate of election which isn’t valid, return it to her. If she says that she is still entitled to pay reduced rate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, she must write to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> National Insurance Contributions and Employer Office at the address shown in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para376">paragraph 3.7.6</a> and ask for a replacement to be issued.</p>

<p>If an employee has more than one job, she must get a separate certificate to give each employer.</p>

<h4>3.7.2 Giving up the right to pay reduced rate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>
</h4>

<p>A woman who wishes to give up her right to pay reduced rate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ask her employer to return the certificate to her</li>
  <li>complete
    <ul>
      <li>part 1 of the certificate</li>
      <li>form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-insurance-married-womans-reduced-rate-contributions-cf9">CF9</a> (if she is a married woman) or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-insurance-widows-reduced-rate-contributions-cf9a">CF9A</a> (if she is a widow)</li>
      <li>send the certificate and completed form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-insurance-married-womans-reduced-rate-contributions-cf9">CF9</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-insurance-widows-reduced-rate-contributions-cf9a">CF9A</a> to the address in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para376">paragraph 3.7.6</a>
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-insurance-married-womans-reduced-rate-contributions-cf9">CF9</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-insurance-widows-reduced-rate-contributions-cf9a">CF9A</a> or by writing to the address in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para376">paragraph 3.7.6</a>.</p>

<p>If your employee would like more advice she should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/reduced-national-insurance-married-women">Reduced rate National Insurance for married women</a>
</li>
  <li>phone the National Insurance enquiries for Individuals Helpline on 0300 200 3500</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.7.3 Losing the right to pay reduced rate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>
</h4>

<p>A woman loses her right to pay reduced rate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> if she:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gets divorced or her marriage is annulled</li>
  <li>becomes a widow but isn’t entitled to Bereavement Benefit after an initial period</li>
  <li>loses her right to Bereavement Benefit, for a reason other than remarriage</li>
  <li>has not, in any 2 consecutive tax years since 6 April 1978:
    <ul>
      <li>had any earnings on which Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are payable or treated as paid (for instance where,
since 6 April 2000, the earnings are between the <abbr title="Lower Earnings Limit">LEL</abbr> and <abbr title="Primary Threshold">PT</abbr>)</li>
      <li>been self-employed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Whilst no <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are payable between the <abbr title="Lower Earnings Limit">LEL</abbr> and <abbr title="Primary Threshold">PT</abbr>, they’re treated as having been paid and her election remains valid. As such, a married woman or widow won’t lose her right to pay reduced rate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Divorce or annulment</h4>

<p>Your employee is required by law to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tell you when she is no longer entitled to pay <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> at the reduced rate</li>
  <li>return her certificate of election to the National Insurance Contributions and Employer Office at the address shown in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para376">paragraph 3.7.6</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>As the employer, you’re required by law to return the certificate of election to the employee when asked to do so. You may consider it worthwhile to have arrangements in place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>so that your employee knows who, or which part of your organisation, she should inform that she is no longer entitled to pay reduced rate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and whether you require this to be done in writing</li>
  <li>to check any notification of change of surname or remarriage or civil partnership as this may mean that there has been a divorce or annulment</li>
  <li>to issue a periodic reminder to employees for whom you hold a certificate of election, advising them of the need to tell you if
    <ul>
      <li>their marriage ends by divorce or annulment</li>
      <li>they’re no longer entitled to pay reduced rate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Although all cases will be considered individually on their merits, you’ll be liable for any underpayment of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the employee was at fault (this might mean, for example, that she failed to tell you that she was no longer entitled to pay reduced rate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> under the laid-down procedures you may have, or she failed to ask for the return of the certificate of election)</li>
  <li>the underpayment was not due to any negligence on your part (for example, you may be considered negligent if you’ve inadequate or no arrangements in place for your employee to tell you that she is no longer entitled to pay <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> at the reduced rate)</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.7.4  When to return a certificate of election</h4>

<p>You must return a certificate to your employee when she:</p>

<ul>
  <li>leaves your employment</li>
  <li>tells you that her marriage has ended in divorce or by annulment</li>
  <li>reaches State Pension age</li>
  <li>has not, in any 2 consecutive tax years since 6 April 1978
    <ul>
      <li>had any earnings on which Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are payable or treated as paid</li>
      <li>been self-employed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>has changed her name</li>
  <li>remarries</li>
  <li>asks for it back</li>
  <li>becomes widowed</li>
</ul>

<p>Complete the parts of the certificate which apply to you before you return it to your employee. When you’ve returned a certificate, if the woman still works for you, deduct standard rate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> unless she has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>given you a new certificate of election</li>
  <li>reached State Pension age and has provided you with proof of that (read paragraphs <a class="govuk-link" href="#para376">3.7.6</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#para381">3.8.1</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you can’t return a certificate of election to an employee who has left, send it with a note of explanation to the National Insurance Contributions &amp; Employer Office at the address shown in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para376">paragraph 3.7.6</a>.</p>

<h4>3.7.5 Adjusting <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>
</h4>

<p>You must reassess and adjust any <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> already deducted if your employee:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gives you a valid certificate of election part way through the tax year</li>
  <li>is late in telling you that she is no longer entitled to pay reduced rate <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Overpayment of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>
</h4>

<p>If an overpayment of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> occurs in the current year as a result of your receiving a valid certificate of election part of the way through the year:</p>

<ul>
  <li>refund the amount overpaid to the employee</li>
  <li>amend the employee’s payroll records and report corrected information on the next <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>adjust your next payment to the accounts office</li>
</ul>

<p>To get a refund of an overpayment in a tax year which has ended when you’ve reported information using forms P35 or P14, the employee must write, quoting her National Insurance number, to:</p>

<h4>Underpayment of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.8 </span> Payment of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> for employees over State Pension age</h3>

<p>Employees over State Pension age don’t have to pay employee’s contributions. Employer’s contributions are still due.</p>

<p>For more information and the State Pension age calculator, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-age">Check your State Pension age</a>. As the employer you’re responsible for ensuring that the correct contributions are paid, and before you stop deducting employee’s contributions you must have seen proof that the employee has reached State Pension age. This can be a birth certificate, passport or certificate of exception,
issued by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>You should keep a copy of the proof you’ve seen because if you stop deducting employee’s contributions without seeing proof, you’re responsible for any underpayment. The employee’s birth certificate or passport should be used as proof of age as <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> no longer issue age exception certificates.</p>

<p>There will be very rare instances where an employee is reluctant to provide the employer with a birth certificate as it may contain sensitive information that they don’t wish to disclose. If this happens they should write to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> advising the reason why they can’t use the birth certificate. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will investigate these and provide a letter confirming they’ve reached state pension age where this is the case. The address to write to is:</p>

<h4>3.8.1 Certificates of age exception</h4>

<p>Your employee may give you a certificate of age exception issued by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> instead of showing you their passport or birth certificate. The certificate shows a ‘valid from’ date and is proof that the employee has reached State
Pension age and won’t be liable to pay any further employee’s contributions on any payment of earnings made on or after that date. You should keep the certificate for as long as the employee works for you.</p>

<h4>3.8.2 When to return a certificate of age exception</h4>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> no longer issue certificates of age exception, however in exceptional circumstances your employee can contact <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> to obtain a letter confirming they’ve reached State Pension age.</p>

<p>Always return a certificate of age exception to your employee when their employment ends. If you’re unable to return the certificate direct to the employee, send it, with a note of explanation, to us at the address shown in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para376">paragraph 3.7.6</a>.</p>

<h4>3.8.3 Adjusting <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>
</h4>

<p>If you’re given proof of the date on which your employee reached State Pension age and that date has passed, you’ll need to reassess and adjust any <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> wrongly paid.</p>

<h4>Overpayment of employee’s contributions</h4>

<p>If an overpayment has occurred in the current tax year as a result of employee’s contributions being wrongly deducted:</p>

<ul>
  <li>refund the employee’s contributions to the employee</li>
  <li>amend the employee’s payroll record and report correct values on the next <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>adjust your next payment to us</li>
</ul>

<p>If an overpayment has occurred in a previous tax year when you’ve reported information using forms P35 or P14 for a previous <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> year, to get a refund the employee must write to:</p>

<h4>Underpayment of employer’s contributions</h4>

<p>For years up to 2016, if an underpayment occurs in the tax year:</p>

<ul>
  <li>amend the employee’s payroll record and report the correct information on your next <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>adjust your next payment to us</li>
</ul>

<p>If an underpayment occurred for a previous tax year, contact the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> National Insurance Contributions &amp; Employer Office at the address shown at <a class="govuk-link" href="#para376">paragraph 3.7.6</a> for advice.</p>

<h4>3.8.4 National Insurance contributions (<abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>) Employment Allowance</h4>

<p>The Employment Allowance is available for most businesses, charities and Community Amateur Sports Clubs to be offset against their employer Class 1 Secondary <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>. Businesses, Charities, certain individuals who employ care and support workers and Community Amateur Sports Clubs may claim the Employment Allowance if the earnings they pay give rise to a secondary Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> liability.</p>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-employment-allowance">Employment Allowance</a> to check if you qualify. In the case of a business, this could be a company, a partnership or a self-employed individual, if they have employees whose earnings give rise to a secondary Class 1 liability.</p>

<p>The Employment Allowance isn’t available for certain domestic employers (a nanny or a chauffeur), public authorities (unless a charity), employers already claiming through a connected business or charity and companies with one employee who is paid above the ST and that employee is the director. Service Companies aren’t able to claim in respect of deemed payments of employment income.</p>

<p>From April 2017 the Employment Allowance isn’t available to an employer (or an employer connected to that employer) who was required to pay a Home Office penalty for employing workers who were subject to immigration control. That employer will be ineligible to claim Employment Allowance for the tax year following the conclusion of all appeal rights to the Home Office penalty.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> Employment Allowance is straight forward to claim. You can do this as part of the normal payroll process through <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> within your software package or using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/payroll-software">Basic <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Tools</a> which are free to download.</p>

<p>You’ll need to determine whether you’re eligible for the Employment Allowance. Your software should require you to specify if you wish to claim the Employment Allowance and you should select the appropriate response. Alternatively, the Employment Allowance can be claimed through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/payroll-software">Basic <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Tools</a> if your software doesn’t enable this. However you claim, you only need to claim the Employment Allowance once and it will continue from tax year to tax year.</p>

<p>The Employment Allowance can be offset against payments of secondary Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> when they’re due to be paid, until the full annual amount of Allowance is used up or the tax year ends, whichever is soonest.</p>

<h4>Example 1</h4>
<p>An employer is claiming the Employment Allowance and has secondary Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> liabilities of £500 per month. The employer claims the Employment Allowance at the start of the tax year. This means that the employer will claim £500 per month Employment Allowance and the maximum annual Employment Allowance of £3,000 will be exhausted by month 6. This means that the £500 secondary Class 1 for months 7 to 12 will continue to be due to be paid to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. Additionally, the employer must continue to pay over to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> income tax due each month.</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>
<p>A second employer claiming the Employment Allowance has secondary Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> liabilities of £100 per month. The employer claims the Employment Allowance at the start of the tax year. This means that the employer won’t claim the full £3,000 Employment Allowance by month 12 and the maximum annual Employment Allowance claimed will be £1,200 with no further entitlement in that tax year. Additionally, the employer must continue to pay over to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> income tax due each month.</p>

<h4>3.8.5 National Insurance contributions (<abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>) Abolition of secondary rate contributions for those under 21 years of age (U21)</h4>

<p>A 0% rate of secondary <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> was introduced from April 2015 for those employees under the age of 21 up to a new <abbr title="Upper Secondary Threshold">UST</abbr>. There’s no reduction in the rate of Class 1 secondary contributions above the <abbr title="Upper Secondary Threshold">UST</abbr>. It’s important to remember that this rate of secondary contributions doesn’t remove the role of the secondary contributor.</p>

<p>Employers are still required to fulfil any other obligations associated with paying earnings, for example, administering statutory payments. These changes don’t alter any of the rules for calculating national insurance other than by using the U21 secondary rate where appropriate. Primary Class 1 contributions will remain unaltered.</p>

<h4>3.8.6 National Insurance contributions (<abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>) Abolition of secondary rate contributions for Apprentices under 25 years of age</h4>

<p>A new 0% rate of secondary <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> was introduced from April 2016 for Apprentices under the age of 25 up to the <abbr title="Apprentice Upper Secondary Threshold">AUST</abbr>. There’s no reduction in the rate of Class 1 secondary contributions above the <abbr title="Apprentice Upper Secondary Threshold">AUST</abbr>.</p>

<p>Apprentices must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>following a government recognised apprenticeship in the UK (those which follow government  arrangements/approved frameworks)</li>
  <li>have a written agreement specifying the government recognised apprentice framework and standard, with a start and expected completion date</li>
</ul>

<p>The agreement between the training provider, apprentice and employer and will be the evidence the employer needs to retain when applying the zero-rate of secondary Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> for an apprentice under 25.</p>

<p>Two new category National Insurance category letters have been introduced to support this new rate of secondary <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Category H</h4>

<p>Standard rate contributions for apprentices under 25.</p>

<h4>Category G</h4>

<p>Mariners’ standard rate contributions for apprentices under 25. It’s important to remember that this new rate of secondary contributions doesn’t remove the role of the secondary contributor. Employers are still required to fulfil any other obligations associated with paying earnings, for example, administering statutory payments.</p>

<p>These changes don’t alter any of the rules for calculating national insurance other than by using the apprentice under 25 rate where appropriate.</p>

<p>Primary Class 1 contributions will remain unaltered.</p>

<h4>3.8.7 Apprenticeship Levy</h4>

<p>From April 2017 employers with an annual pay bill of over £3 million will have to pay the apprenticeship levy. The levy is charged at a rate of 0.5% on your annual pay bill. The pay bill is defined as earnings on which Class 1 secondary <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are due. The pay bill also includes earnings below the Secondary Threshold, and includes the earnings of employees under the age of 21 and apprentices under the age of 25 even though these are liable to Class 1 secondary <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> at a rate of 0%.</p>

<h4>Levy allowance</h4>

<p>You have an annual allowance of £15,000 to offset against your levy liability. If you’re a single employer, with more than one <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme, who isn’t connected to other employers by virtue of the connected companies or connected charities rules that apply to the levy, you can share the allowance between your <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes.</p>

<p>If you’re an employer connected to other employers, by virtue of the connected companies or the connected charities rules, you have one annual allowance of £15,000 available for all of the connected employers within your group.  However, connected employers can choose to share the £15,000 annual allowance between them.</p>

<p>You don’t need to apply for the allowance, you simply offset one-twelfth of your annual allowance against your levy liability arising each month and this should be applied on a cumulative basis. See the examples below.</p>

<p>If you start up, or go into liquidation, during the tax year, you’ll still be able to use the full £15,000 allowance to offset against your levy liability for the portion of the tax year in which you operated.</p>

<h4>Determining whether you’re connected to another company or charity</h4>

<p>The rules on connection are the same as those used for the Employment Allowance.  For guidance on how to determine if you’re connected to another company, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/308734/connected-companies.pdf">Connected companies and Employment Allowance: detailed technical guidance for employers and their agents</a>.</p>

<p>For guidance on how to determine if you’re connected to another charity, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/291871/connected-charities.pdf">Connected charities and Employment Allowance: detailed technical guidance for employers and their agents</a>.</p>

<p>There are no connected rules for public bodies.</p>

<h4>Reporting your levy liability</h4>

<p>As an employer, you’ll have to pay Apprenticeship Levy each month from 6 April 2017 if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have an annual pay bill of more than £3 million</li>
  <li>are connected to other companies or charities for Employment Allowance which in total have an annual pay bill of more than £3 million</li>
</ul>

<p>You must report the levy monthly, on the <abbr title="Employer Payment Summaries">EPS</abbr>. You must send the <abbr title="Employer Payment Summaries">EPS</abbr> to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> within 14 days after the end of each tax month.</p>

<h4>Paying the levy</h4>

<p>You must pay the levy each month to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, at the same time you are due to pay tax and any earnings-related <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, which is within 17 days after the end of the tax month if you pay by an approved method of electronic communication, or within 14 days if you’re paying by another means.</p>

<h4>Calculating your levy liability</h4>

<p>You must calculate the levy each month based on the total cumulative pay bill for your workforce year to date. A 12th of your annual allowance can be used in each month of the tax year on a cumulative basis to offset against your levy liability.</p>

<p>To arrive at the monthly pay bill you must add all the employee earnings subject to Class 1 secondary <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> (from each of the paydays in the tax month) together.</p>

<p>You must then calculate 0.5% of this amount to calculate your levy liability for that tax month. You then use this figure to calculate your cumulative monthly levy liability for the tax year up to that point (for example, 0.5% of each month’s pay bill added together).</p>

<p>You should then offset your cumulative monthly allowance against your cumulative monthly levy liability in order to calculate the apprenticeship levy payable for each tax month.</p>

<h4>How the cumulative allowance works</h4>

<p>£15,000/12 = £1,250<br>
Month 1 - £1,250<br>
Month 2 - £1,250 + £1,250 = £2,500<br>
Month 3 - £1,250 +£1,250+ £1,250 = £3,750<br>
And so on until Month 12<br>
Month 12 £1,250 x 12 = £15,000</p>

<p>Any unused allowance can be carried over into the following month.  But unused allowance in one tax year, can’t be carried over into the next tax year.</p>

<p>Below are examples of how the levy liability is to be calculated.</p>

<h4>Example 1 – Regular pay bill of £250,000 each month (£3m for the tax year so no levy is due)</h4>

<h4>Month 1</h4>

<p>£250,000 x 0.5% = £1,250 levy<br>
Cumulative levy allowance = £1,250, for example £15,000/12<br>
Levy payable month 1 £1,250 - £1,250 = NIL</p>

<h4>Month 2</h4>

<p>£500,000 (£250,000 + £250,000) x 0.5% = £2,500<br>
Cumulative levy allowance £2,500<br>
Levy payable to month 2 is NIL<br>
Levy paid in month 2 = levy payable to month 2 – levy paid to month 1 = 0 – 0 = 0</p>

<h4>And so on until month 12</h4>

<p>£3 million (£250,000 x 12) x 0.5% = £15,000<br>
Cumulative levy allowance £15,000<br>
Levy payable to month 12 is NIL<br>
Levy paid in month 12 = levy payable to month 12 – levy paid to month 11 = 0 – 0 = 0</p>

<h4>Example 2 – Regular pay bill of £300,000 each month (£3.6m for the tax year)</h4>

<h4>Month 1 and each month of the tax year thereafter</h4>

<p>£300,000 x 0.5% = £15,00 levy<br>
Cumulative levy allowance = £1,250<br>
Levy payable month 1 £1,500 - £1,250 = £250</p>

<h4>Month 2</h4>

<p>£600,000 (£300,000 + £300,000) x 0.5% = £3,000<br>
Cumulative levy allowance £2,500<br>
Levy payable to month 2 is £3,000 - £2,500 = £500<br>
Levy paid in month 2 = levy payable to month 2 – levy paid to month 1 = £500 – £250 = £250</p>

<h4>And so on until month 12</h4>

<p>£3.6 million (£300,000 x 12) x 0.5% = £18,000<br>
Cumulative levy allowance £15,000<br>
Levy payable to month 12 is £3,000<br>
Levy paid in month 12 = levy payable to month 12 – levy paid to month 11 = £3,000 – £2,750 = £250</p>

<p>This means that the organisation pays £250 each month in levy which totals £3,000 over the year.</p>

<h4>Example 3 – Seasonal pay bill</h4>

<p>Total pay bill is £3 million over the year but fluctuates during it with a peak in June and July (month 3 and 4). See table below:</p>

<h4>Month 1</h4>

<p>£200,000 x 0.5% = £1,000 levy<br>
Cumulative levy allowance = £1,250, for example.<br>
Levy due up to month 1 is NIL as £1,000 levy is less than the cumulative allowance</p>

<h4>Month 2</h4>

<p>£400,000 (£200,000 + £200,000) x 0.5% = £2,000<br>
Cumulative levy allowance £2,500<br>
Levy due up to month 2 is NIL as £2,000 levy is less than the cumulative allowance (£2,500)<br>
Levy paid in month 2 = levy due up to month 2 – levy due up to month 1 = 0 – 0 = 0</p>

<h4>Month 3</h4>

<p>£900,000 (£200,000 + £200,000 + £500,000) * 0.5% = £4,500<br>
Cumulative levy allowance £3,750<br>
Levy due up to month 3 is £4,500 - £3,750 = £750<br>
Levy paid in month 3 = levy due up to month 3 – levy due up to month 2 = £750 – 0 = £750</p>

<h4>Month 4</h4>

<p>£1,400,000 (£200,000 + £200,000 + £500,000 + £500,000) * 0.5% = £7,000<br>
Cumulative levy allowance £5,000<br>
Levy due to month 4 is £7,000 - £5,000 = £2,000<br>
Levy paid in month 4 = levy due up to month 4 – levy due up to month 3 = £2,000 – £750 = £1,250</p>

<h4>Month 5</h4>

<p>£1,600,000 (£200,000 + £200,000 + £500,000 + £500,000 + £200,000) x 0.5% = £8,000<br>
Cumulative levy allowance £6,250<br>
Levy due up to month 5 is £8,000 - £6,250 = £1,750<br>
Levy paid in month 5 = levy due up to month 5 – levy due up to month 4 = 1750 – 2,000 = - £250</p>

<p>Therefore the employer gets a credit of £250 that month that may be used to offset against other <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> liabilities.</p>

<h4>Month 6</h4>

<p>£1,800,000 (£200,000 + £200,000 + £500,000 + £500,000 + £200,000 + £200,000) x 0.5% = £9,000<br>
Cumulative levy allowance £7,500<br>
Levy due up to month 6 is £9,000 - £7,500 = £1,500<br>
Levy paid in month 6 = levy due up to month 6 – levy due up to month 5 = £1,500 – 1,750= - £250</p>

<p>Therefore the organisation gets a further credit in month 6 of £250 to set against their <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> liabilities.</p>

<p>The calculation continues in the same manner for each of the months 7 -12 where the firm gets a credit of £250 in each month. The whole position for the year can be seen in the table below:</p>

<p>Below is an example of how the allowance will work where a unit of companies or charities split the allowance across the unit:</p>

<h4>Example 4 – A unit of 3 companies (Company A, Company B and Company C).</h4>

<p>Company A and Company B are allocated an annual levy allowance of £7,500. As a consequence, Company C has a levy allowance of £0. Company A and Company B have monthly pay bills of £250,000 (an annual pay bill of £3million). Company C has a monthly pay bill of £100,000 (an annual pay bill of £1.2 million)</p>

<p>The levy to be paid for Company A and Company B will be calculated as follows:</p>

<h4>Month 1</h4>

<p>£250,000 x 0.5% = £1,250 levy<br>
Cumulative levy allowance = £625 for example £7,500/12<br>
Levy payable month 1 £1,250 - £625 = £625<br></p>

<h4>Month 2</h4>

<p>£500,000 (£250,000 +£250,000) x 0.5% = £2500<br>
Cumulative levy allowance £1,250<br>
Levy payable to month 2 is £2,500 - £1,250 = £1,250<br>
Levy paid in month 2 = levy payable to month 2 – levy paid to month 1 = £1,250 - £625 = £625</p>

<h4>And so on to month 12</h4>

<p>£3 million (£250,000 x 12) x 0.5% = £15,000<br>
Cumulative levy allowance £7,500<br>
Levy payable to month 12 = £15,000 - £7,500 = £7,500<br>
Levy paid in month 12 = levy payable to month 12 – levy paid to month 11 = £7,500 - £6,875 = £625</p>

<p>The levy to be paid for Company C will be calculated as follows:</p>

<h4>Month 1</h4>

<p>£100,000 x 0.5% = £500<br>
Cumulative levy allowance £0<br>
Levy payable month 1 £500 - £0 = £500</p>

<h4>Month 2</h4>

<p>£200,000 (£100,000 + £100,000) x 0.5% = £1,000<br>
Cumulative levy allowance £0<br>
Levy payable to month 2 £1,000<br>
Levy paid in month 2 = levy payable to month 2 – levy paid to month 1 = £1,000 - £500 = £500</p>

<h4>And so on to month 12</h4>

<p>£1.2 million (£100,000 x 12) x 0.5% = £6,000<br>
Cumulative levy allowance £0<br>
Levy payable to month 12 £6,000<br>
Levy paid in month 12 = levy payable to month 12 – levy paid to month 11 = £6,000 - £5,500 = £500</p>

<h4>Tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>
</h4>

<p>When a person, for example, a worker, provides their services to a client through one or more agencies (or third parties) and they’re neither an employee of the client nor the agency, then subject to certain conditions applying, the agency may be responsible for operating <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and paying primary and secondary or employee’s and employer’s Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, as explained below.</p>

<p>The agency directly contracting with the client is responsible for the operation of <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and the payment of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> when all of the following conditions are satisfied:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the worker personally provides services to the client</li>
  <li>there’s a contract between the client, or a person connected with the client, and an agency under or in consequence of which – (1) the services are provided, or (2) the client, or any person connected with the client, pays, or provides other consideration for the services</li>
  <li>someone has the right, even if not exercised, to supervise, direct or control the way the work is
done</li>
  <li>the worker receives remuneration (from any person) as a consequence of providing the services</li>
</ul>

<p>When the agency is based outside the UK and contracts directly with a client in the UK, then the client is responsible for paying the tax and acting as the secondary contributor for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>

<p>The agency isn’t responsible for the operation of <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and the payment of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> when any of the following conditions are satisfied the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>worker is providing their services wholly in their own home</li>
  <li>worker is providing their services at premises which aren’t controlled or managed by the client, unless the nature of the services being provided to the client dictates they must be undertaken at such premises</li>
  <li>worker is providing their services as an actor, singer, musician or other entertainer or as a fashion, photographic or artist’s model</li>
  <li>remuneration the worker receives (from any person) as a consequence of providing the services, has already been treated for income tax purposes as earnings from an employment</li>
  <li>agency merely acts as a job-finding agency which introduces the worker to the client and plays no part thereafter in the worker’s engagement with the client</li>
</ul>

<p>An agency ceasing to employ an agency worker should issue form P45, at the earlier of the end of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the relationship, between the agency and the worker</li>
  <li>a period of 3 months during which the agency makes no payments to the worker</li>
</ul>

<p>An agency should, in respect of any agency workers for whom it’s required to operate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>, issue form P45 at the earlier of the end of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the relationship between the agency and the worker</li>
  <li>a period of 3 months during which the agency makes no relevant payments to the worker</li>
</ul>

<p>From 6 April 2016 new legislation affects the application of the travel expenses and subsistence rules for workers who provide their services through an employment intermediary, for more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/480-expenses-and-benefits-a-tax-guide">480(2016): Expenses and benefits</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> Student employees</h3>

<p>If you employ students you must treat them, for payroll purposes, in exactly the same way as any other employee. If you have any employees under 16 years of age and you’re reporting their payments via <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>, use <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> Category letter X, as <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> aren’t payable for under 16 year olds.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span> Information for farmers</h3>

<h4>4.4.1 Harvest casuals</h4>

<h4>For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>There are special rules that apply only to casual employees, taken on for harvest work and shoots, who aren’t members of your family. For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes, the special rules apply to casual harvest work only, not shoots.</p>

<p>You must follow the normal procedures for any part-time or casual employees:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that you take on for non-harvest work</li>
  <li>who are members of your family, regardless of the type of work they do</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, if earnings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>don’t exceed the <abbr title="Primary Threshold">PT</abbr> and ST no <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are payable</li>
  <li>reach or exceed the <abbr title="Lower Earnings Limit">LEL</abbr> but don’t exceed the <abbr title="Primary Threshold">PT</abbr> the employee is treated as having paid <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> when claiming benefit</li>
  <li>exceed the <abbr title="Primary Threshold">PT</abbr>, Class 1 primary <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are payable by the employee.</li>
  <li>exceed the ST, Class 1 secondary <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are payable by the employer</li>
</ul>

<p>For further information on completing your payroll submissions for these employees, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/paying-harvest-casuals-and-casual-beaters">Paying harvest casuals and casual beaters</a>.</p>

<h4>4.4.2 Labour Providers or contractors engaged to carry out specific jobs</h4>

<p>Employment Business is the generic name used instead of gangmaster, labour provider, contractor or agency. If you engage a gangmaster or a contractor who isn’t one of your own regular employees, to carry out specific jobs such as supplying:</p>

<ul>
  <li>own machinery or equipment for threshing, ploughing, haulage and so on</li>
  <li>workers for potato, fruit or other crop picking or processing</li>
  <li>part-time drivers to deliver packages</li>
</ul>

<p>Then the Employment Business is usually responsible for operating <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and accounting for the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due for any worker he or she provides.</p>

<p>In such cases you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>still record details of all payments you make to the Employment Business as we may ask for them at the end of the tax year</li>
  <li>keep your record of payments for at least 3 years after the end of the tax year to which they relate</li>
</ul>

<p>If one of your own regular workers acts as a gangmaster or Employment Business, you may be responsible for operating <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>. In such circumstances you should contact us for advice on <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>. You should be aware that those who supply workers to agriculture and food/drink processing and packaging must be licensed with the Gangmasters Licensing Authority (<abbr title="Gangmasters Licensing Authority">GLA</abbr>). It’s an offence for gangmasters to operate without a licence or for contractors to use unlicensed gangmasters.</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK means England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – people living in the Isle of Man are usually treated as living in the UK</li>
  <li>European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) means Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK</li>
  <li>countries with which the UK has a full reciprocal agreement covering both <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and benefits are Barbados, Bermuda, Guernsey, Israel, Jamaica, Jersey, Mauritius, Philippines, Turkey, USA, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia including Serbia and Montenegro/Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia</li>

<h4>Resident, present or having place of business in the UK</h4>

<p>Whether you’re resident, present or have a place of business is a question of fact and may depend on how your business operates.</p>

<p>Generally, an employer can be said to be resident, present or in the UK if the registered office of the company is in the UK, even if no actual business is carried on there.</p>

<p>Generally, an employer can be said to have a place of business in the UK if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they have a fixed address or occupy premises where they’re present, or are present with the consent of the lawful owner or tenant</li>
  <li>an activity takes place which need not necessarily be remunerative in itself, but is in furtherance of the purposes of the business – the business doesn’t need to be of a trading or commercial nature</li>
</ul>

<p>Some pointers to look for when considering if you have a place of business include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a name plate displayed on the door or premises</li>
  <li>headed letter paper</li>
  <li>a listing in a phone directory</li>
  <li>a lease or rent agreement or some sort of financial transaction for the use of the premises</li>
  <li>a registered office</li>
  <li>registration as a company incorporated outside the UK but with a place of business here for the purpose of the Companies Act 1985</li>
  <li>other premises in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>From 1 May 2010 new European Community regulations treat certain employers in <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> countries as having a place of business in the UK for all Class 1 National Insurance purposes in relation to their employees who become liable to UK National Insurance on or after 1 May 2010.</p>

<p>At the time of going to press the countries signed up to the new regulations are: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland but some other countries may follow suit.</p>

<p>Before someone from abroad starts working for you, you must check that they’re eligible to work in the UK.</p>

<p>For more details and an up-to-date position on National Insurance, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-employee-coming-to-work-from-abroad">New employee coming to work from abroad</a>.</p>

<h4>4.5.1 Employees coming from within the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> and countries with which the UK has a Reciprocal Agreement (<abbr title="Reciprocal Agreement">RA</abbr>) covering <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> or a Double Contributions Convention (<abbr title="Double Contributions Convention">DCC</abbr>)</h4>

<p>You don’t have to pay Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> for employees who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have come from a country
    <ul>
      <li>in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>, or</li>
      <li>with which the UK has a <abbr title="Reciprocal Agreement">RA</abbr> or a <abbr title="Double Contributions Convention">DCC</abbr>
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>they hold a certificate issued by the other country showing that they’re entitled to pay contributions only in that other country for the period covered by the certificate</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the period of exception shown on the certificate has elapsed if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>resident, present or have or are treated as having a place of business in the UK, then Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> (both employer’s and employee’s contributions) must be paid on the first payment that you make to them on or after that date</li>
  <li>not resident, present or don’t have or aren’t treated as having a place of business in the UK, you don’t have to pay employer’s contributions but the employee’s contribution must still be paid</li>
</ul>

<p>If the employee doesn’t have a certificate exempting them from the payment of UK <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> you must deduct UK <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>4.5.2 Employees coming from countries outside the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> with which the UK doesn’t have a <abbr title="Reciprocal Agreement">RA</abbr> covering <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> or a <abbr title="Double Contributions Convention">DCC</abbr>
</h4>

<h4>If you’re resident, present or have a place of business in the UK</h4>

<p>The general rule is that Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> (employer’s and employee’s contributions) must be paid for an employee who has come to work in the UK from a country outside the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> and with which the UK doesn’t have an <abbr title="Reciprocal Agreement">RA</abbr> or <abbr title="Double Contributions Convention">DCC</abbr> covering <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>. <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are payable from the date they start work in the UK. This is the case even if the employee is supplied by an agency whose place of business isn’t in the UK.</p>

<h4>Exceptions</h4>

<p><abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> aren’t payable for the first 52 weeks starting from the first Sunday after the employee arrives in the UK for an employee who doesn’t normally live or work in the UK, but who is sent to work here temporarily by their overseas employer who has a place of business outside the UK even if that employer also has a place of business in the UK.</p>

<p>When the 52-week period finishes you pay <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> for that employee and the normal rules about working out, paying and recording <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> apply.</p>

<h4>If you’re not resident, present or don’t have a place of business in the UK (and not treated as having a place of business)</h4>

<p>You don’t have to pay employer’s contributions but the employee’s contribution must still be paid.</p>

<h4>Host Employer Regulations</h4>

<p>If an employer outside the UK with no place of business in the UK makes their employees available to you to work in your business, the law treats you as their employer.</p>

<p>This most commonly arises where you’re supplied with workers by a foreign agency or perhaps you’re loaned employees from a foreign company linked to yours. You’ll be liable for the payment of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> (both primary and secondary) in respect of that person.</p>

<h4>4.6.2 Modified <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> Schemes – Applying for simplified reporting for employees coming to or leaving the UK</h4>

<p>Some employers can apply for simplified reporting for employees coming to or leaving the UK.</p>

<p>Details are in the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Manual, PAYE82003 (EP Appendix 7A) and PAYE82004 (EP Appendix 7B). The arrangements allow certain employers to apply to pay <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and complete a <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> at the normal time using a best estimate of the earnings and benefits, and later submit a minor correction to the amount of Class 1 or Class 1A <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, without then attracting a penalty.</p>

<p>The idea is to help businesses with internationally mobile workers, by giving them a little longer to identify and account for minor benefits and payments that were not paid from the UK payroll. Conditions apply.</p>

<p>For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/paye-manual/paye81500"><abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Manual</a>.</p>

<h4>4.6.3 Employees coming from abroad</h4>

<p>Subject to certain exceptions <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> must be operated in the usual way for all employees:</p>

<ul>
  <li>working at a UK branch or office of any overseas business, and</li>
  <li>who work under the day-to-day control and management of a business in the UK or the UK branch or office of an overseas business (including directors)</li>
</ul>

<p>The concern in the UK which is using the services of an employee of an overseas employer, must operate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> as if it was the employer. This is the case regardless of whether the employee is paid by the UK concern, the overseas concern, or partly by both.</p>

<p>If all or part of an employee’s income, including any benefits provided, is paid by the overseas concern, the UK employer must get together all details needed to operate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and make returns on form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-end-of-year-expenses-and-benefits-p11d">P11D</a>.</p>

<h4>Employees who aren’t resident in the UK</h4>

<p>Where, because work is performed both in the UK and abroad, it’s unclear at the time of making a payment how much of the payment will ultimately be assessable as <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> income, the whole payment should be subjected to <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> unless we’ve directed otherwise.</p>

<p>Such a direction may be possible where you consider it necessary to determine by apportionment what proportion of a payment is assessable to tax. You can ask us for a direction that <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> need only be applied to a certain proportion of the payment(s) made.</p>

<p>The direction may cover more than one employee and any number of years, provided these details are specified in the direction. Most commonly such a direction will be appropriate in a situation where a payment is made to an employee who isn’t resident in the UK and that payment comprises of earnings which relate to duties in the UK and abroad.</p>

<h4>Employees on short-term business visits to the UK</h4>

<p>Where an employee is likely to qualify for protection from UK Income Tax under the Dependent Personal Services Article of a Double Taxation Convention it may be possible to relax the strict <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> requirements that arise.</p>

<p>Certain information will need to be provided and the criteria in the Dependent Personal Services
clause met. In the latter respect normally the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>employee must be present in the UK for a period not exceeding in aggregate 183 days in the calendar or fiscal year concerned</li>
  <li>remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who isn’t a resident of the UK, and</li>
  <li>remuneration isn’t borne by a permanent establishment or a fixed base which the employer has in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>Write to us for more details in these cases. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="#helpandguide">Help and guidance</a> section for our address.</p>

<h4>Employee seconded to work in the UK</h4>

<p>If you employ someone who comes to work for you from abroad, you’re usually responsible for <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax on their earnings, just as you are for any other employee. So you set up their payroll record and then record and report their earnings, and pay any <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax due on those earnings in the usual way.</p>

<p>If an employee from abroad falls within the definition of a ‘seconded employee’, you’re still responsible for <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax on their earnings – but the rules for what tax code to use and what to include in their payroll record are different. These are explained below.</p>

<p>A seconded employee includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>individuals working wholly or partly in the UK for a UK employer on assignment whilst remaining employed by an overseas employer</li>
  <li>individuals assigned to work wholly or partly in the UK at a recognised branch of their overseas employer’s business</li>
  <li>all individuals included by an employer within a dedicated expatriate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme</li>
  <li>all individuals included by an employer within an expatriate modified <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme</li>
</ul>

<p>For further information on ‘What to include in the payroll record for a seconded employee’, and ‘Using the right tax code for a seconded employee’, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-employee-coming-to-work-from-abroad">New employee coming to work from abroad</a>.</p>

<h4>4.6.4 Employees going abroad</h4>

<p>The normal <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> system applies to all employees of a UK employer even if the employees are working abroad for all or part of the time.</p>

<p>When you send an employee to work abroad you should provide the employee with a letter giving the following details, the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>date the employee went abroad</li>
  <li>gross pay and tax deducted whilst in your employment for the period from 6 April last to the date the employee was sent abroad</li>
</ul>

<p>If the employee goes abroad to work full time and you move them to a payroll with a different employer reference you should submit an <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> with a date of leaving. You should then send an <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> with starter information from the new reference.</p>

<p>If an employee is intending to work in full-time employment abroad for more than a complete tax year you should ask them to complete a P85. They should send the completed P85 to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> who will consider if an NT code can be operated.</p>

<p>If the employee is leaving the UK to work overseas full time for a UK based employer for a period which includes a full tax year, then the P85 should be completed to request an NT tax code. This applies whether the employee files a Self Assessment return or not.</p>

<p>The P85 should be sent to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> no earlier than 8 weeks before the date the overseas work is due to commence and be accompanied by a letter requesting the NT tax code. We’ll tell you if you can operate code NT and the period for which it can apply. NT tax codes will also be issued where there’s ongoing <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> liability only. If the employee ceases to be subject to tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, they can be removed from your <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> until they return to
the UK and deductions recommence.</p>

<p>You should not operate an NT tax code before receiving formal notice from us as this may result in you sending an incorrect <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> and may incur penalties.</p>

<p>The letter confirming that you can use code NT will explain that any <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax that the employee paid prior to leaving the UK can’t be repaid until after the end of the tax year. As an alternative, for the year of leaving the UK, you can run 2 separate payroll records for the employee (each one operating cumulatively): one on the UK pay the employee was paid up to departure and the other for the earnings for work done abroad after departure.</p>

<p>This will allow you to repay some of the UK tax that the employee paid prior to departure in each pay period until the end of the tax year. If you do decide to do this you should let us know and separate payroll IDs will be necessary for each record.</p>

<p>You can also operate a similar procedure for the tax year the employee returns to work in the UK but you must always tell us that the employee has returned to work in the UK and you should immediately stop using code NT.</p>

<h4>Overseas tax deductions</h4>

<p>If you send employees to work on an overseas contract, the overseas tax authorities may get in touch with you about making foreign tax deductions from the employees’ pay. It’s advisable therefore to contact the overseas authority on or before the start of the contract to establish your obligations in that country. This is because you’re likely to have obligations to both UK and overseas tax authorities.</p>

<p>Although foreign deductions may be due, you must explain to the overseas authority that you’re still responsible for operating <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> under UK arrangements for these employees. Find out if the foreign tax authority requires you to make deductions and as soon as you’ve confirmed this you should contact us. We’ll tell you what you can do to make things easier for the employee who will have 2 lots of deductions made from their pay but you must contact us before the end of the tax year.</p>

<h4>4.6.5 Employees working in offshore areas</h4>

<p>You must operate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> for employees working offshore, but there are exceptions. Before employees start working in these areas, write to us for further information. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="#helpandguide">Help and guidance</a> section for our address.</p>

<h4>4.6.6 Coding for payroll purposes for non-resident employees who have never been resident in the UK</h4>

<p>Where a business in the UK or the UK branch or office of an overseas business employs someone who is non-resident, and the employee:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is working wholly outside the UK</li>
  <li>hasn’t been resident in the UK before</li>
  <li>doesn’t intend to and won’t perform any duties in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>Code ‘NT’ may be used for payroll purposes if the paying system demands a code number. An <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> isn’t required and there’s no liability for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>. If the residency position of the employee or the place the duties are performed change so that the employee becomes liable to UK tax, you should immediately stop using code ‘NT’ and follow the procedure for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-employee-coming-to-work-from-abroad">Employees coming to the UK from abroad</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.7 </span> Workers providing their services through intermediaries</h3>

<p>This section deals with the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>workers supplied by agencies, for more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para42">paragraph 4.2</a>
</li>
  <li>workers paid by intermediaries which don’t meet the definition of Managed Service Companies ‘IR35’ rules</li>
  <li>workers paid by Managed Service Companies</li>
  <li>IR35: At the end of the tax year</li>

<p>From 6 April 2016 new legislation affects the application of the travel expenses and subsistence rules for workers who provide their services through an employment intermediary and who are subject to the supervision, direction or control of any party. When such a worker personally provides services (other than an exception for ‘excluded services’ – see below) to a client through an employment intermediary, including a recruitment agency, umbrella company or other similar structure, then each assignment is considered to be a separate employment. Therefore when a worker regularly commutes from home to a workplace for each assignment they won’t be eligible for relief on travel and subsistence. Each workplace is classed as a permanent workplace and so the travel is ordinary commuting.</p>

<p>For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/480-expenses-and-benefits-a-tax-guide">480(2017): Expenses and benefits</a>.</p>

<p>Where a worker is supplied through their own company (for example, a Person of Significant Control (<abbr title="Person of Significant Control">PSC</abbr>)) or partnership isn’t necessary to consider the test of supervision, direction, or control.</p>

<p>With effect from April 2017, if the <abbr title="Person of Significant Control">PSC</abbr> provides services to a public body or is placed by an agency with a public body then responsibility for the deemed payment calculation and liability for <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> / NIC will rest with that public body / agency rather than the <abbr title="Person of Significant Control">PSC</abbr>. If a subsequent salary is drawn from the <abbr title="Person of Significant Control">PSC</abbr> then the <abbr title="Person of Significant Control">PSC</abbr> will be responsible for <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> / NIC on that payment(s).</p>

<p>However, when a Deemed Employment Payment :</p>

<ul>
  <li>is payable under IR35 legislation, or</li>
  <li>would have been payable but for the fact that the worker received remuneration as employment income</li>
</ul>

<p>then the new legislation will apply as the workplace will be classed as a permanent workplace and no relief on travel and subsistence will be available for home to work travel.</p>

<h4>4.7.1 Workers paid by intermediaries which don’t meet the definition of Managed Service Companies (IR35 rules)</h4>

<p>The Intermediaries legislation (also known as ‘IR35’) applies to income earned from engagements (known as relevant engagements) where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a worker provides services to a client under a contract between the client and one or more intermediaries and</li>
  <li>the worker is an office-holder of the client or, but for the presence of the intermediary, the income arising under the contract would have been treated as coming from an employment or an office held by the worker, as if the worker had contracted directly with the client</li>
</ul>

<p>The existing rules which outline the boundary between employment and self-employment for tax or <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes, continue to be used to determine whether an office or employment would have existed but for the use of an intermediary.</p>

<p>For more information on how to decide whether someone is employed or self-employed, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/new-employee/check-status">Tell <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> about a new employee</a>.</p>

<p>The IR35 legislation will apply where the intermediary is a company and the worker has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>beneficial ownership of, or entitlement to acquire rights entitling him or her to receive, more than 5% of the ordinary share capital of the company, or</li>
  <li>possession of, or entitlement to acquire rights entitling him or her to receive more than 5% of any distribution made by the company, or</li>
  <li>received, or could have received, payments or benefits from the company which aren’t salary but could reasonably be taken to represent payment for the services he or she provides to clients</li>
  <li>rights which would entitle him or her to receive or acquire more than 5% of the assets available for distribution in the event of a close company being wound up</li>
</ul>

<p>The ‘IR35’ rules don’t apply where the worker is only entitled to receive income from the intermediary which is all taxed as <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> income and liable to Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, and has no other rights to income or capital from the intermediary.</p>

<p>The ‘IR35’ rules also apply to engagements where the intermediary is a partnership.</p>

<p>However, they only apply if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an individual worker, or persons connected with him or her, is entitled to 60% or more of the partnership profits</li>
  <li>all or most of the partnership’s income in the relevant tax year is derived from the provision of services, in a form which would fall within the definition of relevant engagements, to a single client or a single client and associates of that client</li>
  <li>the profit sharing arrangements in the partnership provide for the income of any of the partners to be based on the amount of income generated by those partners through relevant engagements</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the worker would have been an employee or an office holder of the client, but for the presence of the service company or partnership, the service company or partnership may pay the worker a salary which is liable to <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>. If the salary actually paid is less than the income received by the service company or partnership, from relevant engagements with a client (less certain deductions) then the balance will be deemed to
have been paid to the worker as a deemed employment payment on the last day of the tax year.</p>

<p>New IR35 legislation is being introduced April 2017 for Public Sector engagements, part of that consultation is around the abolition of the 5% deduction for <abbr title="Person of Significant Control">PSCs</abbr> operating in the public sector.</p>

<p>The intermediary will be responsible for operating <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and paying <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> as follows:</p>

<h4>Intermediaries which are companies</h4>

<p>Where a company intermediary receives income in respect of relevant engagements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the intermediary must operate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and pay <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on payments of salary to the worker during the year, in the normal way</li>
  <li>if at the end of the tax year, the total of the worker’s employment income from the intermediary, including benefits in kind, amounts to less than the intermediary’s income from all that worker’s relevant engagements, then the difference (net of allowable expenses described below) will be deemed to have been paid to the worker as earnings on 5 April (earlier in certain circumstances), and tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> must be paid accordingly, from April 2017 this responsibility will be shifted from <abbr title="Person of Significant Control">PSC</abbr> to end user or agency where the <abbr title="Person of Significant Control">PSC</abbr> is working in the public sector</li>
  <li>where salary is deemed in this way, appropriate deductions will be allowed in calculating Corporation Tax profits – no further tax or <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> will be due if the worker subsequently withdraws the money from the company</li>
</ul>

<h4>Intermediaries which are partnerships</h4>

<p>Where a partnership intermediary receives income in respect of relevant engagements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>income of the partnership from all relevant engagements in the year (net of allowable expenses described below) will be deemed to have been paid to the worker on 5 April as earnings from a deemed employment held by the worker.</li>
  <li>the partnership will be required to operate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and pay <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on any deemed employment payment</li>
  <li>any deemed employment payment taxed as <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> income, won’t be included when calculating the worker’s share of partnership trade profits</li>
</ul>

<h4>Expenses</h4>

<p>In computing the deemed employment payment, the following deductions shall be allowed against income from relevant engagements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all expenses otherwise eligible for deduction under the normal expense rules</li>
  <li>any employer pension contributions made to an approved scheme which are allowable under normal rules, plus</li>
  <li>a flat rate 5% of the gross income from the relevant engagements, new IR35 legislation is being introduced in April 2017 for Public Sector engagements, part of that consultation is around the abolition of the 5% deduction for <abbr title="Person of Significant Control">PSCs</abbr> operating in the public sector</li>
  <li>certain capital allowances</li>
  <li>the salary already taxed as employment income and the amount of the employer’s <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> paid during the year, plus any due on the deemed payment</li>
</ul>

<h4>Payment of tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the deemed payment</h4>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#sec1">Section 1</a> of this guide explains how to work out <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> for various pay intervals. For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes, the deemed employment payment should be aggregated with any other earnings paid to the worker by the  intermediary in the year which are derived from employed earner’s employment. The amount of Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> payable in respect of that aggregate amount should be calculated using an annual earnings period, irrespective of whether the worker is a director of the company in the tax year.</p>

<p>Where the provisions of the Intermediaries Regulations apply to the worker from the beginning of the tax year, the worker will have an annual earnings period. Where a later start date applies the worker is prescribed a pro rata annual earnings period.</p>

<h4>4.7.2 Workers paid by Managed Service Companies</h4>

<p>Separate legislation applies to income received from 6 April 2007 by workers providing their services through Managed Service Companies (<abbr title="Managed Service Company">MSC</abbr>).</p>

<p>An <abbr title="Managed Service Company">MSC</abbr> is a form of intermediary company through which workers provide their services to end clients. In essence a scheme provider promotes the use of these companies and provides the structure to workers. The worker (although a shareholder) doesn’t exercise control over the company.</p>

<p>Where a worker provides their services through an <abbr title="Managed Service Company">MSC</abbr>, the existing rules which outline the boundary between employment and self-employment for tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes don’t apply. Payments or benefits received by the worker or an associate which aren’t already treated as earnings, and can reasonably be taken to be in respect of the services of the worker, are treated as employment income and earnings.</p>

<p>For the purposes of the legislation, a company means a limited company, a limited liability partnership or a general partnership.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Managed Service Company">MSC</abbr> is responsible for deducting <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and accounting for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>. The <abbr title="Managed Service Company">MSC</abbr> must deduct <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and account for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on payments of income to the worker during the year, in the normal way.</p>

<p>On each occasion when the worker or their associate receives a payment or benefit from the <abbr title="Managed Service Company">MSC</abbr> which isn’t earnings from an employment, the <abbr title="Managed Service Company">MSC</abbr> must calculate the deemed employment payment in accordance with the legislation and operate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the deemed employment payment.</p>

<p>Appropriate deductions will be allowed on account of the deemed employment payment when calculating profits chargeable to Corporation Tax or partnership profits.</p>

<p>For guidance on calculating the deemed employment payment, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-status-manual/esm3535">Employment Status Manual</a>.</p>

<h4>Expenses</h4>

<p>When calculating the deemed employment payment, a deduction can be made for specific allowable expenses. Expenses incurred in providing services at the client’s premises: for example, travel, subsistence or accommodation costs, aren’t allowable expenses.</p>

<h4>Payment of tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the deemed payment</h4>

<p>Chapter 1 of this guide explains how to work out <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> for various pay intervals. But where regular payments have been made to the director or employee in question throughout the tax year, the deemed payment should be treated as a week 53 payment – read <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec1">Section 1</a> of this guide.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes, the deemed employment payment should be aggregated with any other earnings paid to the worker by the <abbr title="Managed Service Company">MSC</abbr>. An <abbr title="Managed Service Company">MSC</abbr> must pay the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> in respect of the deemed employment payment to
<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> on a monthly basis. The normal <abbr title="End of Year">EOY</abbr> payment rules will apply to the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on deemed payments (that is, the total <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due for the year must be paid by 19 April).</p>

<p>Where an <abbr title="Managed Service Company">MSC</abbr> fails to pay the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, and the sum is irrecoverable from it, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> may transfer the debt to a number of third parties.</p>

<p>The third parties include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="Managed Service Company">MSC</abbr>’s director or other office holder or an associate of the <abbr title="Managed Service Company">MSC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Managed Service Company">MSC</abbr> Provider, its directors or other office holders or associates</li>
  <li>a person who encouraged or was actively involved in the provision of the worker’s
services through the <abbr title="Managed Service Company">MSC</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>4.7.3 IR35 – At the end of the tax year</h4>

<p>The normal <abbr title="End of Year">EOY</abbr> payment rules apply to the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the deemed employment payment made under the IR35 Intermediaries Legislation. The calculation of the deemed employment payment should be reported on an <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> on or before 5 April 2018.</p>

<p>If the intermediary isn’t able to calculate the actual amount of the deemed employment payment and the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due for 2017 to 2018 by 5 April 2018, a payment on account of the estimated tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due should be made by 19 April 2018 supported by a provisional calculation of the deemed payment reported on the final <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> submitted on or before 5 April 2018.</p>

<p>Where a provisional payment of tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> has been made because it was not possible to accurately calculate the deemed payment and deductions on time, any adjustments should be reported via an Earlier Year Update (<abbr title="Earlier Year Update">EYU</abbr>) submitted to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> after the end of the tax year between 20 April 2018 and on or before the following 31 January 2019.</p>

<p>Where <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> doesn’t receive the <abbr title="Earlier Year Update">EYU</abbr> and balancing payment by the following 31 January 2019, the last <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> submitted will be considered to be the final and correct details.</p>

<p>Interest will be charged on late payments made after 19 April 2018 (when the payment was due), but no penalties will be charged for sending the final <abbr title="Earlier Year Update">EYU</abbr> figures late if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the final <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> was received on or before 5 April 2018 showing remuneration paid during the year, plus an amount on account of the provisional deemed employment payment, with tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> correctly calculated on that additional figure</li>
  <li>payment of tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> is made by 19 April 2018, including an amount paid on account of the provisional deemed employment payment, and</li>
  <li>an <abbr title="Earlier Year Update">EYU</abbr> is submitted notifying the correct final amount for the deemed employment, and payment and the tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due are sent to us by 31 January 2019</li>
  <li>any additional tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due as a result of the <abbr title="Earlier Year Update">EYU</abbr> are paid by 31 January 2019</li>
</ul>

<h4>4.7.4 Offshore agencies and employment intermediaries</h4>

<p>Where there’s an employer based in the UK, that employer is responsible for operating <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where a person is employed by or engaged through a foreign employer with no presence or place of business in the UK and there’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no UK agency in the contractual chain, the end client is the person who is responsible for operating <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>a UK agency in the contractual chain, the UK agency is responsible for operating <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>more than one UK agency in the contractual chain, the UK agency that contracts with the end client is responsible for operating <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a UK agency is involved in the supply of workers overseas and the worker is liable for Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> whilst working abroad, then the UK agency is responsible for operating <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>

<p>A worker who would otherwise be self-employed is subject to Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> when they work through an agency and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the worker personally provides services to another person (the client)</li>
  <li>there’s a contract between the client and an agency under or in consequence of which the services are provided or the client provides consideration for the services, and remuneration is receivable by the worker</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#sec1">Section 1</a> Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> if it can be shown the worker isn’t subject to (or to the right of) supervision, direction or control by anyone as to the manner in which they provide their services to the end client.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> in relation to workers employed on the UK Continental Shelf</h4>

<p>There are different rules in relation to the UK Continental Shelf when there’s a foreign employer with no presence of place of business in the UK. For workers who are employed on the UK Continental Shelf, the person responsible for operating <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> is the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>employer, if they’re present in the UK</li>
  <li>associated company, where the employer isn’t present in the UK but has an associated company in the UK</li>
  <li>oil field licensee, (under Part 1 of the Petroleum Act 1998), where the employer isn’t present and doesn’t have an associated presence in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the oil field licensee is responsible as the secondary contributor, a certificate system has been introduced. A foreign employer can apply to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> for a certificate to discharge the oil field licensee’s secondary contributor responsibilities.</p>

<p>Where <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> issues a certificate, the foreign employer takes over the oil field licensee’s secondary contributor responsibilities. This will allow oil field licensees to continue dealing with foreign employers and agencies within the industry without exposing themselves to liabilities for tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>4.7.5 Employment Intermediaries Reporting Requirements</h4>

<p>Employment Intermediaries must send <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> a return every 3 months containing details of all workers they place with clients where they don’t operate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> on the payments.</p>

<h4>5.2.3 Form P11D(b)</h4>

<p>Complete a form P11D(b) to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirm that by 6 July all forms <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-end-of-year-expenses-and-benefits-p11d">P11D</a> you should have completed have been sent to us</li>

Employers who payroll Benefits and Expenses are still required to complete form P11D(b) in respect of the Class 1A due on the benefits provided.</p>

<h4>5.2.4 What to enter on form P11D</h4>

<p>Complete form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-end-of-year-expenses-and-benefits-p11d">P11D</a> to give us details of your employees’ taxable benefits and expenses not subject to payroll.</p>

<p>The list at <a class="govuk-link" href="#para526">paragraph 5.2.6</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sets out the various types of expenses that could be paid to employees and benefits that could be provided to them</li>
  <li>tells you whether or not you should enter the particular type of expense or benefit on form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-end-of-year-expenses-and-benefits-p11d">P11D</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>5.2.5 Reporting termination packages where amounts over £30,000 are taxable</h4>

<p>You need to report packages which are taxable only on amounts over £30,000. You don’t need to do this if the package consists of cash only or, where it includes non-cash benefits, if it has an estimated value of £30,000 or less.</p>

<p>You should make a report to the:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Employer Technical Team Employer Office
<br>Room BP4102
<br>Benton Park View 
<br>NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE
<br>NE98 1ZZ
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>This should be by the 6 July following the tax year in which the termination takes place, if a package is provided, which includes non-cash benefits and is estimated, over its lifetime, to exceed £30,000.</p>

<p>In working out the cash equivalents of non-cash benefits for future years, so as to determine whether a report is needed or not, you only need make reasonable estimates using the rules in force in the year in which termination  occurs.</p>

<p>You don’t need to wait until 6 July if you want to send the report earlier. You can send it at any time after the termination has occurred. You can prepare your report in whichever way suits you best. There’s no prescribed form or format. A copy should always be given to the employee.</p>

<p>If you make a report it must contain the following  information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the total estimated value of the package</li>
  <li>details of the cash payments made and the cash equivalents of non-cash benefits provided in the year in which the termination took place (where the report is made in the tax year best estimates should be supplied)</li>
  <li>an estimate of the cash payments to be made in future years</li>
  <li>an estimate of the total lifetime of the package with details of any contingency factors (for example, payments or benefits ceasing if the employee finds alternative employment)</li>
  <li>details of the type of benefits to be provided after the first year and the terms of their provision (for example, car for 3 years, medical insurance for 10 years and so on)</li>
</ul>

<p>If, after you’ve made your report there’s a variation in the package and the total value increases by more than £10,000 you’ll need to make another report. This has to be made by 6 July following  the end of the tax year in which the variation takes place. The report should only contain details of the variation.</p>

<p>A report will also need to be made if, having originally decided that you don’t need to make a report, there’s a variation in the package so that it includes non-cash benefits and exceeds £30,000.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, you should send a report to the address shown above at the latest by 6 July following the end of the tax year in which the change takes place. The report, however, should be for the year in which termination occurred as if one had been required in the first place.</p>

<p>If you make such a late report remember to provide a copy to the employee.</p>

<h4>5.2.6 P11D List</h4>

<h4>Important</h4>

<p>This list gives general guidance only. It doesn’t cover all expenses or benefits. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/480-expenses-and-benefits-a-tax-guide">480(2017): Expenses and Benefits – A Tax Guide</a>, gives more information as does the P11D Guide.

<p>Expenses and benefits can also attract a Class 1 or Class 1A <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> liability. Guidance on Class 1A <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cwg5-class-1a-national-insurance-contributions-on-benefits-in-kind">CWG5 (2017): Class 1A National Insurance contributions on benefits in kind</a>.</p>

<p>The list at <a class="govuk-link" href="#para51">paragraph 5.1</a> also gives information on when Class 1A <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> may be due on payments of expenses and benefits.</p>

<p>Employers who payroll benefits and expenses don’t have to complete a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-end-of-year-expenses-and-benefits-p11d">P11D</a>. This is because they’re reported under <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span> Exempt expenses</h3>

<h4>5.3.1 Exemption for paid or reimbursed expenses</h4>

<p>From 6 April 2016 paid or reimbursed expenses, and benefits provided, for which tax relief is available in full are exempted from tax and NIC, subject to certain conditions, and don’t need to be reported to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> on form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-end-of-year-expenses-and-benefits-p11d">P11D</a>. All dispensations ceased to have effect on 5 April 2016.</p>

<p>Expenses payments or reimbursements for which tax relief isn’t available on the full amount will need to be paid subject to <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Benefits provided for which tax relief isn’t available on the full amount will need to be reported on form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-end-of-year-expenses-and-benefits-p11d">P11D</a>.
The exemption applies to expenses paid or reimbursed at a scale rate, provided the employer either pays or reimburses at either the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> published ‘Benchmark scale rates’ or at a rate agreed with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> in accordance with an approval notice.</p>

<p>The exemption can cover most types of expense payments and most benefits. For instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>qualifying travel expenses</li>
  <li>reasonable scale rate payments for subsistence</li>
  <li>entertaining</li>
  <li>subscriptions to professional bodies or learned societies</li>
</ul>

<p>The exemption can’t apply to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>company cars and vans</li>
  <li>cheap loans</li>
  <li>round sum allowances</li>
  <li>mileage payments to employees who use their own cars for business travel</li>
</ul>

<p>For the exemption to apply you must have a checking system in place to ensure that employees are in fact incurring and paying amounts in respect of the expenses and that a deduction is due in respect of the full amount paid or reimbursed.</p>

<p>The exemption won’t apply to expenses paid or reimbursed under a salary sacrifice arrangement.
Payments made under a salary sacrifice arrangement should be made under <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>. Employees can make a claim for tax relief direct to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> where any expense is incurred and not paid or reimbursed by you, where the exemption doesn’t apply because the expense isn’t fully deductible, or where expenses or benefits are provided under a salary sacrifice arrangement.</p>

<h4>5.3.2 How to apply for an approval notice</h4>

<p>If you want to pay or reimburse employees subsistence expenses at a rate other than the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Benchmark scale rates you’ll need to apply to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> for an approval notice. Your application will need to set out the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>employees or groups of employees you would like the approval notice to apply to</li>
  <li>amounts of expenses you would like to pay, the occasions you want to pay them on and confirm that the amounts are a reasonable estimate of the expenses actually being incurred by employees</li>
  <li>checking system you’ve in place for controlling  and authorising payments and reimbursements</li>
</ul>

<p>Your checking system must be able to show that payments are only made on qualifying occasions where employees meet the relevant conditions for payment, that the amount paid is a reasonable estimate of the expenses being incurred, and that employees are in fact incurring and paying amounts in respect of the expense.</p>

<p>Approval notices will last for up to 5 years. You must inform us if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your checking system changes</li>
  <li>the circumstances under which you make payments changes</li>
  <li>the amounts you pay are no longer representative of the amounts your employees are actually incurring</li>
</ul>

<h4>5.3.3 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on tax exempt expenses and benefits</h4>

<p>If you pay or reimburse expenses, or provide benefits, which are exempted from tax they won’t be liable for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where the exemption doesn’t apply you’ll need to report and pay Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the full amount of the payment, or Class 1A <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the benefit.</p>

<h3><span class="number">5.4PSAs </span></h3>

<p>A <abbr title="PAYE Settlement Agreement">PSA</abbr> is an agreement between you and your <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> office under which you agree to pay the tax in a lump sum on certain expenses payments and benefits in kind you give to your employees. You don’t have to include items covered by a <abbr title="PAYE Settlement Agreement">PSA</abbr> on form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-end-of-year-expenses-and-benefits-p11d">P11D</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to making lump sum payments of tax, you also make lump sum payments of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on items included in <abbr title="PAYE Settlement Agreement">PSAs</abbr> by paying Class 1B contributions.</p>

<p><abbr title="PAYE Settlement Agreement">PSAs</abbr> normally apply to items which are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>minor</li>
  <li>given by you on an irregular basis</li>
  <li>where it’s impracticable for you to apply <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> to them or include them on form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-end-of-year-expenses-and-benefits-p11d">P11D</a> <abbr title="PAYE Settlement Agreement">PSAs</abbr> don’t apply, for example, to wages and salaries.</li>
</ul>

<h4>More information about Class 1B <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Class 1B <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are payable on <abbr title="PAYE Settlement Agreement">PSAs</abbr> at the same time as tax, using the same payment slip.</p>

<p>Class 1B <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are payable at the appropriate secondary employer’s percentage rate on the total value of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all items covered by the <abbr title="PAYE Settlement Agreement">PSA</abbr> which would give rise to a Class 1 or Class 1A <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> liability</li>
  <li>the tax payable by the employer under the <abbr title="PAYE Settlement Agreement">PSA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>5.4.1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on motoring expenses payments</h4>

<p>There’s a statutory amount which can be paid to employees who use their own cars, vans, motorcycles or cycles for business travel without incurring a <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> liability. If you pay more than the statutory <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> free amount, the excess amount must be added to any other earnings the employee receives in the earnings period in which you make the motoring expense payment. Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are then calculated on the employee’s total earnings.</p>

<p>To work out whether <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are due, you must multiply the amount of business miles travelled by the statutory mileage rate and compare that figure to the amount that you’ve paid.</p>

<p>For privately owned cars and vans, the rate to use is the one which applies to the first 10,000 business miles.</p>

<p>This rate is shown in the table below and must be used irrespective of the number of business miles actually travelled. In working out whether <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are due, you must include in the calculation of the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> free amount all business miles travelled, even if you don’t pay the employee for all of his business mileage.</p>

<p>For employees who use their own motorcycles and cycles for business travel, or who carry passengers, use the appropriate rates in the table below.</p>

<p>The rules for paying the new passenger rate and what counts as business travel are the same for both tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>

<p>More guidance on these rules for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, including examples of how <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are calculated on motoring expenses payments, can be found within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/490-employee-travel-a-tax-and-nics-guide">490: Employee travel – a tax and National Insurance contributions guide</a>.</p>

<h4>5.4.2 Taxation of mileage expenses payments</h4>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para541">paragraph 5.4.1</a> for the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> treatment of motoring expenses payments and passenger payments.</p>

<p>You can pay up to an ‘approved amount’ tax-free to employees using their own vehicles for business travel. This is calculated as follows:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Kind of vehicle</th>
      <th scope="col">Rate</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Car or van</td>
      <td>45 pence per mile for the first 10,000 business miles<br>25 pence per mile after that</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Motorcycle</td>
      <td>24 pence per business mile</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cycle</td>
      <td>20 pence per business mile</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>There are 2 main conditions for payments to be free of tax:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they must be paid to the employee (not merely for the benefit of the employee) for the expenses of business travel in the employee’s privately owned car, van, motorcycle or cycle</li>
  <li>they mustn’t exceed the number of business miles multiplied by the appropriate mileage rate</li>
</ul>

<p>Payments that meet these 2 tests are known as Approved Mileage Allowance Payments (<abbr title="Approved Mileage Allowance Payments">AMAP</abbr>).</p>

<p>If you don’t pay more than the approved amount, all payments are tax-free <abbr title="Approved Mileage Allowance Payments">AMAP</abbr>. You don’t need to include them on form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-end-of-year-expenses-and-benefits-p11d">P11D</a>.</p>

<p>If you pay more than the approved amount, the excess will be charged to tax and you must include it on form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-end-of-year-expenses-and-benefits-p11d">P11D</a>. Excess mileage payments can no longer be included in <abbr title="PAYE Settlement Agreement">PSAs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Meaning of business travel</h4>

<p>This is explained in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/490-employee-travel-a-tax-and-nics-guide">490: Employee travel – a tax and National Insurance contributions guide</a>.</p>

<h4>Associated employments</h4>

<p>Where an employee gets motoring expenses payments from 2 or more associated employments, aggregate the mileage to work out when 10,000 business miles is reached.</p>

<h4>Record keeping</h4>

<p>Even if you pay amounts that are at or below the <abbr title="Approved Mileage Allowance Payments">AMAP</abbr> limit and so aren’t taxable, you’ll still need to keep records of the payments made and the business journeys to which they relate.</p>

<h4>Passenger payments</h4>

<p>There’s an additional exemption from tax for ‘passenger payments’. These are payments you make to employees travelling on business journeys specifically because they carry as passengers fellow employees for whom the journeys are also business travel.</p>

<p>The exempt amount is 5 pence per mile per fellow employee travelling as a business passenger.</p>

<p>The exemption applies only where the vehicle used is a car or a van, but isn’t restricted to employees’ privately owned vehicles. It can also apply where the vehicle used is a company car or van, provided the employee is chargeable to tax on car or van benefit.</p>

<p>Exempt passenger payments don’t need to be included on form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-end-of-year-expenses-and-benefits-p11d">P11D</a> (though any excess does). But you should keep adequate records to demonstrate that payments made satisfy the conditions for exemption.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span> Treatment of expenses payments for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h3>

<p>If you pay an employee expenses, you must include them in gross pay unless they’re exempted from charge under a specific exemption, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para531">paragraph 5.3.1</a>. If you pay an employee expenses for using a privately owned vehicle for business purposes, there are special rules for working out whether you need to include these payments in gross pay, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para541">paragraph 5.4.1</a>.</p>

<h4>Evidence</h4>

<p>To prove that they’re expenses actually incurred by employees in carrying out their work you must be able to provide evidence of the actual business expense.</p>

<p>The type of evidence will depend on the item of business expenditure. For example, evidence could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a log of business phone calls or visits</li>
  <li>credit card bills</li>
  <li>receipts</li>
  <li>work diaries showing the employee’s engagements</li>
  <li>a representative survey of the costs involved (that is a scale rate)</li>
</ul>

<p>This isn’t a complete list and any evidence will be considered.</p>

<h4>Using a scale rate</h4>

<p>Payments based on a scale rate, which covers the costs likely to be incurred, should not be included in gross pay.</p>

<p>For scale rate payments to be excluded from gross pay the scheme you operate must satisfy all the following  conditions, the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>scheme mustn’t have an overall profit element</li>
  <li>payments must be based on an accurate survey of the costs involved</li>
  <li>scheme must allow for a movement in prices</li>
  <li>payments must be reasonable in relation to the employment involved</li>
  <li>employee must make a claim for each payment made</li>
</ul>

<p>Details of the scheme and its provisions must be available for inspection. <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> will be charged on all payments made under the scheme if the scheme isn’t supported by written evidence or isn’t considered sound.</p>

<h4>5.5.1 Payments towards additional household costs incurred by employees who work from home</h4>

<h4>For both <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>Don’t include in gross pay any payments made in respect of reasonable additional household expenses incurred by employees in carrying out duties of their employment at home.</p>

<p>You may pay up to £4 per week (£18 per month) without supporting evidence of the costs.</p>

<p>If you choose to pay more, you must retain supporting evidence to show that the payment is wholly in respect of additional household expenses incurred by the employee in carrying out the duties at home.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span> Round sum allowances</h3>

<p>If you pay a round sum allowance to an employee, you must treat the payment as follows.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>If you can’t identify the business expense include the whole allowance – whether or not an expense is actually incurred – in gross pay. If the expense is wholly deductible for tax purposes it may be covered by the expenses exemption. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para531">paragraph 5.3.1</a>. Payments which are exempted from tax are also not liable for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>Where a round sum allowance is clearly meant to do no more than reimburse an employee for an expense actually incurred in doing his or her job, and the expense was incurred only because of the job the expense may be covered by the exemption for paid or reimbursed expenses. Rread <a class="govuk-link" href="#para531">paragraph 5.3.1</a>. If so, the expense payment doesn’t need to be reported.</p>

<p>Where the payment includes a profit element, or the expenses it’s meant to reimburse aren’t exempted, include the whole amount in gross pay.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.8 </span> Relocation allowances or expenses</h3>

<p>Payments you make to or for an employee who has to move residence as a result of being relocated in the UK by you, should be treated as follows.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>Don’t include in gross pay any exempt relocation expenses payments.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.10 </span> Allowances or expenses to employees working abroad</h3>

<h4>For both <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>Treat payments of expenses to employees working abroad like other expenses payments. In addition, include in gross pay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>payments described as compensation for working abroad</li>
  <li>sums paid as an inducement to work abroad</li>
  <li>any bonus paid for working abroad</li>
</ul>

<p>If you pay an employee a general allowance to compensate for the higher cost of living abroad, commonly known as a cost of living allowance/cost of living addition, that sum must be included in gross pay.</p>

<p>But don’t include in gross pay any payment you make towards expenses incurred in providing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an employee with medical treatment outside the UK where the need for the treatment arises while the employee is outside the UK working for you</li>
  <li>insurance for the employee against the cost of such treatment</li>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.11 </span> Payments you make when an employee stops working for you</h3>

<p>The guidance below tells you what you should do if you make additional one-off payments such as on redundancy or retirement.</p>

<p>Guidance on ‘standard’ payments such as salary, wages, <abbr title="Statutory Maternity Pay">SMP</abbr>, <abbr title="Statutory Adoption Pay">SAP</abbr>, <abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr>, <abbr title="Statutory Shared Parental Pay">ShPP</abbr> and so on is given at <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec2">Section 2</a>.</p>

<h4>5.11.1 Type of payment</h4>

<p>The treatment of a payment made when an employee stops working for you varies according to the type of 
payment. This is true for both <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes.</p>

<p>A single payment is often made up of more than one element. For example, one payment might cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>redundancy pay</li>
  <li>accrued holiday pay</li>
  <li>a payment in lieu of notice</li>
</ul>

<p>Each element must be considered separately. First decide the appropriate tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> rules to apply to each element. Then add these separate results together.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>Most payments fall into one of the following 3 categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the payments are taxable in full</li>
  <li>the payments are taxable only on amounts over £30,000, if
    <ul>
      <li>there’s more than one sum in this category, you must total all such payments before applying the £30,000 limit</li>
      <li>payments are made by instalments, the exemption doesn’t just apply to the year in which the termination  takes place – any unused balance after setting off both cash payments and non-cash benefits may be carried forward to set against payments in a later year</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the payments are completely tax-free</li>
</ul>

<h4>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>Payments are either included or not included in gross pay.</p>

<h4>5.11.2 Action to take when you make such payments</h4>

<p>The list under <a class="govuk-link" href="#para51">paragraph 5.1</a> lists the most common elements included in a leaving payment, and tells you what the appropriate tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> treatments are.</p>

<p>If you need more information about how to value non-cash benefits, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/480-expenses-and-benefits-a-tax-guide">480: Expenses and benefits – a tax guide</a>.</p>

<p>Contact us for guidance on calculating the taxable amount if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you intend to provide anything other than cash when an employee leaves  – for example, an asset (such as a car) or the use of an asset</li>
  <li>any payment (or part payment) is to be paid by a third party, for example, another employer</li>
</ul>

<h4>1. Payment made under terms and conditions of employment – unless the payment is listed separately later in the following paragraphs.</h4>

<p>‘Terms or conditions’ means anything governing the employment relationship so, as well as any written contact, verbal terms, handbooks and agreements may well be included.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>compensation for loss of office provided for under terms or conditions</li>
  <li>accrued pay due</li>
  <li>pay during a period of notice</li>
</ul>

<p>If it’s your normal practice to make a payment on termination, it should be treated in the same way as one made under terms or conditions (even if there’s no legal obligation to pay it).</p>

<p>Redundancy payments are dealt with at <a class="govuk-link" href="#no6">number 6</a>.</p>

<p>Payments made in lieu of notice paid under:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a legal entitlement (or paid automatically)</li>
  <li>an employer’s discretion which is in terms and conditions</li>
</ul>

<h4>6. Payments for redundancy</h4>

<ul>
  <li>due under statutory redundancy payment rules</li>
  <li>paid from your non-statutory scheme to compensate for loss of employment by reason of redundancy</li>

<p>Redundancy has a special legal meaning. Broadly, there must be a reduced need for employees which causes the termination of the employment. This would not include, for example, a payment in lieu of notice provided for by such a scheme. The redundancy may be paid indirect. For example, an employee leaves as a result of a reduced need for employees elsewhere in the business.</p>

  <li>you agree, or the Courts or an Employment Tribunal rules, that the employee was unfairly or wrongly dismissed -if you pay something which is due under the terms or conditions of employment, it won’t be damages (for example, you may be ordered, or agree as part of a settlement of damages, to pay wages due under such terms, in these circumstances that element of the payment must be included in gross pay for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes)</li>

<h4>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>If you make payment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when the employee leaves, work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> based on the regular earnings period for the employment</li>
  <li>after the employee has left, work out <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> based on a weekly earnings period unless it’s a final payment of salary or wage where the usual earnings period, category letter and rates and thresholds at the time of payment should be used</li>
</ul>

<p>Read the guidance within <a class="govuk-link" href="#pmwael">paragraph 1.14</a>.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>Where no tax is due (because the payment isn’t taxable or the payment is a ‘taxable on amounts over £30,000’ payment below this limit) don’t include in gross pay on your employee’s payroll record.</p>

<p>Where tax is due (because the payment is taxable in full or the payment is a ‘taxable on amounts over £30,000’ payment above this limit), and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you make the payment to the employee when or before the employee leaves
    <ul>
      <li>include the taxable amount in gross pay on the employee’s payroll record and operate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> in the normal way</li>
      <li>include the taxable amount on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>
</li>
      <li>complete a form P45 to give to the employee</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>you make the payment to the employee after the employee leaves
    <ul>
      <li>include the taxable amount in gross pay on the employee’s payroll record for the tax week or month number in which you make payment</li>
      <li>enter code 0T as the amended code on the employee’s payroll record</li>
      <li>include the details, set the ‘Payment after leaving’ indicator and show the original date of leaving on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> when you make the final payment</li>
      <li>operate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> by using code 0T (on a week 1 or month 1 basis)</li>
      <li>don’t issue a further form P45. Instead give the employee a letter showing the date of the payment, the gross amount, and the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax you’ve deducted, and confirmation that the payment is a post-leaving payment</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Guidance on reporting termination packages where amounts over £30,000 are taxable is given at <a class="govuk-link" href="#para525">paragraph 5.2.5</a>.</p>

<h4>5.11.3 Lump sum payments on retirement or death which aren’t from registered schemes</h4>

<p>A lump sum retirement or death payment will be tax-free if it’s from an employer-financed scheme, and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in the past the employee has been charged to tax on the employer contributions which funded the lump sum and no employer contributions have been made since 5 April 2006, or</li>
  <li>it’s a payment on death which happened as a result of an accident whilst the person was an employee (including accidents outside work), or</li>
  <li>it’s for ill-health or disablement during service</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a lump sum retirement or death payment isn’t tax-free and it’s paid to any person or body other than an individual (for example, to a club or society) the payer is charged to tax at 50% and <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> doesn’t apply.</p>

<p>Certain payments from overseas retirement benefit schemes may be tax-free. If you think this may apply, ask us about Extra Statutory Concession A10.</p>

<h4>5.11.4 Foreign service</h4>

<p>A payment which is ‘taxable on amounts over £30,000’ may qualify for an additional Income Tax relief. This relief applies if, during the employment, there was ‘foreign service’.</p>

<p>Broadly, this means that the employee was not ‘resident’ in the UK at some time during the employment. If you think this relief may apply, you may wish to speak to us before taking account of any relief.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.12 </span> Employment Tribunal Awards</h3>

<p>The guidance below tells you what you should do if an Employment Tribunal (in Northern Ireland, an Industrial Tribunal) requires you to make payments to an employee under:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a reinstatement order or a re-engagement order</li>
  <li>an order for the continuation of employment</li>
  <li>a protective award</li>
</ul>

<p>Payments due under such awards count as gross pay for both <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes. Read on for more details.</p>

<p>You must calculate Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on the full amount of the award and <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> if the total exceeds £30,000. That is, on the amount awarded before any deductions ordered by the tribunal. If you don’t know the full amount of an award, contact the Clerk to the tribunal that made the award.</p>

<p>If the actual amount you have to pay the employee is less than the amount of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax due on the full amount of the award, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para1191">paragraph 1.19.1</a>. This gives guidance about recovering underpayments of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax from an employee.</p>

<h4>5.12.1 Reinstatement order or re-engagement order</h4>

<p>If a tribunal decides that an employee was unfairly dismissed, it may order the employer to pay notional ‘arrears of pay’ to the employee relating to a period when the employment did not exist. Such amounts count as gross pay for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes, the payment is taxable on amounts over £30,000 only (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para5111">paragraph 5.11.1</a>.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<h4>Payment made to an employee</h4>
<p>Where you make a payment under an order to an employee:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you must treat it as a separate payment and not add it to any other payment of earnings you make to the employee at the same time</li>
  <li>assess the amount of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due on the payment using an earnings period which is the longer of
    <ul>
      <li>the period to which the order relates</li>
      <li>a week</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Use this earnings period no matter how you make the payment, that is, in a lump sum or by instalments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use the category letter, National Insurance percentage rates and earnings limits current at the time you make payment (or when the payment is due to be made if nothing is actually paid because of adjustments to the gross amount by the tribunal)</li>
  <li>record the payment, <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> details and any other information, on the employee’s payroll record in the tax week/ month in which you make payment – this means that if you make another payment of earnings to the employee at the same time, you’ll have 2 lots of entries for the same tax week/month</li>
</ul>

<h4>Payment made to a director</h4>

<p>Where you make a payment under an order to a director:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add the amount of the payment to any other earnings paid to date in the year</li>
  <li>assess the amount of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due on the total amount of earnings to date</li>
  <li>use the earnings period which you’re using to assess <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on any other payments you make to the director that is, an annual earnings period or a pro-rata annual earnings period</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ca44-national-insurance-for-company-directors">CA44: National Insurance for company directors</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>use the category letter, NI percentage rates and earnings limits current at the time you make payment</li>
  <li>record the payment, <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> details and any other information, on the payroll record in the normal way</li>
</ul>

<h4>For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</h4>

<ul>
  <li>treat the employee as a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/new-employee">new employee</a>
</li>
  <li>operate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> procedures at the week or month number that you make any payment(s) - don’t include their previous earnings and tax deducted to date on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>5.12.2 Order for the continuation of employment</h4>

<p>A tribunal may order that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an employee’s employment must continue whilst it deals with a complaint of unfair dismissal</li>
  <li>specify the amount that the employer must pay the employee</li>
</ul>

<p>Such amounts count as gross pay for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> but for <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes these payments are taxable on amounts over £30,000 only.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>Follow the guidance in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para5121">paragraph 5.12.1</a> under ‘Payment made to an employee’ or ‘Payment made to a director’, as appropriate.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</h4>

<ul>
  <li>treat the employee as a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/new-employee">new employee</a>
</li>
  <li>operate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> procedures at the week or month number that you make any payment(s) - don’t include their previous earnings and tax deducted to date on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>5.12.3 Pay due under a protective award</h4>

<p>A tribunal may decide that an employer has broken some rules in making, or proposing to make, an employee redundant. If so, it can order the employer to pay the employee for a certain period. This is called the ‘protected period’.</p>

<p>Amounts paid under a protective award count as gross pay for both <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<h4>Payment made to an employee</h4>

<p>Where you make a payment under a protective award to an employee:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you must treat it as a separate payment and not add it to any other payment of earnings you make to the employee at the same time</li>
  <li>assess the amount of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due on the payment using an earnings period which is the longer of
    <ul>
      <li>the protected period</li>
      <li>that part of the protected period in respect of which the payment is made</li>
      <li>a week</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>use this earnings period no matter how you make the payment, that is, in a lump sum or by instalments</li>
  <li>use the category letter, NI percentages rates and earnings limits current at the time you make payment (or when the payment is due to be made if nothing is actually paid because of adjustments to the gross amount by the tribunal)</li>
  <li>record the payment, <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> details and any other information, on the employee’s payroll record in the tax week/ month in which you make payment – this means that if you make another payment of earnings to the employee at the same time, you’ll have 2 lots of entries for the same tax week/month</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>An employee is made redundant on 31 October. The employer pays their wages up to 30 November.</p>

<p>A tribunal decides the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>protected period is 31 October to 31 December (62 days)</li>
  <li>employer must pay the employee their wages for the period 1 December to 31 December (31 days)</li>
</ul>

<p>Assess the amount of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due on the wages paid for the period 1 November to 31 December using a 62-day earnings period, as this is the longer period of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the protected period (62 days)</li>
  <li>that part of the protected period in respect of which the payment is made (31 days)</li>
  <li>a week (7 days)</li>
</ul>

<p>For guidance on how to work out the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> using this 62-day earnings period, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec1">Section 1</a>.</p>

<h4>Payment made to a director</h4>

<p>Where you make a payment under a protective award to a director:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add the amount of the payment to any other earnings paid to date in the year</li>
  <li>assess the amount of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due on the total amount of earnings to date</li>
  <li>use the earnings period which you’re using to assess <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on any other payments you make to the director that is, an annual earnings period or a pro-rata annual earnings period – for more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ca44-national-insurance-for-company-directors">CA44: National Insurance for company directors</a>
</li>
  <li>use the category letter, National Insurance percentages rates and earnings limits current at the time you make payment</li>
  <li>record the payment, <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> details and any other information, on the payroll record in the normal way</li>
</ul>

<h4>For <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>For tax purposes these payments are taxable on amounts over £30,000 only. Apply <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> to the excess. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para5111">paragraph 5.11.1</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.13 </span> Providing an employee with a non-cash payment</h3>

<p>The following paragraphs provide a guide to operating <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> where assets other than cash are provided to an employee and are treated as earnings of the employee. In general <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> will have to be operated where the asset is a <abbr title="Readily Convertible Asset">RCA</abbr> or where certain cash sums are paid in connection with securities even where those securities aren’t <abbr title="Readily Convertible Assets">RCAs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>5.13.1 Readily Convertible Asset (<abbr title="Readily Convertible Asset">RCA</abbr>)</h4>

<p>An <abbr title="Readily Convertible Asset">RCA</abbr>, for the purposes of this Guide, is one which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is capable of being sold on a recognised investment exchange, the London Bullion Market or the New York Stock Exchange – for example, stocks, shares and other financial instruments, gold bullion and other precious metals and so on</li>
  <li>is a right over a money debt – for example, trade debts assigned by an employer to an employee</li>
  <li>is subject to a fiscal warehousing regime, such as a bonded warehouse – for example, oriental carpets stored in ‘bond’</li>
  <li>gives rise to a right to enable an employee to obtain money – for example, an interest in trust which comes to an end shortly after being assigned to an employee, resulting in an automatic right to cash</li>
  <li>is subject to a trading arrangement, either at the time of provision or likely to come into existence in future under an arrangement or understanding in place when the asset is provided – for example, shares or jewellery which can be sold either under an arrangement existing at the time of provision or under future arrangements for which steps have been taken at the time the shares or jewellery are provided</li>
  <li>is already owned by the employee and whose value is enhanced by the employer – for example, an employer may pay an additional premium to an employee’s life assurance policy, considerably increasing the value of the policy</li>
  <li>is an asset consisting in securities which aren’t shares that are Corporation Tax deductible (Part 12 of <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/4/contents" rel="external">Corporation Tax Act 2009</a>) – most shares will already be <abbr title="Readily Convertible Asset">RCA</abbr> under one of the criteria above – securities include shares of any body, corporate or government loan stock, and other securities defined in Chapter 1, Part 7 of <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/1/contents" rel="external"><abbr title="Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act">ITEPA</abbr> 2003</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Shares can’t be <abbr title="Readily Convertible Asset">RCA</abbr> if they represent the exercise of rights :</p>

<ul>
  <li>obtained before 27 November 1996</li>
  <li>from a Schedule 3 <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/1/contents" rel="external"><abbr title="Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act">ITEPA</abbr> 2003</a> Savings Related Share Option Scheme</li>
  <li>from a Schedule 4 <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/1/contents" rel="external"><abbr title="Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act">ITEPA</abbr> 2003</a> Company Share Option Plan (<abbr title="Company Share Option Plan">CSOP</abbr>) and exercise occurs between 3 and 10 years from the date of grant or less than 3 years from grant by reason of injury, disability, redundancy or retirement</li>
</ul>

<h4>5.13.2 Valuation of assets</h4>

<p>Payments in the form of readily convertible assets must be included in gross pay for both <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes.  The amount on which <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> should be operated and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> assessed is the best estimate that can reasonably be made of the amount of income on which the employee is likely to be chargeable to tax in respect of the provision of the asset.</p>

<p>For most assets, including shares or other securities provided directly to an employee, the value to be ascertained is ‘money’s worth’, with reference to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the cost of the asset to the employer</li>
  <li>the value of the asset when it was awarded</li>
  <li>where the employee has already sold the asset, the amount received for it – if known</li>
  <li>where the employee has contributed towards the cost of the asset – the amount of that contribution should be deducted</li>
</ul>

<p>Where, however, the event is one charged to tax under the securities legislation in Part 7 of <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/1/contents" rel="external"><abbr title="Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act">ITEPA</abbr> 2003</a> (for example, exercise of option or lifting of restriction on a security) the market value must be obtained by reference to the Capital Gains Tax (<abbr title="Capital Gains Tax">CGT</abbr>) value (read Sections 272 and 273 <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/12/contents/enacted" rel="external">Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (TCGA)</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.14 </span> Shares and other securities</h3>

<h4>5.14.1 Securities options</h4>

<p><abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> will normally be due where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>securities are acquired by an employee (or associated person) pursuant to an employment-related securities option</li>
  <li>such an option is assigned or released for consideration (even if the security is non-<abbr title="Readily Convertible Asset">RCA</abbr>, if the consideration is cash or an <abbr title="Readily Convertible Asset">RCA</abbr> then <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> will be due)</li>
  <li>the employee (or associated person) receives a benefit in cash or money’s worth in connection with the option (for example, compensation for loss of option following  takeover)</li>
</ul>

<p>In most cases there’s no charge on the grant of securities options. The exception to this general rule is explained in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-related-securities">Employment-Related Securities Manual</a>.</p>

<h4>Tax advantaged schemes</h4>

<p>If the shares acquired from tax advantaged schemes don’t satisfy the scheme rules for income tax relief, then <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> will be due if the shares are <abbr title="Readily Convertible Assets">RCAs</abbr>. If the shares are non-<abbr title="Readily Convertible Assets">RCAs</abbr> then the Income Tax payable is to be included in the person’s Self Assessment tax return.</p>

<p>For more details about the tax rules that apply to tax advantaged share schemes, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employee-tax-advantaged-share-scheme-user-manual">Employee Tax Advantaged Share Schemes User Manual</a>.</p>

<h4>Schedule 4 <abbr title="Company Share Option Plan">CSOP</abbr>
</h4>

<p>A gain made from a Schedule 4 <abbr title="Company Share Option Plan">CSOP</abbr> share option exercised at least 3 years but not later than 10 years after the date it was granted, is generally exempt from <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> liability.</p>

<p>If a Schedule 4 <abbr title="Company Share Option Plan">CSOP</abbr> option is assigned or released for cash or an <abbr title="Readily Convertible Asset">RCA</abbr>, then <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> should be operated as for non-tax advantaged arrangements.</p>

<p>No tax charge arises if the Schedule 4 <abbr title="Company Share Option Plan">CSOP</abbr> scheme allows for options to be exercised when employment ceases within 3 years of the date the options are granted for one of the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>injury</li>
  <li>disability</li>
  <li>redundancy</li>
  <li>retirement or a Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations (<abbr title="Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations">TUPE</abbr>) transfer or a transfer of the employing company out of the group</li>
  <li>in certain cash takeovers</li>
</ul>

<p>Where Income Tax liability is due <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> must be accounted for on any gain if the shares acquired are <abbr title="Readily Convertible Assets">RCAs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Schedule 3 Save As You Earn (<abbr title="Save As You Earn">SAYE</abbr>)</h4>

<p>When a share option is exercised in accordance with the rules of a Schedule 3 <abbr title="Save As You Earn">SAYE</abbr> scheme at least 3 years after the date on which it was granted, or within 6 months of leaving employment by reason of injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or a <abbr title="Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations">TUPE</abbr> transfer or a transfer of the employing company out of the group, then the gain is exempt from <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> liability. There’s also no income tax charge in certain cash takeovers. If a
taxable charge arises, any Income Tax payable is to be included in the employee’s Self Assessment tax return.</p>

<h4>Enterprise Management Incentives (<abbr title="Enterprise Management Incentives">EMI</abbr>)</h4>

<p>There’s no Income Tax or <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> liability on the grant of a qualifying <abbr title="Enterprise Management Incentives">EMI</abbr> option. Income Tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> liability may arise on the exercise of the <abbr title="Enterprise Management Incentives">EMI</abbr> option if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the option price is less than market value of the shares when the option was granted</li>
  <li>the shares under option are free</li>
  <li>there’s a disqualifying event</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> liability must be accounted for on any gain if the shares acquired are <abbr title="Readily Convertible Assets">RCAs</abbr>. For more details about the tax rules that apply to <abbr title="Enterprise Management Incentives">EMI</abbr> options, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employee-tax-advantaged-share-scheme-user-manual">Employee Tax Advantaged Share Schemes User Manual</a>.</p>

<h4>Schedule 2 Share Incentive Plans (<abbr title="Share Incentive Plans">SIP</abbr>)</h4>

<p>Shares acquired by employees under a Schedule 2 <abbr title="Share Incentive Plans">SIP</abbr> are generally exempt from <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> liability when awarded or withdrawn from the plan provided the shares have been held in the plan for 5 years.</p>

<p>Shares withdrawn from the plan earlier than 5 years because the employment has ended due to injury, disability, redundancy, retirement, death or a <abbr title="Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations">TUPE</abbr> transfer or a transfer of the employing company out of the group aren’t liable to income tax or <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>

<p>There’s also no income tax charge in certain cash takeovers. Shares that are <abbr title="Readily Convertible Assets">RCAs</abbr> and held for a shorter period may be subject to <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> liability in some circumstances. If the shares aren’t <abbr title="Readily Convertible Assets">RCAs</abbr> and an Income Tax charge arises then the tax is to be included in the person’s Self Assessment tax return.</p>

<h4>5.14.2 Restricted securities</h4>

<p>Securities (including shares) are restricted if they’re subject to forfeiture or have other restrictions which means that the market value of those securities is reduced, due to the restriction.</p>

<p>If securities are subject to a forfeiture provision that lasts for less than 5 years then Income Tax won’t arise at the time of acquisition unless an election has been entered into to disregard the restriction. <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> should be operated accordingly (subject to the security being an <abbr title="Readily Convertible Asset">RCA</abbr>).</p>

<p>If there’s no election then Income Tax will arise at the time when the forfeiture condition ceases to apply; <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> must then be applied if securities are <abbr title="Readily Convertible Assets">RCAs</abbr>. For restricted securities without a forfeiture restriction, Income Tax will arise at the time of acquisition on the value of the securities taking into account the value of the restrictions.</p>

<p>Further charges to Income Tax will arise when those restrictions are lifted. It’s also possible to enter into an election to disregard the restrictions at the time of acquisition in order to avoid further charges to Income Tax. <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> should be applied if securities are <abbr title="Readily Convertible Assets">RCAs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>5.14.3 Special charges on employment-related securities</h4>

<p>The following charges are subject to <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> where the securities are <abbr title="Readily Convertible Assets">RCAs</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>chargeable events in relation to restricted securities</li>
  <li>chargeable events in relation to convertible securities</li>
  <li>charge on acquisition where market value of securities is artificially depressed</li>
  <li>charge where market value of securities is artificially enhanced</li>
  <li>charge on discharge of notional loan where securities are acquired for less than market value (but not the annual charge)</li>
  <li>charge where securities are disposed of for more than market value</li>
  <li>chargeable benefits from securities</li>
</ul>

<p>Even if the securities aren’t <abbr title="Readily Convertible Assets">RCAs</abbr>, if the consideration takes the form of cash or an <abbr title="Readily Convertible Asset">RCA</abbr> then <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> should be operated.</p>

<h4>Securities and security options provided through third parties</h4>

<p>There are special rules which may apply where arrangements use third parties to reward employees, including by way of securities and securities options. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para5157">paragraph 5.15.7</a>.</p>

<h4>Employee Shareholder Status Shares</h4>

<p>The Employee Shareholder employment status came into effect from 1 September 2013 (although those who take advantage of the status scheme will remain employed earners for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes). Employee Shareholders will have different employment rights to employees, and in consideration for their agreement to adopt this status they’ll be awarded by their employing company at least £2,000 worth of shares.</p>

<p>There are tax reliefs for Employee Shareholder shares, and these apply from 1 September 2013. Income Tax and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> will usually not be chargeable on the first £2,000 of share value received by an Employee Shareholder.</p>

<p>This is because the Employee Shareholder is deemed to have made a payment of £2,000 for the Employee Shareholder shares. If shares having a market value of less than £2,000 are acquired, on the first or only day that shares are acquired in consideration of an Employee Shareholder agreement, then the payment of £2,000 won’t be deemed to have been made. The deemed payment by the employee only applies on the first occasion on which they acquire qualifying shares under an Employee Shareholder agreement.</p>

<p>For the Employee Shareholder agreement to have legal effect the employee must receive advice from a relevant legal adviser on the terms and effect of the Employee Shareholder agreement. The company is required to pay reasonable costs for that advice whether the individual accepts the job or not.</p>

<p>When an employer funds the cost of independent legal advice received by a person considering an Employee Shareholder position, this won’t be treated as a taxable benefit and there will be no Class 1A <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> liability. Also, payments to the individual to reimburse any reasonable costs of advice won’t give rise to any income tax liability and will be disregarded in the calculation of earnings for the purposes of earnings related <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.15 </span> Practical considerations on non-cash payments</h3>

<h4>5.15.1 <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on <abbr title="Readily Convertible Assets">RCAs</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Payment in the form of readily convertible assets must be included in gross pay for both <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes. The amount on which <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> should be operated and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> assessed is the amount of income which counts as employment income for Income Tax purposes. Include such notional payments in gross pay for the pay period the payment is deemed as paid. Work out <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> in the normal way. If the employee is on a K code, ignore the 50% overriding limit when calculating the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> due on the payment.</p>

<p>For chargeable events in relation to securities options, restricted securities and convertible securities, employees may enter into an agreement or election with the employer to meet some or all of the liability for employer’s <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>

<p>In these circumstances employer’s <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> met by the employee is a deductible amount for Income Tax purposes but isn’t deductible in calculating the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due.</p>

<h4>5.15.2 Deducting <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> from non-cash payments</h4>

<p>Recover from the employee the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> due on the non-cash payment by deducting it in the following way:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first, from any net wages, salaries, commission, fees and so on paid at the same time as non-cash payment, even if this reduces the employee’s pay to nil</li>
  <li>then from any later payments made in that pay period until the full amount of <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> due on the non-cash payment has been recovered</li>
</ul>

<p>Any <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> which you don’t recover from the employee, must be made good by the employee within 90 days (6 July) of the end of the tax year in which the non-cash payment was received.</p>

<p>If the employee doesn’t do this, then you must show the unrecovered amount as further remuneration on form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-end-of-year-expenses-and-benefits-p11d">P11D</a>.</p>

<h4>5.15.3 Deducting <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> from certain non-cash payment</h4>

<p>Where you make non-cash payments of earnings to an employee or an ex-employee you’ve the right to recover an employee’s share of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> from subsequent cash payments of earnings in the same tax year where an under-deduction occurred because there weren’t enough cash earnings.</p>

<p>When you recover such underpayments of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you can only recover the employee’s share of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> in the same tax year from any further cash payments of earnings to the employee, and</li>
  <li>the amount recovered can’t exceed the contribution due on that further payment</li>
</ul>

<p>If non-cash payments of earnings are made and you could not deduct the employee’s share of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> because there were not enough cash earnings, if the payment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has been made by an intermediary</li>
  <li>comprises a beneficial interest in shares</li>
  <li>comprises of securities or an interest in securities</li>
</ul>

<p>you have until the end of the tax year, following  the one in which the non-cash payments of earnings were made, to recover the employee’s share of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>. There’s no limit on the amount that you can recover from subsequent earnings to recover the under-deduction.</p>

<p>Intermediary is defined as either a person:</p>

<ul>
  <li>acting on behalf of the employer and at the expense of the employer</li>
  <li>connected with him, or trustees holding property for any person, or class of persons which includes, the employee</li>
</ul>

<p>The rules don’t affect your responsibility to account for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> at the time payment is made.</p>

<h4>5.15.4 Paying <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> on non-cash payments</h4>

<p><abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> payments are due by the 19th of the month following the end of the tax month or quarter to which it relates (or the 22nd if paying electronically).</p>

<p>You can pay quarterly if you estimate over the full tax year that your total payment will be, on average, less than £1,500 per month.</p>

<p>You must pay <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> all <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due, including that due on any non-cash payments made in that tax month or quarter, even if the employee did not have sufficient cash, to allow all the deductions to be made in that pay period.</p>

<h4>5.15.5 Recording a non-cash payment</h4>

<p>Regardless of whether or not the employer has borne the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and employee’s share of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> you must include the value of the non-cash payment of earnings with the related <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> due, on your payroll records for the employee, <abbr title="Full Payment Submissions">FPS</abbr> and P60 as appropriate.</p>

<p>If the employee leaves your employment during the year in which the non-cash payment of earnings was made, include the value of the asset and all <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> due when updating the payroll information.</p>

<h4>5.15.6 P11D</h4>

<p><abbr title="Readily Convertible Assets">RCAs</abbr> liable to <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> should not be reported on form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-end-of-year-expenses-and-benefits-p11d">P11D</a>, but tax not recovered from the employee may need to be reported on form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-end-of-year-expenses-and-benefits-p11d">P11D</a>, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para5122">paragraph 5.12.2</a>.</p>

<h4>5.15.7 Employment income provided through third parties (‘Disguised Remuneration’ rules)</h4>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>The rules on employment income made available through third parties deal with arrangements which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>involve third parties (including trusts or other vehicles used to reward employees)</li>
  <li>attempt to avoid or delay payment of Income Tax</li>
</ul>

<p>These rules are sometimes called the “disguised remuneration” rules or the ‘Part 7A’ rules (which refers to the part of <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/1/contents" rel="external"><abbr title="Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act">ITEPA</abbr> 2003</a> where most of the law is located).
The law also deals with pension schemes which aren’t registered pension schemes.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, if third party arrangements are used to make available what is in substance a reward or recognition, or a loan, in connection with the employee’s current, former, or future employment, then an Income Tax charge arises.</p>

<p>The rules contain detailed exclusions. These stop the law from catching certain arrangements. Generally the exclusions are targeted at arrangements which aren’t tax avoidance arrangements. If the law applies, it deems an amount to count as employment income.</p>

<p>The amount that counts as employment income is specifically brought within the scope of <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>. Special rules deal with, for example, the interaction with the remittance basis.</p>

<h4>General approach to whether a transaction is affected by the rules on employment income provided through third parties – Is there a third party involved?</h4>

<p>This is a very important starting point in working out whether the rules on employment income through third parties (‘the Part 7A rules’) apply. If the employer is providing something directly to the employee, and there’s no third party involved, then these rules won’t apply.</p>

<p>There are 3 exceptions to this general rule, the rules can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apply where the employer is acting as a trustee rather than as an employer</li>
  <li>also apply as a result of steps taken by an employer when there’s an agreement that contributions will be paid to a relevant third person comprising an unregistered pension arrangement</li>
  <li>apply where the employee concerned is acting as a trustee instead of in their capacity as an employee or individual</li>
</ul>

<h4>If there’s a third party, is it a group company?</h4>

<p>If the employer is a company that belongs to a group of companies, the Part 7A rules won’t apply to payments and other items provided to the employee by other companies in that group.</p>

<p>This depends on 4 conditions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The employer and the company in question must both be members of the group of companies at the time the relevant step is taken.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The test about membership of the same group must be satisfied.<br><br>To decide whether both companies are members of the same group, you apply the rules for Corporation Tax on chargeable gains, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/capital-gains-manual">Capital Gains Manual</a>. However, there’s one change. The chargeable gains test is a 75% test.<br><br>But when you apply the test under the rules on employment income through third parties, you change ’75%’ to ’51%’ throughout.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The group company mustn’t be acting as a trustee.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The step taken by the group company mustn’t be part of a tax avoidance arrangement.<br><br></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In practice routine arrangements, where a group company provides employment-related benefits or other parts of the normal pay package, will fall outside the scope of the Part 7A rules and will continue to be taxed as before.</p>

<p>Similar rules apply if the employer is a limited liability partnership, which has a wholly-owned company that provides benefits or part of the pay package to employees of the limited liability partnership.</p>

<h4>What if a third party is involved in a transaction with your employees? Scope of Part 7A rules</h4>

<p>A person who counts as a third party following the rules outlined above is referred to as a ‘relevant third person’. When a relevant third person provides something to your employees, then the Part 7A rules may apply. The Part 7A rules will only apply if all of the following conditions are satisfied:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there’s an arrangement that is potentially within the scope of the Part 7A rules in the first place (an arrangement to provide your employee, or former or prospective employee, with rewards, recognition or loans in connection with the employment)</li>
  <li>a relevant third person has taken a defined ‘relevant step’ (Note: not all transactions count as ‘relevant steps’ under Part 7A – for example, normal temporary provision of use of an asset available that is provided as an employment benefit, such as a company car, would not count as a relevant step)</li>
  <li>the step is connected with the arrangement in question</li>
</ul>

<p>However, you still need to work out if the transaction is specifically excluded from the application of the rules.</p>

<h4>Specific exclusions from the Part 7A rules</h4>

<p>If an arrangement has met the tests for potentially coming within the scope of the Part 7A rules, that doesn’t necessarily mean that it has given rise to Part 7A income. There are a number of specific exclusions that cut down the scope of Part 7A considerably. Check carefully to see if at least one of the exclusions applies.</p>

<p>The exclusions cover a range of circumstances including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>relevant steps taken ‘under’ or ‘for the purpose of’ tax-advantaged share schemes</li>
  <li>relevant steps taken under a registered pension scheme</li>
  <li>commercial transactions where the relevant third person is simply providing your employees with something that they provide on the same terms to members of the public in the ordinary course of their business</li>
  <li>certain transactions carried out as part of employee benefit packages</li>
  <li>certain transactions relating to deferred pay and share plan arrangements</li>
  <li>Employee Car Ownership Schemes</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally these exclusions are subject to specified conditions.</p>

<h4>Part 7A income</h4>

<p>If the step in question has met the test for coming within the scope of Part 7A and isn’t covered by any of the exclusions, then it will give rise to Part 7A income.</p>

<p>The Part 7A income counts as employment income of the employee, and is deemed to be <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> income paid by the employer.</p>

<p>The general rule is that the amount of the Part 7A income will be the value of the relevant step. But there are rules which in certain circumstances will adjust this value, possibly down to nil.</p>

<p>Where an amount is deemed to be <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> income paid by the employer, apply the guidance on practical considerations on non-cash payments at <a class="govuk-link" href="#para5151">paragraph 5.15.1</a> onwards.</p>

<p>For more information about Part 7A income, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual">Employment Income Manual</a>, EIM45000 onwards.</p>

<h4>5.15.8 Employment income provided through third parties (‘Disguised Remuneration’ rules) for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes</h4>

<p>Regulations to reflect the equivalent tax changes described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para5157">paragraph 5.15.7</a> apply where the arrangements attempt to avoid, reduce or delay payment of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where a payment is made through third party arrangements (such as through an Employee Benefit Trust) consider whether the payment is earnings under ordinary rules before applying the disguised remuneration rules.</p>

<p>Where the payment isn’t earnings and it’s treated as employment income for income tax purposes under the disguised remuneration rules set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para5157">paragraph 5.15.7</a>, it’s treated as earnings for Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes.</p>

<p>If the disguised remuneration rules treat an amount as earnings, the amount of earnings should be included in gross pay for Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes, on the date the relevant step is taken, as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para5157">paragraph 5.15.7</a>. So, for example, if a loan is made to an employee, the date the loan is made to the employee, is the date the earnings are paid.</p>

<p>If:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there’s an amount treated as earnings under the Part 7A rules, (for example, the value of a loan)</li>
  <li>at some later date some or all of that amount is a payment of earnings for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes, for example, because the employee isn’t required to repay the loan</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> aren’t due on the amount already included in gross pay when it was treated as earnings under the Part 7A rules. But if the amount that is earnings is more than the amount treated as earnings under the Part 7A rules, the extra amount should be included in gross pay for <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> purposes.</p>
