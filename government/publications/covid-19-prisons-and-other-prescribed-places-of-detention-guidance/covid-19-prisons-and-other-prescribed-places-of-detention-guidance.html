<p>This guidance is currently under review and will be updated to reflect recent policy changes for people with COVID-19 and contacts of a case of COVID-19  in the secure settings.</p>
</div>

<h2>What has changed</h2>

<p>This guidance has been updated to reflect changes to self-isolation requirements for contacts of people who have been identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of coronavirus (COVID-19). These contacts must isolate even if they are fully vaccinated or aged under 18 years and 6 months.</p>

<p>The public health advice for people with symptoms of, or a positive test result for, COVID-19 remains the same.</p>

<h2>Who this guidance is for</h2>

<p>This guidance will assist custodial, detention and healthcare staff in addressing COVID-19 in a prison or prescribed place of detention (<abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr>). It provides operational recommendations to assist staff, local Public Health England Health Protection Teams (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>) and other stakeholders if an incident or outbreak of COVID-19 is reported in a <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr>. Operational practices may vary due to setting specific considerations.</p>

<p>The following establishments in England are included within the definition of <abbr title="prison or prescribed places of detention">PPDs</abbr> used in this guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prisons (both public and privately managed)</li>
  <li>immigration removal centres (<abbr title="immigration removal centres">IRC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>children and young people’s secure estate (<abbr title="children and young people’s secure estate">CYPSE</abbr>):
    <ul>
      <li>young offender institutions (<abbr title="young offender institutions">YOIs</abbr>)</li>
      <li>secure training centres (<abbr title="secure training centres">STCs</abbr>)</li>
      <li>secure children’s homes (<abbr title="secure children’s homes">SCHs</abbr>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Recommendations made here are also relevant to prison escort and custodial services (<abbr title="prison escort and custodial services">PECS</abbr>) staff, particularly the environmental cleaning recommendations and advice to staff. Controlling the spread of infection and managing outbreaks in <abbr title="prison or prescribed places of detention">PPDs</abbr> will rely on coordinating healthcare and custodial staff working with <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>, national and regional Health and Justice teams and other stakeholders at both the local and national level. Other key stakeholders include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NHS England and Improvement Health and Justice Commissioners</li>
  <li>Home Office</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr> establishment managers and their teams</li>
  <li>Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service">HMPPS</abbr>) headquarters functions</li>
  <li>Directors of Public Health in local authorities</li>
</ul>

<p>Further information on specific actions required to identify and manage an incident or outbreak, as well as descriptions of the roles and responsibilities of partner organisations involved, is provided in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/multi-agency-contingency-plan-for-disease-outbreaks-in-prisons" class="govuk-link">Multi-agency contingency plan for the management of outbreaks of communicable diseases or other health protection incidents in prisons and other places of detention in England</a>.</p>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<p>The most important symptoms of COVID-19 are recent onset of any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new continuous cough</li>
  <li>a high temperature</li>
  <li>a loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell (anosmia)</li>
</ul>

<p>For most people, COVID-19 will be a mild illness. However, if a prisoner or detainee has any of the symptoms above, even if their symptoms are mild, they should be isolated (in accordance with relevant powers) and tested for COVID-19 with a polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) test. Staff or visitors having any of the symptoms above should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">arrange to have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</a> and follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>What to do if someone has symptoms of COVID-19 or has a positive COVID-19 test result in a <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr>
</h2>

<p>In <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr> settings, possible cases of COVID-19 are likely to be identified by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>custodial and detention staff</li>
  <li>other prisoners or detainees</li>
  <li>self-referral</li>
  <li>at reception screening</li>
  <li>regular asymptomatic testing, outbreak testing or through other means</li>
</ul>

<p>All staff should be alert to prisoners, colleagues, visitors or detainees who have symptoms of COVID-19.</p>

<p>All <abbr title="prison or prescribed places of detention">PPDs</abbr> should have a plan in place identifying an appropriate place to isolate prisoners or detainees with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.</p>

<p>If necessary, access to a language-line, or similar translation service, must be provided as soon as a person with possible or confirmed COVID-19 infection enters the establishment. This will ensure an accurate history can be taken and prisoners or <a class="govuk-link" href="#Cohorting">detainees cohorted appropriately</a>.</p>

<p>People in protective isolation should have regular opportunities to discuss their wellbeing and any anxieties with a member of staff.</p>

<h3>Prisoners or detainees</h3>

<h4>Prisoners or detainees with symptoms of COVID-19</h4>

<p>Prisoners or detainees with symptoms of COVID-19 should be placed in protective isolation (in accordance with relevant powers) in single occupancy accommodation immediately and be tested for COVID-19 with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. A lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) antigen test is not an appropriate substitute for a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test for a symptomatic patient.</p>

<p>They should remain in isolation while awaiting the results of the test.</p>

<p>If single occupancy accommodation is not available, possible cases should be held alone in higher occupancy accommodation, or where demand exceeds capacity <a class="govuk-link" href="#outbreak">during an outbreak</a>, the <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> will advise.</p>

<p>All detainees with symptoms of COVID-19 should wear a surgical face mask (Type II or IIR) while being transferred to protective isolation. Escorting staff should follow the guidance on <a href="#PPE" class="govuk-link">personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>)</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control" class="govuk-link">handwashing instructions</a> and maintain a 2 metre distance wherever possible.</p>

<p>Prisoners or detainees who are identified as confirmed or suspected cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 must be detained in single occupancy accommodation for the required 10 days (isolation). Contacts should follow guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="#ContactOmicron">Prisoners or detainees who are contacts of someone identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19</a>.</p>

<h4>Prisoners or detainees who test positive for COVID-19 with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</h4>

<p>Prisoners or detainees who test positive with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test should remain in protective isolation for at least 10 full days and only be released from isolation after a clinical assessment. The isolation period includes the day their symptoms started (or the day their test was taken if they do not have symptoms) and the next 10 full days.</p>

<p>Prisoners or detainees who are isolating because of a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result but who did not have symptoms should start a new 10 day isolation period if they develop COVID-19 symptoms during the initial isolation period, starting from the day of symptom onset.</p>

<p>If a detainee has previously received a positive COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result, they should not be re-tested within 90 days of that test, unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they develop any new symptoms of COVID-19</li>
  <li>they are a close contact of someone who has been identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<p>If the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is positive, the detainee must isolate and follow the steps in this guidance.</p>

<h4>Asymptomatic prisoners or detainees who test positive for COVID-19 with a lateral flow device antigen test (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>)</h4>

<p>Asymptomatic prisoners or detainees who test positive with an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test should be placed in protective isolation in single occupancy accommodation immediately and be tested with a follow-up <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test within 2 days of the positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test at the latest. They must remain in isolation while awaiting the results of the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test.</p>

<p>If the follow-up <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is positive they should complete the 10 full days isolation period and follow the advice in this guidance.</p>

<p>If the follow-up <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is negative, and this <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test was taken within 2 days of the positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test, the isolation can end subject to a clinical assessment.</p>

<p>If a follow-up <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test is not taken within 2 days after the positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result the prisoner or detainee must complete the 10 full days isolation period.</p>

<h4>Ending protective isolation</h4>

<p>Prisoners or detainees who test negative for COVID-19 and who were asymptomatic at the time of the test do not need to be isolated if they were tested as part of routine testing.</p>

<p><abbr title="prison or prescribed places of detention">PPDs</abbr> are high-risk settings for COVID-19. Given the high-risk setting, it is important to interpret negative results in symptomatic prisoners or detainees with caution and a clinical assessment should be undertaken before they are released from isolation.</p>

<p>Prisoners or detainees who have tested positive for COVID-19 may return to their normal routine on completion of their isolation period and clinical assessment if they do not have symptoms other than a cough or anosmia, as these symptoms can last for several weeks. They should also be at least 48 hours without fever.</p>

<p>If a prisoner or detainee still has symptoms other than cough or anosmia after 10 days or longer, they should continue to isolate until they have had a clinical assessment. If a prisoner or detainee develops COVID-19 symptoms at any point after ending their first period of isolation they should start a new 10 day isolation period, starting from the day of symptom onset, and have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test.</p>

<p>Prisoners or detainees who have been admitted to hospital should be isolated in hospital (or continue to self-isolate on discharge) for 14 days from their first positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result. This is because COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital will usually have more severe disease and are more likely to have pre-existing conditions, such as severe immunosuppression.</p>

<h4>Prisoners or detainees who are identified as contacts of a case of COVID-19</h4>

<h4>Prisoners or detainees who are contacts of someone identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19</h4>

<p>Any prisoner or detainee who is a contact of someone who has been identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 must stay in isolation for the required 10 days. This includes prisoners or detainees who are fully vaccinated or aged under 18 years and 6 months.</p>

<p>Contacts of people who have been identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of coronavirus (COVID-19) must be detained in single occupancy accommodation for the required 10 days (isolation).</p>

<p>All contacts of confirmed, symptomatic or suspected Omicron variant of COVID-19 detainees should be meticulous in their hand hygiene and wear a surgical face mask (Type II or IIR) when leaving their cell for any reason including when being transferred to protective isolation.</p>

<p>The Health Protection Team (<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>)/Outbreak Control Team (<abbr title="outbreak control team">OCT</abbr>) will advise regarding cohorting restrictions.</p>

<p>All staff should follow the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-prisons-and-other-prescribed-places-of-detention-guidance/covid-19-prisons-and-other-prescribed-places-of-detention-guidance#PPE">personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>)</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control">handwashing instructions</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-guidance-for-maintaining-services-within-health-and-care-settings-infection-prevention-and-control-recommendations" class="govuk-link">maintain a 2 metre distance wherever possible</a>.</p>

<p>Contacts should have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test as soon as possible. Detainees who have previously received a positive COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result, are not usually advised to be re-tested within 90 days of that test. However, they should have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test within 90 days of a previous positive test if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they develop any new symptoms of COVID-19</li>
  <li>they are a close contact of someone who has been identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<p>If the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is positive, the detainee must isolate and follow the steps in this guidance.</p>

<h4>If a prisoner or detainee is fully vaccinated and is identified as a contact of a case of COVID-19 not suspected or confirmed to be the Omicron variant</h4>

<p>Prisoners or detainees that are notified that they are a contact of a case of COVID-19 not suspected or confirmed to be the Omicron variant are not required to self-isolate for 10 full days if they are fully vaccinated, subject to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the prisoner or detainee should not have any COVID-19 symptoms</li>
  <li>the prisoner or detainee takes a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test when contacted and isolates until a negative test result is returned</li>
  <li>the prisoner or detainee takes an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test each day for 7 days and the results should be negative</li>
  <li>if a prisoner or detainee has had a COVID-19 infection in the past 90 days, they should not have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test and should only undertake daily <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>  tests</li>
  <li>the prisoner or detainee agrees to wear a surgical face mask (Type II or IIR) when out of their cell</li>
  <li>the prisoner or detainee should not mix with people who are highly vulnerable to COVID-19 during the 10 day period following their contact with the case. This includes visitors they may receive who are highly vulnerable to COVID-19, even if the visitor is fully vaccinated</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if they are a contact of someone identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant, they need to follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="#ContactOmicron">Prisoners or detainees who are contacts of someone identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 guidance in the section above</a>.</p>

<p>Fully vaccinated means that they have been vaccinated with an MHRA approved COVID-19 vaccine in the UK, and at least 14 days have passed since they received the recommended doses of that vaccine.</p>

<p>If the prisoner or detainee develops symptoms of COVID-19 during this period, follow the guidance for <a href="#Prisonerwithsymptoms" class="govuk-link">prisoners or detainees with symptoms of COVID-19</a>.</p>

<h4>If a prisoner or detainee is unvaccinated or partially vaccinated and is identified as a contact of a case of COVID-19 not suspected or confirmed to be the Omicron variant</h4>

<p>Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated prisoners or detainees who are known to have been exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 case should be isolated for 10 full days after their last exposure to a case. <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> will advise on cohorting people. If they are cohorted, this should only be with other residents who do not have COVID-19 symptoms but who have also been exposed to the same index case of COVID-19.</p>

<p>As <abbr title="prison or prescribed places of detention">PPDs</abbr> are high-risk settings for COVID-19, this requirement applies equally to prisoners or detainees who have previously recovered from COVID-19.</p>

<p>If the prisoner or detainee develops symptoms of COVID-19 during this period, follow the guidance for <a class="govuk-link" href="#Prisonerwithsymptoms">prisoners or detainees with symptoms of COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>If prisoners or detainees have been cohorted, all members of the cohort may end isolation after 10 full days and clinical assessment if none of the members develop COVID-19 symptoms or test positive for COVID-19 (with either an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test).</p>

<p>If individuals who have been cohorted with other prisoners or detainees subsequently test positive for COVID-19 with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, all the members of the cohort will need to re-start their 10 day isolation period from the date of their last exposure to the newly diagnosed case.</p>

<p>If a member of the cohort has tested positive with an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test, all members of the group should isolate until the possible case receives their follow-up <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result and an assessment on whether to extend isolation can be made.</p>

<p>Prisoners and detainees are strongly encouraged to be vaccinated to protect themselves and others from infection.</p>

<h4>Clinical assessment and healthcare</h4>

<p>Where possible, any assessments should be done without entering the cell or room. Detailed guidance for prison healthcare on the <a href="https://elearning.rcgp.org.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=10388" class="govuk-link" rel="external">management of COVID-19 in secure environments</a> is available from the Royal College of General Practitioners (see ‘Secure Environments’ tab and select ‘COVID-19 Guidance for healthcare in secure environments’). It is important to be aware of people who have underlying co-morbidities and are clinically extremely vulnerable to COVID-19 needing closer monitoring or hospital admission, as they are at higher risk of deteriorating.</p>

<p>Prisoners or detainees who have symptoms of COVID-19, but who are clinically well enough to remain in the <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr>, do not need to be transferred to hospital. Those who are clinically unwell and require hospitalisation should be transferred to appropriate healthcare facilities following safe escort and transfer protocols for the establishment. Staff should wear appropriate <a href="#PPE" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr></a>. The prisoner or detainee should be offered a surgical face mask (Type II or IIR) to be worn during transportation, if tolerated, to minimise the dispersal of respiratory droplets. Staff at the receiving destination must be informed that the patient has possible or confirmed COVID-19.</p>

<h3>Staff</h3>

<h4>Staff with symptoms of COVID-19</h4>

<p>If a member of staff develops symptoms of COVID-19, however mild:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they should self-isolate and follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance</a>
</li>
  <li>if at home (off-duty), they should not attend work and notify their line manager</li>
  <li>if at work, they should put on a surgical face mask (Type II or IIR) immediately, inform their line manager and return home</li>
  <li>they should arrange to have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</li>
</ul>

<h4>Staff who have tested positive for COVID-19 with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</h4>

<p>Staff who have tested positive for COVID-19 by a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test must self-isolate for at least 10 full days and follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">stay at home guidance</a>. The isolation period includes the day their symptoms started (or the day their test was taken if they do not have symptoms) and the next 10 full days. If, however, they have been admitted to hospital they should be isolated in hospital (or continue to self-isolate on discharge) for 14 days from their first positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result.</p>

<p>Staff who are isolating because of a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result but who did not have symptoms should start a new 10 full day isolation period if they develop COVID-19 symptoms during the initial isolation period, starting from the day of symptom onset.</p>

<p>Staff who have tested positive for COVID-19 may return to work on completion of their required isolation period and a clinical assessment if they do not have symptoms other than a cough or anosmia, as these symptoms can last for several weeks. They should also be at least 48 hours without fever.</p>

<h4>Symptomatic staff who have tested negative for COVID-19 with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</h4>

<p>Given the high-risk setting, it is important to interpret negative results in symptomatic staff with caution and a clinical assessment should be undertaken before they start working.</p>

<h4>Asymptomatic staff who have tested positive for COVID-19 with an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test</h4>

<p>Staff who have <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests as part of an assisted asymptomatic testing programme, and who test positive, must self-isolate immediately and arrange to have a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test within 2 days of the positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test at the latest. If the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is positive, they must continue to self-isolate for 10 days and follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">stay at home guidance</a>. Staff who take <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests at home (self-reported) should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<p>If the follow-up <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is negative, and this <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test was taken within 2 days of the positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test, self-isolation can end.</p>

<p>If a follow-up <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test is not taken within 2 days after the positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result staff must complete the 10 full days isolation period.</p>

<h4>Asymptomatic staff who have tested negative for COVID-19 with an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test</h4>

<p>Staff who test negative for COVID-19 with an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test as part of routine testing and who were asymptomatic at the time of the test can remain at work or return to work immediately as long as they remain asymptomatic.</p>

<h4>Staff who are contacts of a suspected or confirmed case of Omicron variant of COVID-19</h4>

<p>If a staff member lives in the same household as, or has been informed that they are a contact of someone who has been identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, they must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">stay at home</a> and self-isolate for the full 10 days.</p>

<p>The requirement to stay at home and self-isolate applies even if the staff member is fully vaccinated.</p>

<p>The staff member should arrange to have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test as soon as possible and follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">stay at home guidance</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person" class="govuk-link">guidance for non-household contacts</a> as appropriate.</p>

<p>If the staff member has previously received a positive COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result, they should not be re-tested within 90 days of that test, unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they develop any new symptoms of COVID-19</li>
  <li>they are a close contact of someone who has been identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 or</li>
  <li>they are required to take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test upon entry to the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>If the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is positive, they must stay at home, self-isolate and follow the steps in this guidance again.</p>

<h4>If a staff member is fully vaccinated and is a contact of a case that has not been identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19</h4>

<p>Staff members that are notified that they are a contact of a COVID-19 case are not required to self-isolate for 10 days if they are fully vaccinated. They should inform their line manager or employer immediately if they are required to work in the next 10 days.</p>

<p>However, if they are a contact of someone identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant, they need to follow the <a href="#ContactOmicron" class="govuk-link">Staff who are contacts of a suspected or confirmed case of Omicron variant of COVID-19 guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Fully vaccinated means that they have been vaccinated with an MHRA approved COVID-19 vaccine in the UK, and at least 14 days have passed since they received the recommended doses of that vaccine.</p>

<p>If the staff member develops symptoms of COVID-19 during this period, follow the guidance for <a href="#Staffwithsymptoms" class="govuk-link">staff with symptoms of COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>The majority of staff will be able to continue in their usual role. The following apply to all staff returning to work following this exemption:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the staff member should not have any COVID-19 symptoms</li>
  <li>the staff member should be strongly advised to have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>  test, either through their workplace arrangements or via the NHS Test and Trace service, before starting work</li>
  <li>the staff member should undertake an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test every day for 7 days (even on days they are not at work)</li>
  <li>on days the staff member is working, this <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test should be taken before starting their shift, and the result should be negative</li>
  <li>if a staff member has had a COVID-19 infection in the past 90 days, they should not have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test and should only undertake daily <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>  tests</li>
  <li>the staff member should comply with all relevant infection control precautions and <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be properly worn throughout the day</li>
  <li>the staff member should not work with prisoners or detainees who are highly vulnerable to COVID-19 during the 10 day period following their contact with the case</li>
</ul>

<h4>If an unvaccinated or partially vaccinated staff who are contacts of a COVID-19 case that has not been identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant</h4>

<p>Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated staff members who are contacts of a COVID-19 case may take part in the <abbr title="Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service">HMPPS</abbr> Daily Contact Testing Programme to return to work. All individuals identified as contacts of a positive case will continue to be contact traced and the vaccination status of a contact will be verified by Health Resilience Leads.</p>

<p>However, contacts of someone who has been identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 can not take part in daily contact testing, and must complete their full 10 day isolation period.</p>

<p>Prison staff are strongly encouraged to be vaccinated to protect themselves and others from infection.</p>

<p>If the staff member develops symptoms of COVID-19 during this period, follow the guidance for <a class="govuk-link" href="#Staffwithsymptoms">staff with symptoms of COVID-19</a>.</p>

<h3>Visitors</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-someone-in-prison-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic" class="govuk-link">Guidance on visiting someone in prison</a> is available. People who are self-isolating or have symptoms of COVID-19 should not visit anyone in a prison. If a visitor develops symptoms within 48 hours of the visit they should inform the prison.</p>

<p>If a visitor becomes unwell with symptoms of COVID-19 while at the prison, they should go home immediately and follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>Management and reporting of a case or outbreak of COVID-19 in a <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr>
</h2>

<p>On clinical suspicion or confirmation of a case or outbreak within a <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr>, the appropriate registered medical practitioner must notify the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/contacts-public-health-england-regions-local-centres-and-emergency">local <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr></a> as soon as possible and provide all requested information. Following initial risk assessment by the <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> and <abbr title="prison or prescribed places of detention">PPDs</abbr>, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> are advised to convene an incident or outbreak control team (<abbr title="incident control team">ICT</abbr>/<abbr title="outbreak control team">OCT</abbr>) in response to notification of a possible or probable incident or outbreak of COVID-19.</p>

<p>An outbreak is defined as 2 or more prisoners or detainees or staff in the <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr> who meet the case definition for COVID-19 or have a positive test result and among whom transmission was likely to have occurred within a 14-day period. The role of the <abbr title="incident control team">ICT</abbr>/<abbr title="outbreak control team">OCT</abbr> is to ensure the outbreak/incident is appropriately investigated and managed, and to advise the Governor or appropriate Senior Manager of the <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr> on measures required to control it, which may impact on operational, logistic and security challenges for the setting.</p>

<p><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>’s National Health and Justice Team will provide advice and support to responding <abbr title="incident control team">ICT</abbr>/<abbr title="outbreak control teams">OCTs</abbr>, conduct surveillance at national level, share intelligence with key partners, and develop national guidance for use in preventing and managing outbreaks.</p>

<p>In all establishments, contact tracing must be initiated immediately. <abbr title="Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service">HMPPS</abbr> Contact Tracing Leads (<abbr title="contact tracing leads">CTLs</abbr>) have been appointed for each establishment and will undertake an initial risk screening to determine which individuals need to isolate based on available information. Confirmed contacts will then be added onto the national Test and Trace Database by <abbr title="contact tracing leads">CTLs</abbr>. Those with a negative test result will be clinically assessed. The <abbr title="Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service">HMPPS</abbr> Contact Tracing strategy operates as part of the wider NHS Test and Trace model and <abbr title="contact tracing leads">CTLs</abbr> will liaise with <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> where to resolve complex cases.</p>

<p>Stakeholders responding to outbreaks must work through the formal structure of the <abbr title="outbreak control team">OCT</abbr> as detailed in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/multi-agency-contingency-plan-for-disease-outbreaks-in-prisons" class="govuk-link">multi-agency contingency plan for the management of outbreaks of disease in <abbr title="prison or prescribed places of detention">PPDs</abbr></a>. Following a risk assessment, the <abbr title="outbreak control team">OCT</abbr> will advise on an appropriate testing strategy.</p>

<p>A dedicated protective isolation unit or area for the temporary isolation of cases who are unwell should be designated within the establishment to facilitate better monitoring or provision of health services to these patients.</p>

<p>An outbreak is considered to be over when there are no test confirmed cases with illness onset dates in the last 28 days in that setting. This refers to anyone working or living in the setting.</p>

<h2>Population management during an outbreak of COVID-19 in a <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr>
</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/multi-agency-contingency-plan-for-disease-outbreaks-in-prisons">multi-agency contingency plan for the management of outbreaks of communicable diseases or other health protection incidents in prisons and other places of detention in England</a> describes specific actions required to identify and manage an incident or outbreak.  Where an outbreak has been declared, the Governor or appropriate Manager should inform the <abbr title="Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service">HMPPS</abbr> National COVID-19 reporting system (or equivalent in other <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr>) in the first instance. They will engage with the Population Management Unit through command arrangements. A dynamic risk assessment form should be completed by the Governor or Manager and the <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> Consultant in Health Protection leading the <abbr title="outbreak control team">OCT</abbr>. Outbreaks should be reported to <abbr title="Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service">HMPPS</abbr> or Home Office as applicable.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="outbreak control team">OCT</abbr> may consider recommending:</p>

<ul>
  <li>restricting transfers out to other <abbr title="prison or prescribed places of detention">PPDs</abbr>. This is to avoid seeding an outbreak in another <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr>. Where required for security reasons, the receiving <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr> should be notified of the outbreak. Avoid transferring symptomatic prisoners or detainees as a priority. All infection control advice should be followed if transfer is required</li>
  <li>restricting new receptions. This is to avoid feeding an outbreak by introducing new vulnerable cases to the <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr>. If not possible to restrict completely, new receptions should be:
    <ul>
      <li>assessed to determine if they are in a high-risk clinical group</li>
      <li>assessed for signs and symptoms of COVID-19, and any symptomatic new arrivals should be isolated or cohorted immediately and managed as detailed in this guidance</li>
      <li>additional testing of detainees and staff</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Court appointments during an outbreak of COVID-19 in a prison</h2>

<p>Courts should be informed of an outbreak of COVID-19 in a <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr> and individuals who test positive or are symptomatic should not attend court. Courts should be advised if a prisoner or detainee has tested positive or has symptoms of COVID-19 as soon as possible. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-courts-and-tribunals-planning-and-preparation">Guidance for court and tribunal users</a> is available.</p>

<p>Any court attendance that cannot be avoided should follow safe escort and transfer protocols for the establishment. If the person is remanded in custody in a different prison, the receiving prison should be notified of the outbreak in the original prison and if the prisoner or detainee has tested positive for COVID-19, has symptoms of COVID-19 or is a contact of a confirmed case. A note should be placed on SystmOne for healthcare teams.</p>

<p>If the courts have allocated prisoners or detainees to a site affected by COVID-19, redirection to an establishment without an outbreak should be considered. In some circumstances and based on an establishment’s function, this may not be sustainable for more than a few days.</p>

<h2>Cohorting of symptomatic, clinically vulnerable and newly received detainees</h2>

<p>Contacts of people who have been identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of coronavirus (COVID-19) must be detained in single occupancy accommodation for the required 10 days (isolation) and must not be cohorted with any other people.</p>

<p>Cohorting is a public health strategy for the care of large numbers of people who are ill, potentially infectious, or who are vulnerable and present heightened risk of severe disease if infected. Cohorting involves gathering these groups of people into separate areas and establishing effective barrier control between the groups and the wider population to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This may mean compartmentalising <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr> establishments into separate areas to make sure the groups can be kept apart.</p>

<p>Cohorting strategies should consider arrangements to protect those at risk of severe illness from COVID-19 (those who are clinically extremely vulnerable), measures to isolate those who are symptomatic (and any cell or room-sharers) and provision to hold newly received prisoners or detainees separated from the main population.</p>

<p>To minimise the risk to other prisoners or detainees during periods of sustained community transmission of COVID-19, all new and transferred prisoners or detainees should be isolated in a Reverse Cohorting Unit (<abbr title="reverse cohorting unit">RCU</abbr>) for up to 14 days and <a href="#Testing" class="govuk-link">tested for COVID-19</a>, allowing the <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr> to ensure each individual is not infected.</p>

<p>Prison Governors, Directors and <abbr title="immigration removal centres">IRC</abbr> Managers must survey their establishments for suitability for cohorting and conduct risk assessments on the co-location of people who would normally be kept separated. Plans to implement cohorting should be developed in conjunction with appropriate clinical, infection control and specialist public health advice.</p>

<p>Staff overseeing a cohorted population should limit movements to other parts of the <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr> to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19. Where staff movement is unavoidable it should be minimised, and extra care taken to ensure <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control" class="govuk-link">infection control measures</a> are strictly adhered to.</p>

<h2>Testing for COVID-19 in <abbr title="prison or prescribed places of detention">PPDs</abbr>
</h2>

<p>There are 2 main types of test currently being used to detect if someone has COVID-19:</p>

<ul>
  <li>polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) tests</li>
  <li>lateral flow device antigen (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) tests</li>
</ul>

<p>Any prisoner, detainee or member of staff with symptoms of COVID-19 should be isolated (self-isolate for staff) and have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. Prisoners or detainees with symptoms of COVID-19 should be tested by healthcare staff wherever possible. The local <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> can provide additional advice on testing and procedures.</p>

<p>Anyone who has previously received a positive COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result should not be re-tested within 90 days of that test, unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they develop any new symptoms of COVID-19</li>
  <li>they are a close contact of someone who has been identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<p>If the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is positive, they must stay at home, self-isolate and follow the steps in this guidance again.</p>

<p>This 90-day period starts when the person initially develops symptoms or, if they were asymptomatic when they were tested, the date of their positive test result.</p>

<p>Asymptomatic testing of prisoners, detainees and staff for COVID-19 is also required in <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr> settings in the following outbreak and non-outbreak situations.</p>

<h3>During an outbreak</h3>

<p>In outbreak situations, <abbr title="outbreak control teams">OCTs</abbr> will undertake a risk assessment and decide whether to activate whole <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr> testing. If activated, whole <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr> testing will involve all prisoners or detainees and staff being tested using both an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. If it is only possible to do one type of test, an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test should be used in the first instance. Testing should be undertaken as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at day 0 (the first day mass testing is available)</li>
  <li>between days 5 and 7</li>
  <li>at day 28 after the last confirmed or suspected case, to confirm the outbreak is over (recovery testing)</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing should be considered as part of the risk mitigation strategy (in agreement with the <abbr title="incident control team">ICT</abbr>/<abbr title="outbreak control team">OCT</abbr>) to enable prisoners to be transferred out of the custodial setting to assist with population management. In these circumstances, a prisoner should have an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test on the day before and on the day of departure from the custodial setting with the outbreak.</p>

<p>During an outbreak, testing of prisoners using <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests should also take place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>before release</li>
  <li>before a transfer to another prison</li>
  <li>before a court attendance</li>
  <li>immediately before and after a period of release on temporary licence (<abbr title="release on temporary licence">ROTL</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Cases and contacts of people who have been identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of coronavirus (COVID-19) must be detained in single occupancy accommodation for the required 10 days (isolation).</p>

<p><abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> will advise on the exceptional circumstances when single occupancy is not available.</p>

<p>Detainees confirmed of being a contact with a case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 should not be cohorted with confirmed non-Omicron variant of COVID-19 cases.</p>

<p>Detainees suspected of being a contact with a case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 should not be cohorted with suspected non-Omicron variant of COVID-19 cases.</p>

<h3>Non-outbreak situations</h3>

<h4>Staff</h4>

<p>In non-outbreak situations, all staff should be tested weekly with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test and twice weekly with an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test (one of the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests being midweek). Following a period of leave or cross-deployment, staff should be tested for COVID-19 with an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test and have a negative result before returning to work or starting a shift.</p>

<p>In the children and young people’s secure estate, staff testing is the same as in the adult estate (weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests and twice weekly <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests), with the exception of staff in <abbr title="secure children’s homes">SCHs</abbr> who should take <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests twice a week with a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> in the event of a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> result.</p>

<h4>Prisoner or detainee</h4>

<p>All prisoners or detainees entering prisons are placed in <abbr title="reverse cohorting units">RCUs</abbr>. Prisoners or detainees in <abbr title="reverse cohorting units">RCUs</abbr> should be tested with <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests at reception and again 5 to 7 days after they arrive. They should remain in the <abbr title="reverse cohorting unit">RCU</abbr> for 14 days but if population management dictates, they can be moved into the general population once the second negative test has been confirmed.</p>

<p>Essential workers should be tested twice weekly with an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test (one of the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests being mid-week).</p>

<p>Asymptomatic testing of prisoners or detainees using <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> should also take place:</p>

<h4>Children and young people</h4>

<p>In <abbr title="young offender institutions">YOIs</abbr> and <abbr title="secure training centres">STCs</abbr> where <abbr title="reverse cohorting units">RCUs</abbr> are operating, the same arrangements apply for children as in the adult estate.</p>

<p>In <abbr title="secure children’s homes">SCHs</abbr> where all accommodation is provided on a single room basis, children should have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test on arrival and again 5 to 7 days after they arrive. They will be able to leave isolation after 10 full days or 2 negative tests.</p>

<h2>Transition of prisoners or detainees to the community</h2>

<p>All individuals should be seen by healthcare services as part of normal preparations for release. Prisoners and detainees cannot be detained beyond their tariff.</p>

<p>Where applicable, the local authority, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> and <abbr title="Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service">HMPPS</abbr> (including probation) must be made aware of any cases or close contacts of known cases returning to the community before completing a full period of protective isolation, for example, less than 10 days for cases or contacts of cases. The local authority must be made aware of any cases or close contacts of known cases with no fixed abode. People returning to the community need to be prepared and to understand <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-summer-2021-roadmap/coronavirus-how-to-stay-safe-and-help-prevent-the-spread">how to stay safe and help prevent the spread of COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>Probation services and approved premises/hostels should also be advised to facilitate appropriate self-isolation if the person is symptomatic, has had a positive test for COVID-19, or has had contact with a confirmed case.</p>

<h2>Limiting spread of COVID-19 in <abbr title="prison or prescribed places of detention">PPDs</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Managers of <abbr title="prison or prescribed places of detention">PPDs</abbr> can help reduce the spread of COVID-19 by regularly reviewing existing control measures, ensuring adherence to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control">infection prevention and control recommendations</a> and reminding everyone of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">available public health advice and support</a>. Guidance on mitigations to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 also applies to new variants.</p>

<p>Resources including <a href="https://campaignresources.phe.gov.uk/resources/campaigns/101-coronavirus-/resources" class="govuk-link" rel="external">posters, leaflets and other materials</a> are available.</p>

<p>To reduce the risk of catching COVID-19 and passing it on to others:</p>

<ul>
  <li>staff (when not performing duties requiring close contact) and prisoners or detainees - maintain 2 metre distance (where recommended) from others wherever possible</li>
  <li>staff should wear specified <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for activities requiring sustained close contact with possible or confirmed cases</li>
  <li>remind staff and prisoners or detainees to wash their hands with soap and water regularly and to cover their mouths and noses with disposable tissues when they cough or sneeze. Individuals should dispose of tissues into a disposable rubbish bag. If they do not have a tissue, remind them to sneeze into the crook of the elbow, not into the hand and immediately wash hands with soap and water or use hand sanitiser</li>
  <li>objects and surfaces should be <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings" class="govuk-link">cleaned and disinfected</a> regularly using standard cleaning products, paying attention to all surfaces but especially ones that are touched frequently</li>
  <li>make sure there is adequate <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation/index.htm">ventilation of indoor spaces</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>While social distancing and other measures in general have been lifted, it may be appropriate to apply some of these measures depending on the risks, if risk assessments suggest doing so. Use of social distancing should be targeted, time limited, and kept under review.</p>

<h2>Advice on the use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for healthcare staff and custodial or detention staff</h2>

<p>Staff should minimise any non-essential and avoidable contact with any staff member or prisoner.</p>

<p>Healthcare staff are most likely to work directly with possible or confirmed COVID-19 cases but custodial staff, <abbr title="prison escort and custodial services">PECS</abbr> and transport services may also encounter individuals when symptoms first present or who are asymptomatic.</p>

<p>Mitigation measures, including <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, should be determined by risk assessment and implemented as part of a hierarchy of controls approach. For activities requiring close contact with a possible or confirmed case of COVID-19, for example, patient assessment, interviewing people at less than 2 metres distance, or arrest and restraint, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe">guidance on <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr></a> is available.  An <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-prisons-and-other-prescribed-places-of-detention-guidance">activity/context specific table</a> summarising the recommended <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for staff in <abbr title="prison or prescribed places of detention">PPDs</abbr> is available. Dispose of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> as clinical waste.</p>

<p>Hand and respiratory hygiene are important components of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control">infection prevention and control measures</a> and essential to reduce cross-contamination and infection.</p>

<p>Staff use of fluid resistant surgical masks (Type IIR) should be considered to reduce transmission of COVID-19, particularly in poorly ventilated or crowded areas, or wherever physical distancing of 2 metres (where recommended) is hard to achieve.</p>

<h2>Risk assessment for staff exposures in the workplace</h2>

<p>All staff who come into contact with COVID-19 cases – whether or not they are protected by the use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> or by other risk mitigation measures– should remain vigilant to the possibility of contracting infection and should self-isolate immediately if they develop COVID-19 symptoms.</p>

<p>If a member of staff has come into close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case or symptomatic prisoner or detainee suspected of having COVID-19 while not wearing <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, or had a breach in their <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> while providing assistance to a prisoner or detainee with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, then the staff member should inform their line manager. A risk assessment should be undertaken in conjunction with local infection prevention and control policy and clinical advice to determine if there has been a significant breach or close contact without <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. If the risk assessment concludes there has been a significant breach or close contact without <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, the Prison Contact Tracing Lead should be notified and the member of staff should stay at home and complete 10 full days isolation. If they develop symptoms of COVID-19 they should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</a> and follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">stay at home guidance</a>. Advice about whether a risk-assessment is needed may also be sought from the <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>.</p>

<p>The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) provides information on <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/index.htm" class="govuk-link" rel="external">working safely</a> for employers and employees.</p>

<h2>Cleaning and waste</h2>

<p>Guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings" class="govuk-link">cleaning and waste disposal</a> is available.</p>

<h2>Vaccination</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae" rel="external" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 vaccination programme</a> is being delivered to all adults in England. Every effort should be made to encourage staff and prisoners or detainees to get fully vaccinated, especially given the vulnerabilities of people in prisons and places of detention.</p>

<p>COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to reduce the likelihood of catching COVID-19 and of severe illness for those who have received them. COVID-19 vaccines also reduce the likelihood of a vaccinated person spreading COVID-19 to others, but it is still possible for this to happen. Guidance on isolation and testing should be followed even if someone has received one or more doses of COVID-19 vaccine. This will reduce the risk of spreading infection and help to protect other people.</p>

<p>This guidance is of a general nature and should be treated as a guide. In the event of any conflict between any applicable legislation (including the health and safety legislation) and this guidance, the applicable legislation shall prevail.</p>
