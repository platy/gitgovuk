<h2>Who this guidance is for</h2>

<p>This guidance will assist custodial, detention and healthcare staff in addressing coronavirus (COVID-19) in a prison or prescribed place of detention (<abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr>). It provides operational recommendations to assist staff, local UKHSA Health Protection Teams (UKHSA <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>) and other stakeholders if an incident or outbreak of COVID-19 is reported in a <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr>. Operational practices may vary due to setting specific considerations.</p>

<p>The following establishments in England are included within the definition of <abbr title="prison or prescribed places of detention">PPDs</abbr> used in this guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prisons (both public and privately managed)</li>
  <li>immigration removal centres (<abbr title="immigration removal centres">IRC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>children and young people’s secure estate (<abbr title="children and young people’s secure estate">CYPSE</abbr>):
    <ul>
      <li>young offender institutions (<abbr title="young offender institutions">YOIs</abbr>)</li>
      <li>secure training centres (<abbr title="secure training centres">STCs</abbr>)</li>
      <li>secure children’s homes (<abbr title="secure children’s homes">SCHs</abbr>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Recommendations made here are also relevant to prison escort and custodial services (<abbr title="prison escort and custodial services">PECS</abbr>) staff and approved premises, particularly the sections on environmental cleaning and advice to staff. Controlling the spread of infection and managing outbreaks in <abbr title="prison or prescribed places of detention">PPDs</abbr> will rely on coordinating healthcare and custodial staff working with UKHSA <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>, national and regional Health and Justice teams and other stakeholders at both the local and national level. Other key stakeholders include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NHS England and Improvement Health and Justice Commissioners</li>
  <li>Home Office</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr> establishment managers and their teams</li>
  <li>Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service">HMPPS</abbr>) headquarters functions</li>
  <li>Directors of Public Health in local authorities</li>
</ul>

<p>Further information on specific actions required to identify and manage an incident or outbreak, as well as descriptions of the roles and responsibilities of partner organisations involved, is provided in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/multi-agency-contingency-plan-for-disease-outbreaks-in-prisons" class="govuk-link">Multi-agency contingency plan for the management of outbreaks of communicable diseases or other health protection incidents in prisons and other places of detention in England</a>.</p>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<p>The main symptoms of COVID-19 are recent onset of any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new continuous cough</li>
  <li>a high temperature</li>
  <li>a loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell (anosmia)</li>
</ul>

<p>For most people, COVID-19 will be a mild illness. However, if a prisoner or detainee has any of the symptoms above, even if their symptoms are mild, they should be isolated (in accordance with relevant powers) and tested for COVID-19 with a polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) test. Staff or visitors having any of the symptoms above should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">arrange to have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</a> and follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>What to do if someone has symptoms of COVID-19 or has a positive COVID-19 test result in a <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr>
</h2>

<p>In <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr> settings, possible cases of COVID-19 are likely to be identified by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>custodial and detention staff</li>
  <li>other prisoners or detainees</li>
  <li>self-referral</li>
  <li>at reception screening</li>
  <li>regular asymptomatic testing, outbreak testing or through other means</li>
</ul>

<p>All staff should be alert to prisoners, colleagues, visitors or detainees who have symptoms of COVID-19.</p>

<p>All <abbr title="prison or prescribed places of detention">PPDs</abbr> should have a plan in place that identifies an appropriate place to isolate prisoners or detainees with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.</p>

<p>If necessary, access to a language-line, or similar translation service, must be provided as soon as a person with possible or confirmed COVID-19 infection enters the establishment. This will ensure an accurate history can be taken and prisoners or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-prisons-and-other-prescribed-places-of-detention-guidance/covid-19-prisons-and-other-prescribed-places-of-detention-guidance#Cohorting">detainees cohorted appropriately</a>.</p>

<p>People in protective isolation should have regular opportunities to discuss their wellbeing and any anxieties with a member of staff.</p>

<h3>Prisoners or detainees with symptoms of COVID-19</h3>
<p>Prisoners or detainees with symptoms of COVID-19 should be placed in protective isolation (in accordance with relevant powers) in single occupancy accommodation immediately and be tested for COVID-19 with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. They should remain in isolation while awaiting the results of the test.</p>

<p>If single occupancy accommodation is not available, possible cases should be held alone in higher occupancy accommodation, or where demand exceeds capacity, cases may be <a href="#Cohorting" class="govuk-link">cohorted</a> together. The prisoner or detainee should wear a surgical face mask (Type II or IIR) while being transferred to protective isolation. Escorting staff should follow the guidance on <a href="#PPE" class="govuk-link">personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>)</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control" class="govuk-link">handwashing instructions</a> and maintain a 2 metre distance wherever possible.</p>

<h3>Prisoners or detainees who test positive for COVID-19</h3>

<p>Prisoners or detainees who test positive with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> or <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test should remain in protective isolation for at least 10 full days and be released from isolation after a clinical assessment. Refer to section detailing Ending protective isolation. The isolation period includes the day their symptoms started (or the day their test was taken if they do not have symptoms) and the next 10 full days.</p>

<p>Prisoners or detainees may be able to end their self-isolation period before the end of the 10 full days. They can take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test from 5 days after the day their symptoms started (or the day their test was taken if they did not have symptoms), and another <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test on the following day. The second <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test should be taken at least 24 hours later. If both these test results are negative, and they do not have a high temperature, they may end self-isolation after the second negative test result. They should not take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test before the fifth day of their isolation period, and they should only end self-isolation following 2 consecutive negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests which should be taken at least 24 hours apart, or after the full 10 days has ended.</p>

<p>If they take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test from the fifth day of their isolation period, and the test result is positive, they should wait 24 hours before they take the next test.</p>

<p>If both <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test results are negative, it is likely that they were not infectious at the time the tests were taken. To further reduce the chance of passing COVID-19 on to others, if prisoners or detainees  end their self-isolation period before 10 full days they are strongly advised:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to limit close contact with other people outside of their bubble and with those in the wider population, especially in areas which are poorly ventilated</li>
  <li>to not attend work where possible</li>
  <li>to wear a face covering when outside of their cell</li>
  <li>to limit contact with anyone who is at higher risk of severe illness if infected with COVID-19, including visitors</li>
  <li>to follow guidance on how to stay safe and help prevent the spread</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ending protective isolation</h3>

<p>Prisoners or detainees who test negative for COVID-19 and who were asymptomatic at the time of the test do not need to be isolated if they were tested as part of routine testing.</p>

<p><abbr title="prison or prescribed places of detention">PPDs</abbr> are high-risk settings for COVID-19. Given the high-risk setting, it is important to interpret negative results in symptomatic prisoners or detainees with caution and a clinical assessment should be undertaken before they are released from isolation.</p>

<p>Prisoners or detainees who have tested positive for COVID-19 may return to their normal routine on completion of their isolation period and clinical assessment if they do not have symptoms other than a cough or anosmia, as these symptoms can last for several weeks. They should also be at least 48 hours without fever.</p>

<p>If a prisoner or detainee still has symptoms other than cough or anosmia after 10 days or longer, they should continue to isolate until they have had a clinical assessment. If a prisoner or detainee develops COVID-19 symptoms at any point after ending their first period of isolation they should start a new 10 day isolation period, starting from the day of symptom onset, and have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test.</p>

<p>Prisoners or detainees who have been admitted to hospital should be isolated in hospital (or continue to self-isolate on discharge) for 14 days from their first positive COVID-19 test result or onset of symptoms. This is because COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital will usually have more severe disease and are more likely to have pre-existing conditions, such as severe immunosuppression.</p>

<h3>Prisoners or detainees who are identified as contacts of a case of COVID-19</h3>

<h4>If a prisoner or detainee is fully vaccinated and is identified as a contact of a case</h4>

<p>Prisoners or detainees that are notified that they are a contact of a COVID-19 case are not required to self-isolate for 10 full days if they are fully vaccinated, subject to participation in Risk Mitigation Testing for Contacts of COVID-19 (<abbr title="prisoner risk mitigation testing">PRMT</abbr>). This involves the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the prisoner or detainee should not have any COVID-19 symptoms</li>
  <li>the prisoner or detainee takes a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test and isolates until a negative test result is returned</li>
  <li>the prisoner or detainee takes an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test each day for 7 days and the results should be negative</li>
  <li>if a prisoner or detainee has had a COVID-19 infection in the past 90 days they should not have an initial <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, but they should undertake daily <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests. If they subsequently have a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> result then they should isolate and follow Asymptomatic prisoners or detainees who test positive for COVID-19 with a lateral flow device antigen test (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) guidance</li>
  <li>the prisoner or detainee agrees to wear a surgical face mask (Type II or IIR) when out of their cell</li>
  <li>the prisoner or detainee should not mix with people who are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 during the 10 day period following their contact with the case. This includes visitors they may receive, even if the visitor is fully vaccinated</li>
</ul>

<p>Fully vaccinated means they have had 2 doses of an approved vaccine such as Pfizer BioNTech, AstraZeneca or Spikevax (formerly Moderna). They are also fully vaccinated if they have had one dose of the single-dose Janssen vaccine as part of an approved clinical trial.</p>

<p>If any of the COVID-19 tests during the isolation period are positive, guidance on Prisoners or detainees who test positive for COVID-19 should be followed.</p>

<p>If the prisoner or detainee develops symptoms of COVID-19 during this period, follow the guidance for <a href="#Prisonerwithsymptoms" class="govuk-link">prisoners or detainees with symptoms of COVID-19</a>.</p>

<h4>If a prisoner or detainee is unvaccinated or partially vaccinated and is identified as a contact of a case</h4>

<p>Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated prisoners or detainees who are known to have been exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 case should be isolated or cohorted for 10 full days after their last exposure to a case. If they are cohorted, this should only be with other residents who do not have COVID-19 symptoms but who have also been exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 case. As <abbr title="prison or prescribed places of detention">PPDs</abbr> are high-risk settings for COVID-19, this requirement applies equally to prisoners or detainees who have previously recovered from COVID-19.</p>

<p>If the prisoner or detainee develops symptoms of COVID-19 during this period, follow the guidance for <a class="govuk-link" href="#Prisonerwithsymptoms">prisoners or detainees with symptoms of COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>If prisoners or detainees have been cohorted, all members of the cohort may end isolation after 10 full days and clinical assessment if none of the members develop COVID-19 symptoms or test positive for COVID-19 (with either an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test).</p>

<p>If individuals who have been cohorted with other prisoners or detainees subsequently test positive for COVID-19, all the members of the cohort will need to re-start their 10 day isolation period from the date of their last exposure to the newly diagnosed case.</p>

<p>Prisoners and detainees are strongly encouraged to be vaccinated to protect themselves and others from infection.</p>

<h4>Clinical assessment and healthcare</h4>

<p>Where possible, any assessments should be done without entering the cell or room. Detailed guidance for prison healthcare on the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://elearning.rcgp.org.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=10388">management of COVID-19 in secure environments</a> is available from the Royal College of General Practitioners (see ‘Secure Environments’ tab and select ‘COVID-19 Guidance for healthcare in secure environments’). It is important to be aware of people who have underlying co-morbidities and are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 needing closer monitoring or hospital admission, as they are at higher risk of deteriorating.</p>

<p>Prisoners or detainees who have symptoms of COVID-19, but who are clinically well enough to remain in the <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr>, do not need to be transferred to hospital. Those who are clinically unwell and require hospitalisation should be transferred to appropriate healthcare facilities following safe escort and transfer protocols for the establishment. Staff should wear appropriate <a href="#PPE" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr></a>. The prisoner or detainee should be offered a surgical face mask (Type II or IIR) to be worn during transportation, if tolerated, to minimise the dispersal of respiratory droplets. Staff at the receiving destination must be informed that the patient has possible or confirmed COVID-19.</p>

<h2>Staff</h2>

<p>This guidance is for <abbr title="Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service">HMPPS</abbr> directly employed or other staff. Health and social care workers should follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings" class="govuk-link">guidance for health and social care workers</a>.</p>

<h3>Staff with symptoms of COVID-19</h3>

<p>If a member of staff develops symptoms of COVID-19, however mild:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in all cases, they should take a COVID-19 test,  self-isolate and follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">stay at home guidance</a>
</li>
  <li>while at home (off-duty), they should not attend work and notify their line manager</li>
  <li>while at work, they should put on a surgical face mask (Type II or IIR) immediately, inform their line manager and return home</li>
</ul>

<h3>Staff who have tested positive for COVID-19</h3>

<p>Staff who have tested positive for COVID-19 whether they have symptoms or not,  must self-isolate for at least 10 full days and follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance</a>. The isolation period includes the day their symptoms started (or the day their test was taken if they do not have symptoms) and the next 10 full days. If, however, they have been admitted to hospital they should be isolated in hospital (or continue to self-isolate on discharge) for 14 days from their first positive  test result or the onset of symptoms.</p>

<p>Staff who have tested positive for COVID-19 may return to work on completion of their required isolation period and a clinical assessment if they do not have symptoms other than a cough or anosmia, as these symptoms can last for several weeks. They should also be at least 48 hours without fever.</p>

<p>Staff may be able to end their self-isolation period before the end of the 10 full days. Staff can take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test from 5 days after the day their symptoms started (or the day their test was taken if they did not have symptoms), and another <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test on the following day. The second <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test should be taken at least 24 hours later. If both these test results are negative, and they do not have a high temperature, they may end their self-isolation after the second negative test result and may return to work on day 6 under the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the staff member should not have a fever</li>
  <li>the staff member should continue to undertake daily <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests on day 7, 8, 9 and 10 of their isolation period. If any of these <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test results are positive the staff member should isolate and should wait 24 hours before taking the next <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test</li>
  <li>on days the staff member is working, the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test should be taken prior to beginning their shift, as close as possible to the start time</li>
  <li>the staff member must continue to comply with all relevant infection control precautions and <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> must be worn properly throughout the day</li>
  <li>if the staff member works with patients or residents who are especially vulnerable to COVID-19 (as determined by the organisation), a risk assessment should be undertaken by the organisation, and consideration given to redeployment for the remainder of the 10 day isolation period</li>
  <li>if any of the above cannot be met, the staff member should not come to work and should follow the stay at home guidance for the full 10-day period from when their isolation started</li>
</ul>

<p>If staff take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test from the fifth day of their isolation period, and the test result is positive, they should wait 24 hours before taking the next test.</p>

<p>The likelihood of a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test in the absence of symptoms after 10 days is very low. If the staff member’s <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result is positive on the 10th day, they should continue to take daily <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests, and should not return to work until a single negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result is received.</p>

<p>The likelihood of a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test after 14 days is considerably lower. If the staff member’s <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result is still positive on the 14th day, they can stop testing and return to work on day 15. If the staff member works with patients or residents who are especially vulnerable to COVID-19 (as determined by the organisation), a risk assessment should be undertaken, and consideration given to redeployment.</p>

<p>Managers can undertake a risk assessment of staff who test positive between 10 and 14 days and who do not have a high temperature, with a view to them returning to work depending on the work environment.</p>

<p>Any staff admitted to hospital with COVID-19 symptoms will be subject to the guidance for isolation for patients within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-stepdown-of-infection-control-precautions-within-hospitals-and-discharging-covid-19-patients-from-hospital-to-home-settings">guidance for stepdown of infection control precautions and discharging COVID-19 patients</a>.</p>

<p>There is additional guidance on reducing the spread of COVID-19 in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">stay at home guidance</a>. Household contacts of the staff member should also follow this guidance.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">Stay at home guidance</a> features an infographic to support the process of testing during isolation.</p>

<h3>Symptomatic staff who have tested negative for COVID-19</h3>

<p>Given the high-risk setting, it is important to interpret negative results in symptomatic staff with caution and a clinical assessment should be undertaken before they start working.</p>

<h3>Asymptomatic staff who have tested positive for COVID-19</h3>

<p>Staff who have positive tests as part of an assisted asymptomatic testing programme, and who test positive, must self-isolate immediately. They must continue to self-isolate for 10 days and follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance</a>. Staff who take <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests at home (self-reported) should also follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Staff must complete the 10 full days isolation period or the 7 days isolation period, following 2 negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests taken 24 hours apart and follow the guidance detailed in the section titled Staff who have tested positive for COVID-19.</p>

<h3>Asymptomatic staff who have tested negative for COVID-19</h3>

<p>Staff who test negative for COVID-19 as part of routine testing and who were asymptomatic at the time of the test can remain at work or return to work immediately as long as they remain asymptomatic.</p>

<h4>If a staff member is identified as a contact of a case of COVID-19</h4>

<h5>If a staff member is fully vaccinated and is identified as a contact of a case of COVID-19</h5>

<p>Staff members that are notified that they are a contact of a COVID-19 case are not required to self-isolate for 10 days if they are fully vaccinated. Fully vaccinated means they have had 2 doses of an approved vaccine such as Pfizer BioNTech, AstraZeneca or Spikevax (formerly Moderna). They are also fully vaccinated if they have had one dose of the single-dose Janssen vaccine. If the staff member develops symptoms of COVID-19 during this period, they should follow the guidance for <a href="#Staffwithsymptoms" class="govuk-link">staff with symptoms of COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>These staff should (but are not legally required to) take part in Daily Testing for Contacts of COVID-19 (<abbr title="Daily Testing for Contacts of COVID-19">DTCC</abbr>).  They should inform their line manager or employer immediately if they are required to work in the next 10 days.</p>

<p>The majority of staff will be able to continue in their usual role. The following conditions for participation in <abbr title="Daily Testing for Contacts of COVID-19">DTCC</abbr> apply to all staff returning to work following this exemption:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the staff member should not have any COVID-19 symptoms</li>
  <li>the staff member should be strongly advised to have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, either through their workplace arrangements or via the NHS Test and Trace service, before starting work.</li>
  <li>the member of staff should commence daily self-collect <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests at home for 7 days from the point they are identified as a contact, using <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> before attending work each day (and on days they are not at work)</li>
  <li>staff do not have to wait for their initial <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> result before returning to work, however their initial <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> result must be negative</li>
  <li>on days the staff member is working, a daily <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test should be taken before starting their shift, and the result should be negative before attending work</li>
  <li>if a staff member has had a COVID-19 infection in the past 90 days they can undertake daily <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests.</li>
  <li>the staff member should comply with all relevant infection control precautions and <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be properly worn throughout the day</li>
  <li>the staff member should not work with prisoners, staff or detainees who are  at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 during the 10 day period following their contact with the case</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance applies to all settings including Approved Premises.</p>

<h5>If an unvaccinated or partially vaccinated staff member is identified as a contact of a case of COVID-19</h5>

<p>Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated household contacts of a case of COVID-19 cannot take part in DCT. Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated staff members who are identified as household COVID-19 contacts must therefore self-isolate for 10 days and follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated staff members who are non-household COVID-19 contacts may take part in the <abbr title="Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service">HMPPS</abbr> Daily Contact Testing Programme to return to work. The following apply to all staff returning to work following this exemption:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the staff member should not have any COVID-19 symptoms</li>
  <li>the staff member should have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test through their workplace arrangements at home or an on-site approved testing site (<abbr title="approved testing site">ATS</abbr>) before starting work.</li>
  <li>the staff member should undertake an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test every day for 7 days at an <abbr title="approved testing site">ATS</abbr> before starting work, and the result should be negative. There is a minimum requirement to take 5 tests out of 7</li>
  <li>if the establishment does not have an <abbr title="approved testing site">ATS</abbr> in place then the staff member must isolate for 10 days</li>
  <li>if a staff member has had a COVID-19 infection in the past 90 days they should not have an initial <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, but they should undertake daily <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests before starting work as part of the DCT process</li>
  <li>the staff member should comply with all relevant infection control precautions and <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be properly worn throughout the day</li>
  <li>the staff member should not work with prisoners or detainees who are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 during the 10 day period following their contact with the case</li>
</ul>

<p>All individuals identified as contacts of a positive case will continue to be contact traced and the vaccination status of a contact will be verified by Health Resilience Leads. Prison staff are strongly encouraged to be vaccinated to protect themselves and others from infection.</p>

<p>If the staff member develops symptoms of COVID-19 during this period, follow the guidance for <a href="#Staffwithsymptoms" class="govuk-link">staff with symptoms of COVID-19</a>.</p>

<h2>Visitors</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-someone-in-prison-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemi" class="govuk-link">Guidance on visiting someone in prison</a> is available for social visitors. People who are self-isolating or have symptoms of COVID-19 should not visit anyone in a prison. If a visitor develops symptoms within 48 hours of the visit they should inform the prison.</p>

<p>If a visitor becomes unwell with symptoms of COVID-19 while at the prison, they should go home immediately and follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Professional visitors</h3>

<p>Professional visitors should undertake an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test 24 hours before visiting the prison and the result must be negative. These professional visitors should follow guidance appropriate to their role or provided by their organisations</p>

<p>Fully vaccinated Professional visitors can attend a visit if they are a known contact of a case of COVID-19 provided they are taking part in <abbr title="Daily Testing for Contacts of COVID-19">DTCC</abbr> and their <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test prior to the visit is negative result.</p>

<h3>Prisoners/detainees and visiting</h3>

<p>Prisoners or detainees who are a confirmed COVID-19 case or isolating as a contact of a case cannot participate in visits</p>

<p>Prisoners or detainees who are undertaking daily <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing as a contact of a case (PDTCC) can participate in visits providing their most recent <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> result is negative.</p>

<h3>Pre-visit testing</h3>

<p>Prisoners participating in visits should take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test on the day of the visit. They should only attend the visit if the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> result is negative.</p>

<h3>Other visits considerations</h3>

<p>Minimising close contact, wearing face coverings, enhancing ventilation, cleaning hands and other infection prevention and control measures are important in allowing visits to operate safely.</p>

<p>Contact visits should be considered within the risk mitigation strategy.</p>

<p>Where a prison has an outbreak, mixing of wings should be avoided during visits. Wing based visits should be provided where possible.</p>

<h2>Management and reporting of a case or outbreak of COVID-19 in a <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr>
</h2>

<p>On clinical suspicion or confirmation of a case or outbreak within a <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr>, the appropriate registered medical practitioner must notify the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/contacts-public-health-england-regions-local-centres-and-emergency">local UKHSA <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr></a> as soon as possible and provide all requested information. Following initial risk assessment by the <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> and <abbr title="prison or prescribed places of detention">PPDs</abbr>, UKHSA <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> are advised to convene an incident or outbreak control team (<abbr title="incident control team">ICT</abbr>/<abbr title="outbreak control team">OCT</abbr>) in response to notification of a possible or probable incident or outbreak of COVID-19.</p>

<p>An outbreak is defined as 2 or more prisoners or detainees or staff in the <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr> who meet the case definition for COVID-19 or have a positive test result and among whom transmission was likely to have occurred within a 14-day period. The role of the <abbr title="incident control team">ICT</abbr>/<abbr title="outbreak control team">OCT</abbr> is to ensure the outbreak/incident is appropriately investigated and managed, and to advise the Governor or appropriate Senior Manager of the <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr> on measures required to control it, which may impact on operational, logistic and security challenges for the setting.</p>

<p>UKHSA’s National Health and Justice Team will provide advice and support to responding <abbr title="incident control team">ICT</abbr>/<abbr title="outbreak control teams">OCTs</abbr>, conduct surveillance at national level, share intelligence with key partners, and develop national guidance for use in preventing and managing outbreaks.</p>

<p>In all establishments, contact tracing must be initiated immediately. <abbr title="Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service">HMPPS</abbr> Contact Tracing Leads (<abbr title="contact tracing leads">CTLs</abbr>) have been appointed for each establishment and will undertake an initial risk screening to determine which individuals need to isolate based on available information. Confirmed contacts will then be added onto the national Test and Trace Database by <abbr title="contact tracing leads">CTLs</abbr>. Those with a negative test result will be clinically assessed. The <abbr title="Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service">HMPPS</abbr> Contact Tracing strategy operates as part of the wider NHS Test and Trace model and <abbr title="contact tracing leads">CTLs</abbr> will liaise with UKHSA <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> where to resolve complex cases.</p>

<p>Stakeholders responding to outbreaks must work through the formal structure of the <abbr title="outbreak control team">OCT</abbr> as detailed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/multi-agency-contingency-plan-for-disease-outbreaks-in-prisons">multi-agency contingency plan for the management of outbreaks of disease in <abbr title="prison or prescribed places of detention">PPDs</abbr></a>. Following a risk assessment, the <abbr title="outbreak control team">OCT</abbr> will advise on an appropriate testing strategy.</p>

<p>A dedicated protective isolation unit or area for the temporary isolation of cases who are unwell should be designated within the establishment to facilitate better monitoring or provision of health services to these patients.</p>

<p>An outbreak is considered to be over when there are no test confirmed cases with illness onset dates in the last 28 days in that setting. This refers to anyone working or living in the setting.</p>

<h2>Population management during an outbreak of COVID-19 in a <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr>
</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/multi-agency-contingency-plan-for-disease-outbreaks-in-prisons">multi-agency contingency plan for the management of outbreaks of communicable diseases or other health protection incidents in prisons and other places of detention in England</a> describes specific actions required to identify and manage an incident or outbreak. Where an outbreak has been declared, the Governor or appropriate Manager should inform the <abbr title="Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service">HMPPS</abbr> National COVID-19 reporting system (or equivalent in other <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr>) in the first instance. They will engage with the Population Management Unit through command arrangements. A dynamic risk assessment form should be completed by the Governor or Manager and the UKHSA Consultant in Health Protection leading the <abbr title="outbreak control team">OCT</abbr>. Outbreaks should be reported to <abbr title="Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service">HMPPS</abbr> or Home Office as applicable.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="outbreak control team">OCT</abbr> may consider recommending:</p>

<ul>
  <li>restricting transfers out to other <abbr title="prison or prescribed places of detention">PPDs</abbr>. This is to avoid seeding an outbreak in another <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr>. Where required for security reasons, the receiving <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr> should be notified of the outbreak. Avoid transferring symptomatic prisoners or detainees as a priority. All infection control advice should be followed if transfer is required</li>
  <li>restricting new receptions. This is to avoid feeding an outbreak by introducing new vulnerable cases to the <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr>. If not possible to restrict completely, new receptions should be:
    <ul>
      <li>assessed to determine if they are in a high-risk clinical group</li>
      <li>assessed for signs and symptoms of COVID-19, and any symptomatic new arrivals should be isolated or cohorted immediately and managed as detailed in this guidance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Court appointments during an outbreak of COVID-19 in a prison</h2>

<p>Courts should be informed of an outbreak of COVID-19 in a <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr> and individuals who test positive or are symptomatic should not attend court. Courts should be advised if a prisoner or detainee has tested positive or has symptoms of COVID-19 as soon as possible. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-courts-and-tribunals-planning-and-preparation" class="govuk-link">Guidance for court and tribunal users</a> is available.</p>

<p>Any court attendance that cannot be avoided should follow safe escort and transfer protocols for the establishment. If the person is remanded in custody in a different prison, the receiving prison should be notified of the outbreak in the original prison and if the prisoner or detainee has tested positive for COVID-19, has symptoms of COVID-19 or is a contact of a confirmed case. A note should be placed on SystmOne for healthcare teams.</p>

<p>If the courts have allocated prisoners or detainees to a site affected by COVID-19, redirection to an establishment without an outbreak should be considered. In some circumstances and based on an establishment’s function, this may not be sustainable for more than a few days.</p>

<h2>Cohorting of symptomatic, clinically vulnerable and newly received detainees</h2>

<p>Cohorting is a public health strategy for the care of large numbers of people who are ill, potentially infectious, or who are vulnerable and present heightened risk of severe disease if infected. Cohorting involves keeping similar groups together and separate from the other groups to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This may mean compartmentalising <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr> establishments into separate areas to make sure the groups can be kept apart.</p>

<p>Cohorting strategies should consider arrangements to protect those at risk of severe illness from COVID-19 (those who are clinically extremely vulnerable), measures to isolate those who are symptomatic (and any cell or room-sharers) and provision to hold newly received prisoners or detainees separated from the main population.</p>

<p>To minimise the risk to other prisoners or detainees during periods of sustained community transmission of COVID-19, all new and transferred prisoners or detainees should be isolated in a Reverse Cohorting Unit (<abbr title="reverse cohorting unit">RCU</abbr>) for up to 14 days and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Testing">tested for COVID-19</a>, allowing the <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr> to ensure each individual is not infected.</p>

<p>Prison Governors, Directors and <abbr title="immigration removal centres">IRC</abbr> Managers must survey their establishments for suitability for cohorting and conduct risk assessments on the co-location of people who would normally be kept separated. Plans to implement cohorting should be developed in conjunction with appropriate clinical, infection control and specialist public health advice.</p>

<p>Staff overseeing a cohorted population should limit movements to other parts of the <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr> to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19. Where staff movement is unavoidable it should be minimised, and extra care taken to ensure <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control">infection control measures</a> are strictly adhered to.</p>

<h2>Testing for COVID-19 in <abbr title="prison or prescribed places of detention">PPDs</abbr>
</h2>

<p>There are 2 main types of test currently being used to detect if someone has COVID-19:</p>

<ul>
  <li>polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) tests</li>
  <li>lateral flow device antigen (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) tests</li>
</ul>

<p>Any prisoner, detainee or member of staff with symptoms of COVID-19 should be isolated (self-isolate for staff) and have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. Prisoners or detainees with symptoms of COVID-19 should be tested by healthcare staff wherever possible. The local UKHSA <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> can provide additional advice on testing and procedures.</p>

<p>Anyone who has previously received a positive COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result should not take another <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test within 90 days of that test, unless they develop any new symptoms of COVID-19, or if they are required to take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test upon entry into the UK. This 90-day period starts when the person initially develops symptoms or, if they were asymptomatic when they were tested, the date of their positive test result.</p>

<p>Asymptomatic testing of prisoners, detainees and staff for COVID-19 is also required in <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr> settings in the following outbreak and non-outbreak situations.</p>

<h3>During an outbreak</h3>

<p>In outbreak situations, <abbr title="outbreak control teams">OCTs</abbr> will undertake a risk assessment and decide whether to activate whole <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr> testing. If activated, whole <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr> testing will involve all prisoners or detainees and staff being tested. If it is only possible to do one type of test, an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test should be used in the first instance. Testing should be undertaken as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at day 0 (the first day mass testing is available)</li>
  <li>between days 5 and 7</li>
  <li>at day 28 after the last confirmed or suspected case, to confirm the outbreak is over (recovery testing)</li>
</ul>

<p>If a prisoner or detainee refuses to take part in mass asymptomatic testing in the context of an outbreak then they should be treated as a presumptive case and isolated for 10 days from their last potential exposure.</p>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing should be considered as part of the risk mitigation strategy (in agreement with the <abbr title="incident control team">ICT</abbr>/<abbr title="outbreak control team">OCT</abbr>) to enable prisoners to be transferred out of the custodial setting to assist with population management. In these circumstances, a prisoner should have an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test on the day before and on the day of departure from the custodial setting with the outbreak.</p>

<p>During an outbreak, testing of prisoners using <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests should also take place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>before release</li>
  <li>before a transfer to another prison</li>
  <li>before a court attendance</li>
  <li>immediately before and after a period of release on temporary licence (<abbr title="release on temporary licence">ROTL</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Staff routine testing</h3>

<p>In non-outbreak situations, all staff should be tested weekly with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test and twice weekly with an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test (one of the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests being midweek). Following a period of leave or cross-deployment, staff should be tested for COVID-19 with an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test and have a negative result before returning to work or starting a shift.</p>

<p>In the children and young people’s secure estate, staff testing is the same as in the adult estate (weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests and twice weekly <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests), with the exception of staff in <abbr title="secure children’s homes">SCHs</abbr> who should take <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests twice a week with a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> in the event of a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> result.</p>

<h3>Prisoner or detainee routine testing</h3>

<p>All prisoners or detainees entering prisons are placed in <abbr title="reverse cohorting units">RCUs</abbr>. Prisoners or detainees in <abbr title="reverse cohorting units">RCUs</abbr> should be tested with <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests at reception and again 5 to 7 days after they arrive. They should remain in the <abbr title="reverse cohorting unit">RCU</abbr> for 14 days but if population management dictates, they can be moved into the general population once the second negative test has been confirmed.</p>

<p>Essential workers should be tested twice weekly with an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test (one of the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests being mid-week).</p>

<p>Asymptomatic testing of prisoners or detainees using <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> should also take place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>before release</li>
  <li>before a transfer to another <abbr title="prison or prescribed place of detention">PPD</abbr>

<h4>Children and young people</h4>

<p>In <abbr title="young offender institutions">YOIs</abbr> and <abbr title="secure training centres">STCs</abbr> where <abbr title="reverse cohorting units">RCUs</abbr> are operating, the same arrangements apply for children as in the adult estate.</p>

<p>In <abbr title="secure children’s homes">SCHs</abbr> where all accommodation is provided on a single room basis, children should have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test on arrival and again 5 to 7 days after they arrive. They will be able to leave isolation after 10 full days or 2 negative tests.</p>

<h2>Transition of prisoners or detainees to the community</h2>

<p>All individuals should be seen by healthcare services as part of normal preparations for release. Prisoners and detainees cannot be detained beyond their tariff.</p>

<p>Where applicable, the local authority, UKHSA <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> and <abbr title="Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service">HMPPS</abbr> (including probation) must be made aware of any cases or close contacts of known cases returning to the community before completing a full period of protective isolation, for example, less than 10 days for cases or contacts of cases. The local authority must be made aware of any cases or close contacts of known cases with no fixed abode. People returning to the community need to be prepared and to understand <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-summer-2021-roadmap/coronavirus-how-to-stay-safe-and-help-prevent-the-spread" class="govuk-link">how to stay safe and help prevent the spread of COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>Probation services and approved premises/hostels should also be advised to facilitate appropriate self-isolation if the person is symptomatic, has had a positive test for COVID-19, or has had contact with a confirmed case.</p>

<h2>Limiting spread of COVID-19 in <abbr title="prison or prescribed places of detention">PPDs</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Managers of <abbr title="prison or prescribed places of detention">PPDs</abbr> can help reduce the spread of COVID-19 by regularly reviewing existing control measures, ensuring adherence to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control" class="govuk-link">infection prevention and control recommendations</a> and reminding everyone of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">available public health advice and support</a>. Guidance on mitigations to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 also applies to new variants.</p>

<p>Resources including <a class="govuk-link" href="https://campaignresources.phe.gov.uk/resources/campaigns/101-coronavirus-/resources" rel="external">posters, leaflets and other materials</a> are available.</p>

<p>To reduce the risk of catching COVID-19 and passing it on to others:</p>

<ul>
  <li>staff (when not performing duties requiring close contact) and prisoners or detainees - maintain 2 metre distance (where recommended) from others wherever possible</li>
  <li>staff should wear specified <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for activities requiring sustained close contact with possible or confirmed cases</li>
  <li>remind staff and prisoners or detainees to wash their hands with soap and water regularly and to cover their mouths and noses with disposable tissues when they cough or sneeze. Individuals should dispose of tissues into a disposable rubbish bag. If they do not have a tissue, remind them to sneeze into the crook of the elbow, not into the hand and immediately wash hands with soap and water or use hand sanitiser</li>
  <li>objects and surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected regularly using standard cleaning products, paying attention to all surfaces but especially ones that are touched frequently</li>
  <li>make sure there is adequate ventilation of indoor spaces</li>
</ul>

<p>While social distancing and other measures in general have been lifted, it may be appropriate to apply some of these measures depending on the risks, if risk assessments suggest doing so. Use of social distancing should be targeted, time limited, and kept under review.</p>

<h2>Advice on the use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for healthcare staff and custodial or detention staff</h2>

<p>Staff should minimise any non-essential and avoidable contact with any staff member or prisoner.</p>

<p>Healthcare staff are most likely to work directly with possible or confirmed COVID-19 cases but custodial staff, <abbr title="prison escort and custodial services">PECS</abbr> and transport services may also encounter individuals when symptoms first present or who are asymptomatic.</p>

<p>Mitigation measures, including <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, should be determined by risk assessment and implemented as part of a hierarchy of controls approach. For activities requiring close contact with a possible or confirmed case of COVID-19, for example, patient assessment, interviewing people at less than 2 metres distance, or arrest and restraint, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe">guidance on <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr></a> is available. An <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-prisons-and-other-prescribed-places-of-detention-guidance" class="govuk-link">activity/context specific table</a> summarising the recommended <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for staff in <abbr title="prison or prescribed places of detention">PPDs</abbr> is available. Dispose of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> as clinical waste.</p>

<p>Hand and respiratory hygiene are important components of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control">infection prevention and control measures</a> and essential to reduce cross-contamination and infection.</p>

<p>Staff use of fluid resistant surgical masks (Type IIR) should be considered to reduce transmission of COVID-19, particularly in poorly ventilated or crowded areas, or wherever physical distancing of 2 metres (where recommended) is hard to achieve.</p>

<h2>Risk assessment for staff exposures in the workplace</h2>

<p>All staff who come into contact with COVID-19 cases – whether or not they are protected by the use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> or by other risk mitigation measures– should remain vigilant to the possibility of contracting infection and should self-isolate immediately if they develop COVID-19 symptoms.</p>

<p>If a member of staff has come into close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case or symptomatic prisoner or detainee suspected of having COVID-19 while not wearing <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, or had a breach in their <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> while providing assistance to a prisoner or detainee with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, then the staff member should inform their line manager.</p>

<p>A risk assessment should be undertaken in conjunction with local infection prevention and control policy and clinical advice to determine if there has been a significant breach or close contact without <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. If the risk assessment concludes there has been a significant breach or close contact without <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, the Prison Contact Tracing Lead should be notified and the member of staff should stay at home and complete 10 full days isolation.</p>

<p>If they develop symptoms of COVID-19 they should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</a> and follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Advice about whether a risk-assessment is needed may also be sought from the <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>.</p>

<p>The Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) provides information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/index.htm" rel="external">working safely</a> for employers and employees.</p>

<h2>Cleaning and waste</h2>

<p>Guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">cleaning and waste disposal</a> is available.</p>

<h2>Vaccination</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">COVID-19 vaccination programme</a> is being delivered to all adults in England. Every effort should be made to encourage staff and prisoners or detainees to get fully vaccinated, and to have boosters where recommended, especially given the vulnerabilities of people in prisons and places of detention.</p>

<p>COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to reduce the likelihood of catching COVID-19 and of severe illness for those who have received them. COVID-19 vaccines also reduce the likelihood of a vaccinated person spreading COVID-19 to others, but it is still possible for this to happen. Guidance on isolation and testing should be followed even if someone has received one or more doses of COVID-19 vaccine. This will reduce the risk of spreading infection and help to protect other people.</p>

<p>This guidance is of a general nature and should be treated as a guide. In the event of any conflict between any applicable legislation (including the health and safety legislation) and this guidance, the applicable legislation shall prevail.</p>
