<p>The UK is adopting a pragmatic approach to customs controls, delaying their introduction for many goods from 1 January 2021 until full controls are in place by 1 January 2022. For more information check the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/declaring-goods-brought-into-great-britain-from-the-eu-from-1-january-2021">delaying declarations for EU goods brought into Great Britain</a> from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>If you’re an operator of a frontier location (port, wharf, roll on roll off, rail terminal or airport) who receives or dispatches freight from the EU, these changes will affect you.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>From 1 January 2022, all goods imported from the EU to mainland Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) must be declared and presented to the UK customs authorities in line with UK legislation.</p>

<p>There are 2 main customs models that can be used to control goods imported into Great Britain, the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>temporary storage model</li>
  <li>pre-lodgement model</li>
</ul>

<h2>The temporary storage model</h2>

<p>Goods coming into Great Britain can be stored at the frontier in a temporary storage facility for up to 90 days before being declared to customs. Check guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/temporary-storage" class="govuk-link">how to apply to operate a temporary storage facility</a>.</p>

<h2>The pre-lodgement model</h2>

<p>Traders will be required to submit a customs declaration in advance of goods boarding on the EU side. In this model, the carrier (ferry, train or plane operator) will be required to make sure a declaration has been pre-lodged before the goods board at the EU point of departure.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will risk assess declarations during the crossing and a message will be issued by the time goods arrive at the border informing the person in control of the goods (such as hauliers) if the goods have been cleared. This will make sure checks are only carried out if needed and most goods will be cleared to continue onwards on their journey on arrival. See <a href="#annexe-A" class="govuk-link">Annexe A</a> on the steps in the pre-lodgement model.</p>

<p>Goods which have not been cleared must be held by the frontier location until <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has indicated the goods are customs cleared using <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>-approved IT systems. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is aware that, at some frontier locations, there is no physical capacity to hold goods until they are customs cleared. Where this is the case, goods requiring checks will be directed to inland checking facilities.</p>

<h3>Reasonable steps: actions to take</h3>

<p>All border locations have a responsibility for controlling goods within their premises, but their role is proportionate to their capacity. To provide clarity to frontier locations operating under the pre-lodgement model, the government has introduced ‘reasonable steps’ (a list of actions for frontier locations that operate under the pre-lodgement model).</p>

<p>All locations using the pre-lodgement model will be grouped into categories, which will have distinct reasonable steps. These reasonable steps minimise the risk of congestion at ports whilst ensuring full border controls can be implemented on EU goods. The difference in the responsibilities between border locations in these categories is based on evidence of frontier location capacity. The key categories are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Category 1: ports with extremely limited capacity to hold uncleared goods within the principal’s approved area</li>
  <li>Category 2: ports with some capacity to hold uncleared goods within the principal’s approved area</li>
  <li>Category 3: ports with capacity to hold all uncleared goods within the principal’s approved area</li>
</ul>

<h4>Category 1</h4>

<p>Category 1 port operators will need to:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Write to carriers reminding them of their responsibilities under the pre-lodgement model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the approval holder fails to meet this, they’ll be at risk of incurring a penalty, might be liable for any missing duties and face the possibility of losing their customs approval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So long as the letter has been sent, the approval holder will be able to release uncleared goods on arrival, so the goods can proceed to an inland site for customs checks.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Category 2</h4>

<p>Category 2 port operators will need to:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Write to carriers reminding them of their responsibilities under the pre-lodgement model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide processes and infrastructure to facilitate the control of goods at the frontier location (for example, a positive message from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>-approved IT systems), so the approval holder knows the goods are cleared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Release uncleared goods to move inland for their checks when (and only when) the infrastructure at the port is fully exhausted.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Port operators will also need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure they are able to receive the message about whether the goods are held or cleared (either through the Application Programming Interface (<abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>) or Border Force) and can direct drivers to the relevant areas for the checks to be completed</li>
  <li>provide sufficient infrastructure for checks to take place where there is capacity to hold uncleared goods and to make sure uncleared goods do not leave</li>
</ul>

<p>If the approval holder fails to carry out the above steps correctly, they’ll be at risk of incurring a penalty, might be liable for any missing duties and face the possibility of losing their customs approval.</p>

<h4>Category 3</h4>

<p>Category 3 port operators will need to:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Write to carriers reminding them of their responsibilities under the pre-lodgement model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide processes and infrastructure to facilitate the control of goods at the frontier location (for example, a positive message from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>-approved IT systems), so the approval holder knows the goods are cleared.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To achieve this, they’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure they are able to receive the message about whether the goods are held or cleared (either through the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> or Border Force) and can direct drivers to the relevant areas for the checks to be complete</li>
  <li>provide sufficient infrastructure for the checks to take place and to make sure uncleared goods do not leave</li>
</ul>

<p>If the approval holder fails to carry on the above steps correctly, they’ll be at risk of incurring a penalty, might be liable for any missing duties and face the possibility of losing their customs approval.</p>

<p>Where there are exceptional circumstances, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will make sure this is reflected in the approval holders’ customs approvals. For example, where goods must travel from one part of the location’s approved area to another for clearance checks, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> may deem it not possible for the ports to exercise control over goods.</p>

<p>If border locations dispute their categorisation, they should put their concerns in writing to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Annexe A: Timeline under the pre-lodgement model</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Trader</h3>

<p>The trader or an intermediary acting on their behalf make sure all EU goods to mainland Great Britain have submitted their customs declarations in advance of the goods boarding on the EU side. These declarations are made through <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>-approved IT systems.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Carrier</h3>

<p>The carrier makes sure the goods have the necessary declarations before boarding.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Frontier locations</h3>

<p>If the border location is not mandated for pre-lodgement (check the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/list-of-roll-on-roll-off-ports" class="govuk-link">roll on roll off ports</a>), the location must inform all carriers that goods should not arrive without pre-lodged declarations.</p>

<p>The frontier location will follow its reasonable steps to discharge the obligation set out in the approval.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Goods released</h3>

<p>If goods are selected for checks, they’ll be subject to customs compliance activities either at the border location or an inland site. Once the goods have customs clearance, these goods are released to procedure.</p>
