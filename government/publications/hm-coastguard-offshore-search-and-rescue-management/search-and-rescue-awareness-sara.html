<p>The Search and Rescue Awareness (SARA) course is provided by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) to provide a short overview of Search and Rescue and detail the relevant expectations during an incident impacting one of the offshore energy industries.</p>

<p>The MCA is an Executive Agency of the Department for Transport and through HM Coastguard, is responsible for the coordination of all civil maritime and aeronautical search and rescue within the UK’s Search and Rescue Region, and for ensuring the effective provision of counter pollution response within the UK Exclusive Economic Zone.</p>

<p>As a result, HM Coastguard has responsibility to respond to incidents related to, or in the vicinity of oil and gas installations, or offshore renewables developments and with the addition of multiple industry resources which may be available to support search and rescue, it is vital to ensure that all parties are best prepared should such a response be required.</p>

<p>This half day course, delivered by highly experienced and knowledgeable presenters from HM Coastguard, has separate versions for the oil and gas industry, and renewables industry, and is aimed at any personnel, onshore or offshore, who may be involved in the management of and response to emergencies, particularly offshore installation managers or their deputies, marine coordinators, and emergency response teams.</p>

<p>The course provides a high-level overview of roles and responsibilities and will be conducted virtually.  Delegates will be involved in a tabletop exercise, with breakout discussions, to enhance understanding and awareness of how their role contributes to emergency response, with a view to improving cooperation with national SAR coordinators and responders. This course does not replace the benefit of attending the full Offshore SAR Management course, but is intended to provide an initial awareness, while the OSARM is currently unavailable.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/hm-coastguard-offshore-search-and-rescue-management">Dates and course information</a> is available online and anyone wishing to book a place on the course should do so via this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/HMCoastguard1@mcga.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/" rel="external">course booking link</a>.</p>
