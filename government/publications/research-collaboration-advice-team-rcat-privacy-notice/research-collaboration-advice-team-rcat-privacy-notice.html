<p>The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>) is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal data. This notice describes how we collect and use your personal data in accordance with data protection law, including the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) and the Data Protection Act (<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr>) 2018.</p>

<h2>About the Research Collaboration Advice Team (<abbr title="Research Collaboration Advice Team">RCAT</abbr>)</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Research Collaboration Advice Team">RCAT</abbr> offers researchers advice on how to protect their work from hostile activity, ensuring international collaboration is done safely and securely. We promote government advice on security-related topics, such as export controls, cyber security and protection of intellectual property. We work with the higher education institutions and across government to better understand risks faced by the research sector.</p>

<h2>Your data</h2>

<p>We will process the following personal data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>names, professional details and contact details of our points of contact within higher education and research institutions</li>
  <li>names, professional details and contact details of staff and researchers within higher education, research institutions and their current and potential research collaboration partners</li>
</ul>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The purpose for which we are processing your personal data is to provide higher education research institutions with advice and support on trusted research advice and research collaboration security, and to better understand national security risks in research.</p>

<h2>Legal basis of processing</h2>

<p>The legal basis for processing your personal data is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>public task</strong>: processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the data controller.  In this case it is for <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> to exercise the function to provide higher education research institutions with advice and support on trusted research advice and research collaboration security, and better understand national security risks in research.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recipients</h2>

<p>We will share your personal data with third parties where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>required or allowed by law</li>
  <li>it is in the public interest to do so, including in relation to national security considerations</li>
  <li>you authorise us to do so</li>
  <li>it is necessary for the performance of our functions as a government department, including in relation to sharing information with other UK government departments and agencies</li>
</ul>

<p>We will also share your personal data with the police and other law enforcement agencies where it is necessary to do so for the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences, and other regulatory authorities when it is necessary for the purposes of their regulatory functions.</p>

<p>We treat the security of your data very seriously. We have strict security standards, and all our staff and other people who process personal data on our behalf get regular training about how to keep information safe.</p>

<p>Where possible the personal data is minimised, aggregated, or anonymised.</p>

<p>We have put in place appropriate technical, physical and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect about you.</p>

<p>In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those persons who have a business or legal need.</p>

<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and the regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

<p>All organisations we work with are required to agree to move, process and destroy data securely, that is, in line with the principles set out in the HM Government <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/security-policy-framework">Security policy framework</a>, issued by the Cabinet Office, when handling, transferring, storing, accessing or destroying information.</p>
