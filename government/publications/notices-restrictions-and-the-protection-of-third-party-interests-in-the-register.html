<p>This guide gives advice about how to apply for a notice or a restriction to protect a third-party interest in a registered estate or charge. It explains the effect of existing register entries in respect of third party interests and explains what applications may be made in respect of existing entries. It is aimed at conveyancers and you should interpret references to ‘you’ accordingly. HM Land Registry staff will also refer to it.</p>
