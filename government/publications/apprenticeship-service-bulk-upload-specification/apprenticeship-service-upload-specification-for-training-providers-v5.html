<h2>Intended audience</h2>
<p>This technical document is for people responsible for uploading data to the apprenticeship service and MI system design (including MI managers, commercial software suppliers and own software writers).</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>File upload is an enhanced feature within the apprenticeship service (the Service)  that allows training providers to add one or more apprentices for one or more employers at the same time.</p>

<p>You can only use file upload to add new apprentices, it cannot be used to update or amend apprentice details.</p>

<p>Employers will still need to approve all new apprentices that you add.</p>

<h2>How to create a file</h2>

<p>The file is a comma separated values (CSV) file. In most cases, your learner management system (LMS) should be able to create a CSV file that you can use for the upload process. If your system is not able do this, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-service-bulk-upload-specification">a file upload template</a> is available to download.</p>

<p>If you are adding to an existing cohort, you need to make sure the CohortRef is completed with the cohort reference. If you leave the CohortRef empty a new cohort will be created automatically for each employer (if you have employer permissions to create cohorts on their behalf).</p>

<p>You need to include the AgreementID to identify each employer.</p>

<h2>How and when to submit a file</h2>

<p>File upload can be found in the ‘add apprentices’ section on the home page. You can add apprentices to cohorts that have already been created or start a new one (if you have employer permissions to do this on their behalf).</p>

<p>The apprentice record must be added and approved by both you and the employer before the Education and Skills Funding Agency will release any funds from the employer’s account.</p>

<p>Files can be submitted at any time of the month.</p>

<h2>File validation and error correction</h2>

<p>Validation rule checks are carried out on any file you upload. The rules check:</p>

<p>a. the format of your file is correct</p>

<p>b. the file is no larger than 100 lines</p>

<p>c. all mandatory fields have been entered</p>

<p>d. the field data types are valid</p>

<p>e. the field lengths are valid</p>

<p>f. data for consistency across related fields, for example there are no existing (“overlapping”) apprenticeships for the same learner on the dates you’ve provided</p>

<p>g. the cohort is editable</p>

<p>h. the date of birth is valid at the start date of the apprenticeship</p>

<p>If your file upload fails any validation checks, the entire file will be rejected, and no data will be uploaded to the Service. You will then need to review and correct any errors in your LMS or template and re-upload the file.</p>

<h2>Updating records</h2>

<p>When the apprentices have been added and approved by both the employer and training provider no further changes can be made through the file upload process, but amendments can be made to apprentice records in the ‘Manage apprentices’ section of the Service.</p>

<h2>Transfer funds</h2>

<p>For apprenticeships that are being paid for using transferred funds from another employer, the cohort must be created first by the employer. The cohort reference will then need to be added to CohortRef field in your LMS or on the template.</p>

<h2>Funding reservations</h2>

<p>For employers that do not pay the apprenticeship levy, the reservation will automatically be created when using the upload file function; it will not use any existing reservations. If the employer has reached their reservation limit for the financial year, you will not be able to add apprentices.</p>

<p>If a reservation has already been separately created, it will not be used for adding apprentices in file upload. It will need to be deleted from the Service manually.</p>
