<h2>Foreword by Commissioner Dr Steve Unger</h2>

<p>The Transport Location Data Competition has stimulated the rapid
prototyping of many innovative geospatial solutions,developed by the
companies that have participated in the competition.</p>

<p>Data-driven innovation is fundamental to many sectors of the economy, but
no sector demonstrates this more clearly than transport. There are many
real-world challenges which can be addressed given access to the right data,
and development of new data analytic techniques. This creates a real
opportunity for businesses to develop new services. As a result, we will all
benefit from transport networks which are easier to use, more efficient,
healthier, safer and greener.</p>

<p>The ingenuity and inventiveness of the proposals submitted to the
competition has been impressive. We received over 200 submissions
proposing different ways in which location data can be exploited to solve
transport challenges. We funded 28 projects to develop the initial idea into a
proof of concept. We have provided additional support for seven of the most
commercially viable projects, to help bring these ideas to market.</p>

<p>I would like to thank our delivery partner, Innovate UK, and congratulate the
businesses who have used this competition to advance their ideas. They are
a real testimony to the quality of the participants in the competition and they
demonstrate what can be achieved if we harness the power of location data.</p>

<h2>Simon Edmonds Chief Business Officer Innovate UK</h2>

<p>The aim of the Transport Location Data Competition was to stimulate the
development of geospatial solutions, which can be used to help solve major
transport challenges such as: the need to integrate transport modes, enable
safe active travel, enhance our supply chains and increase the efficiency of
our transport networks. Industry’s response to the competition
demonstrated significant appetite, with ambitious and innovative project
applications.</p>

<p>As the Innovate UK Transport Vision 2050 references, a connected,
sustainable transport ecosystem aligned with new business models is
essential to transform the transport sector. This in turn will advance new
opportunities for economic growth and societal benefit.</p>

<p>We recognise the need for innovative geospatial technologies, spatial data
applications, routing systems, monitoring systems to develop the connected
transport sector. With an ever increasing need to understand where vehicles
are, how people are travelling and asset management, the connection
between transport and geospatial industries will continue to evolve and
grow, driven by innovation.</p>

<p>It has been a huge honour to partner with the Geospatial Commission on this
exciting programme and we look forward to the innovative solutions being
developed further in the future.</p>

<h2>City Science</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>National Freight Model</strong> - Advanced modelling to
improve the understanding of freight movements
within Great Britain</p>
</div>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cityscience.com/" rel="external">City Science</a> is an SME with a core mission to support the decarbonisation of
transport and energy systems. They have built a team of thought leaders in
sustainable transport, energy use, climate change, data science, software
development and finance to respond to the needs of their clients in
government and the private sector addressing the challenges of
decarbonisation.</p>

<p>It remains clear to the founders of City Science that the transition to a
sustainable, decarbonised economy will require new ways of thinking and
evidence to guide that journey. Therefore, the City Science team engages in
innovation and research to develop the tools and methods which bring rigour
to the advice they provide to their clients. Prior successes include the
development of their award-winning visualisation software, Cadence, and
completion of the Department for Transport’s Zero Emission Road Freight
competition.</p>

<p>Their previous clients include the Department for Transport, National
Highways and England’s Economic Heartland. As an SME, they demonstrate
enhanced levels of flexibility and attention to the needs of their clients.
Through instilling this, their clients repeatedly put faith in City Science to
produce credible, innovative and robust outputs.</p>

<p><strong>National Freight Model</strong></p>

<p>City Science have developed a cutting-edge software tool - the National
Freight Model. The tool supports government and industry by providing the
critical geospatial information required to decarbonise the freight system and
improve its efficiency. Improving freight efficiency could contribute to adding
potentially tens of billions of pounds to the economy and reduce UK annual
carbon emissions by 4%.</p>

<p>By leveraging cutting-edge technology to statistically fuse a wide range of
geospatial datasets, the tool displays freight information for 640,000 routes,
16 cargoes and 5 vehicle types. This substantially enhances the detail with
which the freight system can be analysed during planning and operational
decision making processes.</p>

<h2>Dynamon</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Zero</strong> - An AI tool to help commercial fleets adopt the
optimum zero-emission vehicles and charging
infrastructure</p>
</div>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://dynamon.co.uk/" rel="external">Dynamon</a> is transforming the commercial transport industry to a sustainable
future with smarter fleet procurement. Dynamon’s tools enable fleet
procurement teams to precisely forecast the performance of different vehicle
technologies within their specific operations to identify the optimum
solutions that minimise cost and environmental impact.</p>

<p>Built on advanced data analytics and AI, Dynamon’s tools combine and
process fleet telematics data and product performance data to provide
accurate, meaningful fleet specific procurement insights.</p>

<p>Fleets using Dynamon’s tools are empowered to make informed optimal
procurement decisions that can help make their businesses more
competitive, resilient, and better for the environment.</p>

<p><strong>Zero</strong></p>

<p>Dynamon has developed a web-based data analytics tool, called ZERO, which
helps commercial transport companies optimise their transition to zero-
emission vehicle (ZEV) fleets. ZERO enables fleet teams to identify the
optimum ZEVs and charging infrastructure based on their unique operation
and depot electricity constraints. Insights provided by ZERO significantly de-
risk the transition to ZEV fleets and can help accelerate the phasing out of
fossil fuel vehicles in commercial transport operations.</p>

<p>ZERO works by combining geospatial datasets (fleet telematics data, terrain
data, weather data, traffic data, charge point data) with ZEV performance
data obtained from Dynamon’s industry leading ZEV testing program. ZERO
can forecast real-world ZEV performance within specific fleet operations and
identify the required charging infrastructure to ensure a ZEV fleet can
perform the same operation as a previous internal combustion engine fleet.</p>

<p>ZERO will make it significantly easier and less financially risky for fleets to
transition to ZEVs, by enabling fleet procurement teams to identify the
optimum, most cost-effective solutions for their operations therefore
reducing the need for extensive trials of ZEV solutions and minimising the
risk of poor investments.</p>

<h2>Emu Analytics</h2>
<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>MANTIS</strong> - An AI-powered Digital Twin solution that
predicts future shipping patterns to aid maritime
navigation strategy and offshore renewables planning</p>
</div>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emu-analytics.com/" rel="external">Emu Analytics</a> is a UK-based micro-SME specialising in geospatial analytics
and visualisation software solutions. Its digital twin solution, Flo.w, is
designed to analyse big, fast, continuous and often real-time geospatial data,
which is derived from transport systems, big networks, smart cities, IoT
(Internet of Things) sensors and much more.</p>

<p>Emu’s software has been implemented for several organisations across
multiple sectors, including British Airways, Transport for London, EDF Energy,
Vodafone, Transport for Wales and the Civil Aviation Authority.</p>

<p><strong>Marine ANalyTics Intelligence
System (MANTIS)</strong></p>

<p>Marine ANalyTics Intelligence System (MANTIS) is a solution based on Flo.w,
created for a challenge posed by the General Lighthouse Authority (GLA). As
the providers of maritime navigational services in UK waters (along with the
Northern Lighthouse Board, Irish Lights and Trinity House), the GLA needed
an analytical capability that could predict the movement and behaviours of
future shipping in and around the UK, as the expected increase in offshore
renewables introduces a greater number of marine obstacles.</p>

<p>MANTIS continuously analyses and visualises millions of vessel location
points and movements, both historically and in real-time. Using Emu’s
innovative geospatial and machine learning techniques it can perform
predictions of changes to future shipping routes if new user-specified
obstacles are simulated.</p>

<p>The solution places these powerful capabilities directly into the hands of
technical and non-technical personnel alike. It brings together all the
complexity of historic, real-time and predictive data into a highly intuitive and
easily accessible platform that allows users (who may be Planners,
Operational Staff, Marine Evidence Managers, Risk Assessors, Sustainability
Analysts and more) to rapidly and efficiently assess the impacts of proposed
future wind farms.</p>

<h2>HackPartners</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Delorean</strong> - A tool that uses track circuit sensor and
location data to increase the capacity and efficiency of
the rail network without compromising safety</p>
</div>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://hackpartners.com/" rel="external">HackPartners</a> build cutting-edge technology products that help improve: asset

<p><strong>Delorean</strong></p>

<p>“We want our trains to run on time” – This is the very first sentence that you can read in the Williams-Shapps Plan for Rail from May 2021. With that in mind, HackPartners built Delorean, a full featured dashboard that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automatically attributes the most probable causes of lateness for every train, for any lateness values – including below the sub-threshold (three minutes) lateness, which is currently not easily attributed by performance teams</li>
  <li>Models how the lateness propagates through the network and causes reactionary delay</li>
  <li>Quantifies how Temporary Speed Restrictions affect the network performance</li>
</ul>

<p>To enable the above they have developed innovative datasets and modelling techniques, including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automatic Signal Aspect Inference from train movement data</li>
  <li>Models how the lateness propagates through the network and causes reactionary delay</li>
  <li>Quantifies how Temporary Speed Restrictions affect the network performance</li>
</ul>

<p>The output is a high resolution of train movement on the Great Britain rail network and a suite of analytics to provide data-driven intelligence on lateness to performance teams.</p>

<h2>ngenius.ai</h2>

<p><strong>Optimising Geofencing</strong></p>

<p>Geofencing is where a vehicle’s location is used to change its behaviour. The focus of this project was to use the electric range of hybrid vehicles in the best possible way to have a positive impact on urban air quality. The project demonstrated how geospatial data can be used to reduce emissions from existing geofenced buses, enable geofencing on other hybrid vehicles and optimise geofencing plans for better air quality through integrated traffic andair quality simulation.</p>

<p>Through geospatial optimisation of vehicle usage, flexible zones were applied to the geofencing buses that are run by the local authority partner and these zones then change depending on passenger loading, route topology and traffic conditions. The results showed a 30% improvement in air quality due to the effectiveness of geofencing which is a similar improvement to that delivered by bus lanes but without the cost of implementing them.</p>

<p>In addition, a smartphone app and data platform have been developed to enable geofencing on existing hybrid passenger cars, such as those used by private hire fleets. The fleet trial demonstrated that it could significantly influence the use of electric mode and showed 10% nitrogen oxide (NOx) reductions and 23% particulate emissions reductions within the geofence zones.</p>
