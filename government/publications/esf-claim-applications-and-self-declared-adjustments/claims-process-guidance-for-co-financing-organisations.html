<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guidance should be read in conjunction with the terms and conditions set out in your European Social Fund (<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>) Memorandum of Understanding (<abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> including your approved Co-financing Organisation (<abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr>) final Full Application for <abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> funding. These documents set out the eligible parameters, scope of activities and the key deliverables that are to be reported to the Managing Authority.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup></p>

<p>In order for a <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> to report on delivery and draw down <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Grant Funding in line with the terms and conditions set out in their <abbr title="European Social Fund Memorandum Of Understanding">ESF MOU</abbr>, an application for reimbursement ‘Grant Claim’ must be made.</p>

<p>All Claims should be submitted via <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> (Electronic Claims and Information Management System). Secure access to <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> will be arranged for staff within the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> Claims Team who have the relevant authority to act as Authorised Signatories and, or a named authoriser for each claim.</p>

<p>Before any payments can be processed the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> must have completed and returned a fully accurate ‘Bank Details Form’ to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority. A blank form will be sent to the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> with their new <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> and, once accurately completed and returned, this will allow the Managing Authority to enable actual payment.</p>

<p>A Project Inception Visit (<abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIV</abbr>) must also have taken place prior to submission of the first claim(s) for any new <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>(s) and, following this visit, the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority should have confirmed in writing, usually via email, that the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> is cleared to start submitting financial claims. For <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr>, a single Project Inception Visit may cover one or more projects or MOUs.</p>

<p>All pre-grant payment conditions stated in the <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> must be met prior to the first instalment and subsequent grant payments.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> must ensure from the outset that robust and suitable systems and processes are in place locally in order to maintain adequate audit trails and manage information effectively and efficiently. All project information must be retained and made available for verification or any audit throughout delivery and post completion under the retention of documentation requirements in accordance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-structural-and-investment-funds-document-retention">European Social Fund document retention guidance</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-structural-and-investment-funds-eligibility-documents"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> National Eligibility Rules and Programme Guidance.</a></p>

<p>Unless agreed otherwise with the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority, the first submitted claim should include all spend or activity undertaken on the project up to and including the current Claim Instalment Period. The <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> must ensure that any expenditure included in the first claim meets the relevant defrayal rules set out in this guidance.</p>

<p>All applicable Claim periods prior to the initial Claim Period must be completed as ‘Nil Claims’ on <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> by the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr>. Progress Reports will not be required for the initial ‘Nil Claims’ periods, but will be required for all subsequent claim periods.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Contract Manager will contact you regarding the Final Claim process up to 6 months’ prior to any final Claim.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Definitions</h2>

<p>For the purposes of this guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> is the agreement between the Managing Authority or Intermediate Body (IB) and the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contract is the agreement between the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> and their lead provider or grantee (Grant Recipient)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Timing</h2>

<p>Claims must be submitted to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority in arrears, via <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>, reporting on a pre-defined period of actual activity. This is referred to as the ‘Claim Instalment Period’.</p>

<p>Claim Instalment Periods are based on calendar quarters as detailed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>quarter 1, 1 January – 31 March</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>quarter 2, 1 April – 30 June</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>quarter 3, 1 July – 30 September</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>quarter 4, 1 October – 31 December</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Claims are determined by the Claims Schedule set out in the <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>. Claims (including ‘Nil Claims’) should be started in chronological order; <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr> cannot start a new Claim on <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> until a Claim for the previous Claim Period has been started.</p>

<p>Claims are to be submitted for each <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>, via <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>, using the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Claim Form, which includes the Dual Forecast and Submission Form (DFAS) within 60 calendar days of the end of the preceding Claim Instalment Period.</p>

<p>The Managing Authority will aim to finalise payment into the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr>’s nominated Bank Account within 30 working days from the point at which all claim information is agreed by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority as correct and complete for example, there are no outstanding issues, actions or concerns that could potentially lead to an Irregularity.</p>

<h4>Late or missing claims</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> must notify the Managing Authority promptly if at any time they become aware that they are unable to make a Grant Claim in accordance with the outlined timescales or in accordance with the expenditure profile.</p>

<p>If a Claim is not submitted in line with the Claim Schedule, the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Contract Manager will provide an email prompt to the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr>.</p>

<p>In cases where there has still been no claim submission, the Contract Manager may take the opportunity to remind the applicant that under section 10.1 of their <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>, the Managing Authority may withhold any or all of the payments and, or require part or all of the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> to be repaid if it is reasonably considered that that the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> is failing to “adequately retain information and provide information requested by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>, the Certifying Authority, the European Commission, the European Court of Auditors, or the Audit Authority”. For this reason, the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> should ensure prompt submission of Claims in line with the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority Claim Schedule.</p>

<p>Where a <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> Project is covered by a Funding Agreement, rather than an <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>, under the terms and conditions set out in their Funding Agreement, failure to submit claims within their contractual timescales may be an event of default under their Funding Agreement and could therefore lead to the Department enacting its rights to suspend, reduce or cease to make payments in respect of the relevant <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project. If a Claim is not submitted in line with the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> Funding Agreement Claim Schedule, the Contract Manager will provide at least one email prompt to the Grant Recipient. However, if a claim is still not forthcoming, the Contract Manager will consider whether ‘Event of Default’ action is appropriate.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Claim process</h2>

<p>The Claim process is an integral part of the contract management and control environment employed by the Managing Authority in managing the Programme. Although Claims are a mechanism for <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr> to draw down their European Structure and Investment Funds (<abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr>) Grant it also provides key information on <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> progress and performance. The information provided enables the Managing Authority to obtain assurances and carry out Article 125 Desk-Based Evidence Checks (<abbr title="Desk Based Evidence Checks">DBEC</abbr>) and ‘On-the-Spot’ Visits (<abbr title="On the Spot Visit">OTSV</abbr>) to determine the validity of the activities currently undertaken, for the on-going project delivery and these will take place outside of the Claims process.</p>

<p>All claims should be submitted to the Managing Authority via <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>. The following documentation should be uploaded as supporting documentation, unless the Managing Authority has agreed any specific, alternative arrangements with the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> for a given claim or claim period. Such arrangements must be documented in writing and will be retained by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority as part of the audit trail for any affected claims:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Participant Data Schema (not application to Investment Priority 2.2 and Priority Axis 3 outputs or results)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Transaction List</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Dual Forecast and Submission Form – at <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> and National Level, (including the signed claim form)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each project must also submit a narrative Progress Report with their quarterly claim. The Progress Report information should be recorded directly into the relevant screen(s) and fields in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>. By exception, subject to agreement with their Contract Manager, a project may be allowed to provide their report via a separate document which must then be uploaded into <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> - however, you should note that you will still need to work through the Progress Report screens in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> in these circumstances before attaching your narrative report otherwise <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> will not allow submission of your claim. Regardless of whether they choose direct input, or a separate document, the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> must ensure all required Progress Report sections or topics as set out in the <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> Progress Report screens are fully covered.</p>

<p><abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr> who are delivering activities under Investment Priority 2.2 must report progress against their Output and Result profiles in both the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Dual Forecast and Submission Form and their Progress Report. This should include numerical performance against profiles, as well as any specific narrative progress update.</p>

<p>As part of the Project Inception Visit process, <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr> should have already identified staff to perform the ‘Claim Editor’ role in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> – bearing in mind that financial claims can only be generated and submitted in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> by individuals who have been assigned the ‘Claim Editor’ user role, including uploading of any supporting documents.</p>

<p><abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr> must ensure that the final compiled claim is checked by a ‘Claim Reviewer’ in their organisation prior to submission of the claim via <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>. The ‘Claim Reviewer’ must be a named individual who has been agreed as a ‘Named Authoriser’ (for example, an authorised <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> External user) between the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> and <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority. The ‘Claim Reviewer’ must be a different person to the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> User who is recorded as “Submitting” the claim to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority – the name of the person submitting the claim can be found in the ‘Activity Log’ of the ‘Manage Claims’ menu in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>.</p>

<p>If a <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> submits a claim without ‘Claim Reviewer’ action recorded in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>, or if the ‘Claim Reviewer’ is not a recognised ‘Named Authoriser’ for the project, the claim will be rejected by the Managing Authority and returned to the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> for remedial action.</p>

<p>Claims are to be submitted in arrears for each Instalment Period and only eligible expenditure defrayed (incurred and ‘paid’, for example, cleared bank account) by the end of that period can be included in the Claim for reimbursement. By exception any expenditure for previous periods can also be included, as long as this has not already been included in another Claim and a statement has been included in the expenditure description field confirming this.</p>

<p>At the point each Claim is submitted to the Managing Authority on <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>, the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> must notify their <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Contract Manager via email, to ensure timely action can be completed to check the information provided and authorise and approve the resulting payment.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> must notify the Managing Authority promptly if at any time it becomes aware that it is unable to make a Grant Claim in accordance with the outlined timescales or in accordance with the expenditure profile.</p>

<p>In the event that no expenditure has been defrayed during the Instalment Period, a ‘Nil Claim’ must still be submitted.  Once a Project has been cleared by the Managing Authority to make their first Claim, all Claims thereafter – including ‘Nil Claims’ must include a Progress Report.</p>

<p>If at any stage the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> identifies any mistakes or omissions in any of its Claims, whether paid or in the process of being paid, they must contact their <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Contract Manager as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Financial information</h3>

<p>This section aims to guide you through the key areas to check when collating the detail for your Claim.</p>

<p><abbr title="European Social Fund Co-Financing Organisation">ESF CFO</abbr> Admin costs can be submitted as a single entry line, but must adhere to all other relevant stipulations listed below. If requested by the Managing Authority/Intermediate Body, an itemised list will need to be provided for the purposes of Annual Monitoring and Audit Verification.</p>

<p>All expenditure which is to be claimed must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>fall within the agreed scope of activities outlined in the <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> and the agreed expenditure categories. Since the application stage, the Cost Category headings have been aligned with the <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> system to allow a smooth transition to the IT service. A <a class="govuk-link" href="#reconciliation">Cost Category Reconciliation</a>has been developed to ensure the correct Cost Category headings are used</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be at Contract or <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> level – whichever is more granular</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>conform to all respects of the eligibility criteria as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-structural-and-investment-funds-eligibility-documents"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> National Eligibility Rules and Programme Guidance.</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be defrayed (incurred and ‘paid’, for example, cleared bank account) by the end date of the Claim Instalment Period. The date paid is the date the payment appears on your bank statement. For large organisations the Bankers Automated Clearing Services (<abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr>) defrayal date may be acceptable, this should be discussed with the Managing Authority</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>only include Irrecoverable Value Added Tax (<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>) if this has been agreed as an eligible cost with the Managing Authority during the Full Appraisal process</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be able to be backed up by a full audit trail containing all original source documentation from receipted invoices to bank statements and accounting documents of equivalent verifiable value. These need to be maintained and made available for Article 125 ‘On-the-Spot’ checks and audits. These documents must be retained in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-structural-and-investment-funds-document-retention">European Social Fund document retention guidance</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-structural-and-investment-funds-eligibility-documents"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> National Eligibility Rules and ProgrammeGuidance.</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Transactions List</h2>

<p>A Transaction List, itemising each type of expenditure (<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> or Match), must be uploaded directly into <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> to support each Claim. This Transaction List must provide the Managing Authority, or any other audit body, with clear detail relating to all the costs being claimed.  It is important that this information is entered accurately and provides a clear description of the costs to enable the reader to determine their eligibility. The use of acronyms and jargon should be avoided to aid clarity to the reader.</p>

<p>Note: <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr> may show salaries as a single line, but full and complete records must be kept by the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> for each individual within this Claim for Audit purposes - this will be tested annually as part of the Verification Cycle.</p>

<p>The Transaction List spreadsheet contains three tabs entitled ‘Guidance’, ‘Transactions’ and ‘Summary’. The Transaction List is designed to enable upload to <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>.</p>

<p>It is strongly recommended that the ‘Guidance’ tab is consulted before attempting to work through the Setup and populate the ‘Transactions’ tab. If at any time you are unsure of the level of detail required after checking with guidance, please check with your Contract Manager before uploading.</p>

<p>Unless agreed otherwise with the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority, the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> should separate their lines of expenditure between “<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Admin Costs “, “<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> – Contract Costs” and “Match – Contract Costs”. A separate document detailing the expenditure relating to each contract should be provided on request to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Verification Team.</p>

<p>In the case of the The National Lottery Community Fund (TNCLF), as their delivery model uses cash match, they must only use the “<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Admin Costs” and “<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> – Contract Costs” headings.</p>

<p>The details required when completing the Transaction List screen in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> are explained below along with descriptions on whether these are mandatory <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> fields, and what they are validated against.</p>

<p>The details required when completing the Transaction List screen in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> are explained below along with descriptions on whether these are mandatory <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> fields, and what they are validated against.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>a) the fields labelled as mandatory below are those which will automatically be validated by <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> and if they are not completed accurately, the Claim will be rejected</p>

<p>b) for data collection purposes all fields must be completed where possible regardless of whether they are labelled as mandatory or not</p>

<p>c) all monetary figures must be to 2 decimal places; .005 and above, rounded to .01; .004 and below, rounded to .00</p>

<p>d) dates should be added in with slashes (e.g. DD/MM/YYYY) as <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> will not accept full-stops - and will automatically change to YYYY-MM-DD when the ‘Export’ button is pressed</p>

<p>e) once the Transaction List has been completed the ‘Export’ button will need to be activated prior to submission to <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>. This button creates a spreadsheet which is in a format that <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> can accept for example without macros or any other formatting</p>

<p>For instructions on uploading the Transaction List please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-claim-applications-and-self-declared-adjustments"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 
<abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> External Users Guidance</a></p>

<h4>Cost category</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) Select the eligible cost as agreed and set out in your <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>. The headings you must select from are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> – <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> Admin</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> – Contract Costs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Match – Contract Costs</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Other cost categories in the Transaction List are not applicable to <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr> and should not be used.</p>

<p>If the Cost Categories in your <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> pre-date the implementation of the new <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> cost categories above, you will need to select the relevant cost category on the Transaction List using the mapping below.</p>

<h4>Delivery Partner</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) If your project has Delivery Partners, you must insert the Identification (<abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr>) number applicable to that Delivery Partner in column C of the Transaction List. You must record this value in Column C against all transaction lines relating to that partner.  If your project has no delivery partners, please enter a ‘0’ into column C on each transaction line.</p>

<p>You can find the correct <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> number for each of your Delivery Partners in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> by visiting the Full Application option from the left hand menu on your project screen in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> and scrolling down to the Delivery Partner table.</p>

<p>If you have an existing Delivery Partner and their information is not recorded in the Delivery Partner table in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>, you will need to add their information to the table before you can include them in your financial claim.</p>

<p>If you have a new Delivery Partner, you must submit a Project Change Request to the Managing Authority first for approval before including them in the Delivery Partner table and any Financial Claims.</p>

<h4>Priority Axis</h4>

<p>(Mandatory – must align with <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>) Select the applicable Priority Axis as agreed and specified in your grant <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Investment priority</h4>

<p>(Mandatory – must align with <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>) Select the applicable Investment Priority as agreed and specified in your grant <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Procurement Contract <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr>
</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) If a transaction line is as a result of Procurement undertaken by your project, you should record the relevant Procurement Record <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> number in Column F in each case. The Procurement Record <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> number can be found in the Procurement Register for your <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project on <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> or, for existing <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> procurements not already recorded in the <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> Procurement Register, may be listed in the Dual Forecast &amp; Submission form Procurement Tab.</p>

<p>If the transaction line is not a result of procurement by your project, then please leave column F blank.</p>

<h4>Supplier name</h4>

<p>(Mandatory – in any format) Enter the name of supplier, creditor / payee or employee.</p>

<h4>Supplier <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> number</h4>

<p>Enter the supplier <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> number.</p>

<h4>Invoice reference</h4>

<p>(Mandatory – in any format) Invoice or receipt or reference number (this may be created by the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> but must be auditable).  All documents should be given a separate unique reference number to clearly identify the item of expenditure for audit purposes. See table below for further details.</p>

<h4>Invoice date</h4>

<p>(Mandatory – see ‘d’ above) Date on the invoice or if salaries the date posted on your accounting system. As stated above dates can be added in using slashes – as <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> will not accept full-stops - and will automatically change to YYYY-MM-DD when the ‘Export’ button is pressed.</p>

<h4>Defrayal date</h4>

<p>(Mandatory – see ‘d’ above) Date the money was defrayed  or paid (for example, left your bank account – as appears on your bank statement). (For large organisations the <abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr> defrayal date maybe acceptable and should be discussed with the Managing Authority). Again, dates can be added in using slashes –as <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> will not accept full-stops - and will automatically change to YYYY-MM-DD when the ‘Export’ button is pressed.</p>

<p>If organisations pay their <abbr title="National Insurance">NI</abbr> and pension contributions monthly, it can be automatically accepted that these will be paid and that the relevant defrayal date is the date the payroll is paid. This approach is used for Article 125 testing.</p>

<h4>Defrayal method</h4>

<p>(Mandatory – in any format) Select from the drop-down list the method of payment, for example, <abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr>, Cheque, Credit Card. See table below for further details.</p>

<h4>Defrayal reference</h4>

<p>(Mandatory – in any format) Enter payment reference relevant to transaction. If this is part of a <abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr> run this number will need to be created, unique and auditable. See below for further details.</p>

<p>Note: Additional narrative regarding other document dates, references and methods should be included in Comments.</p>

<h4>Expenditure description</h4>

<p>(Mandatory – in any format) Full description of the item of expenditure being claimed to ensure clarity for any reader on what is being included. Connections between defrayal, invoice dates and salary paid dates should be explained, for example, if they are the same date. Additionally, if an employee works full-time on <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>, include this in the description.</p>

<p>Note: If the expense relates to a participant, the unique participant identifier must be included within the expenditure description. This ensures that, if there are any issues with this participant on the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr>, it will be possible to identify and rectify any related expenditure where needed. The participant name must not be used.</p>

<h4>Apportionment details</h4>

<p>Indicate how the eligible value is derived from the original invoice or receipt value, for example, the method of apportionment, ineligible costs removed.</p>

<p>If a cost is apportioned between <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>, Match and, or Youth Employment Initiative (<abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr>), more than one Category of Region and, or more than one Investment Priority, you must include details here of how the cost has been apportioned in each case.</p>

<h4>Total Invoice Value (excluding <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>)</h4>

<p>(Mandatory – in any format) Indicate the total, Net of <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>, expenditure value of the invoice or receipt, (total documented value excluding <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>).</p>

<p>If a cost is apportioned between <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>, Match and or <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr>, more than one Category of Region and or more than one Investment Priority, the Total Invoice Value must still be completed with the actual, total overall amount of the invoice. The ‘Total Eligible Value’ field will then be the place where you will need to record the actual expenditure amount to be claimed after any apportionment has been taken into account.</p>

<h4>Total Irrecoverable <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>
</h4>

<p>State the Irrecoverable <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> value which cannot be recovered from another source Her Majesty’s Revenue Custom (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) of the invoice or receipt following any adjustments for apportionments or ineligible costs.</p>

<p>Note: if you are <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> registered and are able to recover <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> but are choosing not to do so, these costs still cannot be included in your claim. However, you must still provide details of these costs here.</p>

<h4>Total Eligible Value</h4>

<p>(Mandatory – in any format) Enter the project eligible expenditure amount after any apportionment or adjustments have been applied and Irrecoverable <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> added in. This is the expenditure value minus adjustments for which <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> is being claimed against.</p>

<h4>Eligible for Flat Rate Indirect Costs</h4>

<p>(Mandatory – ‘Y’ or ‘N’) Select ‘No’ from drop-down menu - These are NOT applicable to <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr>, so ‘No’ should be used here.</p>

<h4>Total Category of Region Expenditure</h4>

<p>(Mandatory – if Claim covers more than one Categories of Region (CoR) applicable to the project will have been agreed at appraisal together with the Co-financing Rate <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> for each category.  If you have only one CoR you do not need to enter data into cells T, U and V.</p>

<p>Note:  If you have more than one Category of Region and your <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>/Funding Agreement was agreed prior to 09/03/17, you will need to contact your Contract Manager to obtain this information</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Descriptions of Defrayed Expenditure</h2>

<p>The item for which funding is being claimed must have a clear description. The description must be detailed enough to allow the reader to consider its validity without the need to see the actual evidence at this stage.</p>

<p>The table below provides guidance on acceptable/unacceptable expenditure descriptions and level of detail required.</p>

<p>Please note that this is for illustrative purposes only and it is not an exhaustive list:</p>

<p>Where your project receives a credit note from a partner or supplier but that expenditure has already been included and paid in a previous <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> claim, you should raise a Self-Declared Adjustment for the full value of the credit note.</p>

<p>If you then incur further costs with the same supplier or partner against your Project and want to use the credit note as payment or part-payment of those costs you should complete the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>record the full value of the new expenditure or invoice in your Transaction List</li>
  <li>ensure the description of the transaction explains how much of the invoice or expenditure is being paid via  credit note</li>
  <li>ensure you retain a copy of the credit note, and evidence of the supplier or partner acceptance of the credit note as payment or part-payment as evidence of defrayal</li>
  <li>if requested as part of the Desk-Based Evidence Checks, On The Spot Visits (<abbr title="On the Spot Visit">OTSV</abbr>) visit or Audit Authority checks, you will need to provide the credit note as evidence of defrayal</li>
</ol>

<p>If your Project received a credit note from a partner or supplier for expenditure which has not yet been included in an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> claim, the amount of any expenditure being claimed from the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority against that supplier or partner for the activities covered by the credit note should be reduced by the value of the credit note. This is because expenditure covered by a credit note is not ‘defrayed’ until the credit note has been spent with the relevant partner or supplier.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Internal Cost Transfers</h3>

<p>If your organisation uses Internal Cost Transfers as part of your payment processes for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> costs, you should be aware that evidence of the Internal Cost Transfer itself is not sufficient evidence of defrayal of those <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project costs.</p>

<p>In the situation of an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project operating as a separate entity within a wider organisation (for example an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project within a Local Authority) and the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project pays an additional direct cost to the wider organisation via internal cost transfer, there must be a process in place and a clear audit trail showing not only the transfer of funds between the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project and the wider organisation receiving those funds, but also evidence of the same, actual costs being incurred for example defrayed by the wider organisation who is receiving payment from the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project to a third party.</p>

<p>If the payment is made by an internal cost transfer and there is no supporting evidence as outlined above, the evidence of the internal cost transfer alone is not sufficient evidence of defrayal and any expenditure should be removed from the claim unless the required defrayal evidence can be provided.</p>

<p>An example of a compliant audit trail for internal cost transfers could be as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>evidence of an invoice or request for payment from a parent organisation to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project, setting out the specific, direct costs to be paid by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project and what services or goods have been provided by the parent organisation to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence of the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project transferring the relevant direct costs amount to the parent organisation such as, financial journal entry, cost centre transfer record</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence of the direct, actual costs incurred by the parent organisation and evidence they have defrayed those costs, as a result of the goods or services provided to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project for example, bank statement; <abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr> run</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The final bullet point is important to ensure that your <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project is only claiming costs from the Managing Authority which have been actually been incurred by the parent or other organisation. This list is not exhaustive and, depending on the complexity of the internal cost transfer arrangements, the Managing Authority may request other documentation in support of any transactions where internal cost transfers are part of the payment process, to ensure there is sufficient documentary evidence for each step from initial payment by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project to defrayal.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Participant Data Schema (<abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>Output and Result targets are key performance indicators for <abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> programmes. Every project justifies the level of investment requested from <abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> by agreeing to achieve a number of programme defined outputs and result targets. These targets are scoped and referenced in the application for <abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> funding which is appraised by the Managing Authority and form an important part of the <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> or Funding Agreement.</p>

<p>Before submitting any output or results data to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority, the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> must ensure they have a full audit trail containing all original source documentation for each output and result being reported – in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-structural-and-investment-funds-eligibility-documents"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Data Evidence Requirements</a> published on GOV.UK. This audit trail must be maintained and made available for verification checks and audits and must be retained in accordance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-structural-and-investment-funds-document-retention">European Social Fund document retention guidance</a>  and <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-structural-and-investment-funds-eligibility-documents"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> National Eligibility Rules and Programme Guidance</a>.</p>

<p>With the exception of Investment Priority 2.2 and Priority Axis 3 (Technical Assistance) deliverables, all outputs and results to be claimed for during the respective Claim Period should be recorded and submitted to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority using the Participant Data Schema form. It is good practice to submit a single Participant Data Schema with each claim – however, if you have a significant number of lines to report for example, 5,000 or over, you may discuss with your Contract Manager whether you can submit more than one <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> for a given claim period by exception. Progress against Investment Priority 2.2 and Priority Axis 3 outputs and results must be reported as part of the project Progress Report and <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Dual Forecast and Submission Form.</p>

<p>As stated in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-claim-applications-and-self-declared-adjustments">Participant Data Schema Guidance</a> participant identifiers are how we track participants and their progress. Each participant must have a unique and persistent identifier number. <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> data protection regulations require that no unnecessary identifying or personal data is collected about the participant additionally the guidance on the Data Protection Act sets out that consideration should be given to not only the identifying potential of individual items of data but the impact of the total data collected. To this end participant <abbr title="Identifications">IDs</abbr> should not be based on any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>participant’s first names</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>participant’s surnames</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>participant’s full address</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Importantly as a beneficiary organisation you must be able to reconcile a Participant <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> to a single unique participant, for both audit purposes and participant survey selection. If a participant is selected for a follow up survey, the evaluation team will contact you to request the participant contact details which will be held and processed in a separate system with greater security.</p>

<p>The Participant <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> should relate to the submitting organisation, for example</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>TNXXXXXXXXXX = The National Lottery Community Fund</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>DWXXXXXXXXX = Department for Work Pensions (DWP)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>SFXXXXXXXXXX = Skills Funding Agency</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>NOXXXXXXXXXX = NOMS</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>DBXXXXXXXXXX = Direct Bid</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A maximum number of characters, including the prefix signifier, should be 22 characters.</p>

<p>Annex 6 of this guidance includes examples of a range of scenarios which may occur in delivery of an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> product and how these impact on the reporting of associated outputs and results. Grant Recipients should ensure they take account of these scenarios when completing their Participant Data Schema each quarter.</p>

<p>Once the Participant Data Schema has been completed and the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> is content that all data in the schema is correct, the ‘Create Export Sheet’ button must be pressed prior to uploading the document into <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>. This creates a spreadsheet which is in a format that <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> can accept i.e. without macros. For instructions on uploading of the Participant Data Schema please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-claim-applications-and-self-declared-adjustments"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> External User Guidance</a></p>

<p>The most up-to-date version of the Participant Data Schema form, as well as full guidance on how to complete the form can be found on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-claim-applications-and-self-declared-adjustments.">GOV.UK</a></p>

<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Dual Forecast and Submission Form</h2>

<p>An <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Dual Forecast and Submission Form must be completed and submitted to the Managing Authority as a supporting document with each claim. The Form is made up of a number of tabs, as explained below.</p>

<p>The majority of the fields within the ‘Claim’ tab of the Dual Forecast and Submission Form is self-explanatory such as the project details and the list of supporting documents confirmed as being submitted by the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> as part of the overall claim.</p>

<p>Lines 27–28 on the ‘Claim’ tab of the Dual Forecast and Submission Form should be completed please see below.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Defrayed expenditure for which grant is now payable</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>Revenue</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Total Cumulative Eligible expenditure defrayed prior to the claim period (£)</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>Eligible expenditure from all previous Claims submitted to Managing Authority.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Amount of Eligible Expenditure Defrayed within the claim period (£)</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>Eligible expenditure from the transaction sheet + 15/40% of flat rate costs where applicable.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Line 29 of the ‘Claim’ tab relates to Income Generation which is not applicable to <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> projects. This line should therefore be left blank.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span>Expenditure forecast tab</h3>

<p>Information on actual expenditure for previous and current claim periods as well as contracted expenditure profiles for remaining claim periods is required with every claim to support <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Contract Managers in reviewing the performance of each project.</p>

<p>The ‘Expenditure Forecast’ tab of the Dual Forecast and Submission Form is to be completed to capture this information. Expenditure must be broken down by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Investment Priority (IP)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Category of Region (CoR)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Variances from the contracted profiled forecast, ‘slippage’, must be fully explained and justified within the Progress Report, submitted along with the claim. Any actual underspend variance greater than 15% from the contracted expenditure profiles may result in de-commitment or withdrawal of <abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> funding in line with the underperformance policy. Your Contract Manager will discuss this with you if applicable. Any anticipated variances should be discussed with your Contract Manager as soon as possible, who will consider whether a Project Change Request is required.</p>

<p>Before submitting a completed Dual Forecast and Submission Form, you should ensure the ‘Contracted’ figures you record in the Expenditure Forecast Tab for future periods are the same as the project cost profile figures as recorded in the ‘Full Application’ screen for that specific <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>. If the ‘Contracted’ future figures do not align, the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Contract Manager may return the Dual Forecast &amp; Submission Form to you for re-work which may, in turn, lead to a delay in processing of the relevant claim.</p>

<p>However, if a Project Change Request (<abbr title="Project Change Request">PCR</abbr>) has recently been approved by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority where this changes the future, contracted expenditure profiles, but the amended figures have not yet been updated in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>, you should complete the Dual Forecast and Submission Form, with the approved, revised <abbr title="Project Change Request">PCR</abbr> contracted figures and add a note to their Progress Report explaining why the Dual Forecast &amp; Submission figures do not match your current <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> expenditure profiles.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span>Output Forecast and Results Forecast Tab</h3>

<p>Information on actual performance against each individual Output and Result category for your project previous and current claim periods, as well as contracted target levels for the remaining claim periods, is required with every claim to support <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Contract Managers in reviewing the performance of each project.</p>

<p>The ‘Outputs Forecast’ tab and ‘Results Forecast’ tab in the Dual Forecast and Submission Form are both to be completed to capture this information. Figures must be broken down by Investment Priority and Category of Region.</p>

<p>Variances from the contracted profiles, ‘slippage’, must be fully explained and justified within the Progress Report, submitted along with the claim. Any actual under performance with a variance greater than 15% from the contracted targets may result in de-commitment or withdrawal of <abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> funding in line with underperformance policy. Your Contract Manager will discuss this with you if applicable. Any anticipated variances should be discussed with your Contract Manager as soon as possible, who will consider whether a Project Change Request is required.</p>

<p>A full audit trail, containing all original source documentation, must be maintained and made available for Article 125 ‘On-the-Spot’ checks and audits. <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-structural-and-investment-funds-eligibility-documents"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> National Eligibility Rules and Programme Guidance</a> linked to payments has been published by the Managing Authority. These documents must be retained in accordance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-structural-and-investment-funds-document-retention">European Social Fund document retention guidance</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-structural-and-investment-funds-eligibility-documents"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> National Eligibility Rules and Programme Guidance</a></p>

<p>A forecast of expected achievement of each target for the remaining contract period must be entered and be broken down:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>per <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by quarter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>together with a national total forecast</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The same template can be used for both scenarios and must be labelled to show whether they link to an <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> or whether it is the national forecast.</p>

<p>The National Level Dual Forecast and Submission Form should be submitted to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Contract Manager in the Managing Authority via email. Each <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> level Dual Forecast and Submission Form should be uploaded into <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> along with the relevant claims documentation for that <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>, quarterly claim.</p>

<p>Before submitting a completed Dual Forecast and Submission Form at individual <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project level, you should ensure the ‘Contracted’ figures you record for future periods in the Outputs and Results Tab are the same as the project output and result profile figures as recorded in the ‘Full Application’ screen for that specific <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>. If the ‘Contracted’ figures do not align, the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Contract Manager may return the Dual Forecast and Submission Form to you for re-work which may, in turn, lead to a delay in processing of the relevant claim.</p>

<p>However, if a Project Change Request has recently been approved by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority where this changes the future, contracted output and/or result profiles, but the amended figures have not yet been updated in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>, you should complete the Dual Forecast and Submission Form with the approved, revised <abbr title="Project Change Request">PCR</abbr> contracted figures and add a note to your Progress Report explaining why the ‘Contracted’ Dual Forecast and Submission figures do not match their <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> profiles.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span>Procurement Tab</h3>

<p>You should record in the Procurement Tab any completed procurement exercises as well as any planned future procurements – this includes any <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> procured contracts which are used as match-funding.</p>

<p>Where there are procurements that have already been completed, that have not been reviewed, or fully reviewed at appraisal or <abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIV</abbr> stage – for example, the procurement exercise has been undertaken or completed after the <abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIV</abbr> was finalised – these will need to be reviewed at the Desk-Based Administrative Checks (<abbr title="Desk Based Administrative Checks">DBAC</abbr>) stage and an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Public Procurement Checklist may need to be completed.</p>

<p>The Checklist is not required where a Contracting Authority has carried out a procurement exercise where the value is below £24,999.99. In such cases, the Contract Manager undertaking the <abbr title="Desk Based Administrative Checks">DBAC</abbr> will still carry out existing, relevant procurement checks to ensure the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> is aware of and adhering to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-structural-and-investment-funds-procurement-documents"><abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> National Procurement Requirements</a></p>

<p>Where the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Public Procurement Checklist is required, you will be asked to complete and return the checklist to the Contract Manager, together with any specified ‘Core Documents’.</p>

<p>The ‘<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Public Procurement Checklist’ can be issued at any point in the <abbr title="Desk Based Administrative Checks">DBAC</abbr> process, however the review of any relevant procurement exercises must be finished before any costs from that procurement exercises are included in an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Claim.</p>

<p>Where you have completed more than one procurement exercise a separate checklist should be completed for each individual procurement exercise.</p>

<p>Where a single procurement exercise has resulted in the award of a number of individual contracts, a single <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Public Procurement Checklist can be completed.</p>

<p>In all cases you should ensure that neither you nor your Contract Manager upload any of the supporting ‘Core Documents’ into <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> as these may be ‘Commercial in Confidence’. Instead these should be sent to the Contract Manager via email.</p>

<p>If the Contract Manager undertaking the procurement checks is unable to obtain sufficient assurance that a Procurement exercise has been undertaken compliantly, they will consider whether expenditure relating to that procurement exercise should be excluded from the current and any future claims for the given <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project, or whether a Financial Correction would be appropriate.</p>

<p>Depending on the seriousness of the issue, the Contract Manager may also consider whether the <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>/Funding Agreement for that <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project should be terminated by the Managing Authority. Depending on the seriousness of the issue, it may also be necessary to consider whether other <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> MOUs or Funding Agreements linked to that procurement exercise should be terminated by the Managing Authority.</p>

<p>Once the Contract Manager has completed the relevant procurement checks, they will notify you of the outcome, including any impacts on current and/or future claims. The Contract Manager will also update the Procurement Register in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> with details of that procurement exercise.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Progress Report</h2>

<p>A narrative Progress Report must be completed and submitted to the Managing Authority with each quarterly claim. The Progress Report must be recorded directly into the relevant fields in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> unless the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> has a prior agreement from the Contract Manager that they can submit their report as a separate document, uploaded into <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> as part of the package of claims documentation – however, you should note that you will still need to work through the Progress Report screens in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> in these circumstances before attaching your narrative report otherwise <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> will not allow submission of your claim.</p>

<p>Regardless of the completion method, the report must contain suitable commentary on the performance and progress of the project to date and the planned activity going forward. This must provide sufficient detail to demonstrate successful delivery of the activities and deliverables and if there is any ‘slippage’ of performance, it must include the measures being put in place to bring the project back on track. The Claim may be rejected on <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> if any of the information is incomplete or is considered insufficient or incorrect.</p>

<p>Where agreed in advance with your Managing Authority Contract Manager, a national progress report may be submitted. An exception to this is that all MOUs within London must be accompanied by an individual Progress Report at each Claim.</p>

<p>Where it is deemed necessary, the Managing Authority may still request specified individual <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> or contract level Progress Reports to accompany the national report.</p>

<p>Note: See <a class="govuk-link" href="#Annex1">Annex 1</a> prior to completion of your Progress Report.</p>

<p>For the ‘Equal Opportunities’ section of the progress report, the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> should provide an update of progress in terms of promoting equality and equality performance. This should constitute a short, written narrative in the equal opportunities field of the report – the narrative should also cover progress against the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project specific Equality and Diversity Implementation Plan, including any achievements against targets within the Implementation Plan.</p>

<p>As a minimum, for the Equal Opportunities element of their Progress Report, the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> should provide an update on the following within their narrative:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>details of progress against the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Equality &amp; Diversity Implementation Plan for the project, with details of any reviews undertaken and any further revisions made to the plan</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>some basic detail on performance against profile in terms of any equality targets</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether or not any under-performance has been identified, and, if so, the mitigating/corrective action that will be taken</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to reporting on Equal Opportunities, you must also report on any improvements, updates or amendments that you have made in terms of the governance of the Sustainable Development theme in your project – as well as any progress in achieving aims and objectives set out in your sustainable development policy / implementation plan during the claim instalment period.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Managing Authority claims checks</h2>

<p>The Checklist (below) lists examples of the types of questions the Managing Authority will consider when looking at a submitted claim and the relevant supporting documents</p>

<p><abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr> must ensure that information and supporting documents submitted as part of the claim itself, as well as any subsequent evidence or source documentation submitted to the Managing Authority in response to Desk-Based Evidence Checks, satisfy the checks listed below.</p>

<h4>Expenditure</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Q1 Do all of the defrayal dates fall after the invoice dates?</p>
</div>

<p>Defrayal should usually follow receipt of invoice. However, there may be circumstances where the invoice is received after defrayal. In these circumstances you should request an explanation from the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> and provide comments in the comment box.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Q2
Does the expenditure detail or description provide sufficient information?</p>

<p>This could relate to a Project Inception Visit, Article 125 and, or Article 127 actions that are outstanding, consideration needs to be given if this would be something that would prevent payment.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#Annex2">Annex 2</a> provides a help sheet for invoice transactions, and Annex 3 provides a help sheet for salary transactions. These are broad guidelines only.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Article 125 checks</h2>

<p>There are two different types of Article 125 Defrayal Documentary Check:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Desk Based Documentary Evidence Checks – For <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr> these will be undertaken by the Verification Team, within a specified time window, post Claim payment.  This will involve a selection of both <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> and Match contract payments across all MOUs thereby giving each Claim payment an equal chance for selection. Evidence for the majority of <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr> will be required at individual learner level with its associated cost, supported by defrayal evidence. There will be no Desk Based Checks for the Big Lottery Fund in favour of an increased number of ’On-the-Spot’ transaction line checks instead for selected providers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On-the-Spot Visits will be undertaken by the Verification Team Post-Claim payment. Further guidance on the visits will be provided by the Managing Authority</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Before the Claim is paid, the Managing Authority will undertake Desk-Based Administrative checks of all submitted documents to ensure all relevant information has been submitted.</p>

Provide an update on State Aid received as a <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> and what State Aid has been dispersed to employer beneficiaries, including those relating to paid work placements and internships including those relating to paid work placements and internships.</p>

<p>Your progress report must include a narrative explaining what checks have been undertaken to ensure that the project is operating State Aid processes in line with your <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Funding Agreement and published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/832429/esf_2014-2020_-_guidance_on_state_aid.pdf" rel="external">European Social Fund 2014 to 2020 State Aid Guidance</a>
Your narrative should also explain how you have ensured a complete set of State Aid evidence is being retained in line with the published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-structural-and-investment-funds-document-retention"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Document Retention guidance.</a></p>

<p>Projects which have a state aid exemption your Progress Report should reflect the exemption applicable as per the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> or as a result of a <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> Variation. The only exemptions applicable to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>De Minimis</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>45030 Aid for Disadvantaged Workers General Block Exemption (<abbr title="General Block Exemption Regulation">GBER</abbr>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>45031 Training Aid (<abbr title="General Block Exemption Regulation">GBER</abbr>)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All other exemptions are not applicable to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme. A blank exemption is a permissible response if either state aid does not apply or there has been no use of the agreed exemption within the claim instalment period.</p>

<p>In addition, the Grant Recipient must also ensure they have valued the aid appropriately and provided detail on the methodology used by the project. In the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> programme there are two methods permissible for valuing aid. Method 1 is the preferred approach and should be used by projects, and only where in exceptional cases should the Grant Recipient use Method 2. 
Details on the methods are provided below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>method 1 relates to an average of the costs if that support was bought privately. Using this method, the Grant Recipient will need to explain how they have calculated that average, for example through comparison of three other suppliers and calculating the average of the costs based on this information</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
  <li>method 2 relates to their real costs (such as the hourly rate of the member of staff who is providing the support, plus the 15 or 40% <abbr title="Flat Rate Indirect Costs">FRIC</abbr> attributed to that salary. The Grant Recipient should use the hourly rate applied to the member of staff undertaking the cost with an uplift of the appropriate <abbr title="Flat Rate Indirect Costs">FRIC</abbr> for the project by the number of hours to complete the task to identify the level of aid</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the only methods available for use. No other methodology proposed by Grant Recipients can be used</p>

<h4>Valuing Aid – worked examples</h4>

<p>Method 1</p>

<p>A Grant Recipient is providing a Small and Medium Enterprise (<abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr>) with a Training Needs Analysis (<abbr title="Training Needs Analysis">TNA</abbr>), and then developing a training plan for a group of the staff who work for the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr>.</p>

<p>In this case, the Grant Recipient takes an average of the costs 3 other providers would charge the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> for this activity, so, for example;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Joe Bloggs Training Ltd would charge £1,500 for a <abbr title="Training Needs Analysis">TNA</abbr> for an <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> with less than 50 employees, and a further £500 for a training plan, giving a total of £2,000</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jane Doe College Services Ltd would charge £1,350 for a <abbr title="Training Needs Analysis">TNA</abbr> and a further £700 for a bespoke training plan, so total would be £2,050</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Training R Us Ltd would charge £1,700 for the <abbr title="Training Needs Analysis">TNA</abbr>, and include the bespoke training plan free of charge</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, the average of these providers would be (£2,000 + £2,050 + £1,700 = £5,750 divided by 3) £1,916.67 worth of aid.</p>

<p>If the project is using the De Minimis route, this would be the amount of De Minimis aid that they need to tell the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> that they have received. If the project is using the <abbr title="General Block Exemption Regulation">GBER</abbr>, this is the total aid amount, and they will need to seek the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> contribution to this total (under Training Aid for example, the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> must contribute 50% of these costs, so the Grant Recipient would need to invoice the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> for £958.34).</p>

<p>Method 2</p>

<p>The Grant Recipient is providing an <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> with a Training Needs Analysis, and then developing a training plan for a group of the staff who work for the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr>, as above.</p>

<p>In this case, the Grant Recipient should take the hourly rate for the member of staff doing the Training Needs Analysis, include the Flat Rate Indirect Cost (<abbr title="Flat Rate Indirect Costs">FRIC</abbr>) uplift, then multiply that by the number of hours taken to carry out the Training Needs Analysis and development of the plan. For example, £27:15 per hour (including 15% <abbr title="Flat Rate Indirect Costs">FRIC</abbr>) x 43 hours = £1,167.45 worth of aid.</p>

<p>If De Minimis applies, this is the amount of De Minimis aid the Grant Recipient will need to inform the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> they have received, and if they are using the <abbr title="General Block Exemption Regulation">GBER</abbr> they will need to invoice the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> for 50% of the costs (£583.73).</p>

<p>For those claims where either of the <abbr title="General Block Exemption Regulation">GBER</abbr> exemptions outlined above are acceptable against the project the progress report should also include the value of aid for the claim instalment period. However, although the value of aid is not a requirement where De Minimis applies the Grant Recipient is still required to have calculated the value of aid using one of the methodologies above to ensure the aid is calculated and reported on for the purposes of 3 year €200,000 ceiling.</p>

<p>A response of Not Applicable  is not acceptable on any aspect of State Aid, including the valuing method, level of aid and the exemption applied. If you record a response of Not Applicable or equivalent, the Contract Manager will not be able to approve your claim. Instead they will refer your claim back to you, requesting that you provide an updated, acceptable response.</p>

<h4>5. Sustainability monitoring</h4>

<p>Report on what improvements, updates , amendments have been made to show how the Sustainable Development governance, policies and implementation plans have progressed in the Claim Instalment Period.</p>

<h4>6. Branding and publicity</h4>

<p>Report on any publicity activity that has taken place during the Claim Instalment Period.  This may include publicity material, leaflets, banners or stationery and any press releases, newspaper articles or publicity events. Review any evidence uploaded referring to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-structural-and-investment-funds-programme-guidance">Branding and publicity requirements for the 2014 to 2020 European Regional Development Fund and European Social Fund.</a></p>

<h4>7.Procurement</h4>

<p>You should record in the Procurement Tab of the Dual Forecast &amp; Submission Form any completed procurement exercises as well as any planned future procurements – this includes any <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> procured contracts which are used as match-funding. You should also include reference to recently completed or newly planned future procurement exercises in the ‘Procurement’ section of your Progress Report. In either case, the action taken by the Contract Manager should be the same.</p>

<p>Where there are procurements that have already been completed, that have not been reviewed, or fully reviewed at appraisal or Project Inception Visit (<abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIV</abbr>) stage – for example, the procurement exercise has been undertaken or completed after the <abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIV</abbr> was finalised – these will need to be reviewed at the Desk-Based Administrative Checks stage and an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Public Procurement Checklist may need to be completed.</p>

<p>The Checklist is not required where a Contracting Authority has carried out a procurement exercise where the value is below £24,999.99. In such cases, the Contract Manager undertaking the <abbr title="Desk Based Administrative Checks">DBAC</abbr> will still carry out existing, relevant procurement checks to ensure the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> is aware of and adhering to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-structural-and-investment-funds-procurement-documents"><abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> National Procurement Requirements.</a>.</p>

<p>Where the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Public Procurement Checklist is required, you will be asked to complete and return the checklist to the Contract Manager, together with any specified ‘Core Documents’.</p>

<p>The ‘<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Public Procurement Checklist’ can be issued at any point in the <abbr title="Desk Based Administrative Checks">DBAC</abbr> process, however the review of any relevant procurement exercises must be finished before any costs from that procurement exercises are included in an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Claim.</p>

<p>Where you have completed more than one procurement exercise a separate checklist should be completed for each individual procurement exercise.</p>

<p>Where a single procurement exercise has resulted in the award of a number of individual contracts, a single <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Public Procurement Checklist can be completed.</p>

<p>In all cases you should ensure that neither you nor your Contract Manager upload any of the supporting ‘Core Documents’ into <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> as these may be ‘Commercial in Confidence’. Instead these should be sent to the Contract Manager via email.</p>

<p>If the Contract Manager undertaking the procurement checks is unable to obtain sufficient assurance that a Procurement exercise has been undertaken compliantly, they will consider whether expenditure relating to that procurement exercise should be excluded from the current and any future claims for the given <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project, or whether a Financial Correction would be appropriate.</p>

<p>Depending on the seriousness of the issue, the Contract Manager may also consider whether the <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> or Funding Agreement for that <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project should be terminated by the Managing Authority. Depending on the seriousness of the issue, it may also be necessary to consider whether other <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> MOUs or Funding Agreements linked to that procurement exercise should be terminated by the Managing Authority.</p>

<p>Once the Contract Manager has completed the relevant procurement checks, they will notify you of the outcome, including any impacts on current and, or future claims. The Contract Manager will also update the Procurement Register in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> with details of that procurement exercise.</p>

<h4>Fixed percentage staff costs</h4>

<p>A copy of the contractual document which confirms the fixed percentage of time per month the employee is working on the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project and a copy of the payslip and any other documents, where necessary, which show the actual gross employment costs which have been used to calculate the correct ‘Fixed Percentage’ <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Direct Staff Costs amount for the selected transaction line.</p>

<h4>Payroll report</h4>

<p>For example, payroll report detailing total gross pay and all pay costs for A.N. Other for [Month] as highlighted. A narrative should be provided if it is not clearly possible to demonstrate links between the documents for both full time and hourly charged employees. Where possible provide a link between the <abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr> payment and the monies defrayed. If this link cannot be clearly made an explanation should be provided as to why not.
Screen dumps are acceptable as long as the accounting package is identified and certified as a true copy as stated below.</p>

<h4>Pay Advice Reports</h4>

<p>For example, breakdown of pay costs, pay deductions and net pay due to the employee.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr> run</h4>

<p>For example, total Organisation payroll of [£X] with explanatory figures linking this to respective documents. As with payroll above, notes should be added to documents to demonstrate links between them. Supporting calculations where <abbr title="National Insurance">NI</abbr> is paid on a different <abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr> run should be included and a note provided making the link. Wherever possible the amount claimed should be highlighted in a <abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr> build up and included within the evidence.</p>

<h4>Bank statement</h4>

<p>For example, defrayal of costs from the Bank Account. The figure being defrayed should match that of the <abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr> run. If the Bank Statement figures do not match <abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr> an explanation of the difference should be included with backup documentation and calculations to demonstrate the Bank Statement figure.</p>

<h4>National Insurance</h4>

<p>If organisations pay their <abbr title="National Insurance">NI</abbr> and pension contributions monthly, it can be automatically accepted that these will be paid and that the relevant defrayal date is the date the payroll is paid. This approach is used for Article 125 testing.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span>Annex 5: Common claim errors</h2>

<p>Based on the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme claims received to-date, the following are good practices recommended for all Grant Recipients, including <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr>, to avoid queries and support the submission of admissible, ‘right first time’ claims.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.1 </span>Transaction list</h3>

<p>1.Descriptions of expenditure in Transaction Lists should be sufficiently detailed to enable the Managing Authority to immediately understand what exactly the expenditure is so that it can be readily checked and confirmed as eligible. Descriptions should not include abbreviations or jargon which the Managing Authority may not understand.</p>

<p>2.Where ‘Other Direct Costs’ are directly related to a specific participant (for example, childcare costs, travel costs), the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> must include the participant unique identifier from the Participant Data Schema in the expenditure description in the Transaction List, to allow the Managing Authority to attribute the costs to a valid participant.  Actual participant names must not be included in the Transaction List or Participant Data Schema.</p>

<p>3.Where applicable, a clear description of the apportionment between Categories of Regions, Investment Priorities, <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> &amp; Match and (if applicable) <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr>, should be noted in the Apportionment Details column, so the Managing Authority can understand how, from the total invoice value, the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> has arrived at the total eligible amount.</p>

<p>4.The total invoice value must EXCLUDE <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.2 </span>Dual Forecast and Submission Form</h3>

<p>1.Ensure you are using the correct, latest version as published on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-claim-applications-and-self-declared-adjustments">GOV.UK</a> – as per the latest version, each project should be reporting ‘Actuals’ and ‘Contracted Amounts’ for expenditure, outputs and results.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.3 </span>Participant Data Schema</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure you are using the correct, latest version as published on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-claim-applications-and-self-declared-adjustments">GOV.UK</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the participant data has been added via the relevant drop down boxes, and the export sheet has been created, DO NOT overtype any of the information in the Participant Data Schema, before uploading it to <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> – this will risk validation errors and or may result in the wrong <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> being reported for your project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Report all participant-related <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> output and results in a single Participant Data Schema for each quarterly claim. This will support accurate sampling for desk-based checks, speeding the claims approval and payment process.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span>Annex 6: Output and Results Scenarios</h2>

<h4>Scenario 1 – Participant starts <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> intervention and all data is complete at point of starting.</h4>

<p>In this scenario, any appropriate Programme Specific and Common Output indicators are captured at the point the starting information is declared on the Participant Data Schema (<abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr>) to the Managing Authority (<abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>). See illustrated example below</p>

<p>Guidance:</p>

<p>Section 3.1.1 page 10 of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Monitoring and Evaluation guidance refers: 
(https://ec.europa.eu/sfc/en/system/files/ged/<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>%20monitoring%20and%20evaluation%20guidance.pdf)</p>

<p>In order to fulfil the data completeness requirement, data on participants shall be complete with regard to all common output indicators covering personal non-sensitive data: Gender, employment status, age, education level, and household situation.</p>

<h4>Scenario 2 – Participant starts <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> intervention and all data is complete at point of starting, then participant leaves <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> intervention and all data is complete at point of leaving.</h4>

<p>In this scenario, any appropriate Programme Specific and Common Output indicators are captured at the point the starting information is declared on the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>. Any appropriate Programme Specific and Common Result indicators are captured at the point the leaving information is declared on the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>. See illustrated example below</p>

<p>Guidance:</p>

<p>(Section 3.4.1 page 18 <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Monitoring and Evaluation guidance refers: (Data Recording and Storage)</p>

<p>The individual participants’ data for all person-related indicators must be recorded and stored in a way that allows a Member State to perform the tasks it is legally required to perform. Therefore, all records should include, as a minimum: an identifier for the operation/project; a personal identifier that allows an individual to be traced and re-contacted; dates of starting and leaving an operation; and access to values for all variables needed for indicators.</p>

<h4>Scenario 1 &amp; 2 Example:</h4>

<p>A participant joins a single project within an operation, completes the planned activity and leaves.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/115898/Claims_Guidance_single_project.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>In the scenario above a participant joins a single project within an operation, completes the planned activity and leaves.</p>

<p>In the first stage the participant is interviewed and referred to a 3 month training scheme.  The Output indicators on entry, refer to their situation on entry to the operation, which is their situation on the first day of training.</p>

<p>All information collected at interview and the referral point must be verified.</p>

<p>The participant then undertakes 3 months training.</p>

<p>Intermediate result indicators refer to the participant’s situation at point of exit from the operation (in this case the leaving date), or within 4 weeks after.</p>

<h4>Scenario 3 – Participant starts <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> intervention and all data is complete at point of starting, then leaves intervention early and leaving data is complete.</h4>

<p>In this scenario, any appropriate Programme Specific and Common Output indicators are captured at the point the starting information is declared on the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>. Any appropriate Programme Specific and Common Result indicators are captured at the point the leaving information is declared on the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Scenario 3 Example:</p>

<p>A participant joins a single project with an operation but does not complete the planned activity and therefore leaves earlier than expected.  The leaving date, and therefore the point to which immediate results indicators should apply, is always the date that the participant leaves the operation and not the planned exit date.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/116559/Claims_Guidance_not_complete.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>In the scenario above, a participant is interviewed and then referred to training.</p>

<p>In the first stage the participant is interviewed and referred a 3 months training scheme. The Output indicators on entry, refer to their situation on entry to the operation. So in this scenario it is their situation on the first day of the training scheme. 
All information collected at interview and the referral point must be verified.</p>

<p>The participant joins a single project which in this case is planned as a 3 months training scheme. However, in this scenario they do not complete the planned activity as they leave at the end of month 2, 1 month earlier than expected.</p>

<p>The immediate results indicators, refers to situation on exit from the operation. So their actual leaving date, is always the date that the participant leaves the operation and not the planned exit date. The outcome can be reported, or updated should it change, within 4 weeks of the date of leaving.</p>

<p>Note for Youth Employment Initiative (<abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr>) supported operations, information about whether a participant completes the intervention or not is important for some of the <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr> indicators (see section 5.10.1).</p>

<p>Note for Youth Employment Initiative (<abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr>) supported operations, information about whether a participant completes the intervention or not is important for some of the <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr> indicators (see section 5.10.1).</p>

<p>Immediate result indictors refer to situations on exit from the operation for instance the leaving date or within 4 weeks of that date even if the exit is earlier than planned.</p>

<p>Guidance:</p>

<p>European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Annex D – Practical Guidance on data collection and validation refers: (https://ec.europa.eu/sfc/en/system/files/ged/Annex D - Practical guidance on data collection and validation.pdf)</p>

<h4>Scenario 4 – Participant starts <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> intervention and all data is complete at point of starting, then leaves intervention early and leaving data is incomplete.</h4>

<p>In this scenario, any appropriate Programme Specific and Common Output indicators are captured at the point the starting information is declared on the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>. No Programme Specific or Common Result data can be captured as the leaving data is incomplete.</p>

<p>Note: Incomplete leaving data could include date of leaving. It is important that projects have a policy in place to establish an appropriate leaving date, for participants who leave their intervention early. For example, a participant does not attend a planned intervention and the project is unable to contact them. The project has a policy that provides for 2 planned interventions to be missed without contact. If the participant fails to attend the second intervention, the project will record the participant as a leaver.</p>

<h4>Scenario 5 – Participant starts <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> intervention and data is incomplete at point of starting.</h4>

<p>In this scenario, the participant will not count towards any Programme Specific or Common Output indicators.</p>

<p>Note: Participants falling into this category must still be declared to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> on the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr>. The <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> is required to provide a count of incomplete records to the European Commission (<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>).</p>

<p>Guidance:
Section 3.1.1 page 10 of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Monitoring and Evaluation guidance refers:</p>

<p>There is no single common indicator in SFC capturing the grand total number of participants (including those for which the common output indicators covering personal non-sensitive data could not be collected). Nevertheless, this grand total number of participants shall be reported by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> in the framework of the <abbr title="Annual Implementation Reports">AIRs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Section 2.3.7 of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Annex D – Practical Guidance on data collection and validation refers: Grand total of participants;</p>

<p>The “grand total of participants” covers all supported participants, including those for which the basic data (i.e. the common output indicators covering personal non-sensitive data) could not be collected or are incomplete. This total should be reported in the last row of Table 4A of the <abbr title="Annual Information Report">AIR</abbr> (see section 3.1.1 of the European Commission (<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>) Guidance document on Monitoring and Evaluation).</p>

<h4>Scenario 6 – Participant returns to an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> operation, after previously participating in an intervention within the same operation.</h4>

<p>In this scenario, any previous results relating to this participant are no longer valid. It is only possible to record the results relevant to the latest intervention.</p>

<h4>Example 6</h4>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/116560/Claims_Guidance_participant_returns.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>In the scenario above a participant is interviewed and then referred to training.</p>

<p>In the first stage the participant is interviewed and referred to language training. The Output indicators on entry, refer to their situation on entry to the operation, which is their situation on the first day of language training. 
All information collected at interview and the referral point must be verified.</p>

<p>After 2 months the participant leaves the language training for 1 month’s employment.  The date the participant left the language training is their original exit date.</p>

<p>When their one month’s employment finishes the participant re-enters an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> operation. On re-entry, their original Output indicators on entry, will be held. This is correct. 
It is only possible to record the results relevant to this latest intervention. So, in this scenario, any previous results relating to this participant are no longer valid. Their existing leaving date and associated immediate result data must be removed.</p>

<p>The participant then undertakes Skills Training and Further language training
Leaving date.</p>

<p>Record new leaving date (the date of last exit from the operation) and corresponding immediate result data when the participant leaves this latest intervention.</p>
