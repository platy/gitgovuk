<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guidance should be read in conjunction with the terms and conditions set out in your European Social Fund (<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>) Memorandum of Understanding (<abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> including your approved Co-financing Organisation (<abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr>) final Full Application for European Structural Investment Fund (<abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr>) funding. These documents set out the eligible parameters, scope of activities and the key deliverables that are to be reported to the Managing Authority (<abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>).<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup></p>

<p>For a <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> to report on delivery and draw down <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Grant Funding in line with the terms and conditions set out in their <abbr title="European Social Fund Memorandum Of Understanding">ESF MOU</abbr>, an application for reimbursement ‘Grant Claim’ must be made.</p>

<p>All Claims should be submitted via Electronic Claims and Information Management System (<abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>). Secure access to <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> will be arranged for staff within the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> Claims Team who have the relevant authority to act as Authorised Signatories and, or a named authoriser for each claim.</p>

<p>Before any payments can be processed the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> must have completed and returned a fully accurate ‘Bank Details Form’ to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>. A blank form will be sent to the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> with their new <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> and once accurately completed and returned, this will allow the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> to enable actual payment.</p>

<p>A Project Inception Visit (<abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIV</abbr>) must also have taken place prior to submission of the first claim(s) for any new <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>(s) and, following this visit, the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> will have confirmed in writing, usually via email, that the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> is invited to submit their first financial claims. For <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr>, a single <abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIV</abbr> may cover one or more projects or MOUs.</p>

<p>All pre-grant payment conditions stated in the <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> must be met prior to the first instalment and subsequent grant payments.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> must ensure from the outset that robust and suitable systems and processes are in place locally in order to maintain adequate audit trails and manage information effectively and efficiently. All project information must be retained and made available for verification or any audit throughout delivery and post completion under the retention of documentation requirements in accordance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-structural-and-investment-funds-document-retention">European Social Fund document retention guidance</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-eligibility-documents/esf-national-eligibility-rules-and-programme-guidance"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> National Eligibility Rules and Programme Guidance.</a></p>

<p>Unless agreed otherwise with the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>, the first submitted claim should include all spend or activity undertaken on the project up to and including the current Claim Instalment Period. The <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> must ensure that any expenditure included in the first claim meets the relevant defrayal rules set out in this guidance.</p>

<p>All applicable Claim periods prior to the initial Claim Period must be completed as ‘Nil Claims’ on <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> by the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr>. Progress Reports will not be required for the initial ‘Nil Claims’ periods but will be required for all subsequent claim periods.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Contract Manager (<abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr>) will contact you regarding the Final Claim process up to 6 months prior to any final Claim.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>For the purposes of this guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> is the agreement between the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> or <abbr title="Intermediate Body">IB</abbr> and the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contract is the agreement between the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> and their lead provider or grantee (Grant Recipient)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Please also see the glossary at <a class="govuk-link" href="#four">Annex 4</a> in this guide.</p>

<h2>Timing</h2>

<p>Claims must be submitted to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> in arrears, via <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>, reporting on a pre-defined period of actual activity. This is referred to as the ‘Claim Instalment Period’.</p>

<p>Claim Instalment Periods are based on calendar quarters as detailed below:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>quarter 1, 1 January – 31 March</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>quarter 2, 1 April – 30 June</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>quarter 3, 1 July – 30 September</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>quarter 4, 1 October – 31 December</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Claims are determined by the Claims Schedule set out in the <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>. Claims (including ‘Nil Claims’) should be started in chronological order; <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr> cannot start a new Claim on <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> until a Claim for the previous Claim Period has been started.</p>

<p>Claims are to be submitted for each <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>, via <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>, within 60 calendar days of the end of the preceding Claim Instalment Period.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> will aim to finalise payment into the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr>’s nominated Bank Account within 30 working days from the point at which all claim information is agreed by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> as correct and complete for example, there are no outstanding issues, actions or concerns that could potentially lead to an Irregularity.</p>

<h3>Late or missing claims</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> must notify the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> promptly if at any time they become aware that they are unable to make a Grant Claim in accordance with the outlined timescales or in accordance with the expenditure profile.</p>

<p>In cases where there has still been no claim submission, the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> may take the opportunity to remind you that under section 10.1 of your <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> may withhold any or all of the payments and, or</li>
  <li>require part or all of the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> to be repaid if it is reasonably considered that that the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> is failing to retain information and</li>
  <li>provide information requested by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>, the Certifying Authority (<abbr title="Certifying Authority">CA</abbr>), the European Commission (<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>), the European Court of Auditors, or the Audit Authority</li>
</ul>

<p>For this reason, the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> should ensure prompt submission of Claims in line with the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> Claim Schedule.</p>

<p>Where a <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> Project is covered by a Funding Agreement (<abbr title="Funding Agreement">FA</abbr>), rather than an <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>, under the terms and conditions set out in their <abbr title="Funding Agreement">FA</abbr>, failure to submit claims within their contractual timescales may be an event of default and could therefore lead to the Department enacting its rights to suspend, reduce or cease to make payments in respect of the relevant <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project.</p>

<p>If a Claim is not submitted in line with the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> <abbr title="Funding Agreement">FA</abbr> Claim Schedule, the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> will provide at least one email prompt to the Grant Recipient (<abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr>). If a claim is still not forthcoming, the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> will consider whether ‘Event of Default’ action is appropriate.</p>

<h2>Claim process</h2>

<p>The Claim process is an integral part of the contract management and control environment employed by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> in managing the Programme. Although Claims are a mechanism for <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr> to draw down their <abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> Grant it also provides key information on <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> progress and performance.</p>

<p>The information provided enables the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> to obtain assurances and carry out Article 125 Desk-Based Evidence Checks (<abbr title="Desk Based Evidence Check">DBEC</abbr>) and ‘On-the-Spot’ Visits (<abbr title="On the Spot Visit">OTSV</abbr>) to determine the validity of the activities currently undertaken, for the on-going project delivery and these will take place outside of the Claims process.</p>

<p>All claims should be submitted to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> via <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>. The following documentation should be uploaded as supporting documentation, unless the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> has agreed any specific, alternative arrangements with the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> for a given claim or claim period.</p>

<p>Such arrangements must be documented in writing and will be retained by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> as part of the audit trail for any affected claims:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Transaction List</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Participant Data Schema (not application to Investment Priority (<abbr title="Investment Priority">IP</abbr>) 2.2 and Priority Axis 3 outputs or results)</li>
  <li>IP2.2 project need to submit a completed the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-claim-applications-and-self-declared-adjustments">IP2.2 Claim Form</a> on GOV.UK</li>
</ul>

<p>Each project must also submit a detailed narrative Progress Report with their quarterly claim. The Progress Report information should be recorded directly into the relevant screen(s) and fields in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Subject to agreement with their <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> a project may be allowed to provide their report via a separate document which must then be uploaded into <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>.</p>

<p>However, you should note that you will still need to work through the Progress Report screens in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> in these circumstances before attaching your narrative report otherwise <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> will not allow submission of your claim.</p>

<p><abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr> must ensure all required Progress Report sections or topics as set out in the <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> Progress Report screens are fully covered.</p>

<p>This is regardless of whether the progress report is</p>

<ul>
  <li>fully input direct to <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>input to <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> with a separate uploading supporting document</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow this link to the section covering the <a class="govuk-link" href="#progress"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Progress Report</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr> who are delivering activities under IP2.2 must report progress against their Output and Result profiles in both the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-claim-applications-and-self-declared-adjustments">IP2.2 Claim Form</a> and the Progress Report. The Progress Report should include numerical performance against profiles, as well as any specific narrative progress update.</p>

<p>As part of the <abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIV</abbr> process, <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr> should have already identified staff to perform the ‘Claim Editor’ role in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> – bearing in mind that financial claims can only be generated and submitted in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> by individuals who have been assigned the ‘Claim Editor’ user role, including uploading of any supporting documents.</p>

<p><abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr> must ensure that the final compiled claim is checked by a ‘Claim Reviewer’ in their organisation prior to submission of the claim via <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>. The ‘Claim Reviewer’ must be a named individual who has been agreed as a ‘Named Authoriser’ (for example, an authorised <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> External user) between the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> and <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>. The ‘Claim Reviewer’ must be a different person to the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> User who is recorded as “Submitting” the claim to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> – the name of the person submitting the claim can be found in the ‘Activity Log’ of the ‘Manage Claims’ menu in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>.</p>

<p>If a <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> submits a claim without ‘Claim Reviewer’ action recorded in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>, or if the ‘Claim Reviewer’ is not a recognised ‘Named Authoriser’ for the project, the claim will be rejected by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> and returned to the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> for remedial action.</p>

<p>Claims are to be submitted in arrears for each Instalment Period and only eligible expenditure defrayed (incurred and ‘paid’, for example, cleared bank account) by the end of that period can be included in the Claim for reimbursement. By exception, any expenditure for previous periods can also be included, as long as this has not already been included in another Claim and a statement has been included in the expenditure description field confirming this.</p>

<p>At the point each Claim is submitted to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> on <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>, the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> must notify their <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> via email, to ensure timely action can be completed to check the information provided and authorise and approve the resulting payment.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> must notify the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> promptly if at any time it becomes aware that it is unable to make a Grant Claim in accordance with the outlined timescales or in accordance with the expenditure profile.</p>

<p>In the event that no expenditure has been defrayed during the Instalment Period, a ‘Nil Claim’ must still be submitted. Once a Project has been invited by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> to make their first financial Claim, all Claims thereafter – including ‘Nil Claims’ must include a Progress Report.</p>

<p>If at any stage the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> identifies any mistakes or omissions in any of its Claims, whether paid or in the process of being paid, they must contact their <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Where clerical and or technical errors are identified on Claims that have already been paid, GRs will need to contact their <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Financial information</h2>

<p>This section aims to guide you through the key areas to check when collating the detail for your Claim.</p>

<p><abbr title="European Social Fund Co-Financing Organisation">ESF CFO</abbr> Admin costs can be submitted as a single entry line but must adhere to all other relevant stipulations listed below. If requested by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> or <abbr title="Intermediate Body">IB</abbr>, an itemised list will need to be provided for the purposes of Annual Monitoring and Audit Verification.</p>

<p>All expenditure which is to be claimed must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>fall within the agreed scope of activities outlined in the <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> and the agreed expenditure categories. Since the application stage, the Cost Category headings have been aligned with the <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> system to allow a smooth transition to the IT service. Please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="#reconciliation">Cost Category Reconciliation</a> below to ensure the correct Cost Category headings are used</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be at Contract or <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> level – whichever is more granular or detailed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>conform to all respects of the eligibility criteria as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-structural-and-investment-funds-eligibility-documents"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> National Eligibility Rules and Programme Guidance.</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be defrayed (incurred and ‘paid’, for example, and have cleared bank account) by the end date of the Claim Instalment Period. The date paid is the date the payment appears on your bank statement. For large organisations, the Bankers Automated Clearing Services (<abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr>) defrayal date may be acceptable, this should be discussed with the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>only include Irrecoverable Value Added Tax (<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>) if this has been agreed as an eligible cost with the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> during the Full Appraisal process</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be able to be backed up by a full audit trail containing all original source documentation from receipted invoices to bank statements and accounting documents of equivalent verifiable value. These need to be maintained and made available for Article 125 ‘On-the-Spot’ checks and audits and must be retained in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-structural-and-investment-funds-document-retention">European Social Fund document retention guidance</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-structural-and-investment-funds-eligibility-documents"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> National Eligibility Rules and ProgrammeGuidance.</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Transactions List</h2>

<p>A Transaction List, itemising each type of expenditure (<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> or Match), must be uploaded directly into <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> to support each Claim. This Transaction List must provide the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>, or any other audit body, with clear detail relating to all the costs being claimed. It is important that this information is entered accurately and provides a clear description of the costs to enable the reader to determine their eligibility. The use of acronyms and jargon should be avoided to aid clarity to the reader.</p>

<p>Note: <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr> may show salaries as a single line, but full and complete records must be kept by the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> for each individual within this Claim for Audit purposes - this will be tested annually as part of the Verification Cycle.</p>

<p>The Transaction List spreadsheet contains three tabs entitled ‘Guidance’, ‘Transactions’ and ‘Summary’. The Transaction List is designed to enable upload to <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>.</p>

<p>It is strongly recommended that you read the ‘Guidance’ tab thoroughly before attempting to work through the Setup and populate the ‘Transactions’ tab. If at any time you are unsure of the level of detail required after checking with guidance, please check with your <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> before uploading.</p>

<p>Unless agreed otherwise with the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>, the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> should separate their lines of expenditure between</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Admin Costs</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> – Contract Costs and</li>
  <li>Match – Contract Costs</li>
</ul>

<p>A separate document detailing the expenditure relating to each contract should be provided on request to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Verification Team.</p>

<p>In the case of the The National Lottery Community Fund (<abbr title="The National Lottery Community Fund">TNLCF</abbr>), as their delivery model uses cash match, they must only use the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Admin Costs and <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> – Contract Costs headings.</p>

<p>The details required when completing the Transaction List screen in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> are explained below along with descriptions on whether these are mandatory <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> fields, and what they are validated against.</p>

<p>The details required when completing the Transaction List screen in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> are explained below along with descriptions on whether these are mandatory <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> fields, and what they are validated against.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>a) the fields labelled as mandatory below are those which will automatically be validated by <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> and if they are not completed accurately, the Claim will be rejected</p>

<p>b) for data collection purposes all fields must be completed where possible regardless of whether they are labelled as mandatory or not</p>

<p>c) all monetary figures must be to 2 decimal places; .005 and above, rounded to .01; .004 and below, rounded to .00</p>

<p>d) dates should be added in with slashes DD/MM/YYYY as <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> will not accept full-stops - and will automatically change to YYYY-MM-DD when the ‘Export’ button is pressed</p>

<p>Once the Transaction List has been completed the ‘Export’ button will need to be activated prior to submission to <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>. This button creates a spreadsheet without macros or any other formatting, so it is in a format that <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> can accept.</p>

<p>For instructions on uploading the Transaction List please follow this link to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-claim-applications-and-self-declared-adjustments"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>

<h4>Cost category</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) Select the eligible cost as agreed and set out in your <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>. The headings you must select from are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> – <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> Admin</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> – Contract Costs</li>
  <li>Match – Contract Costs</li>
</ul>

<p>Other cost categories in the Transaction List are not applicable to <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr> and should not be used.</p>

<p>If the Cost Categories in your <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> pre-date the implementation of the new <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> cost categories above, you will need to select the relevant cost category on the Transaction List using the mapping below.</p>

<h4>Delivery Partner</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) If your project has Delivery Partners, you must insert the Identification (<abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr>) number applicable to that Delivery Partner in column C of the Transaction List. You must record this value in Column C against all transaction lines relating to that partner. If your project has no delivery partners, please enter a ‘0’ into column C on each transaction line.</p>

<p>You can find the correct <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> number for each of your Delivery Partners in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> by visiting the Full Application option from the left-hand menu on your project screen in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> and scrolling down to the Delivery Partner table.</p>

<p>If you have an existing Delivery Partner and their information is not recorded in the Delivery Partner table in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>, you will need to add their information to the table before you can include them in your financial claim.</p>

<p>If you have a new Delivery Partner and their information is not recorded in the Delivery Partner table in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>, you will need to add their information to the table before you can include them in your financial claim. If you have a new Delivery Partner, you must submit a Project Change Request (<abbr title="Project Change Request">PCR</abbr>) to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> first for approval before including them in the Delivery Partner table and any Financial Claims.</p>

<h4>Priority Axis</h4>

<p>(Mandatory – this must align with <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>) Select the applicable Priority Axis as agreed and specified in your grant <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Investment priority</h4>

<p>(Mandatory – this must align with <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>) Select the applicable Investment Priority as agreed and specified in your grant <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Procurement Contract <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr>
</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) If a transaction line is as a result of Procurement undertaken by your project, you should record the relevant Procurement Record <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> number in Column F in each case. The Procurement Record <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> number can be found in the Procurement Register for your <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project on <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>.</p>

<p>If the transaction line is not a result of procurement by your project, then please leave column F blank.</p>

<p>Lower-level procurement such as that found within <abbr title="The National Lottery Community Fund">TNLCF</abbr> Projects will be addressed on a case-by-case basis and will not routinely appear on the procurement register. <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> Leads will discuss these arrangements with the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> where necessary.</p>

<h4>Supplier name</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) Enter the name of supplier, creditor, payee or employee.</p>

<h4>Supplier Value Added Tax (<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>) number</h4>

<p>Enter the supplier <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> number.</p>

<h4>Invoice reference</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) this may be an Invoice, or receipt or reference number (created by the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> and must be auditable). All documents should be given a separate unique reference number to clearly identify the item of expenditure for audit purposes. See table below for further details.</p>

<h4>Invoice date</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) Date on the invoice or if salaries the date posted on your accounting system. Dates can be added in using slashes – as <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> will not accept full-stops - and will automatically change to YYYY-MM-DD when the ‘Export’ button is pressed.</p>

<h4>Defrayal date</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) Date the money was defrayed or paid (for example, the date the money left your bank account – as shown on your bank statement). (For large organisations, the <abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr> defrayal date maybe acceptable and should be discussed with the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>). Dates can be added in using slashes – as <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> will not accept full-stops - and will automatically change to YYYY-MM-DD when the ‘Export’ button is pressed.</p>

<p>If organisations pay their <abbr title="National Insurance">NI</abbr> and pension contributions monthly, it can be automatically accepted that these will be paid, and that the relevant defrayal date is the date the payroll is paid. This approach is used for Article 125 testing.</p>

<h4>Defrayal method</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) Select from the drop-down list the method of payment, for example, <abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr>, Cheque, Credit Card. See table below for further details.</p>

<h4>Defrayal reference</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) Enter payment reference relevant to transaction. If this is part of a <abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr> run this number will need to be created, unique and auditable. See below for further details.</p>

<p>Note: Additional narrative regarding other document dates, references and methods should be included in Comments.</p>

<h4>Expenditure description</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) Full description of the item of expenditure being claimed to ensure clarity for any reader on what is being included. Connections between defrayal, invoice dates and salary paid dates should be explained, for example, if they are the same date. Additionally, if an employee works full-time on <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>, include this in the description.</p>

<p>Note: If the expense relates to a participant, the unique participant identifier must be included within the expenditure description. This ensures that, if there are any issues with this participant on the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr>, it will be possible to identify and rectify any related expenditure where needed. The participant’s name must not be used.</p>

<h4>Apportionment details</h4>

<p>Indicate how the eligible value is derived from the original invoice or receipt value, for example, the method of apportionment, ineligible costs removed.</p>

<p>If a cost is apportioned between <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>, Match and, or Youth Employment Initiative (<abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr>), more than one Category of Region (<abbr title="Category of Region">CoR</abbr>) and, or more than one Investment Priority, you must include details here of how the cost has been apportioned in each case.</p>

<h4>Total Invoice Value (excluding <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>)</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) Indicate the total, Net of <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>, expenditure value of the invoice or receipt, (total documented value excluding <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>).</p>

<p>If a cost is apportioned between <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>, Match and or <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr>, more than one <abbr title="Category of Region">CoR</abbr> and or more than one Investment Priority (<abbr title="Investment Priority">IP</abbr>), the Total Invoice Value must still be completed with the actual, total overall amount of the invoice. The ‘Total Eligible Value’ field will then be the place where you will need to record the actual expenditure amount to be claimed after any apportionment has been taken into account.</p>

<h4>Total Irrecoverable <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>
</h4>

<p>State the Irrecoverable <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> value which cannot be recovered from another source Her Majesty’s Revenue Custom (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) of the invoice or receipt following any adjustments for apportionments or ineligible costs.</p>

<p>Note: if you are <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> registered and are able to recover <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> but are choosing not to do so, these costs still cannot be included in your claim.</p>

<p>Only record irrecoverable <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> in this field if you are claiming it back through <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Total Eligible Value</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) Enter the project eligible expenditure amount after any apportionment or adjustments have been applied and Irrecoverable <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> added in. This is the expenditure value minus adjustments for which <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> is being claimed against.</p>

<h4>Eligible for Flat Rate Indirect Costs</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) Select ‘No’ from drop-down menu - These are NOT applicable to <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr>, so ‘No’ should be used here.</p>

<h4>Total Category of Region Expenditure</h4>

<p>(Mandatory – only relevant if Claim covers more than one <abbr title="Category of Region">CoR</abbr>.)  If you have only one <abbr title="Category of Region">CoR</abbr> you do not need to enter data into cells T, U and V.</p>

<p>Note:  If you have more than one <abbr title="Category of Region">CoR</abbr> and your <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> or Funding Agreement was agreed prior to 09/03/17, you will need to contact your <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> to obtain this information</p>

<h2>Descriptions of Defrayed Expenditure</h2>

<p>The item for which funding is being claimed must have a clear description. The description must be detailed enough to allow the reader to consider its validity without the need to see the actual evidence at this stage.</p>

<p>The table below provides guidance on acceptable/unacceptable expenditure descriptions and level of detail required.</p>

<p>Please note that this is for illustrative purposes only and it is not an exhaustive list:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Unacceptable Description</td>
      <td>Acceptable Description</td>

      <td>Salary for [state at least one of name, post, payroll number] for period dd/mm/yy to dd/mm/yy. The description should also include whether the staff member is working all or part of their time on the project. If working part of their time, the description must include the number of hours worked and the hourly rate or ‘Fixed Percentage’ figure used so the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> can see how the total amount being claimed for that individual has been determined.</td>
    </tr>

<p>Follow this link to <a class="govuk-link" href="#Annex2">Annex 2</a> which provides a help sheet for invoice transactions and this link to <a class="govuk-link" href="#Annex3">Annex 3</a>which provides a help sheet for salary transactions. These are broad guides only for information required at ‘On-the-Spot’ Visits (<abbr title="On the Spot Visit">OTSV</abbr>) and not for submission with the Claim.</p>

<h4>Credit notes</h4>

<p>Where your project receives a credit note from a partner or supplier, but that expenditure has already been included and paid in a previous <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> claim, you should raise a Self-Declared Adjustment (<abbr title="Self Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr>) for the full value of the credit note.</p>

<p>If you then incur further costs with the same supplier or partner against your Project and want to use the credit note as payment or part-payment of those costs you should complete the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>record the full value of the new expenditure or invoice in your Transaction List</li>
  <li>ensure the description of the transaction explains how much of the invoice or expenditure is being paid via  credit note</li>
  <li>ensure you retain a copy of the credit note, and evidence of the supplier or partner acceptance of the credit note as payment or part-payment as evidence of defrayal</li>
  <li>if requested as part of the Desk-Based Evidence Checks (<abbr title="Desk Based Evidence Checks">DBECs</abbr>), <abbr title="On the Spot Visit">OTSV</abbr> visit or Audit Authority checks, you will need to provide the credit note as evidence of defrayal</li>
</ol>

<p>If your Project received a credit note from a partner or supplier for expenditure which has not yet been included in an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> claim, the amount of any expenditure being claimed from the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> against that supplier or partner for the activities covered by the credit note should be reduced by the value of the credit note. This is because expenditure covered by a credit note is not ‘defrayed’ until the credit note has been spent with the relevant partner or supplier.</p>

<h3>Internal Cost Transfers</h3>

<p>If your organisation uses Internal Cost Transfers as part of your payment processes for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> costs, you should be aware that evidence of the Internal Cost Transfer itself is not sufficient evidence of defrayal of those <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project costs.</p>

<p>Where an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project is operating as a separate entity within a wider organisation (for example an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project within a Local Authority) and the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project pays an additional direct cost to the wider organisation via internal cost transfer, there must be a process in place and a clear audit trail showing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the transfer of funds between the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project and the wider organisation receiving those funds, and</li>
  <li>evidence of the same, actual costs being incurred for example defrayed by the wider organisation who is receiving payment from the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project to a third party</li>
</ul>

<p>If the payment is made by an internal cost transfer and there is no supporting evidence as outlined above, the evidence of the internal cost transfer alone is not sufficient evidence of defrayal, and any expenditure should be removed from the claim unless the required defrayal evidence can be provided.</p>

<p>An example of a compliant audit trail for internal cost transfers could be as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>evidence of an invoice or request for payment from a parent organisation to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project, setting out the specific, direct costs to be paid by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project and what services or goods have been provided by the parent organisation to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project</li>
  <li>evidence of the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project transferring the relevant direct costs amount to the parent organisation. For example a financial journal entry, or a cost centre transfer record</li>
  <li>evidence of the direct, actual costs incurred by the parent organisation and evidence they have defrayed those costs, as a result of the goods or services provided to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project for example, relevant bank statements, or evidence of a <abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr> run</li>
</ul>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project should only claim costs from the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> which have been incurred by the parent or other organisation. This guidance above is not exhaustive and, depending on the complexity of the internal cost transfer arrangements, the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> may request other documentation in support of any transactions where internal cost transfers are part of the payment process. This is to ensure there is sufficient documentary evidence for each step from initial payment by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project to defrayal.</p>

<h2>Participant Data Schema (<abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>Output and Result targets are key performance indicators for <abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> programmes. Every project justifies the level of investment requested from <abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> by agreeing to achieve a number of programme defined outputs and result targets. These targets are scoped and referenced in the application for <abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> funding which is appraised by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> and form an important part of the <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> or <abbr title="Funding Agreement">FA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Before submitting any output or results data to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>, the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> must ensure they have a full audit trail containing all original source documentation for each output and result being reported. This must be in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-eligibility-documents/esf-data-evidence-requirements-eligibility-and-results"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Data Evidence Requirements - Eligibility and Results</a> published on GOV.UK. This audit trail must be maintained and made available for verification checks and audits and must be retained in accordance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-document-retention/european-social-fund-document-retention-guidance">European Social Fund document retention guidance</a>  and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-eligibility-documents/esf-national-eligibility-rules-and-programme-guidance"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> National Eligibility Rules and Programme Guidance</a>.</p>

<p>With the exception of <abbr title="Investment Priority">IP</abbr> 2.2 and Priority Axis 3 (Technical Assistance) deliverables, all outputs and results to be claimed for during the respective Claim Period should be recorded and submitted to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> using the Participant Data Schema (<abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr>) form. It is good practice to submit a single <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> with each claim – however, if you have a significant number of lines to report for example, 5,000 or over, you may discuss with your <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> whether by exception you can submit more than one <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> for a given claim period by exception. Progress against IP2.2 and Priority Axis 3 outputs and results must be reported as part of the project Progress Report.</p>

<p>IP2.2 deliverables must be reported on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-claim-applications-and-self-declared-adjustments">IP2.2 Claim Form</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>As stated in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-claim-applications-and-self-declared-adjustments">Participant Data Schema Guidance</a> participant identifiers are how the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> track participants and their progress. Each participant must have a unique and persistent identifier number.</p>

<p>European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) data protection regulations require that no unnecessary identifying or personal data is collected about the participant. Additionally the guidance on the Data Protection Act sets out that consideration should be given to not only the identifying potential of individual items of data but the impact of the total data collected. Participant <abbr title="Identifications">IDs</abbr> should not be based on any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>participant’s first names</li>
  <li>participant’s surnames</li>
  <li>participant’s full address</li>
</ul>

<p>Importantly as a beneficiary organisation you must be able to reconcile a Participant <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> to a single unique participant, for both audit purposes and participant survey selection. If a participant is selected for a follow up survey, the evaluation team will contact you to request the participant contact details which will be held and processed in a separate system with greater security.</p>

<p>The Participant <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> should contain a unique prefix signifier relating to the organisation, submitting the data, and contain a maximum 22 characters, including the prefix signifier.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#Annex6">Annex 6</a> of this guidance includes examples of a range of scenarios which may occur in delivery of an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> product and how these impact on the reporting of associated outputs and results. GRs should ensure they take account of these scenarios when completing their <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> each quarter.</p>

<p>Once the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> has been completed and the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> is content that all data in the schema is correct, the ‘Create Export Sheet’ button must be pressed prior to uploading the document into <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>. This creates a spreadsheet which is in a format that <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> can accept i.e. without macros. For instructions on uploading of the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-claim-applications-and-self-declared-adjustments"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> External User Guidance</a></p>

<p>Follow this link to the latest version of the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> form, as well as full guidance on how to complete the form on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-claim-applications-and-self-declared-adjustments.">GOV.UK</a></p>

<h3>National level, Dual Forecast Form</h3>

<p>A National level, Dual Forecast and Submission Form should be completed by the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> and submitted as a supporting document with each claim. Your <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> will discuss this with you if applicable.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> should email or upload the National level, Dual Forecast and Submission Form to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr></p>

<p>For Greater London Authority (GLA), <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr> should submit a GLA level Dual Forecast Form to their GLA contact via email.</p>

<h2>Procurement</h2>

<p>All new procurement exercises, already undertaken or yet to be undertaken must be recorded in the Procurement Register in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>.</p>

<p>The first recorded exercise will be automatically allocated a Procurement Record <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> 1, any additional or subsequent procurement exercises added to the register will be allocated a sequential Procurement Record <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> of 2,3 or 4.</p>

<p>Reference to any completed procurement exercises as well as any planned future procurements should be included in the Procurement’ section of your Progress Report, this includes any <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> procured contracts which are used as match funding.</p>

<p>Where a procurement exercise has already been completed, and has not been reviewed, or fully reviewed at appraisal or <abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIV</abbr> stage.</p>

<p>For example</p>

<ul>
  <li>the procurement exercise has been undertaken after the <abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIV</abbr> was finalised</li>
  <li>completed after the <abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIV</abbr> was finalised</li>
</ul>

<p>These will need to be reviewed at the Desk-Based Administrative Checks (<abbr title="Desk Based Administrative Checks">DBAC</abbr>) stage and an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Public Procurement Checklist may need to be completed.</p>

<p>The Checklist is not required where a Contracting Authority has carried out a procurement exercise where the value is below £24,999.99.</p>

<p>In such cases, the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> undertaking the <abbr title="Desk Based Administrative Checks">DBAC</abbr> will still carry out existing, relevant procurement checks to ensure the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> is aware of and adhering to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-structural-and-investment-funds-procurement-documents"><abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> National Procurement Requirements</a></p>

<p>Where the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Public Procurement Checklist is required, you will be asked to complete and return the checklist to the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr>, together with any specified Core Documents relating to that procurement exercise.</p>

<p>In all cases the supporting Core Documents and completed checklist should be uploaded into <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> via the Procurement Register.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Note: for <abbr title="The National Lottery Community Fund">TNLCF</abbr> it is essential that all procurement exercises are identified by adding the name in the procurement Title, for example Procurement of IT (Delivery Partner – Joe Bloggs Training).</li>
</ul>

<p>The ‘<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Public Procurement Checklist’ can be issued at any point in the <abbr title="Desk Based Administrative Checks">DBAC</abbr> process, however the review of any relevant procurement exercises must be finished before any costs from that procurement exercises are included in an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Claim.</p>

<p>Where you have completed more than one procurement exercise a separate checklist should be completed for each individual procurement exercise.</p>

<p>Where a single procurement exercise has resulted in the award of a number of individual contracts, a single <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Public Procurement Checklist can be completed.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> undertaking the procurement checks is unable to obtain sufficient assurance that a Procurement exercise has been undertaken compliantly, they will consider whether expenditure relating to that procurement exercise should be excluded from the current and any future claims for the given <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project, or whether a Financial Correction would be appropriate.</p>

<p>Depending on the seriousness of the issue</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> may also consider whether the <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> or <abbr title="Funding Agreement">FA</abbr> for that <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project should be terminated by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>it may also be necessary to consider whether other <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> MOUs or <abbr title="Funding Agreemens">FAs</abbr> linked to that procurement exercise should be terminated by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> has completed the relevant procurement checks, they will notify you of the outcome, including any impacts on current and, or future claims. The <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> will also update the Procurement Register in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> wto show that the procurement checks have been completed.</p>

<p>You must notify the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> of any instances where you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have decided not to progress with a planned procurement</li>
  <li>have withdrawn a contracted procurement</li>
  <li>will not be making purchases for the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project under a contracted procurement</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Progress Report</h2>

<p>A full and comprehensive narrative Progress Report must be completed and submitted to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> with each quarterly claim.</p>

<p>The Progress Report must be recorded directly into the relevant screens and fields in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>, unless the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> has a prior agreement from the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> that they can submit their report as a separate document, uploaded into <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> as part of the package of claims documentation.</p>

<p>You should note that you will still need to work through the Progress Report screens in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> in these circumstances before attaching your narrative report otherwise <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> will not allow submission of your claim.</p>

<p>Regardless of the completion method, the report must contain suitable commentary on the performance and progress of the project to date and the planned activity going forward.</p>

<p>This must</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide sufficient detail to demonstrate successful delivery of the activities and deliverables and</li>
  <li>include the measures being put in place to bring the project back on rack if there is any ‘slippage’ of performance</li>
</ul>

<p>The claim may be rejected on <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> if any of the information is incomplete or is considered insufficient or incorrect</p>

<p>Where it is deemed necessary, the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> may still request specified individual <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> or contract level Progress Reports to accompany the national report.</p>

<p>For the ‘Equal Opportunities’ section of the progress report, the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> should provide an update of progress in terms of promoting equality and equality performance. This should constitute a short, written narrative in the equal opportunities field of the report – the narrative should also cover progress against the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project specific Equality and Diversity Implementation Plan, including any achievements against targets within the Implementation Plan.</p>

<p>As a minimum, for the Equal Opportunities element of their Progress Report, the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> should provide an update on the following within their narrative:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any improvements</li>
  <li>updates</li>
  <li>amendments</li>
  <li>details of progress against profile in terms of any equality targets; and any</li>
  <li>under-performance identified, and the mitigating or correct action that will be taken</li>
</ul>

<p>That you have made during the claim instalment period in terms of the governance of the Equality and Diversity theme in your project.</p>

<p>As well as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any progress in achieving aims during the claim instalment period</li>
  <li>any progress in achieving objectives during the claim instalment period</li>
</ul>

<p>These should be set out in your Equality and Diversity policy or implementation plan and supporting evidence provided.</p>

<p>As a minimum, for the Sustainable Development section of your Progress Report, the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> should provide an update on the following within the narrative:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any improvements</li>
  <li>updates</li>
  <li>amendments</li>
</ul>

<p>That you have made during the claim instalment period in terms of the governance of the Sustainable Development theme in your project.</p>

<p>As well as</p>

<ul>
  <li>any progress in achieving aims during the claim instalment period</li>
  <li>any progress in achieving objectives during the claim instalment period</li>
</ul>

<p>These should be set out in your sustainable development policy or implementation plan and supporting evidence provided.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#Annex2">Annex 2</a> provides a help sheet for invoice transactions, and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Annex3">Annex 3</a> provides a help sheet for salary transactions. These are broad guidelines only.</p>

<h2>Article 125 checks</h2>
<p>Before the Claim is paid, the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> will undertake <abbr title="Desk Based Administrative Checks">DBAC</abbr> of all submitted documents to ensure all relevant information has been submitted.</p>

<p>There are two different types of Article 125 Defrayal Documentary Check:</p>

<h4><abbr title="Desk Based Evidence Checks">DBECs</abbr></h4>

<p>For <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr> these will be undertaken by the Verification Team, within a specified time window, post Claim payment.</p>

<p>This will involve a selection of both <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> and Match contract payments across all MOUs thereby giving each Claim payment an equal chance for selection.</p>

<ul>
  <li>evidence for the majority of <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr> will be required at individual learner level with its associated cost, supported by defrayal evidence</li>
  <li>there will be no Desk Based Checks for the Big Lottery Fund in favour of an increased number of ’On-the-Spot’ transaction line checks instead for selected providers</li>
</ul>

<h4>OTSVs</h4>

<p>For <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr> these will be undertaken by the Verification Team Post-Claim payment. Further guidance on the visits will be provided by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr></p>

<h2>Annex 1: Progress report</h2>

<h3>Progress</h3>

<p>If a single contract covers more than one Local Enterprise Partnership area, the Management Information must be separated respectively on submission of the Claim.</p>

<h3>Expenditure</h3>

<p>You should report on the performance of actual expenditure against the profiled values contained in the <abbr title="Funding Agreement">FA</abbr> or <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> and recorded on <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Information should include actual expenditure for the current claim period and cumulative achievement for previous claim periods.</p>

<p>Upload any internal Management Information (<abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr>) currently used to report progress to date against the deliverables within your project or use a separate document.</p>

<p>Expenditure must be broken down by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Investment Priority, and (where applicable)</li>
  <li>Category of Region</li>
</ul>

<p>Comments or separate documentation as referenced above must include future forecast figures, for example contracted expenditure profiles for remaining claim periods for every claim, this will support the <abbr title="Contract Managers">CMs</abbr> in reviewing the performance of each project.</p>

<p>Variances from the contracted profiled forecast, slippage, must be fully explained and justified within the Progress Report and submitted along with the claim.</p>

<p>You should explain whether the project is still on track and to budget, and expenditure ‘slippage’ must be explained and justified with plans outlined on how the ‘slippage’ will be addressed.</p>

<p>Any potential overspend in cost categories or a request to re-profile expenditure should be flagged up here.</p>

<p>Any actual underspend variance greater than 15% from the contracted expenditure profiles may result in de-commitment or withdrawal of <abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> funding in line with the underperformance policy.</p>

<p>Any anticipated variances should be discussed with your <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> as soon as possible, who will consider whether a <abbr title="Project Change Request">PCR</abbr> is required.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> will discuss this with you if applicable.</p>

<p>Where a <abbr title="Project Change Request">PCR</abbr> has recently been approved, if this changes the future, contracted expenditure profiles, but the amended figures have not yet been updated in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>, add a note to the Progress Report explaining why the reported figures do not match your current <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> expenditure profiles.</p>

<h3>Targets - Outputs, Results and Additional Targets</h3>

<p>You should report on the actual achievement of targets and future forecast compared to the profile outlined in the <abbr title="Funding Agreement">FA</abbr> or <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Information should include actual achievement for the current claim period and cumulative achievement for previous claim periods.</p>

<p>Upload any internal <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> currently used to report progress to date against the deliverables within your project or use a separate document.</p>

<p>Outputs and Results must be broken down by</p>

<ul>
  <li>Investment Priority</li>
</ul>

<p>and (where applicable)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Category of Region.</li>
</ul>

<p>This should include full and comprehensive information on actual performance against each individual Output and Result category for your project previous and current claim periods.</p>

<p>Variances from the contracted profiles, ‘slippage,’ must be fully explained and justified within the Progress Report and submitted along with the claim.</p>

<p>The contracted target levels for the remaining claim periods, is required with every claim to support <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> in reviewing the performance of each project.</p>

<p>Any actual under performance with a variance greater than 15% from the contracted targets may result in de-commitment or withdrawal of <abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> funding in line with underperformance policy.</p>

<p>Identify any specific issues encountered relating to measuring or evidencing the targets or take up of assistance from businesses.</p>

<p>If there is any slippage, provide detail on remedial measures being put in place to bring things back on track.
Any anticipated variances should be discussed with your <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> as soon as possible, who will consider whether a <abbr title="Project Change Request">PCR</abbr> is required.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> will discuss this with you if applicable.</p>

<p>Where a <abbr title="Project Change Request">PCR</abbr> has recently been approved, if this changes the future, contracted output and, or result profiles, but the amended figures have not yet been updated in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>, you should complete the Progress Report with the approved, revised <abbr title="Project Change Request">PCR</abbr> contracted figures to explain why the ‘figures do not match the <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> profiles.</p>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Match funding</h3>

<p>Report on the funding received during the Claim Instalment Period as well as the cumulative values received to-date. Any potential changes to the funding package should also be referred to.</p>

<h3>Milestones and future activity</h3>

<h4>Summary of planned activities for the next Claim Instalment Period</h4>

<p>An outline of the key activities planned for the next Claim Instalment Period including any key dates or events. If there is any future major activity planned beyond the next Instalment Period, you should provide an update in this section. You will also need to report against any slippage in the current claim period that may impact the delivery of your project.</p>

<h3>State Aid</h3>

<p>State Aid measures applicable to the project will have been identified at appraisal and will automatically feed through to the Claims Profile. Provide an update on State Aid received as a <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> and what State Aid has been dispersed to employer beneficiaries, including those relating to paid work placements and internships including those relating to paid work placements and internships.</p>

<p>Your progress report must include a narrative explaining what checks have been undertaken to ensure that the project is operating State Aid processes in line with your <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Funding Agreement">FA</abbr> and the following published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-state-aid/esf-guidance-on-state-aid">European Social Fund 2014 to 2020 State Aid Guidance</a>
Your narrative should also explain how you have ensured a complete set of State Aid evidence is being retained in line with the published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-document-retention/european-social-fund-document-retention-guidance"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Document Retention guidance.</a></p>

<p>You should also refer to the guidance issued in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/05821-change-to-state-aid-guidance-and-valuing-of-aid">Action Note 058/21</a> when considering the narrative for this section.</p>

<p>For Projects which have a state aid exemption your Progress Report should reflect the exemption applicable as per the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> or as a result of a <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> Variation. The only exemptions applicable to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>De Minimis</li>
  <li>45030 Aid for Disadvantaged Workers General Block Exemption (<abbr title="General Block Exemption Regulation">GBER</abbr>)</li>
  <li>45031 Training Aid (<abbr title="General Block Exemption Regulation">GBER</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>All other exemptions are not applicable to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme. A blank exemption is a permissible response if either state aid does not apply or there has been no use of the agreed exemption within the claim instalment period.</p>

<p>In addition, the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> must also ensure they have valued the aid appropriately and provided detail on the methodology used by the project. In the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> programme there are two methods permissible for valuing aid. Method 1 is the preferred approach and should be used by projects, and only where in exceptional cases should the Grant Recipient use Method 2.</p>

<p>Details on the methods are provided below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>method 1 relates to an average of the costs if that support was bought privately. Using this method, the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> will need to explain how they have calculated that average, for example through comparison of three other suppliers and calculating the average of the costs based on this information</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
  <li>method 2 relates to their real costs (such as the hourly rate of the member of staff who is providing the support, plus the 15 or 40% <abbr title="Flat Rate Indirect Costs">FRIC</abbr> attributed to that salary. The <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> should use the hourly rate applied to the member of staff undertaking the cost with an uplift of the appropriate <abbr title="Flat Rate Indirect Costs">FRIC</abbr> for the project by the number of hours to complete the task to identify the level of aid</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the only methods available for use. No other methodology proposed by GRs can be used</p>

<h4>Valuing Aid – worked examples</h4>

<p>Method 1</p>

<p>A <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> is providing a Small and Medium Enterprise (<abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr>) with a Training Needs Analysis (<abbr title="Training Needs Analysis">TNA</abbr>), and then developing a training plan for a group of the staff who work for the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr>.</p>

<p>In this case, the Grant Recipient takes an average of the costs 3 other providers would charge the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> for this activity, so, for example.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Joe Bloggs Training Ltd would charge £1,500 for a <abbr title="Training Needs Analysis">TNA</abbr> for an <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> with less than 50 employees, and a further £500 for a training plan, giving a total of £2,000</li>
  <li>Jane Doe College Services Ltd would charge £1,350 for a <abbr title="Training Needs Analysis">TNA</abbr> and a further £700 for a bespoke training plan, so total would be £2,050</li>
  <li>Training R Us Ltd would charge £1,700 for the <abbr title="Training Needs Analysis">TNA</abbr>, and include the bespoke training plan free of charge</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, the average of these providers would be (£2,000 + £2,050 + £1,700 = £5,750 divided by 3) £1,916.67 worth of aid.</p>

<p>If the project is using the De Minimis route, this would be the amount of De Minimis aid that they need to tell the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> that they have received. If the project is using the <abbr title="General Block Exemption Regulation">GBER</abbr>, this is the total aid amount, and they will need to seek the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> contribution to this total (under Training Aid for example, the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> must contribute 50% of these costs, so the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> would need to invoice the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> for £958.34).</p>

<p>Method 2</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> is providing an <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> with a <abbr title="Training Needs Analysis">TNA</abbr>, and then developing a training plan for a group of the staff who work for the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr>, as above.</p>

<p>In this case, the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> should take the hourly rate for the member of staff doing the <abbr title="Training Needs Analysis">TNA</abbr>, include the Flat Rate Indirect Cost (<abbr title="Flat Rate Indirect Costs">FRIC</abbr>) uplift, then multiply that by the number of hours taken to carry out the <abbr title="Training Needs Analysis">TNA</abbr> and development of the plan. For example, £27:15 per hour (including 15% <abbr title="Flat Rate Indirect Costs">FRIC</abbr>) x 43 hours = £1,167.45 worth of aid.</p>

<p>If De Minimis applies, this is the amount of De Minimis aid the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> will need to inform the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> they have received, and if they are using the <abbr title="General Block Exemption Regulation">GBER</abbr> they will need to invoice the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> for 50% of the costs (£583.73).</p>

<p>For those claims where either of the <abbr title="General Block Exemption Regulation">GBER</abbr> exemptions outlined above are acceptable against the project the progress report should also include the value of aid for the claim instalment period. However, although the value of aid is not a requirement where De Minimis applies the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> is still required to have calculated the value of aid using one of the methodologies above to ensure the aid is calculated and reported on for the purposes of 3-year €200,000 ceiling.</p>

<p>A response of Not Applicable  is not acceptable on any aspect of State Aid, including the valuing method, level of aid and the exemption applied. If you record a response of Not Applicable or equivalent, the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> will not be able to approve your claim. Instead they will refer your claim back to you, requesting that you provide an updated, acceptable response.</p>

<p>If you have assessed at application stage, that State Aid does not apply to your project you should confirm here that that there has been no change, and that you have assessed that State Aid is not relevant to this claim.</p>

<p>If your assessment of State Aid has changed you should discuss this separately with your <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Further Progress</h3>

<h4>Sustainability monitoring</h4>

<p>You must report on the Sustainable Development of your project, including</p>

<ul>
  <li>is there an adequate Sustainability policy and implementation plan in place?</li>
  <li>are the policy and plan subject to regular review?
    <ul>
      <li>who is responsible for leading that review?</li>
      <li>what documentation is produced?</li>
      <li>any progress updates?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>when is the next review due?</li>
  <li>where appropriate, what specific actions are being taken to promote female recruitment?</li>
  <li>where appropriate, what specific actions are being taken to tackle obstacles created by caring responsibilities?</li>
  <li>what specific actions are being taken around Disability access for example to buildings?</li>
  <li>what commitment is in place to provide specialised support for disabled?</li>
  <li>any improvements, updates, or amendments that you have made in terms of the governance of the Sustainable Development theme in your project?</li>
  <li>any progress in achieving aims and objectives set out in your sustainable development policy or implementation plan during the claim instalment period?</li>
  <li>any evidence in support of the above must be uploaded with the Progress Report supporting evidence</li>
</ul>

<h3>Branding and publicity</h3>

<p>Report on any publicity activity that has taken place during the Claim Instalment Period. This may include publicity material, leaflets, banners or stationery and any press releases, newspaper articles or publicity events. Review any evidence uploaded referring to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-structural-and-investment-funds-programme-guidance">Branding and publicity requirements for the 2014 to 2020 European Regional Development Fund and European Social Fund.</a></p>

<h3>Procurement</h3>

<p>Reference to any completed procurement exercises as well as any planned future procurements should be included in the Procurement’ section of your Progress Report, this includes any <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> procured contracts which are used as match funding.</p>

<p>Where there are procurements that have already been completed, that have not been reviewed, or fully reviewed at appraisal or Project Inception Visit (<abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIV</abbr>) stage – for example, the procurement exercise has been undertaken or completed after the <abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIV</abbr> was finalised – these will need to be reviewed at the Desk-Based Administrative Checks stage and an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Public Procurement Checklist may need to be completed.</p>

<p>The Checklist is not required where a Contracting Authority has carried out a procurement exercise where the value is below £24,999.99. In such cases, the Contract Manager undertaking the <abbr title="Desk Based Administrative Checks">DBAC</abbr> will still carry out existing, relevant procurement checks to ensure the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> is aware of and adhering to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-structural-and-investment-funds-procurement-documents"><abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> National Procurement Requirements.</a> published on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Where the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Public Procurement Checklist is required, you will be asked to complete and return the checklist to the Contract Manager, together with any specified ‘Core Documents’.</p>

<p>All supporting ‘Core Documents’ and completed checklist should be uploaded into <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Note: for <abbr title="The National Lottery Community Fund">TNLCF</abbr> it is essential that all procurement exercises are identified by adding the name in the procurement Title, for example Procurement of IT (Delivery Partner – Joe Bloggs Training).</p>

<p>The ‘<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Public Procurement Checklist’ can be issued at any point in the <abbr title="Desk Based Administrative Checks">DBAC</abbr> process, however the review of any relevant procurement exercises must be finished before any costs from that procurement exercises are included in an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Claim.</p>

<p>Where you have completed more than one procurement exercise a separate checklist should be completed for each individual procurement exercise.</p>

<p>Where a single procurement exercise has resulted in the award of a number of individual contracts, a single <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Public Procurement Checklist can be completed.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> undertaking the procurement checks is unable to obtain sufficient assurance that a Procurement exercise has been undertaken compliantly, they will consider whether expenditure relating to that procurement exercise should be excluded from the current and any future claims for the given <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project, or whether a Financial Correction would be appropriate.</p>

<p>Depending on the seriousness of the issue, the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> may also consider whether the <abbr title="Memorandum Of Understanding">MOU</abbr> or <abbr title="Funding Agreement">FA</abbr> for that <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project should be terminated by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>. Depending on the seriousness of the issue, it may also be necessary to consider whether other <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> MOUs or <abbr title="Funding Agreemens">FAs</abbr> linked to that procurement exercise should be terminated by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Once the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> has completed the relevant procurement checks, they will notify you of the outcome, including any impacts on current and, or future claims. The <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> will also update the Procurement Register in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> with details of that procurement exercise.</p>

<p>You must notify the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> of any instances where you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have decided not to progress with a planned procurement</li>
  <li>have withdrawn a contracted procurement</li>
  <li>will not be making purchases for the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project under a contracted procurement.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fixed percentage staff costs</h3>

<p>A copy of the contractual document which confirms the fixed percentage of time per month the employee is working on the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project and a copy of the payslip and any other documents, where necessary, which show the actual gross employment costs which have been used to calculate the correct ‘Fixed Percentage’ <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Direct Staff Costs amount for the selected transaction line.</p>

<h3>Payroll report</h3>

<p>For example, payroll report detailing total gross pay and all pay costs for A.N. Other for [Month] as highlighted. A narrative should be provided if it is not clearly possible to demonstrate links between the documents for both full time and hourly charged employees. Where possible provide a link between the <abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr> payment and the monies defrayed.

<h3>
<abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr> run</h3>

<p>For example, total Organisation payroll of [£X] with explanatory figures linking this to respective documents. As with payroll above, notes should be added to documents to demonstrate links between them. Supporting calculations where <abbr title="National Insurance">NI</abbr> is paid on a different <abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr> run should be included and a note provided making the link. Wherever possible the amount claimed should be highlighted in a <abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr> build up and included within the evidence.</p>

<h3>Bank statement</h3>

<p>For example, defrayal of costs from the Bank Account. The figure being defrayed should match that of the <abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr> run. If the Bank Statement figures do not match <abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr> an explanation of the difference should be included with backup documentation and calculations to demonstrate the Bank Statement figure.</p>

<h3>National Insurance</h3>

<p>If organisations pay their <abbr title="National Insurance">NI</abbr> and pension contributions monthly, it can be automatically accepted that these will be paid, and that the relevant defrayal date is the date the payroll is paid. This approach is used for Article 125 testing.</p>

<h2>Annex 5: Common claim errors</h2>

<p>Based on the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme claims received to-date, the following are good practices recommended for all GRs, including <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr>, to avoid queries and support the submission of admissible, ‘right first time’ claims.</p>

<h3>Transaction list</h3>

<p>1.Descriptions of expenditure in Transaction Lists should be sufficiently detailed to enable the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> to immediately understand what exactly the expenditure is so that it can be readily checked and confirmed as eligible. Descriptions should not include abbreviations or jargon which the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> may not understand.</p>

<p>2.Where ‘Other Direct Costs’ are directly related to a specific participant (for example, childcare costs, travel costs), the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> must include the participant unique identifier from the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> in the expenditure description in the Transaction List, to allow the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> to attribute the costs to a valid participant. Actual participant names must not be included in the Transaction List or <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr>.</p>

<p>3.Where applicable, a clear description of the apportionment between CoRs, IPs, <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> &amp; Match and (if applicable) <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr>, should be noted in the Apportionment Details column, so the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> can understand how, from the total invoice value, the <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> has arrived at the total eligible amount.</p>

<p>4.The total invoice value must EXCLUDE <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr></p>

<h3>Participant Data Schema</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure you are using the correct, latest version as published on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-claim-applications-and-self-declared-adjustments">GOV.UK</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the participant data has been added via the relevant drop-down boxes, and the export sheet has been created, DO NOT overtype any of the information in the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr>, before uploading it to <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> – this will risk validation errors and or may result in the wrong <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> being reported for your project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Report all participant related <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> output and results in a single <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> for each quarterly claim. This will support accurate sampling for desk-based checks, speeding the claims approval and payment process.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Annex 6: Output and Results Scenarios</h2>

<h3>Scenario 1 – Participant starts <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> intervention and all data is complete at point of starting.</h3>
<p>In this scenario, any appropriate Programme Specific and Common Output indicators are captured at the point the starting information is declared on the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>. See illustrated example below</p>

<h4>Guidance:</h4>

<p>Section 3.1.1 page 10 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/sfc/en/system/files/ged/ESF%20monitoring%20and%20evaluation%20guidance.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Monitoring and Evaluation guidance refers</a></p>

<p>In order to fulfil the data completeness requirement, data on participants shall be complete with regard to all common output indicators covering personal non-sensitive data: Gender, employment status, age, education level, and household situation.</p>

<h3>Scenario 2 – Participant starts <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> intervention and all data is complete at point of starting, then participant leaves <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> intervention and all data is complete at point of leaving.</h3>

<p>In this scenario, any appropriate Programme Specific and Common Output indicators are captured at the point the starting information is declared on the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>. Any appropriate Programme Specific and Common Result indicators are captured at the point the leaving information is declared on the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>. See illustrated example below</p>

<h4>Guidance:</h4>

<p>(Section 3.4.1 page 18 <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Monitoring and Evaluation guidance refers: (Data Recording and Storage)</p>

<p>The individual participants’ data for all person-related indicators must be recorded and stored in a way that allows a Member State to perform the tasks it is legally required to perform. Therefore, all records should include, as a minimum: an identifier for the operation/project; a personal identifier that allows an individual to be traced and re-contacted; dates of starting and leaving an operation; and access to values for all variables needed for indicators.</p>

<h4>Scenario 1 &amp; 2 Example:</h4>

<p>A participant joins a single project within an operation, completes the planned activity and leaves.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/115898/Claims_Guidance_single_project.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>In the scenario above a participant joins a single project within an operation, completes the planned activity and leaves.</p>

<p>In the first stage the participant is interviewed and referred to a 3 month training scheme.  The Output indicators on entry, refer to their situation on entry to the operation, which is their situation on the first day of training.</p>

<p>All information collected at interview and the referral point must be verified.</p>

<p>The participant then undertakes 3 months training.</p>

<p>Intermediate result indicators refer to the participant’s situation at point of exit from the operation (in this case the leaving date), or within 4 weeks after.</p>

<h3>Scenario 3 – Participant starts <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> intervention, and all data is complete at point of starting, then leaves intervention early and leaving data is complete.</h3>

<p>In this scenario, any appropriate Programme Specific and Common Output indicators are captured at the point the starting information is declared on the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>. Any appropriate Programme Specific and Common Result indicators are captured at the point the leaving information is declared on the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Scenario 3 Example:</h4>

<p>A participant joins a single project with an operation but does not complete the planned activity and therefore leaves earlier than expected.  The leaving date, and therefore the point to which immediate results indicators should apply, is always the date that the participant leaves the operation and not the planned exit date.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/116559/Claims_Guidance_not_complete.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>In the scenario above, a participant is interviewed and then referred to training.</p>

<p>In the first stage the participant is interviewed and referred a 3 months training scheme. The Output indicators on entry, refer to their situation on entry to the operation. So in this scenario it is their situation on the first day of the training scheme. All information collected at interview and the referral point must be verified.</p>

<p>The participant joins a single project which in this case is planned as a 3 months training scheme. However, in this scenario they do not complete the planned activity as they leave at the end of month 2, 1 month earlier than expected.</p>

<p>The immediate results indicators, refers to situation on exit from the operation. So their actual leaving date, is always the date that the participant leaves the operation and not the planned exit date. The outcome can be reported, or updated should it change, within 4 weeks of the date of leaving.</p>

<p>Note for <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr> supported operations, information about whether a participant completes the intervention or not is important for some of the <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr> indicators (see section 5.10.1).</p>

<p>Immediate result indictors refer to situations on exit from the operation for instance the leaving date or within 4 weeks of that date even if the exit is earlier than planned.</p>

<h4>Guidance:</h4>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/sfc/en/system/files/ged/Annex%20D%20-%20Practical%20guidance%20on%20data%20collection%20and%20validation.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Annex D – Practical Guidance on data collection and validation</a> refers:</p>

<h3>Scenario 4 – Participant starts <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> intervention and all data is complete at point of starting, then leaves intervention early and leaving data is incomplete.</h3>

<p>In this scenario, any appropriate Programme Specific and Common Output indicators are captured at the point the starting information is declared on the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>. No Programme Specific or Common Result data can be captured as the leaving data is incomplete.</p>

<p>Note: Incomplete leaving data could include date of leaving. It is important that projects have a policy in place to establish an appropriate leaving date, for participants who leave their intervention early. For example, a participant does not attend a planned intervention and the project is unable to contact them. The project has a policy that provides for 2 planned interventions to be missed without contact. If the participant fails to attend the second intervention, the project will record the participant as a leaver.</p>

<h3>Scenario 5 – Participant starts <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> intervention and data is incomplete at point of starting.</h3>

<p>In this scenario, the participant will not count towards any Programme Specific or Common Output indicators.</p>

<p>Note: Participants falling into this category must still be declared to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> on the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr>. The <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> is required to provide a count of incomplete records to the European Commission (<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>).</p>

<h4>Guidance:</h4>
<p>Section 3.1.1 page 10 of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Monitoring and Evaluation guidance refers:</p>

<p>There is no single common indicator in SFC capturing the grand total number of participants (including those for which the common output indicators covering personal non-sensitive data could not be collected). Nevertheless, this grand total number of participants shall be reported by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> in the framework of the <abbr title="Annual Implementation Reports">AIRs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Section 2.3.7 of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Annex D – Practical Guidance on data collection and validation refers: Grand total of participants;</p>

<p>The “grand total of participants” covers all supported participants, including those for which the basic data (for example, the common output indicators covering personal non-sensitive data) could not be collected or are incomplete. This total should be reported in the last row of Table 4A of the <abbr title="Annual Implementation Report">AIR</abbr> (see section 3.1.1 of the European Commission (<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>) Guidance document on Monitoring and Evaluation).</p>

<h4>Scenario 6 – Participant returns to an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> operation, after previously participating in an intervention within the same operation.</h4>

<p>In this scenario, any previous results relating to this participant are no longer valid. It is only possible to record the results relevant to the latest intervention.</p>

<h4>Example 6</h4>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/116560/Claims_Guidance_participant_returns.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>In the scenario above a participant is interviewed and then referred to training.</p>

<p>In the first stage the participant is interviewed and referred to language training. The Output indicators on entry, refer to their situation on entry to the operation, which is their situation on the first day of language training. 
All information collected at interview and the referral point must be verified.</p>

<p>After 2 months the participant leaves the language training for 1 month’s employment.  The date the participant left the language training is their original exit date.</p>

<p>When their one month’s employment finishes the participant re-enters an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> operation. On re-entry, their original Output indicators on entry, will be held. This is correct.</p>

<p>It is only possible to record the results relevant to this latest intervention. So, in this scenario, any previous results relating to this participant are no longer valid. Their existing leaving date and associated immediate result data must be removed.</p>

<p>The participant then undertakes Skills Training and Further language training
Leaving date.</p>

<p>Record new leaving date (the date of last exit from the operation) and corresponding immediate result data when the participant leaves this latest intervention.</p>
