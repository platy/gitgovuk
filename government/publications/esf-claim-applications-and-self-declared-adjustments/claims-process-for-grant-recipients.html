<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guidance should be read in conjunction with the terms and conditions set out in your European Structural and Investment Funds (<abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr>) Funding Agreement (FA) including the projects approved final full application for <abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> funding. These documents set out the eligible parameters, scope of activities and the key deliverables that are to be reported to the Managing Authority (<abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>).<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>

<p>For the Grant Recipient (<abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr>) to report on delivery and draw down European Social Fund (<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>) Grant Funding in line with the terms and conditions set out in the FA, an application for reimbursement ‘Grant Claim’ must be made.</p>

<p>All Claims should be submitted via <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> (Electronic Claims and Information Management System).</p>

<p>Before any payments can be processed the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> must have completed and returned a fully accurate ‘Bank Details Form’ to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>. A blank form will be sent to the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> with their new FA and, once accurately completed and returned, this will allow the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> to enable actual payment.</p>

<p>A Project Inception Visit (<abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIV</abbr>) must also have taken place prior to submission of your first claim and, following this visit, the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> should have confirmed in writing, usually via email, that the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> is cleared to start submitting financial claims.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> must ensure from the outset that robust and suitable systems and processes are in place locally to maintain adequate audit trails and manage information effectively and efficiently. All project information must be retained and made available for verification or any audit visits throughout delivery and post completion under the retention of documentation requirements in accordance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-document-retention/european-social-fund-document-retention-guidance">European Social Fund document retention guidance</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-eligibility-documents/esf-national-eligibility-rules-and-programme-guidance"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> National Eligibility Rules and Programme Guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Unless agreed otherwise with the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>, the first submitted claim should include all spend or activity undertaken on the project up to and including the current Claim Instalment Period. The <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> must ensure that any expenditure included in the first claim meets the relevant defrayal rules set out in this guidance.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Contract Manager (<abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr>) will contact you regarding the Final Claim process up to 6 months prior to any final Claim.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Timing</h2>

<p>Claims must be submitted to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> in arrears, via <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>, reporting on a pre-defined period of actual activity. This is referred to as the Claim Instalment Period.</p>

<p>Claim Instalment Periods are confirmed within the project specific conditions contained within the FA; these are based on calendar quarters as detailed below</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<ul>
  <li>quarter 1, 1 January – 31 March</li>
  <li>quarter 2, 1 April – 30 June</li>
  <li>quarter 3, 1 July – 30 September</li>
  <li>quarter 4, 1 October – 31 December</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Claims are determined by the Claims Schedule set for the project, and Claims (including ‘Nil Claims’) should be started in chronological order – <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> cannot start a new Claim on <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> until the Claim for the previous Claim Period has been started.</p>

<p>Claims must be submitted to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> within 25 working days of the end of each Claim Instalment Period.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> will aim to finalise payment into the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr>’s Bank Account within 30 working days from the point at which all claim information is agreed by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> as correct and complete, including the conclusion of any desk-based evidence checks (that is, there are no outstanding issues, actions or concerns that could potentially lead to an Irregularity).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Late or missing claims</h3>

<p><abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr>’s must notify the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> promptly if at any time they become aware that they are unable to make a Grant Claim in accordance with the outlined timescales or in accordance with the expenditure profile.</p>

<p>Under the terms and conditions set out in their FA, <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr>’s are required to make Grant Claims within 25 working days of the end of the Instalment Period for which the Grant Claim is due. Failure to comply with this condition is an event of default under their FA and could therefore lead to the Department enacting its rights to suspend, reduce or cease to make payments in respect of the relevant <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project.</p>

<p>For this reason, the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr>’s should ensure prompt submission of Claims in line with their contracted Claim Schedule.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Claim process</h2>

<p>The claim process is an integral part of the contract management and control environment employed by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> in managing the Programme. Although Claims are a mechanism for <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr>’s to draw down their <abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> Grant it also provides key information on project progress and performance.  Full and comprehensive information enables the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> to obtain assurances and carry out Desk Based Verification on the validity of the activities currently undertaken and the on-going project delivery.</p>

<p>For Technical Assistance projects this guide, should be used alongside the guidance in Action Note 048/20 New <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Flat Rate Simplified Cost Option methodology and associated claims process for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Technical Assistance projects published on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>All claims should be submitted to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> via <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>. The following documentation should be uploaded as supporting documentation.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<ul>
  <li>ESF Transaction List</li>
  <li>ESF Participant Data Schema (not application to Investment Priority 2.2 and Priority Axis 3 outputs or results)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Each project must also submit a narrative Progress Report with their quarterly claim. The Progress Report information should be recorded directly into the relevant screen(s) and fields in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>.</p>

<p>By exception, subject to agreement with their <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr>, a project may be allowed to provide their report via a separate document which must then be uploaded into <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>.</p>

<p>However, <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr>’s should note that they will still need to work through the Progress Report screens in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> in these circumstances before attaching their narrative report otherwise <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> will not allow submission of the claim.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether they choose direct input, or a separate document, the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> must ensure all required Progress Report sections or topics as set out in the <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> Progress Report screens are fully covered.</p>

<p>For guidance on completing see <a class="govuk-link" href="#progress"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Progress Report</a></p>

<p>Projects who are delivering activities under Investment Priority 2.2 must report progress against their Output and Result profiles in their Progress Report. This should include numerical performance against profiles, as well as any specific narrative progress update.  <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Technical Assistance projects should also report progress against their specific <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> output and result indicators in each of their quarterly Progress Reports.</p>

<p>All Investment Priority (<abbr title="Investment Priority">IP</abbr>) 2.2 Projects are required to complete an <abbr title="Investment Priority">IP</abbr> 2.2 Claim Form which should be uploaded to <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>. Follow this link to the</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-claim-applications-and-self-declared-adjustments"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> claim applications and Self-Declared Adjustments</a> on GOV.UK</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> may also ask the project to upload an additional project specific return with each claim.</p>

<p>For example, Community Led Local Development (CLLD) projects must upload a CLLD Management Information 	(<abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr>) sheet which provides details of pipeline activity at Local Grant Recipients (LGR) level, reports on the 25% M and A threshold.</p>

<p>As part of the <abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIV</abbr> process, <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr>’s should have already identified staff to perform the ‘Claim Editor’ role in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> – bearing in mind that financial claims can only be generated and submitted in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> by individuals who have been assigned the ‘Claim Editor’ user role, including uploading of any supporting documents.</p>

<p><abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr>’s must ensure that the final compiled claim is checked by a Claim Reviewer in their organisation prior to submission of the claim via <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>. The Claim Reviewer must be an individual who has been named as an Authorised Signatory on the project’s Bank Details previously submitted to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> and they must record their action in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>.</p>

<p>If a <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> submits a claim without Claim Reviewer action recorded in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>, or if the Claim Reviewer is not a recognised Authorised Signatory for the project, the claim will be rejected by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> and returned to the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> for remedial action.</p>

<p>Claims are to be submitted in arrears for each Instalment Period and only eligible expenditure defrayed (incurred and ‘paid’, for example cleared bank account) by the end of that period can be included in the Claim for reimbursement. It is acceptable to include expenditure defrayed in previous periods in the Claim, if they have not already been included in another Claim and a statement has been included in the expenditure description field confirming this.</p>

<p>At the point each Claim is submitted to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> on <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>, the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> must notify their <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> via email, to ensure timely action can be completed to check the information provided, request desk-based evidence where applicable and authorise and approve the resulting payment.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> must notify the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> promptly if at any time it becomes aware that it is unable to make a Grant Claim in accordance with the outlined timescales or in accordance with the expenditure profile.</p>

<p>In the event that no expenditure has been defrayed during the Instalment Period a Nil Claim must still be submitted.  Once a Project has been invited by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> to make their first financial Claim, all Claims thereafter – including Nil Claims – must include a Progress Report.</p>

<p>Progress Reports provide details of progress towards delivery and achievement of the project objectives or activities, expenditure forecast and Outputs and Results forecast.</p>

<p>If at any stage, the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> identifies any mistakes or omissions in any of its Claims, whether paid or in the process of being paid, they should contact their <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Where clerical and or technical errors are identified on Claims that have already been paid, <abbr title="Grant Recipients">GRs</abbr> will need to contact their <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Financial information</h2>

<p>This section is aimed to guide you through the key areas to check when collating the detail for your Claim.</p>

<p>All expenditure which is to be claimed must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>fall within the agreed scope of the project activities and within the agreed expenditure categories defined in the financial tables within the FA.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>conform to all respects of the eligibility criteria as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-eligibility-documents/esf-national-eligibility-rules-and-programme-guidance"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> National Eligibility Rules and Programme Guidance</a> .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be defrayed (incurred and paid for example, cleared the applicant’s bank account) by the end date of the Claim Instalment Period. The date paid is the date the payment appears on your bank statement. For large organisations, the Bankers Automated Clearing Services (<abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr>) defrayal date may be acceptable, this should be discussed with the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>only include ‘Flat Rate’ costs of either 15% or 40% as outlined in your FA; this will have been formally agreed during the appraisal process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>only include Irrecoverable Value Added Tax (<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>) if this has been agreed as an eligible cost with the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> during the Full Appraisal process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be able to be backed up by a full audit trail containing all original source documentation from receipted invoices to bank statements and accounting documents of equivalent verifiable value. These need to be maintained and made available for verification checks and audits. These documents must be retained in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-document-retention/european-social-fund-document-retention-guidance">European Social Fund document retention guidance</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-eligibility-documents/esf-national-eligibility-rules-and-programme-guidance"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> National Eligibility Rules and Programme Guidance</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Transactions list</h2>

<p>A Transaction List, itemising each item of expenditure, must be uploaded directly into <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> to support each Claim. This Transaction List must provide the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>, or any other audit body, with clear detail relating to all the costs being claimed.  It is important that this information is entered accurately and provides a clear description of the costs to enable the reader to determine their eligibility. The use of acronyms and jargon should be avoided to aid clarity to the reader.</p>

<p>The Transaction List spread sheet contains three tabs entitled Guidance, Transactions and Summary. The Transaction List is designed to enable upload to <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>.</p>

<p>It is strongly recommended that the ‘Guidance’ tab is consulted before attempting to populate the Transactions tab. If at any time you are unsure of the level of detail required after checking with guidance, please check with your <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> before uploading.</p>

<p>The details required when completing the Transaction List screen in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> are explained below along with descriptions on whether these are mandatory fields, and what they are validated against.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>a) the fields labelled as mandatory below are those which will automatically be validated by <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> and if they are not completed accurately, the Claim will be rejected</p>

<p>b) for data collection purposes all fields must be completed where possible regardless of whether they are labelled as mandatory or not</p>

<p>c) all monetary figures must be to 2 decimal places; .005 and above, rounded to .01; .004 and below, rounded to .00</p>

<p>d) dates should be added in with slashes (for example, DD/MM/YYYY) as <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> will not accept full-stops, and will automatically change to YYYY-MM-DD when the ‘Export’ button is pressed</p>

<p>e) once the Transaction List has been completed the ‘Export’ button will need to be pressed prior to submission to <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>. This button creates a spreadsheet which is in a format that <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> can accept meaning, without macros or any other formatting</p>

<p>For instructions on uploading the Transaction List please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-claim-applications-and-self-declared-adjustments"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> External Users Guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Cost category</h3>

<p>(Mandatory) Select the eligible cost as agreed and set out in your grant FA.</p>

<p>The headings you must select from are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> – direct staff costs</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> – other direct costs</li>
  <li>Youth Employment Initiative (<abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr>) – direct staff costs</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr> – other direct costs</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Do not use the cost categories of ‘Match-direct staff costs’ or ‘Match-other direct costs’. <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> and associated Match costs must be entered as a total combined cost under the ‘<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Direct Staff Costs’ and, if applicable the ‘<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Other Direct Costs’ cost category. This is because the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> and <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> will automatically calculate the percentage of Match funding for each claim based on the intervention rate for your <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project. The final payment for your claim will then be based on that same intervention rate.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project, the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> should complete one line which must include both the amount of <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> and Match claimed. The <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> will pay Claims at the intervention rate applicable to your project as detailed in the financial annex within your FA</li>
  <li>for a <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr> project, the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> should complete the Transaction List with two lines for each cost. Line one being <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr>, then on line two enter the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> and Match combined. The <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> will split the amount claimed (on line two) based on the intervention rate applicable to your project as above and the <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr> line will be paid at 100%, as detailed in the financial annex within your FA</li>
</ul>

<p>The following cost categories do not apply to Direct Bid projects and must not be used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> – CFO Admin</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> – Contract Costs</li>
  <li>Match – Contract Costs</li>
</ul>

<h4>Delivery Partner</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) If your project has Delivery Partners, you must insert the Identification (<abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr>) number applicable to that Delivery Partner in column C of the Transaction List. You must record this value in Column C against all transaction lines relating to that partner. If your project has no delivery partners, please enter a ‘0’ into column C on each transaction line.</p>

<p>You can find the correct <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> number for each of your Delivery Partners in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> by visiting the Full Application option from the left-hand menu on your project screen in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> and scrolling down to the Delivery Partner table.</p>

<p>If you have an existing Delivery Partner and their information is not recorded in the Delivery Partner table in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>, you will need to add their information to the table before you can include them in your financial claim.</p>

<p>If you have a new Delivery Partner, you must submit a Project Change Request (<abbr title="Project Change Request">PCR</abbr>) to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> first for approval, before including them in the Delivery Partner table and any Financial Claims.</p>

<h4>Priority Axis</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) Select the applicable Priority Axis as agreed and specified in your grant FA.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Investment Priority</h3>

<p>(Mandatory) Select the applicable Investment Priority as agreed and specified in your grant FA.</p>

<p>Note: For <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr> Claims you must select Investment Priority 1.3a for the <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr> portion of your expenditure for each financial transaction and Investment Priority 1.3b for the Match and or <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> element, failing to do so will result in your payment being incorrect.</p>

<h4>Procurement contract <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr>
</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) If a transaction line is as a result of Procurement undertaken by your project, you should record the relevant Procurement Record <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> number in Column F in each case. The Procurement Record <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> number can be found in the Procurement Register for your <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project on <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>.</p>

<p>If the transaction line is not a result of procurement by your project, then please leave column F blank.</p>

<h4>Supplier name</h4>

<p>(Mandatory – in any format) Enter the name of supplier, creditor or payee or employee.</p>

<h4>Supplier <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> number</h4>

<p>Enter the supplier <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> number.</p>

<h4>Invoice reference</h4>

<p>(Mandatory – in any format) Invoice or receipt or reference number.  All documents should be given a separate unique reference number to clearly identify the item of expenditure for audit purposes.</p>

<h4>Invoice date</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) Date of the invoice or if a salary cost, the date posted on your accounting system. Dates should be added with slashes (for example, DD/MM/YYYY) –as <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> will not accept full-stops and will automatically change to YYYY-MM-DD when the ‘Export’ button is pressed.</p>

<h4>Defrayal date</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) Date the money was defrayed or paid. (For large organisations the <abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr> defrayal date maybe acceptable and should be discussed with the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>).  Dates can be added in using slashes – as <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> will not accept full stops – and will automatically change to YYYY-MM-DD when the ‘Export’ button is pressed.</p>

<p>If organisations pay their National Insurance (<abbr title="National Insurance">NI</abbr>) and pension contributions monthly, it can be automatically accepted that these will be paid and that the relevant defrayal date is the date the payroll is paid. This approach is used for Article 125 testing.</p>

<p>For Petty Cash transactions, the defrayal date should be the date money from the Petty Cash account box was paid to an individual or supplier such as, align with the date the individual or supplier recipient signed to say they had received money from the Petty Cash.</p>

<h4>Defrayal method</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) Select from the drop-down the method of payment, such as, <abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr>, Cheque, and Credit Card.</p>

<h4>Defrayal reference</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) Enter payment reference relevant to transaction.</p>

<h4>Expenditure description</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) Full description of the item of expenditure being claimed to ensure clarity for any reader of what is being included (see additional details below for more assistance). Connections between defrayal, invoice dates and salary paid dates should be explained, that is, if they are the same date, for example, if an employee works full-time on <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>, include this in the description.</p>

<p>Note: If the expense relates to a participant, the unique participant identifier must be included within the expenditure description. This ensures that, if there are any issues with this participant on the Participant Data Schema (<abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr>), it will be possible to identify and rectify any related expenditure where needed. The participant’s name must not be used.</p>

<h4>Apportionment details</h4>

<p>Indicate how the eligible value is derived from the original invoice or receipt value such as, the method of apportionment, ineligible costs removed.</p>

<p>If a cost is apportioned between <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>, Match and or <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr>, more than one Category of Region and/or more than one Investment Priority, you must include details here of how the cost has been apportioned in each case.</p>

<h4>Total Invoice Value (excluding <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>)</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) Indicate the total Net expenditure value of the invoice or receipt (total documented value excluding <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>).</p>

<p>If a cost is apportioned between <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>, Match and or Youth Employment Initiative (<abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr>), more than one Category of Region and or more than one Investment Priority, the Total Invoice Value must still be completed with the actual, total overall amount of the invoice. The ‘Total Eligible Value’ field will then be the place where you will need to record the actual expenditure amount to be claimed after any apportionment has been taken into account.</p>

<h4>Total Irrecoverable <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>
</h4>

<p>State the Irrecoverable <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> value which cannot be recovered from another source Her Majesty Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) of the invoice or receipt following any adjustments for apportionments or ineligible costs.</p>

<p>Note: If you are <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> registered and are able to recover <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> but are choosing not to do so, these costs still cannot be included in your Claim. 
Only record irrecoverable <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> in this field if you are claiming it back through <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Total Eligible Value</h4>

<p>(Mandatory Enter the project eligible expenditure amount after any apportionment or adjustments have been applied and Irrecoverable <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> added in. This is the expenditure value minus adjustments against which <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> is being claimed.</p>

<h4>Eligible for Flat Rate Indirect Costs (<abbr title="Flat Rate Indirect Costs">FRIC</abbr>)</h4>

<p>(Mandatory) Select ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ from drop-down menu. Leaving this blank will fail validation This heading is used when using either the 15% or 40% Simplified Cost Option.</p>

<p><abbr title="Flat Rate Indirect Costs">FRIC</abbr> costs are calculated at the relevant, agreed percentage based on the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Direct Staff Costs for your project but you do not need to calculate this yourself.</p>

<p>The Transaction List template includes an automatic calculation of <abbr title="Flat Rate Indirect Costs">FRIC</abbr> costs and this auto-calculation will be reflected in the ‘Summary’ tab. <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> will also automatically calculate the <abbr title="Flat Rate Indirect Costs">FRIC</abbr> costs from your uploaded Transaction List.</p>

<p>As these costs are automatically calculated, you must not include <abbr title="Flat Rate Indirect Costs">FRIC</abbr> costs as an expenditure line in your actual Transaction List.</p>

<h4>Total Category of Region (<abbr title="Category of Region">CoR</abbr>) Expenditure</h4>

<p>(Mandatory – if Claim covers more than one <abbr title="Category of Region">CoR</abbr>) – applicable to the project will have been agreed at appraisal together with the Intervention Rate for each category. If you have only one <abbr title="Category of Region">CoR</abbr> you do not need to enter data into cells T, U and V.</p>

<p>Note:  If you have more than one <abbr title="Category of Region">CoR</abbr> and your FA was agreed prior to 09/03/2017, you will need to contact your <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> to obtain this information.</p>

<h4>Descriptions of Defrayed Expenditure</h4>

<p>The item for which funding is being claimed must have a clear description. The description must be detailed enough to allow the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> to consider its validity without the need to see the actual evidence at this stage.</p>

<p>The table below provides guidance on acceptable or unacceptable expenditure descriptions and level of detail required.</p>

<p>Note: This is for illustrative purposes only and it is not an exhaustive list</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Unacceptable Description</th>
      <th scope="col">Acceptable Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Room hire</td>
      <td>Room hired for [state purpose and with whom] on [date] at [place]</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Salary</td>
      <td>Salary for [state at least one of name or post or payroll number] for period dd/mm/yy to dd/mm/yy. The description should also include whether the staff member is working all or part of their time on the project. If working part of their time, the description must include the number of hours worked and the hourly rate or ‘Fixed Percentage’ figure used so the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> can see how the total amount being claimed for that individual has been determined.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Salaries</td>
      <td>Salaries for project management or delivery team for period dd/mm/yy to dd/mm/yy. (A complete breakdown of the evidence supporting each salary cost – identifying the post holders or employees claimed should be retained for Audit purposes)</td>

</table>

<h4>Credit notes</h4>

<p>Where your project receives a credit note from a partner or supplier but that expenditure has already been included and paid in a previous <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> claim, you should raise a Self-Declared Adjustment (SDA) for the full value of the credit note.</p>

<p>If you then incur further costs with the same supplier or partner against your Project and want to use the credit note as payment or part-payment of those costs you should complete the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>record the full value of the new expenditure or invoice in your Transaction List</li>
  <li>ensure the description of the transaction explains how much of the invoice or expenditure is being paid via credit note</li>
  <li>ensure you retain a copy of the credit note, and evidence of the supplier or partner acceptance of the credit note as payment or part-payment as evidence of defrayal</li>
  <li>if requested as part of the Desk-Based Evidence Checks (<abbr title="Desk Based Evidence Checks">DBEC</abbr>), On The Spot Visits (<abbr title="On the Spot Visit">OTSV</abbr>) or Audit Authority (AA) checks, you will need to provide the credit note as evidence of defrayal</li>
</ol>

<p>If your Project received a credit note from a partner or supplier for expenditure which has not yet been included in an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> claim, the amount of any expenditure being claimed from the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> against that supplier or partner for the activities covered by the credit note should be reduced by the value of the credit note. This is because expenditure covered by a credit note is not ‘defrayed’ until the credit note has been spent with the relevant partner or supplier.</p>

<h4>Evidencing Petty Cash Defrayal</h4>

<p>As per the published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-eligibility-documents/esf-national-eligibility-rules-and-programme-guidance"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> National Eligibility Rules and Programme Guidance</a>, items in claims which include petty cash transactions must be capable of being tracked back to individual items claimed and related evidence in the petty cash system. The <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> will need to be able to see the defrayal between the organisations bank account and the petty cash account (that is how and from what source the petty cash account is routinely replenished) and would need to reconcile the petty cash operation to the bank account.</p>

<p>If a Transaction Line is selected for Desk-Based Evidence Check and this expenditure has been funded via an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project’s Petty Cash arrangements, you must provide the following evidence chain and upload all into <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>evidence of funds being debited from the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> or Delivery Partner Bank Account to put into their Petty Cash fund for example, Bank Statement</li>
  <li>evidence of the funds being added to the Petty Cash fund such as a Petty Cash Logbook</li>
  <li>evidence of the funding for the specific Transaction Line being withdrawn from the Petty Cash in order to pay an individual or supplier as per the listed transaction for example, Petty Cash Logbook</li>
  <li>evidence of the individual or supplier confirming receipt of the relevant Petty Cash funds for the expenditure listed in the Transaction Line</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bank statement showing withdrawal of funds from bank account on 1/12/2018</li>
  <li>Petty Cash Logbook showing funds being added to the Petty Cash box on 1/12/18</li>
  <li>Petty Cash Logbook showing money being withdrawn from the fund on 21/1/19 to pay XX individual for a travel ticket listed as a line on the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Claim Transaction List</li>
  <li>signed receipt from XX individual confirming they received XX amount of cash on 21/1/19 as reimbursement for the travel ticket listed as the line on the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Claim Transaction List</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note: in this case the travel ticket would also need to be uploaded to <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> as an item of evidence, in line with the usual travel ticket or expenses evidence requirements.</p>

<h4>Internal Cost Transfers</h4>

<p>If your organisation uses Internal Cost Transfers as part of your payment processes for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> costs, you should be aware that evidence of the Internal Cost Transfer itself is not sufficient evidence of defrayal of those <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project costs.</p>

<p>In the situation of an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project operating as a separate entity within a wider organisation (for example an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project within a Local Authority) and the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project pays an additional direct cost to the wider organisation via internal cost transfer, there must be a process in place and a clear audit trail showing</p>

<ul>
  <li>the transfer of funds between the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project and the wider organisation receiving those funds,</li>
  <li>evidence of the same, actual costs being incurred, for example defrayed by the wider organisation who is receiving payment from the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project to a third party</li>
</ul>

<p>If the payment is made by an internal cost transfer and there is no supporting evidence as outlined above, the evidence of the internal cost transfer alone is not sufficient evidence of defrayal. Any expenditure should be removed from the claim unless the required defrayal evidence can be provided.</p>

<p>An example of a compliant audit trail for internal cost transfers could be as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>evidence of an invoice or request for payment from a parent organisation to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project, setting out the specific, direct costs to be paid by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project and what services/goods have been provided by the parent organisation to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project</li>
  <li>evidence of the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project transferring the relevant direct costs amount to the parent organisation such as, financial journal entry, cost centre transfer record</li>
  <li>evidence of the direct, actual costs incurred by the parent organisation and evidence they have defrayed those costs, as a result of the goods/services provided to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project for example a bank statement; <abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing Services">BACS</abbr> run</li>
</ul>

<p>The final bullet point is important to ensure that your <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project is only claiming costs from the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> which have  actually been incurred by the parent or other organisation. This list is not exhaustive and, depending on the complexity of the internal cost transfer arrangements, the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> may request other documentation in support of any transactions where internal cost transfers are part of the payment process, to ensure there is sufficient documentary evidence for each step from initial payment by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project to defrayal.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Participant Data Schema</h2>

<p>Output and Result targets are key performance indicators for <abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> programmes. Every project justifies the level of investment requested from <abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> by agreeing to achieve a number of programme defined outputs and result targets. These targets are scoped and referenced in the application for <abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> funding which is appraised by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> and form an important part of the FA.</p>

<p>Before submitting any output or results data to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>, the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> must ensure they have a full audit trail containing all original source documentation for each output and result being reported – in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-eligibility-documents/esf-data-evidence-requirements-eligibility-and-results"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Data Evidence Requirements</a>. This audit trail must be maintained and made available for verification checks and audits and must be retained in accordance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-document-retention/european-social-fund-document-retention-guidance">European Social Fund document retention guidance</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-eligibility-documents/esf-national-eligibility-rules-and-programme-guidance"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> National Eligibility Rules and Programme Guidance</a>.</p>

<p>With the exception of Investment Priority 2.2 deliverables, and Investment Priority 3.1 deliverables all outputs and results to be claimed for during the respective Claim Period should be recorded and submitted to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> using the Participant Data Schema form. It is good practice to submit a single Participant Data Schema with each claim – however, if you have a significant number of lines to report for example. 5,000 or over, you may submit more than one <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> for a given claim period by exception.</p>

<p>Investment Priority 2.2 projects must report on their progress per outputs and results profile in their Progress Report.</p>

<p>IP2.2 deliverables must be reported on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-online-full-applications"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> IP2.2 monitoring template</a> which should be uploaded to <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>.</p>

<p>As stated in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-claim-applications-and-self-declared-adjustments">Participant Data Schema Guidance</a>, participant identifiers are how we track participants and their progress. Each participant must have a unique and persistent identifier number. European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) data protection regulations require that no unnecessary identifying or personal data is collected about the participant. Guidance on the Data Protection Act sets out that consideration should be given to not only the identifying potential of individual items of data but the impact of the total data collected. To this end participant IDs should not be based on any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>participant’s first names</li>
  <li>participant’s surnames</li>
  <li>participant’s full address</li>
</ul>

<p>Importantly as a beneficiary organisation you must be able to reconcile a Participant Identification (<abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr>) to a single unique participant, for both audit purposes and participant survey selection. If a participant is selected for a follow up survey, the evaluation team will contact you to request the participant contact details which will be held and processed in a separate system with greater security.</p>

<p>The Participant <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> should relate to the submitting organisation, for example DBXXXXXXXXXX = Direct Bid.</p>

<p>A maximum number of characters, including the prefix signifier, should be 22 characters.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#Annex7">Annex 7</a> of this guidance includes examples of a range of scenarios which may occur in delivery of an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> product and how these impact on the reporting of associated outputs and results. <abbr title="Grant Recipients">GRs</abbr> should ensure they take account of these scenarios when completing their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-claim-applications-and-self-declared-adjustments">Participant Data Schema</a>, each quarter.</p>

<p>Once the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-claim-applications-and-self-declared-adjustments">Participant Data Schema</a>, has been completed and the Grant Recipient is content that all data in the schema is correct, the ‘Create Export Sheet’ button must be pressed prior to uploading the document into <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>. This creates a spreadsheet which is in a format that <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> can accept and that is without macros. For instructions on uploading of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-claim-applications-and-self-declared-adjustments">Participant Data Schema</a> please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-claim-applications-and-self-declared-adjustments"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> External User Guidance</a>.</p>

<p>The most up-to date version of the Participant Data Schema form, as well as full guidance on how to complete the form can be found on GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Expenditure Forecast</h2>

<p>Full and comprehensive information on actual expenditure for previous and current claim periods, as well as contracted expenditure profiles for remaining claim periods is required with every claim to support <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Contract Managers">CMs</abbr> in reviewing the performance of each project.</p>

<p>The Expenditure Forecast provided needs to be broken down by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Investment Priority (<abbr title="Investment Priority">IP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Category of Region (<abbr title="Category of Region">CoR</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Variances from the contracted profiled forecast, ‘slippage’, must be fully explained and justified within the Progress Report.</p>

<p>You will need to provide details of how your project plans to address any shortfall in the immediate, medium – and longer-term expenditure forecast, this will help inform conversations with your <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr>.</p>

<p>Any actual underspend variance greater than 15% from the contracted expenditure profiles may result in de-commitment or withdrawal of <abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> funding in line with the underperformance policy. Your <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> will discuss this with you if applicable.</p>

<p>Any anticipated variances should be discussed with your <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> as soon as possible, who will consider whether a Project Change Request (<abbr title="Project Change Request">PCR</abbr>) is required.</p>

<p>If a <abbr title="Project Change Request">PCR</abbr> has recently been approved by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> where this changes the future, contracted expenditure profiles, but the amended figures have not yet been updated in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>, you should add a note to your Progress Report explaining variances.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Outputs forecast and results forecast</h2>

<p>Full and comprehensive information on actual performance against each individual Output and Result category for your project previous and current claim periods, as well as contracted target levels for the remaining claim periods, is required with every claim to support <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Contract Managers">CMs</abbr> in reviewing the performance of each project.</p>

<p>Figures must be broken down by Investment Priority and <abbr title="Category of Region">CoR</abbr>.</p>

<p>Variances from the contracted profiles, slippage, must be fully explained and justified within the Progress Report.</p>

<p>You will need to provide details of how your project plans to address any shortfall in the immediate, medium – and longer-term expenditure forecast, this will help inform conversations with your <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr>.</p>

<p>Any actual under performance with a variance greater than 15% from the contracted targets may result in de-commitment or withdrawal of <abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> funding in line with underperformance policy. Your <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> will discuss this with you if applicable. Any anticipated variances should be discussed with your <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> as soon as possible, who will consider whether a <abbr title="Project Change Request">PCR</abbr> is required.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Procurement</h2>

<p>All new procurement exercises, already undertaken or yet to be undertaken must be recorded in the Procurement Register in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> or Accountable Body should record any procurement exercise, undertaken by the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Grant Recipients</li>
  <li>Delivery Partner</li>
  <li>Accountable Bodies</li>
  <li>Local Grant Recipients</li>
  <li>Delivery Partners of Grant Recipients</li>
</ul>

<p>The first recorded exercise will be automatically allocated a Procurement Record <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> 1, any additional or subsequent procurement exercises added to the register will be allocated a sequential Procurement Record <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> of 2, 3 or 4.</p>

<p>Reference to any procurement exercises undertaken in this claim period should be included in the progress report and the relevant record on the procurement register completed with supporting evidence provided.</p>

<p>This should include details of any planned future procurements not already included in the Procurement Register in the Procurement section of your Progress Report including any procured contracts which are used as match-funding and . procurement costs which form part of any <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project Costs including procured staff costs.</p>

<p>For example, <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Direct Bid Projects using the 40% Flat Rate Indirect Cost option should complete the register if there has been procurement of any of the staff costs.</p>

<p>Where a procurement exercise has already been completed, and has not been reviewed, or fully reviewed at appraisal or <abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIV</abbr> stage, for example,</p>

<ul>
  <li>the procurement exercise has been undertaken or</li>
  <li>completed after the <abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIV</abbr> was finalised</li>
</ul>

<p>These will need to be reviewed by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> at the Desk-Based Administrative Checks (<abbr title="Desk Based Administrative Checks">DBAC</abbr>) stage and an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Public Procurement Checklist may need to be completed.</p>

<p>The Checklist is required for all Non-Contracting Authority procurement .</p>

<p>The Checklist is not required where a Contracting Authority has carried out a procurement exercise where the value is below £24,999.99.</p>

<p>In such cases, the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> undertaking the <abbr title="Desk Based Administrative Checks">DBAC</abbr> will still carry out existing, relevant procurement checks to ensure that you are aware of and adhering to the <abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> National Procurement Requirements.</p>

<p>Where the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Public Procurement Checklist is required, the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> will ask you to complete and return the checklist, together with any specified Core Documents relating to the procurement exercise.</p>

<p>In all cases the supporting Core Documents and completed checklist should be uploaded into <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> via the Procurement Register.</p>

<p>Note: it is suggested that Procurement exercises undertaken by delivery partners should be identified by adding the name of the Delivery Partner to the procurement title of description.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Public Procurement Checklist can be issued at any point as part of the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> <abbr title="Desk Based Administrative Checks">DBAC</abbr> process, however the review of any relevant procurement exercises must be finished before any costs from that procurement exercises are included in an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Claim.</p>

<p>Where a project has completed more than one procurement exercise a separate checklist may need to be completed for each individual procurement exercise.  Where a single procurement exercise has resulted in the award of a number of individual contracts, a single <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Procurement Checklist can be completed.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> undertaking the procurement checks is unable to obtain sufficient assurance that a Procurement exercise has been undertaken compliantly, they will consider whether expenditure relating to that procurement exercise should be excluded from the current and any future claims for the given <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project or whether a Financial Correction would be appropriate.  Depending on the seriousness of the issue the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> may also consider</p>

<ul>
  <li>terminating the FA for that <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project</li>
</ul>

<p>It may also be necessary to consider</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether other FA or MOUs linked to that procurement exercise should be terminated by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> has completed the relevant procurement checks, they will notify you of 	the outcome, and include details of any impacts on current and or future claims.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> will also update the Procurement Register in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> to show that the procurement checks have been completed.</p>

<p>Note: You must notify the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> of any instances where you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have decided not to progress with a planned procurement</li>
  <li>have withdrawn a contracted procurement</li>
  <li>will not be making purchases for the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project under a contracted procurement</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Progress Report</h2>

<p>A full and comprehensive narrative Progress Report with suitable commentary must be completed and submitted to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> with each quarterly claim.</p>

<p>The Progress Report must be recorded directly into the relevant fields in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> unless the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> has a prior agreement from the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> that 	they can submit their report as a separate document, uploaded into <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> as 		part of the package of claims documentation.</p>

<p><abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr>’s should note that they will still need to work through the Progress Report screens in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> in 		these circumstances before attaching their narrative report otherwise <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> will not allow submission of the claim.</p>

<p>A full and comprehensive narrative should be provided under all headings see annex1.</p>

<p>For example: the performance and progress of the project to date and the planned activity going forward must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide sufficient detail to demonstrate successful delivery of the activities and deliverables</li>
  <li>include the measures being put in place to bring the project back on track is there is any slippage of performance</li>
  <li>include any project specific updates as stipulated within the project specific conditions of your funding agreed or requested by our <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The Claim may be rejected on <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> if any of the information is incomplete or considered insufficient or incorrect.</p>

<p>As a minimum, for the Equal Opportunities element of their Progress Report, the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> should provide an update on the following within their narrative:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any improvements</li>
  <li>updates</li>
  <li>amendments</li>
  <li>details of performance against profile in terms of any equality targets; and any</li>
  <li>under-performance identified, and the mitigating or corrective action that will be taken that you have made during the claim instalment period in terms of the governance of the Equality and Diversity theme in your project.</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any progress in achieving aims during the claim instalment period</li>
  <li>any progress in achieving objectives during the claim instalment period</li>
</ul>

<p>These should be set out in your Equality and Diversity policy or implementation plan and supporting evidence provided.</p>

<p>As a minimum, for the Sustainable Development section of your Progress Report, the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> should provide an update on the following within their narrative:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any improvements</li>
  <li>updates</li>
  <li>amendments that you have made during the claim instalment period in terms of the governance of the Sustainable Development theme in your project.</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any progress in achieving aims during the claim instalment period</li>
  <li>any progress in achieving objectives during the claim instalment period</li>
</ul>

<p>These should be set out in your sustainable development policy or implementation plan and supporting evidence provided.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Desk-based evidence check (<abbr title="Desk Based Evidence Checks">DBEC</abbr>)</h2>

<p>Before the claim is paid, the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> may select and request the source documentation on a number of transaction items to test for evidence of defrayal. The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> External Users Guidance published here on GOV.UK explains how to view the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> request for evidence and how to upload your resulting documentation.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> will identify the specific documentation to be sampled and request the information via the Documentary Evidence Check button on <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>. You must upload the requested evidence into <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> within 7 working days and notify your <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> via email when the upload has taken place.</p>

<p>To minimise risks around the processing of personal data, please do not provide any evidence that is not specifically requested by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>.</p>

<p>If one or more items of requested evidence is not received with the original 7 working day deadline, the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Contract Manager will issue a reminder to the Grant Recipients to submit the evidence.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> still fails to provide the relevant evidence, the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> should consider rejecting the whole claim, given the failure of the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> to provide the full and comprehensive information required under their <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> FA.</p>

<p>Where a <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> is not able to provide full and comprehensive information for more than two Claim Periods in a row the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> may decide to pause processing of claims and or claim payments whilst they consider whether ‘event of default’ action or other penalties may be appropriate.</p>

<p>All evidence must be certified as a true copy of originals or supported by a covering letter which confirms that all documents are true copies of originals.  Certification must be confirmed by the project’s Authorised Signatories in line with scheme of delegation of the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr>.</p>

<p>If, on review of the evidence provided, the selected expenditure presents significant issues, then the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> will extend the sample to check that the issues are not systemic.  Where the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> chooses to extend the sample, they will raise a request through the ‘Queries’ function in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>. You will then be able to respond to <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> via the ‘Queries’ section in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> and upload all the additional evidence that has been requested. This will ensure there is an in-system audit of all action taken. You must formally respond to all queries via <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> even if you have provided the information verbally, or by email.  You should not tick the ‘Query Complete’ box despite the instruction to do so on <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr>.</p>

<p>The Checklist (below) lists examples of the types of questions the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> will consider when looking at a submitted claim and the relevant supporting documents (Part 1) and when undertaking the Desk-Based Evidence Checks (Part 2).</p>

<p><abbr title="Grant Recipients">GRs</abbr> must ensure that full and comprehensive information and supporting documents submitted as part of the claim itself, as well as any subsequent evidence or source documentation submitted to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> in response to Desk-Based Evidence Checks, satisfy the checks listed below.</p>

<p>Please note that, for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Direct Bid Projects defrayal checks on <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Direct Staff Costs have been reintroduced as part of the Desk Based Evidence Check (<abbr title="Desk Based Evidence Checks">DBEC</abbr>) processes from Q4 2018 claims onwards.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Direct Bid projects where staff salary costs are selected for <abbr title="Desk Based Evidence Checks">DBEC</abbr>, <abbr title="Grant Recipients">GRs</abbr> must be asked to provide defrayal evidence in the following cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>all cases where full-time or part-time staff are working all of their time on an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where a full-time or part-time member of staff is working some of their time on an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project and where the hourly rate for that individual pre-dates the introduction of the standard <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 1720 hourly rate calculation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Staff working part of their time on an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project and whose hourly rates are calculated using the 1720 hourly rate methodology or the Fixed Percentage methodology are exempt from any staff salary defrayal evidence checks at the Desk Based Evidence stage.</p>

<h4>Volunteer Time In-Kind</h4>

<p>Timesheets will be needed for all <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project staff who are being used as ‘Volunteer Time In-Kind’. This is regardless of whether they are working full-time or part-time, or whether they are working part or all of their time on the project. This is also regardless of the methodology used to calculate their notional salary costs.  As per the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme Guidance, this is because Volunteer Time In-Kind staff will not have any salary evidence or equivalent, so use of timesheets is a way of evidencing that they are actually in place and working as a volunteer on the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project.</p>

<h4>Checklist – Part 1</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Q1 Do all of the defrayal dates fall after the invoice dates?</p>

<h4>Summary of planned activities for the next Claim Instalment Period</h4>

<p>An outline of the key activities planned for the next Claim Instalment Period including any key dates or events. 
If there is any future major activity planned beyond the next Instalment Period. You should provide an update in this section. You will also need to report against any slippage in the current claim period that may impact the delivery of your project.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.4 </span>State Aid</h3>

<p>State Aid measures applicable to the project will have been identified at appraisal and will automatically feed through to the claims profile.  Provide update on State Aid received as a <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> and what State Aid has been dispersed to employer beneficiaries, including those relating to paid work placements and internships.</p>

<p>Your progress report must include a narrative explaining what checks have been undertaken to ensure that the project is operating State Aid processes in line with your <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> FA and the following published guidance on GOV.UK European Social Fund 2014 to 2020 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-state-aid">State Aid Guidance</a>. Your narrative should also explain how you have ensured a complete set of State Aid evidence is being retained in line with the published [<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Document Retention guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-document-retention/european-social-fund-document-retention-guidance]</p>

<p>You should also refer to the guidance issued in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/05821-change-to-state-aid-guidance-and-valuing-of-aid">Action Note 058/21</a> when considering the narrative for this section.</p>

<p>For projects which have a state aid exemption you Progress Report should reflect the exemption applicable.  The only exemptions applicable to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>De Minimis</li>
  <li>45030 Aid for Disadvantaged Workers General Block Exemption Regulation (<abbr title="General Block Exemption Regulation">GBER</abbr>)</li>
  <li>45031 Training Aid (<abbr title="General Block Exemption Regulation">GBER</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>All other exemptions are not applicable to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme. A blank exemption is a permissible response if either state aid does not apply or there has been no use of the agreed exemption within the claim instalment period.</p>

<p>In addition, the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> must also ensure they have valued the aid appropriately and provided detail on the methodology used by the project. In the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> programme there are two methods permissible for valuing aid. Method 1 is the preferred approach and should be used by projects, and only where in exceptional cases should the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> Use Method 2. Details on the methods are provided below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Method 1 relates to an average of the costs if that support was bought privately. Using this method, the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> will need to explain how they have calculated that average, for example through comparison of three other suppliers and calculating the average of the costs based on this information; or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Method 2 relates to their real costs (such as the hourly rate of the member of staff who is providing the support, plus the 15 or 40% <abbr title="Flat Rate Indirect Costs">FRIC</abbr> attributed to that salary. The <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> should use the hourly rate applied to the member of staff undertaking the cost with an uplift of the appropriate <abbr title="Flat Rate Indirect Costs">FRIC</abbr> for the project by the number of hours to complete the task to identify the level of aid.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These are the only methods available for use. No other methodology proposed by <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> can be used.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.5 </span>Valuing Aid – worked examples</h3>

<h4>Method 1</h4>

<p>A <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> is providing a Small and Medium size Enterprises (<abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr>) with a Training Needs Analysis, and then developing a training plan for a group of the staff who work for the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr>.</p>

<p>In this case, the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> takes an average of the costs 3 other providers would charge the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> for this activity, so, for example;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Joe Bloggs Training Ltd would charge £1,500 for a TNA for an <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> with less than 50 employees, and a further £500 for a training plan, giving a total of £2,000</li>
  <li>Jane Doe College Services Ltd would charge £1,350 for a TNA and a further £700 for a bespoke training plan, so total would be £2,050</li>
  <li>Training R Us Ltd would charge £1,700 for the TNA, and include the bespoke training plan free of charge</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, the average of these providers would be (£2,000 + £2,050 + £1,700 = £5,750 divided by 3) £1,916.67 worth of aid.</p>

<p>If the project is using the De Minimis route, this would be the amount of De Minimis aid that they need to tell the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> that they have received. If the project is using the <abbr title="General Block Exemption Regulation">GBER</abbr>, this is the total aid amount, and they will need to seek the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> contribution to this total (under Training Aid for example, the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> must contribute 50% of these costs, so the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> would need to invoice the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> for £958.34).</p>

<h4>Method 2</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> is providing an <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> with a Training Needs Analysis, and then developing a training plan for a group of the staff who work for the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr>, as above.</p>

<p>In this case, the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> should take the hourly rate for the member of staff doing the Training Needs Analysis, include the Flat Rate Indirect Cost (<abbr title="Flat Rate Indirect Costs">FRIC</abbr>) uplift, then multiply that by the number of hours taken to carry out the Training Needs Analysis and development of the plan for example, £27:15 per hour (including 15% <abbr title="Flat Rate Indirect Costs">FRIC</abbr>) x 43 hours = £1,167.45 worth of aid.</p>

<p>If De Minimis applies, this is the amount of De Minimis aid the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> will need to inform the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> they have received, and if they are using the <abbr title="General Block Exemption Regulation">GBER</abbr> they will need to invoice the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> for 50% of the costs (£583.73).</p>

<p>For those claims where either of the <abbr title="General Block Exemption Regulation">GBER</abbr> exemptions outlined above are acceptable against the project the progress report should also include the value of aid for the claim instalment period. However, although the value of aid is not a requirement where De Minimis applies the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> is still required to have calculated the value of aid using one of the methodologies above to ensure the aid is calculated and reported on for the purposes of 3-year €200,000 ceiling.</p>

<p>A response of Not Applicable is not acceptable on any aspect of State Aid, including the valuing method, level of aid and the exemption applied. If you record a response of Not Applicable or equivalent, the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> will not be able to approve your claim. Instead, they will refer your claim back to you, requesting that you provide an updated, acceptable response.</p>

<p>If you have assessed at application stage, that State Aid does not apply to your project you should confirm here that that there has been no change, and that you have assessed that State Aid is not relevant to this claim. 
If your assessment of State Aid has changed you should discuss this separately with your <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.8 </span>Branding and Publicity</h3>

<p>Report on any publicity activity that has taken place during the Claim Instalment Period.  This may include publicity material, leaflets, banners or stationery and any press releases, newspaper articles or publicity events. Review any evidence uploaded referring to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-structural-and-investment-funds-programme-guidance">Branding and publicity requirements for the 2014 to 2020 European Regional Development Fund and European Social Fund</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.9 </span>Procurement</h3>

<p>Reference to any completed procurement exercises as well as any planned future procurements should be included in the Procurement’ section of your Progress Report, this includes any procured contracts which are used as match funding.</p>

<p>Where there are procurements that have already been completed, that have not been reviewed, or fully reviewed at appraisal or <abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIV</abbr> stage – for example, the procurement exercise has been undertaken or completed after the <abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIV</abbr> was finalised - these will need to be reviewed at the Desk-Based Administrative Checks (<abbr title="Desk Based Administrative Checks">DBAC</abbr>) stage and an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Public Procurement Checklist may need to be completed.</p>

<p>The Checklist is not required where a Contracting Authority has carried out a procurement exercise where the value is below £24,999.99.</p>

<p>In such cases, the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> undertaking the <abbr title="Desk Based Administrative Checks">DBAC</abbr> will still carry out existing, relevant procurement checks to ensure the CFO is aware of and adhering to the <abbr title="European Structural and Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> National Procurement Requirements published on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Where the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Public Procurement Checklist is required, you will be asked to complete and return the checklist to the Contract Manager, together with any specified ‘Core Documents’ relating to that procurement exercise.</p>

<p>Generally, all supporting Core Document and completed checklist should be uploaded into <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> against the relevant <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> on the procurement register.</p>

<p>Note: it is suggested, to help identify any procurement exercise undertaken by delivery partners, local grant recipients and delivery partners of local grant recipients, that their name is added to the procurement title or description.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Public Procurement Checklist can be issued at any point in the <abbr title="Desk Based Administrative Checks">DBAC</abbr> process, however, the review of any relevant procurement exercises must be finished before any costs from that procurement exercises are included in an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Claim.</p>

<p>Where you have completed more than one procurement exercise a separate checklist should be completed for each individual procurement exercise.</p>

<p>Where a single procurement exercise has resulted in the award of a number of individual contracts, a single <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Public Procurement Checklist can be completed.</p>

<p>In all cases you should ensure that you upload any supporting Core Documents into <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> against the relevant <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> on the procurement register.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> undertaking the procurement checks is unable to obtain sufficient assurance that a Procurement exercise has been undertaken compliantly, they will consider whether expenditure relating to that procurement exercise should be excluded from the current and any future claims for the given <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project, or whether a Financial Correction would be appropriate.</p>

<p>Depending on the seriousness of the issue, the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> may also consider whether the FA for that <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project should be terminated by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>. Depending on the seriousness of the issue, it may also be necessary to consider whether other CFO MOUs or FAs linked to that procurement exercise should be terminated by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Once the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> has completed the relevant procurement checks, they will notify you of the outcome, including any impacts on current and, or future claims. The <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> will also update the Procurement Register in <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> with details of that procurement exercise.</p>

<p>You must notify the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> of any instances where you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have decided not to progress with a planned procurement</li>
  <li>have withdrawn a contracted procurement</li>
  <li>will not be making purchases for the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project under a contracted procurement.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Assets</h4>

<p>Not applicable to <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> - Input No Assets in claim period.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span>Annex 6: Common claim errors</h2>

<p>Based on the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme claims received to-date, the following are good practices recommended for all <abbr title="Grant Recipients">GRs</abbr> to avoid queries and support the submission of admissible, ‘right first time’ claims.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.1 </span>Transaction list</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Descriptions of expenditure in Transaction Lists should be sufficiently detailed to enable the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> to immediately understand what exactly the expenditure is so that it can be readily checked and confirmed as eligible. Descriptions should not include abbreviations or jargon which the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> may not understand.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where ‘Other Direct Costs’ are directly related to a specific participant (such as, childcare costs, travel costs), the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> must include the participant unique identifier from the Participant Data Schema in the expenditure description in the Transaction List, to allow the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> to attribute the costs to a valid participant.  Actual participant names must not be included in the Transaction List or Participant Data Schema.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where applicable, a clear description of the apportionment between <abbr title="Category of Region">CoR</abbr>, Investment Priorities, <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> and Match and (if applicable) <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr>, should be noted in the Apportionment Details column, so the Managing Authority can understand how, from the total invoice value, the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> has arrived at the total eligible amount.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total invoice value must exclude <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Flat Rate Indirect Cost indicator must only be set to ‘Y’ against applicable, eligible staff costs. The indicator must not be set to ‘Y’ for any costs which are ‘Other Direct Costs’</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.2 </span>Participant Data Schema</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure you are using the correct, latest version <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-claim-applications-and-self-declared-adjustments">Participant Data Schema</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the participant data has been added via the relevant drop-down boxes, and the export sheet has been created, do not overtype any of the information in the Participant Data Schema, before uploading it to <abbr title="Electronic Claims and Information Management System">ECLAIMS</abbr> – this will risk validation errors and or may result in the wrong <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> being reported for your project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Report all participant related <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> output and results in a single Participant Data Schema for each quarterly claim. This will support accurate sampling for desk-based checks, speeding the claims approval and payment process.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">18. </span>Annex 7: Output and results scenarios</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.1 </span>Scenario 1 – Participant starts <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> intervention and all data is complete at point of starting.</h3>

<p>In this scenario, any appropriate Programme Specific and Common Output indicators are captured at the point the starting information is declared on the Participant Data Schema (<abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr>) to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>. See illustrated example below.</p>

<p>Guidance:</p>

<p>Section 3.1.1 page 10 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/sfc/en/system/files/ged/ESF%20monitoring%20and%20evaluation%20guidance.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Monitoring and Evaluation guidance refers</a>:</p>

<p>In order to fulfil the data completeness requirement, data on participants shall be complete with regard to all common output indicators covering personal non-sensitive data: Gender, employment status, age, education level, and household situation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.2 </span>Scenario 2 – Participant starts <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> intervention and all data is complete at point of starting, then participant leaves <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> intervention and all data is complete at point of leaving.</h3>

<p>In this scenario, any appropriate Programme Specific and Common Output indicators are captured at the point the starting information is declared on the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>. Any appropriate Programme Specific and Common Result indicators are captured at the point the leaving information is declared on the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>. See illustrated example below.</p>

<p>Guidance:</p>

<p>Section 3.4.1 page 18 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/sfc/en/system/files/ged/ESF%20monitoring%20and%20evaluation%20guidance.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Monitoring and Evaluation guidance</a> refers: (Data Recording and Storage);</p>

<p>The individual participants’ data for all person-related indicators must be recorded and stored in a way that allows a Member State to perform the tasks it is legally required to perform. Therefore, all records should include, as a minimum: an identifier for the operation/project; a personal identifier that allows an individual to be traced and re-contacted; dates of starting and leaving an operation; and access to values for all variables needed for indicators.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.3 </span>Scenario 1 and 2 Example:</h3>

<p>A participant joins a single project within an operation, completes the planned activity and leaves.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/115898/Claims_Guidance_single_project.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>In the scenario above a participant joins a single project within an operation, completes the planned activity and leaves.</p>

<p>In the first stage the participant is interviewed and referred to a 3 month training scheme. The Output indicators on entry, refer to their situation on entry to the operation, which is their situation on the first day of training.</p>

<p>All information collected at interview and the referral point must be verified.</p>

<p>The participant then undertakes 3 months training.</p>

<p>Intermediate result indicators refer to the participant’s situation at point of exit from the operation (in this case the leaving date), or within 4 weeks after.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.4 </span>Scenario 3 – Participant starts <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> intervention and all data is complete at point of starting, then leaves intervention early and leaving data is complete.</h3>

<p>In this scenario, any appropriate Programme Specific and Common Output indicators are captured at the point the starting information is declared on the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>. Any appropriate Programme Specific and Common Result indicators are captured at the point the leaving information is declared on the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Scenario 3 Example:</p>

<p>A participant joins a single project with an operation but does not complete the planned activity and therefore leaves earlier than expected.  The leaving date, and therefore the point to which immediate results indicators should apply, is always the date that the participant leaves the operation and not the planned exit date.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/116559/Claims_Guidance_not_complete.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>In the scenario above, a participant is interviewed and then referred to training.</p>

<p>In the first stage the participant is interviewed and referred a 3 months training scheme. The Output indicators on entry, refer to their situation on entry to the operation. So in this scenario it is their situation on the first day of the training scheme.</p>

<p>All information collected at interview and the referral point must be verified.</p>

<p>The participant joins a single project which in this case is planned as a 3 months training scheme. However, in this scenario they do not complete the planned activity as they leave at the end of month 2, 1 month earlier than expected.</p>

<p>The immediate results indicators refers to situation on exit from the operation. So, their actual leaving date, is always the date that the participant leaves the operation and not the planned exit date. The outcome can be reported, or updated should it change, within 4 weeks of the date of leaving.</p>

<p>Note for Youth Employment Initiative (<abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr>) supported operations, information about whether a participant completes the intervention or not is important for some of the <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr> indicators (see section 5.10.1).</p>

<p>Guidance: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/sfc/en/system/files/ged/Annex%20D%20-%20Practical%20guidance%20on%20data%20collection%20and%20validation.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Annex D – Practical Guidance on data collection and validation</a> refers.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.5 </span>Scenario 4 – Participant starts <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> intervention and all data is complete at point of starting, then leaves intervention early and leaving data is incomplete.</h3>

<p>In this scenario, any appropriate Programme Specific and Common Output indicators are captured at the point the starting information is declared on the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr> to the Managing Authority. No Programme Specific or Common Result data can be captured as the leaving data is incomplete.</p>

<p>Note: Incomplete leaving data could include date of leaving. It is important that projects have a policy in place to establish an appropriate leaving date, for participants who leave their intervention early. For example, a participant does not attend a planned intervention and the project is unable to contact them. The project has a policy that provides for 2 planned interventions to be missed without contact. If the participant fails to attend the second intervention, the project will record the participant as a leaver.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.6 </span>Scenario 5 – Participant starts <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> intervention and data is incomplete at point of starting.</h3>

<p>In this scenario, the participant will not count towards any Programme Specific or Common Output indicators.</p>

<p>Note: Participants falling into this category must still be declared to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> on the <abbr title="Participant Data Schema">PDS</abbr>. The <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> is required to provide a count of incomplete records to the European Commission (<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>).</p>

<p>Guidance: Section 3.1.1 page 10 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/sfc/en/system/files/ged/ESF%20monitoring%20and%20evaluation%20guidance.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Monitoring and Evaluation guidance</a> refers:</p>

<p>There is no single common indicator in SFC capturing the grand total number of participants (including those for which the common output indicators covering personal non-sensitive data could not be collected). Nevertheless, this grand total number of participants shall be reported by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> in the framework of the <abbr title="Annual Implementation Reports">AIRs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Section 2.3.7 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/sfc/en/system/files/ged/Annex%20D%20-%20Practical%20guidance%20on%20data%20collection%20and%20validation.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Annex D – Practical Guidance on data collection and validation</a> refers: Grand total of participants.</p>

<p>The “grand total of participants” covers all supported participants, including those for which the basic data (for example, the common output indicators covering personal non-sensitive data) could not be collected or are incomplete. This total should be reported in the last row of Table 4A of the <abbr title="Annual Information Report">AIR</abbr> (see section 3.1.1 of the <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> Guidance document on Monitoring and Evaluation).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.7 </span>Scenario 6 – Participant returns to an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> operation, after previously participating in an intervention within the same operation.</h3>

<p>In this scenario, any previous results relating to this participant are no longer valid. It is only possible to record the results relevant to the latest intervention.</p>

<p>Scenario 6 – Example</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/116560/Claims_Guidance_participant_returns.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>In the scenario above a participant is interviewed and then referred to training.</p>

<p>In the first stage the participant is interviewed and referred to language training.  The Output indicators on entry, refer to their situation on entry to the operation, which is their situation on the first day of language training.</p>

<p>All information collected at interview and the referral point must be verified.</p>

<p>After 2 months the participant leaves the language training for 1 month’s employment.  The date the participant left the language training is their original Leaving date. This is the original exit date.</p>

<p>When their one month’s employment finishes the participant re-enters an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> operation. On re-entry, remove existing leaving date and associated immediate result data.</p>

<p>The participant then undertakes Skills Training and Further language training
Leaving date.  In this scenario, any previous results relating to this participant are no longer valid. It is only possible to record the results relevant to the latest intervention.</p>

<p>Record new leaving date (the date of last exit from the operation) and corresponding immediate result data.</p>
