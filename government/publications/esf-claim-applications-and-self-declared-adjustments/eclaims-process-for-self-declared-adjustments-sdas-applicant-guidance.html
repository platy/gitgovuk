<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Self-Declared Adjustments (SDAs)</h2>

<p>Where a Grant Recipient (<abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr>) identifies voluntarily that an error has been made in a claim which has already been paid by the European Social Fund (<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>) Managing Authority (<abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>), the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> can submit an <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> (CPR Article 122(2) (b)).</p>

<p>When a <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> submits an <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr>, the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> will review the type of error, the circumstances under which it occurred and the pattern of other SDAs and Irregularities relating to the same project. The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> will then decide if the issue reported via the new <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> should be treated as a Technical or Clerical Adjustment (<abbr title="Technical or Clerical Adjustment">TCA</abbr>) or instead be treated as an Irregularity.</p>

<p>If an error reported by the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> is treated as a <abbr title="Technical or Clerical Adjustment">TCA</abbr> by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> will need to repay the funds and those funds can then be re-cycled into the same <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project for use as part of a later, valid claim.</p>

<p>If an error reported by the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> is treated as an Irregularity by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>, again the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> will need to repay the funds, however those funds cannot be re-cycled into the same <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project. The contracted value for the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project will therefore be reduced by the total value of the Irregularity and those funds will not be available for re-use by that <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project.</p>

<p>Where you need to repay funds affected by an <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr>, your Contract Manager (<abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr>) (or <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> Lead) will confirm how these funds will be recovered from you for example via offsetting against a future claim or, if the final claim has already been paid for your <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project, via Demand Note or Debt Recovery processes.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> can be submitted at any time, see paragraph below.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> must link to a claim period which has already been paid and usually be within the same calendar year the claim was made. If an <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> is submitted outside this period, the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> will consider these declarations on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>If a <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> submits an <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> Adjustment after they have been notified that the same <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project has been selected for an Article 125 On-The-Spot Visit, or Article 127 Audit Authority (<abbr title="Audit Authority">AA</abbr>) visit, but the visit has not yet taken place, or the visit has taken place and the associated outcomes are still being finalised by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> or <abbr title="Audit Authority">AA</abbr>, the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> will usually be treated as an Irregularity.</p>

<p>Where a <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> is notified that their <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project has been selected for an article 125 or 127 inspections, but there is an existing error they have already identified but not yet submitted via <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr>, the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> should collate evidence of detection and other details of the error as usual, including the date the error was identified and evidence of the identification date and ensure this information is uploaded into ECLAIMS as part of the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> will then consider this information â including the date of error detection in comparison to the date the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> was notified of the upcoming A125 or A127 visit - when deciding if the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> should be treated as a <abbr title="Technical or Clerical Adjustment">TCA</abbr> or an Irregularity.</p>

<p>Where a <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> has been notified that their <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project has been selected for audit by another audit body for example. National Audit Office (<abbr title="National Audit Office">NAO</abbr>), European Commission Auditors (<abbr title="European Commission Audit">ECA</abbr>), then SDAs should not be submitted for that <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project until the relevant <abbr title="National Audit Office">NAO</abbr> or <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> audit has been completed</p>

<p>In all cases, where an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project submits an <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr>, but the same <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project has made the same or similar errors in the past, but they have failed to sufficiently rectify their systems to avoid the same errors again, the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> may choose to treat the new <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> as an Irregularity, rather than a <abbr title="Technical or Clerical Adjustment">TCA</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> should contact the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> prior to entering any SDAs on ECLAIMS to discuss the issue they are trying to resolve and agree whether an <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> is appropriate. If an <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> is agreed, the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> should also notify their <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> by email once they have completed submission of the relevant <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr>.</p>

<p>SDAs should only be used to correct or deduct monies from previous claim and only where the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> has paid more funds than they are entitled to as a result of the error.</p>

<p>If a <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> identifies an error which means they may have under-claimed funds in their previous claims, this should not be corrected via the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> process.</p>

<p>Instead, the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> should include the missing expenditure in their next quarterly claim, ensuring the relevant expenditure description explains the reason for this element of the claim.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> should also be able to provide the relevant documentary evidence relating to that expenditure if the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> selects that expenditure for a claims check.</p>

<p>For example, a <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> incurs an invoice cost of Â£110 <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> costs from a supplier. However, in their next claim they mis-claim and only request Â£100 <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> for that expenditure and the claim is then paid by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>.</p>

<p>As a result of a later internal check, the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> realises they have under- claimed Â£10 <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>. The <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> can include an expenditure line for the Â£10 <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> funding in their next claim, explaining this is a Â£10 under-claim against a previous total invoice amount of Â£110 <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>.</p>

<p>If selected for an evidence check, the original evidence of the invoice will be needed, together with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an explanation of which previous, paid <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> claim the under-claimed expenditure relates to</li>
  <li>the Transaction Line <abbr title="Identity">ID</abbr> number for the original, under-claimed expenditure</li>
  <li>and the descriptor wording used in the previous claim for that under-claimed item of expenditure</li>
</ul>

<p>Prior to the submission of any under-claimed funds in a new <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> claim, the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> should discuss this with their <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr>.</p>

<p>If, once the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> has considered all the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> information, they decide to treat the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> as a <abbr title="Technical or Clerical Adjustment">TCA</abbr> this will be recorded in ECLAIMS and the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> will show in the system as Converted to <abbr title="Technical or Clerical Adjustment">TCA</abbr>.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> decided to treat an <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> as an Irregularity, this again will be recorded in ECLAIMS, and the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> will show in the system as Converted to Irregularity.</p>

<p>In both cases the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> will notify the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> of the outcome of their <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Irregularities</h2>

<p>Definition: CPR Article 2 (36): irregularity means any breach of Union law, or of national law relating to its application, resulting from an act or omission by an economic operator involved in the implementation of the European Structural Investment Funds (<abbr title="European Structural Investment Funds">ESIF</abbr>), which has, or would have, the effect of prejudicing the budget of the Union by charging an unjustified item of expenditure to the budget of the Union.</p>

<p>To reduce the risk of <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> incurring and claiming ineligible expenditure, below are examples of common irregularities, please note this list is not exhaustive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>missing items of paperwork such as invoices or bank statements</li>
  <li>costs not defrayed or paid by the lead applicant or partner (of a consortium type project)</li>
  <li>deficiencies in the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Projectâs management and control systems</li>
  <li>failure to retain, share and protect project documentation in line with <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> guidance</li>
  <li>failure to adhere to <abbr title="European Structural Investment Funds">ESIF</abbr> Branding and Publicity Guidance for example, not displaying posters or logos on project documentation</li>
  <li>using an unapproved apportionment methodology for shared overhead costs</li>
  <li>not undertaking a fair, open, transparent, and competitive procurement exercise in line with <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Regulations</li>
  <li>staff costs, including any applicable hourly rate and or fixed rate methodologies, not calculated in line with the agreed methodology, <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Eligibility Rules or <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme Guidance</li>
  <li>any over-claiming for the costs of items, services or staff included in a claim to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>.</li>
  <li>no evidence, insufficient evidence or ineligible evidence to substantiate participant claimed outputs such as on programme, completions, progression, achievement and job outcomes</li>
  <li>no evidence, insufficient evidence or ineligible evidence to support outputs or results</li>
  <li>costs claimed for activities that are not project specific or within the correct priority axis or investment priority</li>
  <li>failure to adhere to State Aid regulations</li>
  <li>no evidence or insufficient evidence to demonstrate a participant is eligible for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> support</li>
  <li>claiming for staff not detailed in the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Funding Agreement (<abbr title="Funding Agreement">FA</abbr>) or Application or a subsequent updated staff list agreed in advance with the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> decision on whether an error reported via the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> route should be treated as a <abbr title="Technical or Clerical Adjustment">TCA</abbr> or an Irregularity.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>How to report and submit a Self-Declared Adjustment</h2>

<p>All SDAs should be submitted by the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> using the ECLAIMS IT system.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> should contact the <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> prior to entering any SDAs on ECLAIMS to discuss the issue they are trying to resolve and agree whether an <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> is appropriate.</p>

<p>If an <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> is agreed, the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> should also notify their <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> via email once they have completed submission of the relevant <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr>.</p>

<p>When calculating and inputting the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> value, the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> should ensure that Flat Rate Indirect Costs (<abbr title="Flat Rate Indirect Costs">FRIC</abbr>) are not included in the recorded <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> value by their ECLAIMS <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> Editor.</p>

<p>If the affected error has any related <abbr title="Flat Rate Indirect Costs">FRIC</abbr> costs, these will automatically be calculated and added by the ECLAIMS system.</p>

<p>GRs should identify staff to perform the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> Editor role, this will be formalised within ECLAIMS once the ECLAIMS external user access form has been completed.</p>

<p><abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> Editors are tasked with creating and submitting the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> on behalf of the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr>, including collating all the relevant information in the form and associated documents and ensuring supporting documents are uploaded to ECLAIMS as part of the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> should ensure that each <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> recorded in ECLAIMS is accurate and that the information recorded includes the following details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how was the error discovered â by whom and as part of what checks</li>
  <li>the date of discovery</li>
  <li>which transaction lines are affected in each previously paid claim</li>
  <li>the amount of funding affected</li>
  <li>the remedial action taken to reduce the risk of the same error occurring again in future</li>
  <li>all supporting calculation information for example exact calculation breakdown and or comparison of costs claimed vs costs which should have been claimed, which has been used to determine the amount of the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>for delegated <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> non-<abbr title="Community Led Local Development">CLLD</abbr> grant projects using Delegated Grant Defrayal Model 2 (set out in Action Note 026/18 on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/734118/026-18_defrayal_for_ESF_delegated_grant_schemes.pdf" rel="external">GOV.UK</a>) Only, if a local <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> organisation has returned unspent grant funding to the Accountable Body but the Accountable Body has already claimed and been paid this grant funding by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> the supporting evidence for the resulting  <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> should also include details of the defrayed, original grant funding payment to the local <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> as well as the reason for the return of funds by the local <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Failure to provide this information may result in the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> being rejected.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> will only be processed once the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> has sufficient information to make a decision on how the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> should be treated. If the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> does not have sufficient information, they will return the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> to the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> via ECLAIMS, requesting the missing information.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> will then need to address the issues raised by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> and then re-submit the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr>, again using ECLAIMS.</p>

<p>When the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> Editor logs into ECLAIMS, from the options menu. Select Self-Declared Adjustments.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> home screen is then displayed and shows any existing SDAs for the same <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project. To create a new <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr>, select Add new <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> Editor must complete the Details and Financial Breakdown by Category sections in turn by selecting next.</p>

<p>The Action section is optional, History is automatically populated by the system.</p>

<p>When Save Draft is selected, this will show in the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> home screen with a status of created and it can be edited. Only select Submit when the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> Editor has fully completed all relevant sections and the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> Reviewer has approved the content.</p>

<p>Populate the fields in the Details screen:</p>

<p>Source: ensure Self-Declared Adjustment is populated here.</p>

<p>Other Reference: is an optional free text box, the editor can enter any references their project has used for this <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Date Detected: Date the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> was identified.</p>

<p>Name: is a free text box, insert the name of the officer who detected the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Function: this is a free text box, insert the function of the officerâs role.</p>

<p>Workplace or team options: ensure <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> is populated here.</p>

<p>Comment: is an optional free text box, enter any additional, supporting information or comments here not already recorded in the previous fields</p>

<p>Select Next to continue to the following section Financial Breakdown by Category.</p>

<p>In the Financial Breakdown by Category section, the drop-down menu will not work, the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> Editor must select Add new category first.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/159047/Picture4.jpg"></div></figure>
<p>Image above shows the Financial Breakdown by Category screen add new category must be selected first.</p>

<p>All submitted claims will appear at the top of the screen, from here, the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> Editor must select the claim the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> refers to using the tick box then select View Transactions. This will enable the editor to select the applicable transaction.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/159048/Picture5.jpg"></div></figure>
<p>Image above shows the transaction, the applicable one must be selected.</p>

<p>Once the transactions relative to the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> have been selected, click the Categorise transactions link which is located at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>There will be two drop down menus at the top of the screen (you may need to scroll up the page), use the first Category drop down menu to select the area the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> falls under, for example expenditure, publicity or contractual etc.</p>

<p>Using the Subcategory drop down menu, select an option that most appropriately describes the nature of the error. In this case we have selected expenditure in the main category field and duplicate items in the subcategory field.</p>

<p>The Description field should be used to enter precise details of the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> such as the type of funding â <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> or Match, its value. Please refer to section 3.4 of this guidance for required details.</p>

<p>Under File, there is the function to upload supporting documentation. If you have not done so in the Description box, you must upload an explanation regarding the expenditure here together with a copy of any supporting calculations. Only the following file types should be uploaded to ECLAIMS:.xlsx / .doc / .docx / .pdf / .txt</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>NOTE: When you select âbrowseâ you will be able to select the relevant document from your electronic folder(s). You will then be presented with some additional fields to record the File Description and File Category for that document.</p>

<p>Please ensure supporting documents are uploaded with a clear, appropriate file name and with a unique version number recorded in the File Description field.</p>

<p>The document file name must also include the ESF claim periods covered by the SDA for example 2018Q1, 2018Q2.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>SDA Breakdown Calculation â 2018Q1 2018Q2 â V1.0</p>

<p>When uploading each document, you should also include you select the File Category; âIrregularities Letter or Reportâ for all SDA supporting documents.</p>
</div>

<p>If you have more than one supporting document to upload, select Add Another. Once you have uploaded all supporting documents, click OK to continue.</p>

<p>Next, on the same Financial Breakdown by Category screen, select Edit against each transaction line in each claim where you need to record an <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> error value for that transaction line.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/159049/Picture6.jpg"></div></figure>
<p>Image shows financial breakdown by Category</p>

<p>Enter the total <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> adjustment value (<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> + Match minus costs) for example how much overspend there is, ensuring you never use negative values select save.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>NOTE: When calculating the ESF plus Match figure to record in this field, you do not need to include any Flat Rate Indirect Costs applicable to that expenditure.</p>

<p>ECLAIMS will automatically check that line to see if there were any Flat Rate Indirect Costs (FRIC) included in that line of expenditure and, if so, ECLAIMS will add on any extra FRIC costs before doing a final calculation using the correct intervention rate and presenting you with an accurate, grand total figure.</p>
</div>

<p>If your <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project covers more than one Category of Region (CoR), you will be presented with a box to complete for each CoR.</p>

<p>Please record the relevant <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> amount per individual CoR per selected transaction line.</p>

<p>Once you have completed the correct figures, select Save and repeat for each claim and line item affected by the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> Editor will return to the screen below. From this screen there are options for editing the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> if required.</p>

<p>Using the drop-down menus at the top of the screen, the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> Editor must select the category and sub-category to be amended.</p>

<p>A summary for that category will be displayed below showing the details entered, then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to change either the claim, transaction, financial category (drop down), description or attachments for a category, select Edit Category. Follow steps from 4.8 to 4.17 in this guidance document, make amendments where necessary by selecting the appropriate content</li>
  <li>save Changes must be selected to continue</li>
  <li>to amend the breakdown, reselect edit</li>
  <li>to delete a category, use both drop down menus to select the relevant category and select Delete Category</li>
  <li>to add more categories, select Add new Category which will take the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> Editor back to earlier step, proceed as normal</li>
  <li>once all categories have been added, select Next to continue</li>
</ul>

<p>Action is optional, it allows further specific <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> details to be entered, if required, click on insert. Select Next to proceed.</p>

<p>If you have submitted your <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>, but the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> has returned the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> to you for further information and or action, you can record the action you have taken in this screen before re-submitting your <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>.</p>

<p>In each case, once you have recorded your comments select Insert to ensure your comments are saved.</p>

<p>The final screen History will display any history relating to the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr>, including any amendments made by the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> Editor or Reviewer.</p>

<p>From here, the editor can either save as a draft or submit. The <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> Editor should select Save draft and once the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> Reviewer is content the information is accurate, they should select Submit, then contact their <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> to notify them that the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> has been submitted to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> Editor or Reviewer will return to the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> home screen which will display the SDAs and its status:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> Editor has selected Save draft the status will show as created and can be edited</li>
  <li>when the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> Reviewer has selected Submit this will show as draft and cannot be edited</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> has been saved as a draft, the option to Delete will also appear. If this option is selected, a confirmation message will appear. Once yes has been selected, the draft <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> will be removed from the system.</p>

<p>Once the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> has reviewed your <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> and decided on the relevant action, they will record the outcome in ECLAIMS.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> (or <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> Lead) will also notify you of the outcome, including any relevant arrangements that will be used to recover the affected funds from you.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Double Corrections</h2>

<p>Double or multiple corrections are acceptable as long as the corrections are for different reasons and take other corrections into account where appropriate.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> should carefully consider whether previous corrections have already been raised on the claim period.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> should discuss this with their <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> prior to raising an <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> on ECLAIMS.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Extrapolated Error</h2>

<p>If your audit trail is not in place to evidence the data submissions, you have made then the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> will recover the funds paid to you.</p>

<p>Errors found in a sample of your data could be extrapolated to give an error over your whole <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> contract. Extrapolated errors will be input by the <abbr title="Audit Authority">AA</abbr> and apply to the entire claim period.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Audit Authority">AA</abbr> will calculate the extrapolated (or projected) irregular amount and input the figure on to ECLAIMS.</p>

<p>Projects should be aware that if the appropriate evidence and audit trail is not available for audit purposes, an auditor may be unable to quantify the expenditure as a direct cost.</p>

<p>The cost would therefore be deemed ineligible and corrective action by the project would be required â this may include repayment of any direct costs claimed which are not eligible or a higher figure extrapolated from the sample where the ineligible costs are discovered.</p>

<p>In cases where an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project is asked to pay costs to an organisation via internal cost transfer or a similar method, but that organisation has not incurred an actual, direct cost, the affected costs cannot be claimed from the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> as a direct cost as there will be no supporting evidence of defrayal from the parent organisation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Negative Transactions</h2>

<p>ECLAIMS will allow the submission of negative transactions. <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> must agree the use of these within their claims with either their <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> or <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> Lead within the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where a negative transaction forms part of the financial correction, any confirmation must take in to account the impact of that negative transaction on the financial correction and the corresponding positive transaction to which it relates.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Project Financial Profile</h2>

<p>The Project Financial Profile (PFP) Table shows the financial position of the project, in particular funds available to spend and the cumulative value of expenditure recovered due to Irregularities and <abbr title="Technical or Clerical Adjustment">TCA</abbr> combined, and expenditure recycled solely related to TCAs. You can access the Project Financial Profile table from the Options menu on the Project main screen.</p>

<p>An explanation of the different fields in the Project Financial Profile table can be found below:</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/159050/Picture7.jpg"></div></figure>
<p>Image above shows a populated example of the Project Financial Profile Screen.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> have decided that the expenditure should be treated as an Irregularity, the funds will be recovered but will not be recycled back to the project.</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Original Contracted Budget value will not change</li>
  <li>deductions will increase to reflect the value of the new Irregularity (Note: The Deductions figure is the total value of all Irregularities and TCAs)</li>
  <li>amount Recycled will not change because funds relating to Irregularities are not recycled back to the project</li>
  <li>the Net Contracted Budget applicable to your <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project will reduce. You will then only be able to commit and spend funding up to the value of your revised Net Contracted Budget figure</li>
</ul>

<p>In the example below, a Â£1,351.15 Irregularity, has been processed on a project that is 50% <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> funded and 50% match funded.</p>

<p>You will see on the left side of the screen.</p>

<ul>
  <li>a Â£1,351.15 Deduction</li>
  <li>the Net Contracted Budget has reduced by Â£1,351.15 of Â£1,999,648.45</li>
  <li>he original contracted budget remains unchanged</li>
</ul>

<p>On the right side of the screen, you will see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Â£1,351.15 Deduction has been split to reflect the 50% <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> value. (Â£675.58)</li>
  <li>the Net Contracted budget has reduced to reflect the deduction</li>
  <li>the Original Contracted Budget remains unchanged</li>
</ul>

<p>If the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> have decided that expenditure is to be treated as a <abbr title="Technical or Clerical Adjustment">TCA</abbr>, funds will be recovered from the projects finances before being recycled back to the project.</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Original Contracted Budget value will not change</li>
  <li>deductions will increase to reflect the value of the new technical clerical adjustment (note: this figure is the total value of all Irregularities and TCAs)</li>
  <li>amount Recycled will increase to reflect the addition of expenditure solely relating to TCAs (split by Match and <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> values)</li>
  <li>the Net Contracted Budget will not reduce as a result of the Technical or Clerical Error</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: When checking to see the current total amount of <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> funding applicable to your project, the figures in the âExpenditureâ and âRevenueâ columns in the right side of the Financial Profiles table will show you the current, applicable amounts.</p>

<p>To calculate the total amount of <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> + match funding applicable to your project, you can then do an offline calculation and multiply the current âRevenue Net Contracted Budgetâ figure in the right-hand bottom corner of the Financial Profile Table by the current intervention rate for your <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project.</p>

<p>Continuing the example above, a Â£100 <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> has now been submitted by the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr>. The <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> have agreed that funds should be recycled and therefore convert the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> to a <abbr title="Technical or Clerical Adjustment">TCA</abbr>.</p>

<p>On the right side of the screen, you will see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Â£100 Deduction has been split to reflect 50% <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> value (Â£50)</li>
  <li>the Net Contracted budge in both the Grant and Revenue columns remains unchanged</li>
  <li>the Original Contracted Budget remains unchanged</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: You may notice that the PFP table shows a Net Contracted Budget value that is higher than the Original Contracted Budget (Funding Agreement value); this higher figure will show until the process for recycling funds back to the project has completed by the Managing Authority.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>History</h2>

<p>The History screen for each Irregularity or <abbr title="Technical or Clerical Adjustment">TCA</abbr> reflects the action that has been taken.</p>

<p>If you want to view the History of an Irregularity or <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr>, select the Irregularities or <abbr title="Technical or Clerical Adjustment">TCA</abbr> or <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> hyperlink from the left menu.</p>

<p>Then select view against the relevant Irregularity, <abbr title="Technical or Clerical Adjustment">TCA</abbr> or <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr></p>

<p>In this example you can see that the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> status was converted to a <abbr title="Technical or Clerical Adjustment">TCA</abbr> to enable funds to be recycled back to the project.</p>

<p>You will now be able to view the Version History by selecting the History hyperlink at the top of the screen.</p>

<p>You are then presented with the different versions. In this example there are two versions. You can view each version by selecting the view hyperlink.</p>

<p>Version 1 shows the action taken by the <abbr title="Grant Recipient">GR</abbr> submitting the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr>. Version 2 shows the action taken by the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> Irregularity Manager to convert the <abbr title="Self-Declared Adjustment">SDA</abbr> to a <abbr title="Technical or Clerical Adjustment">TCA</abbr>.</p>
