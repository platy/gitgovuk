<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>A representative cross-section of volunteers in England, aged 5 and over, tested themselves with swabs from 9 to 27 September 2021 (inclusive). Swabs were analysed using polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) for the presence of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<p>For round 14, there has been a slight change in the method of data collection. Up to round 13, test kits used dry swabs which were then transported via cold-chain distribution to the laboratory. In round 14, we switched to using wet swabs preserved in saline.</p>

<p>Also, at random, 50% of swabs were transported by courier and 50% were sent through the priority COVID-19 postal service. Therefore, we would expect sensitivity to be slightly lower than for previous round, but this would have little to no impact on study findings.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>Over the 19 days of testing which form these findings from round 14 of REACT-1, 764 samples tested positive from a total of 100,527 swab results, giving a weighted prevalence of 0.83% (0.76%, 0.89%) or 83 people per 10,000 infected. This compares to a weighted prevalence in the previous round, round 13 (24 June to 12 July) of 0.63% (0.57%, 0.69%).</p>

<p>This round showed limited evidence of exponential growth with an estimated doubling time of 34 days, and an R number of 1.03 (0.94, 1.14). This is significantly lower than for round 13, which had a doubling time of 15 days, and a corresponding R number of 1.28 (1.24, 1.31).</p>

<p>The rate of prevalence was driven primarily by younger age groups. The epidemic was growing in those aged 17 years and below with an R rate of 1.18 (1.03, 1.34) and 0.99 probability that R&gt;1. However, for those aged 18 to 54, the epidemic was decreasing through the testing period with an R of 0.81 (0.68, 0.97).</p>

<p>The highest weighted prevalence in round 14 was found in children aged 5 to 12 years at, 2.32% (1.96%, 2.73%) and 13 to 17 years at 2.55% (2.11%, 3.08%).</p>

<p>At regional level, weighted prevalence ranged from 0.57% (0.45%, 0.72%) in South East to 1.25% (1.00%, 1.57%) in Yorkshire and The Humber. Within round 14 there was evidence of growth in both East Midlands and London with R of 1.36 (1.05, 1.73) and 1.59 (1.23, 1.99) respectively.</p>

<p>Ethnicity, household size and vaccination status were all markers of differing rates of infection.</p>

<p>The highest prevalence was observed in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>people of Black ethnicity at 1.41% (0.91%, 2.19%) compared with white participants at 0.78% (0.72%, 0.85%)</li>
  <li>those in the largest households of 6 or more people at 1.75% (1.24%, 2.46%) for households with 6 or more persons, compared to 0.33% (0.25%, 0.44%) for single person households</li>
</ul>

<p>Weighted prevalence was 0.56% (0.50%, 0.62%) in those reporting 2 doses of vaccine compared with 1.73% (1.42%, 2.12%) in unvaccinated people.</p>

<p>Weighted prevalence in round 14 among people who were in contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case was 7.35% (6.50%, 8.31%) compared with 0.43% (0.38%, 0.49%) among those without such contact.</p>

<p>Furthermore, multiple regression analyses in round 14 showed that key workers other than healthcare workers and care home workers had increased risk of testing positive, with R of 1.35 (1.10, 1.66) compared to other workers.</p>

<p>Of the samples which were sequenced for variants, of SARS-CoV-2, 100% were from the Delta lineage (or sub-lineage).</p>

<p>Across rounds 13 and 14 of the REACT-1 study, analysis of weighted prevalence by time since receiving second dose of vaccine indicated higher prevalence at 0.55% (0.50%, 0.61%) for those who received their second dose 3 to 6 months before their swab compared to 0.35% (0.31%, 0.40%) for those whose second dose was within 3 months. Prevalence rates were uncertain for those whose second dose was more than 6 months previously.</p>

<p>The study also examined vaccine effectiveness against infection, comparing those who have received 2 doses of a vaccine against those who are unvaccinated. For all participants and all vaccines combined, vaccine effectiveness against infection was estimated to be 62.8% when adjusted for round, age, sex, index of multiple deprivation, region and ethnicity. Among the subset of participants reporting symptoms, vaccine effectiveness was 66.4% overall.</p>

<p>This is in line with estimates by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) that after 2 doses, vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease with the Delta variant is approximately 65 to 70% with AstraZeneca and 80 to 95% with Pfizer-BioNTech.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>During the period 9 to 27 September, the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections broadly levelled off compared to previous rounds, with an R of 1.03, and 83 out of 10,000 people estimated to have the virus. The highest rates were observed regionally in London and the East Midlands and in those aged 5 to 17 years nationally. All positive samples from this round that could be sequenced were found to be the Delta variant.</p>
