<h2>Project objectives</h2>

<p>This measure will require large businesses to notify <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> where they have adopted an uncertain tax treatment that <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is not already been made aware of. Amounts of Corporation Tax, Value Added Tax (VAT) or Income Tax (via Self Assessment or <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) will be classified as uncertain if the tax treatment to which they relate meets one of two legislative criteria:</p>

<ol>
  <li>that a provision has been made in the accounts for the uncertainty</li>
  <li>that the tax treatment applied is not in accordance with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s known position</li>
</ol>

<p>Businesses will be required to notify <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> only if the tax advantage exceeds a £5 million threshold.</p>

<p>This measure aims to highlight and resolve legal interpretation differences earlier, ideally by encouraging more businesses to follow best practice and discuss areas of uncertainty with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> before they submit their returns or, if necessary, through notification.</p>

<p>This equality impact assessment is related to the operational delivery of Uncertain Tax Treatment.</p>

<h2>Customer groups affected</h2>

<p>The customer groups affected by the scheme are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an estimated 2,320 businesses with a turnover above £200 million or with a balance sheet total of over £2 billion, or both</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>third parties who deal with/manage tax affairs on behalf of the customers</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>What customers will need to do</h2>

<h3>What customers need to do as a result of the change</h3>

<p>Customers or agents will be required to complete an online notification (G-form) or can approach <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> in advance of the deadline to provide details of the uncertainty and benefit from exemption (see below).</p>

<p>Notification of an uncertain amount, including the amount of the tax advantage, is required by the same due date as the corresponding tax return.</p>

<p>Customers or agents could approach <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> pre-notification (typically via the designated <abbr title="Customer Compliance Manager">CCM</abbr> or WMBC <abbr title="Customer Engagement and Support Team">CEST</abbr> team mailbox) to provide details of the uncertainty and benefit from exemption, meaning they will not need to provide details of that uncertain amount via online notification (G-form).</p>

<p>For failures to notify, a penalty process will be in place which has the provision for appeals.</p>

<h3>How customers will access this service</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Customer Compliance Manager (<abbr title="Customer Compliance Manager">CCM</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Customer Engagement and Support Team (<abbr title="Customer Engagement and Support Team">CEST</abbr>) for businesses without a <abbr title="Customer Compliance Manager">CCM</abbr>
</li>
  <li>online notification (G-form)</li>
</ul>

<h3>When customers need to do this</h3>

<p>Pre-notification can be done at any time during the tax year, which could happen before 1 April 2022 for returns due soon after this date, but for all post-implementation periods, pre-notifications will typically happen after 1 April 2022 and before the due date for the relevant return.</p>

<p>The customer will be able to complete the online notification G-form from 1 April 2022.</p>

<h2>Assessing the impact</h2>

<p>We assessed the equality impacts on all the protected characteristic groups in line with the Equality Act and Public Sector Equality Duty; and section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gender reassignment</li>
  <li>sexual orientation</li>
  <li>age</li>
  <li>religion or belief</li>
  <li>pregnancy and maternity</li>
  <li>marriage and civil partnership</li>
  <li>people with or without dependents</li>
  <li>political opinion (for Northern Ireland only)</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no evidence to suggest any specific impacts on those customers within any of the protected characteristic groups listed above.</p>

<h3>Disabled and not disabled</h3>

<h4>Impact on customers</h4>

<p>Individuals employed in affected businesses may be disabled and require additional support and/or accessible form/channel of contact.</p>

<h4>Proposed mitigation</h4>

<p>The online notification G-form is available in accessible formats for those who require it. The customer can also contact <abbr title="Customer Compliance Manager">CCM</abbr> or <abbr title="Customer Engagement and Support Team">CEST</abbr> if they prefer.</p>

<h3>People who use different languages (Including Welsh Language and British Sign Language)</h3>

<h4>Impact on customers</h4>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is obliged to provide Welsh language versions of documents, publications and services.</p>

<h4>Proposed mitigation</h4>

<p>The project will provide a Welsh language service to customers in line with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> protocol where proportionate.</p>

<h3>Opportunities to promote equalities</h3>

<p>We have considered opportunities to promote equalities and good relations between people in each of the protected characteristic groups and those outside of that group.</p>

<p>None have been identified.</p>

<p>A full equality impact assessment is not recommended.</p>
