<p><em>£150 government council tax rebate</em></p>
</div>

<p><strong>If you live in a property in council tax bands A to D, you are likely to receive a £150 council tax rebate from the government to help with the cost of living.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>As countries around the world come out of Covid-19 lockdowns, surging demand for energy has meant energy prices have increased. Over the past year, the price of gas alone has quadrupled.</p>

<p>Whilst the problem is global, the effect is being felt by millions of households here in the UK.</p>

<p>The government has listened to these concerns and it has acted.</p>

<p>Recently, the government announced that around 20 million households in England in council tax bands A-D will get a £150 rebate from April.</p>

<p><strong>The rebate will not need to be repaid.</strong></p>

<h2>Who’s eligible?</h2>

<p>Households in council tax bands A-D will receive the £150 council tax rebate.</p>

<p>This means 4 out of 5 households in England will benefit, including around 95% of rented properties. However, second homes or empty properties will not benefit.</p>

<p>If you are unsure of your council tax band, check your council tax band via your printed council tax bill or at: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/council-tax-bands">https://www.gov.uk/council-tax-bands</a> or contact your local council.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>What if my household isn’t eligible?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Councils will receive an extra £144 million to provide support to vulnerable households who may not qualify for the £150 council tax rebate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This includes people on low incomes in council tax bands E-H.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your council will provide more detail on how this will operate in your area.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How will my household get its £150?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Your council will confirm how the rebate will be paid in your area.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For people who pay council tax by direct debit, in most cases, the rebate will go directly into bank accounts. If you don’t already pay by direct debit, you might want to sign up. This will make sure the rebate is paid to you quickly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those who do not pay council tax via direct debit, your council will confirm how the rebate will be paid to you. Please make sure that communication is from your local council before providing payment details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rebate will not need to be repaid.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>What else is on offer to support households with their energy bills?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We are helping to spread the cost of the recent jump in energy prices over several years. £200 of this year’s energy bill will be taken off from October and spread equally over the next 5 years instead, easing the burden on family budgets. This is not a debt, no interest is charged and no credit ratings are affected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Warm Home Discount will be expanded, so nearly 3 million low-income households will benefit from a £150 discount.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
