<h2>Preface</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>This note provides country of origin information (COI) and analysis of COI for use by Home Office decision makers handling particular types of protection and human rights claims (as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Introduction">Introduction</a> section). It is not intended to be an exhaustive survey of a particular subject or theme.</p>

<p>It is split into 2 parts: (1) an assessment of COI and other evidence; and (2) COI. These are explained in more detail below.</p>

<h3>Assessment</h3>

<p>This section analyses the evidence relevant to this note - that is information in the COI section; refugee/human rights laws and policies; and applicable caselaw - by describing this and its inter-relationships, and provides an assessment of, in general, whether one or more of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a person is reasonably likely to face a real risk of persecution or serious harm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the general humanitarian situation is so severe that there are substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk of serious harm because conditions amount to inhuman or degrading treatment as within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">paragraphs 339C and 339CA(iii) of the Immigration Rules</a>/Article 3 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=basictexts&amp;c=" rel="external">European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the security situation is such that there are substantial grounds for believing there is a real risk of serious harm because there exists a serious and individual threat to a civilian’s life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in a situation of international or internal armed conflict as within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">paragraphs 339C and 339CA(iv) of the Immigration Rules</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a person is able to obtain protection from the state (or quasi state bodies)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a person is reasonably able to relocate within a country or territory</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a claim is likely to justify granting asylum, humanitarian protection or other form of leave, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if a claim is refused, it is likely or unlikely to be certifiable as ‘clearly unfounded’ under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/41/section/94" rel="external">section 94 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Decision makers must, however, still consider all claims on an individual basis, taking into account each case’s specific facts.</p>

<h3>Country of origin information</h3>

<p>The country information in this note has been carefully selected in accordance with the general principles of COI research as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.refworld.org/docid/48493f7f2.html" rel="external">Common EU [European Union] Guidelines for Processing Country of Origin Information (COI)</a>, April 2008, and the Austrian Centre for Country of Origin and Asylum Research and Documentation’s (ACCORD), <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.coi-training.net/researching-coi/" rel="external">Researching Country Origin Information – Training Manual,</a> 2013. Namely, taking into account the COI’s relevance, reliability, accuracy, balance, currency, transparency and traceability.</p>

<p>The structure and content of the country information section follows a <a class="govuk-link" href="#Version_control_and">terms of reference</a> which sets out the general and specific topics relevant to this note.</p>

<p>All information included in the note was published or made publicly available on or before the ‘cut-off’ date(s) in the country information section. Any event taking place or report/article published after these date(s) is not included.</p>

<p>All information is publicly accessible or can be made publicly available. Sources and the information they provide are carefully considered before inclusion. Factors relevant to the assessment of the reliability of sources and information include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the motivation, purpose, knowledge and experience of the source</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how the information was obtained, including specific methodologies used</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the currency and detail of information</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the COI is consistent with and/or corroborated by other sources.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Multiple sourcing is used to ensure that the information is accurate and balanced, which is compared and contrasted where appropriate so that a comprehensive and up-to-date picture is provided of the issues relevant to this note at the time of publication.</p>

<p>The inclusion of a source is not, however, an endorsement of it or any view(s) expressed.</p>

<p>Each piece of information is referenced in a footnote. Full details of all sources cited and consulted in compiling the note are listed alphabetically in the bibliography.</p>

<h2>Assessment</h2>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Updated: 25 March 2022</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Basis of claim</h3>

<p>1.1.1 Fear of persecution and/or serious harm by state or non-state actors because of the person’s actual or perceived sexual orientation and/or gender identity or expression.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Points to note</h3>

<p>1.2.1 This note provides an assessment of the general situation of gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, trans and intersex persons as well as those perceived as such. They are referred hereafter collectively as ‘LGBTI persons’, though the treatment and experiences of each group may differ.</p>

<p>1.2.2 Most sources in this note refer to LGBTI collectively or to the experiences of trans persons in particular. There is limited information about the experiences of gay and bisexual men or lesbian and bisexual women.</p>

<p>1.2.3 In Pakistani law trans persons are defined as intersex, eunuchs, transgender men and transgender women. They are also referred to under the umbrella term ‘khawaja sira’ or ‘hijras’ (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Domestic_legislation">Domestic legislation</a>).</p>

<p>1.2.4 For general guidance on considering claims made by LGBTI persons, decision makers should refer to the Asylum Instructions on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sexual-identity-issues-in-the-asylum-claim">Sexual identity issues in the asylum claim</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dealing-with-gender-identity-issues-in-the-asylum-claim-process">Gender identity issues in the asylum claim.</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Consideration of issues</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Credibility</h3>

<p>2.1.1 For information on assessing credibility, see the instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Assessing Credibility and Refugee Status</a>, and the Asylum Instructions on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sexual-identity-issues-in-the-asylum-claim">Sexual identity issues in the asylum claim</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dealing-with-gender-identity-issues-in-the-asylum-claim-process">Gender identity issues in the asylum claim.</a></p>

<p>2.1.2 Decision makers must also check if there has been a previous application for a UK visa or another form of leave. Asylum applications matched to visas should be investigated prior to the asylum interview (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visa-matches-handling-asylum-claims-from-uk-visa-applicants-instruction">Asylum Instruction on Visa Matches, Asylum Claims from UK Visa Applicants</a>).</p>

<p>2.1.3 In cases where there are doubts surrounding an person’s claimed place of origin, decision makers should also consider the need to conduct language analysis testing (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/language-analysis-instruction">Asylum Instruction on Language Analysis</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Exclusion</h3>

<p>2.2.1 Decision makers must consider whether there are serious reasons for considering whether one (or more) of the exclusion clauses is applicable. Each case must be considered on its individual facts and merits.</p>

<p>2.2.2 If the person is excluded from the Refugee Convention, they will also be excluded from a grant of humanitarian protection (which has a wider range of exclusions than refugee status).</p>

<p>2.2.3 For further guidance on the exclusion clauses and restricted leave, see the Asylum Instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/asylum-instruction-exclusion-article-1f-of-the-refugee-convention">Exclusion under Articles 1F and 33(2) of the Refugee Convention</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/humanitarian-protection-instruction">Humanitarian Protection</a> and the instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restricted-leave-asylum-casework-instruction">Restricted Leave</a>.</p>

</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Convention reason(s)</h3>

<p>2.3.1 Actual or imputed particular social group (PSG).</p>

<p>2.3.2 LGBTI persons form a particular social group (PSG) in Pakistan within the meaning of the Refugee Convention because they share an innate characteristic or a common background that cannot be changed, or share a characteristic or belief that is so fundamental to identity or conscience that a person should not be forced to renounce it and have a distinct identity in Pakistan because the group is perceived as being different by the surrounding society.</p>

<p>2.3.3 Although LGBTI persons form a PSG, establishing such membership is not sufficient to be recognised as a refugee. The question to be addressed is whether the person has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of their actual or imputed convention reason.</p>

<p>2.3.4 For further guidance on the 5 Refugee Convention grounds see the Asylum Instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Assessing Credibility and Refugee Status</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Risk</h3>

<h4>a. State treatment</h4>

<p>2.4.1 The Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) does not explicitly refer to same-sex sexual activity, but Section 377 defines ‘carnal intercourse against the order of nature’, as punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment for a period of 2 years to life. There is ambiguity on whether Section 377 applies to women, but it is assumed the law applies to both men and women. The Offence of Zina (Enforcement Of Hudood) Ordinance of 1979 criminalises any form of penetration in a sexual act outside of marriage. Whilst consensual same-sex sexual acts are not explicitly covered by these provisions since LGBTI people are not able to marry they suggest that any same-sex sexual acts that involve penetration could be prosecuted under sharia provisions and may be punished by death. There are no laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, consensual same-sex sexual acts are prohibited as are same-sex civil unions or marriages, and same-sex couples cannot adopt children (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Legal_rights">Legal rights</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Application_of_the">Application of the law</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.2 Unlike lesbians, gay men and bisexuals, the rights of trans persons are recognised under the 2018 Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act (TPPR Act), which allows trans people (defined in the TPPR Act as intersex, eunuchs, trans men and trans women) to self-identify, register to obtain a driver’s license and passport, as well as the right to change and register their gender (if aged over 18) with all government departments, including with the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) who issue national identity cards, upon which trans persons are defined by an ‘X’. Discrimination and harassment of trans persons is also prohibited under the law. They have also been included in government policies and employment (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Domestic_legislation">Domestic legislation</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#Government_position">Government position</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Access_to_services">Access to services</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.3 In practice, the proscriptive laws rarely lead to convictions or prosecutions under the PPC or Sharia provisions, although Sections 377 and 294 (‘Obscene Acts and Songs’) of the PPC have sometimes been used by police as a means to extract bribes or sexual favours under threat of prosecution, particularly against men who have sex with men (MSM) and trans women, who may also be subject to harassment, humiliation, and violence by the police, including sexual violence (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Application_of_the">Application of the law</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#Arrests_and_detention">Arrests and detention</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Treatment_by_the">Treatment by the police</a>). However, all LGBTI persons may be at risk of sanction under provisions of the PPC and sharia law (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Legal_rights">Legal rights</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.4 There is limited information about the extent of the treatment by the state faced by lesbian, gay or bisexual persons who openly express their sexual orientation or gender identity. Most information focusses on trans persons, who are protected under the law and have seen an increased inclusion in government programmes and employment, but they may still face discrimination and abuse by state actors.</p>

<p>2.4.5 In general, a person living openly as LGBTI is not at real risk of persecution or serious harm by the state. However, each case must be considered on its facts with the onus on the person to demonstrate that they would be at real risk on return. If a person does not openly express their sexual orientation or gender identity, consideration must be given to the reasons why they do not.</p>

<h4>b. Societal treatment</h4>

<p>2.4.7 Pakistan is a conservative Muslim society in which anti-LGBTI attitudes persist and are widespread. LGBTI persons face societal discrimination and stigma as well as family and societal pressure to conform to cultural and religious norms, including marriage. Whilst men who have sex with men (MSM) is reported to be a common phenomenon, being openly gay (or lesbian) is not (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Societal_treatment_and">Societal attitudes and treatment</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.8 Various sources maintain that LGBTI persons are, in general, reluctant to be open about their sexuality as they may face abuse, forced marriage, ‘honour killings’, humiliation, societal discrimination and harassment, including in the workplace, in the family and in accessing housing and healthcare. Some persons from a higher socio-economic background in urban areas may ‘come out’ to their family or friends and have access to the ‘underground gay scene’ at private parties or on social media, but if their sexuality is known, they may be exposed to violence or blackmail (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Societal_treatment_and">Societal attitudes and treatment</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.9 There is a degree of societal acceptance of trans persons – primarily khawaja siras – who do not conform to the traditional gender binaries. Trans persons are increasingly represented in television and radio roles and in coverage of trans issues in the media. However, many are marginalised or ostracised by their families or wider society and there are numerous reports of violence, intimidation and abuse, particularly against trans women (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Societal_treatment_and">Societal attitudes and treatment</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.10 Several organisations offer support and/or advocacy for LGBTI persons throughout Pakistan, particularly in larger cities, although advocates for LGBTI persons may be vulnerable to attack by non-state actors (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Civil_society_groups">Civil society groups and NGOs</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.11 In general, a person living openly as LGBTI is likely to be at risk of treatment from non-state actors which is sufficiently serious by its nature and repetition, or by an accumulation of various measures, that it amounts to persecution or serious harm. Each case must be considered on its facts.</p>

<p>2.4.12 Reasons for not being open about their sexual orientation, gender identity or expression may be because the person wishes to conform to societal norms but may also be due to fear of discrimination and/or violence. If a person does not openly express their sexual orientation or gender identity, consideration must be given to the reasons why they do not.</p>

<p>2.4.13 For further guidance on assessing risk, see the Asylum Instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Assessing Credibility and Refugee Status</a>, and the Asylum Instructions on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sexual-identity-issues-in-the-asylum-claim">Sexual identity issues in the asylum claim</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dealing-with-gender-identity-issues-in-the-asylum-claim-process">Gender identity issues in the asylum claim.</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> Protection</h3>

<p>2.5.1 Where the person has a well-founded fear of persecution from the state they will not, in general, be able to obtain protection from the authorities.</p>

<p>2.5.2 Where the person has a well-founded fear of persecution from non-state actors, including ‘rogue’ state actors, decision makers must assess whether the state can provide effective protection.</p>

<p>2.5.3 Sources indicate that sexual minorities may be reluctant to report crimes against them for fear of revealing their sexual orientation or because they suspect the response will be inadequate. Whilst there have been some reported cases of persons arrested for crimes against trans persons, these arrests are generally only made in cases of serious crime, such as rape or murder, and not for incidences of harassment or homophobia, which usually go unreported due to fear of defamation or maltreatment by the police (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Legal_rights">Legal rights</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#State_attitudes_and">State attitudes and treatment</a>).</p>

<p>2.5.4 Homophobic and discriminatory attitudes also negatively affect how the police handle complaints by LGBTI persons and violence perpetrated against them and several sources indicate that such complaints are not always seriously investigated by the police. However, a few sources point out that, in some cases, the police have responded appropriately to charges or abuses against trans persons (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Police_and_judicial">Police and judicial response to violence against LGBTI persons</a>).</p>

<p>2.5.5 In general, the state may be able, but is not willing, to offer effective protection to lesbian, gay and bisexual persons and the person will not be able to avail themselves to the protection of the authorities. generally</p>

<p>2.5.6 Despite the passing of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill 2018, it is reported that police do not always provide adequate protection to trans persons. However, due to the prevailing law protecting trans persons, the reasonable steps taken by the state to operate an effective criminal justice system and that protection is usually accessible, in general, the state is willing and able to provide effective protection to trans persons. Each case must be considered on its facts.</p>

<p>2.5.7 For further guidance on assessing state protection, see the Country Policy and Information Note on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pakistan-country-policy-and-information-notes">Pakistan: Actors of protection</a>, the Asylum Instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Assessing Credibility and Refugee Status</a>, and the Asylum Instructions on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sexual-identity-issues-in-the-asylum-claim">Sexual identity issues in the asylum claim</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dealing-with-gender-identity-issues-in-the-asylum-claim-process">Gender identity issues in the asylum claim.</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span> Internal relocation</h3>

<p>2.6.1 Where the person has a well-founded fear of persecution or serious harm from the state they are unlikely to be able to relocate to escape that risk.</p>

<p>2.6.2 Given that homophobic attitudes are prevalent throughout the country there is unlikely to be any place in Pakistan to which a lesbian, gay or bisexual person could reasonably relocate without making fundamental changes to their behaviour.</p>

<p>2.6.3 Trans persons are protected by law and, subject to their individual circumstances, relocation may be reasonable. Unofficial estimates indicated there were at least 300,000 trans persons across the country, with one estimate suggesting there were between 400,000 and 500,000 trans persons in Punjab alone.</p>

<p>2.6.4 Internal relocation will not be an option if it depends on the person concealing their sexual orientation and/or gender identity in the proposed new location if the reason (or one of the reasons) is a fear of persecution. Each case must be considered on its facts.</p>

<p>2.6.5 For further guidance on considering internal relocation and the factors to be taken into account, see the Asylum Instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Assessing Credibility and Refugee Status</a>, and the Asylum Instructions on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sexual-identity-issues-in-the-asylum-claim">Sexual identity issues in the asylum claim</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dealing-with-gender-identity-issues-in-the-asylum-claim-process">Gender identity issues in the asylum claim.</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Constitution</h3>

<p>3.1.1 The Constitution provisions on a citizen’s fundamental rights do not mention sexual orientation or gender identity although certain provisions may impact the constitutional rights of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) persons<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. For example, Article 25 of the Constitution states ‘All citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> Similarly, Article 27 prohibits discrimination in public services based on race, religion, caste, sex, residence or place of birth<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>. According to Article 14, ‘The dignity of man and, subject to law, the privacy of home, shall be inviolable.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.1.2 However, there are no laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, consensual same-sex sexual acts are prohibited, there is no legal recognition of same-sex civil unions or marriages, and same-sex couples cannot adopt children<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Other legislation</h3>

<p>3.2.1 The US Department of State (USSD) human rights report for 2020 noted that, ‘A 2012 Supreme Court ruling allows transgender individuals to obtain national identification cards listing a “third gender.” Because national identity cards also serve as voter registration, the ruling enabled transgender individuals to participate in elections, both as candidates and voters.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.2.2 The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act (TPPR Act), passed by parliament in 2018, aims to ensure the rights of trans persons. The law allows trans people to self-identify, register to obtain a driver’s license and passport, as well as to change and register their gender (if aged over 18) with all government departments, including, but not limited to, the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA). Discrimination and harassment of trans persons is also prohibited under the law<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>3.2.3 The TPPR Act, cited by the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), defines a trans person as a person who is:</p>

<p>‘(i) “Intersex” (Khusra) with a “mixture of male and female genital features or congenital ambiguities”; or</p>

<p>‘(ii) “eunuch assigned male at birth, but undergoes genital excision or castration”; or</p>

<p>‘(iii) “a transgender man, transgender woman, Khawaja Sira or any person whose gender identity and/or gender expression differs from the social norms and cultural expectations based on the sex they were assigned at the time of their birth”.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.2.4 The term khawaja sira is often used as an umbrella term for trans persons<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup>. However, according to a September 2020 article published by Il Grande Colibri, an LGBTQI voluntary association, ‘… khawaja sira is a transgender culture and not an Urdu translation for the term transgender.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup> Describing this culture, an article in The Sunday Long Read noted ‘The Khwaja Sira community dates back to the Mughal Empire, the 16th- to 19th-century power centered in India, and the term Khwaja Sira itself stems from when the word — derived from Urdu and Farsi — was used as a title for trans, castrated, and gender nonconforming officials in the Mughal court.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup> Il Grande Colibri noted ‘After the downfall of the Mughal Empire, the designation of the term khawaja sira (which was originally meant to describe eunuchs) started to get more largely used to address transgender women and non-binary people.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup></p>

<p>See also <a class="govuk-link" href="#Societal_norms">Societal norms</a>.</p>

<p>3.2.5 A briefing paper dated March 2020 by the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) analysed the TPPR Act in light of Pakistan’s obligations under international law and noted the inclusion of intersex persons in the category of transgender was inaccurate as it failed to ‘… fully recognize the specific legal protections required for intersex people.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.2.6 The TPPR Act does not require a person who self-identifies as ‘transgender’ to obtain any official or medical recognition of gender reassignment<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>3.2.7 However, in regard to registration with NADRA and obtaining a National Identity Card (NIC), a September 2020 article published by Il Grande Colibri, noted:</p>

<p>‘Khursand Bayar Ali, a well-known transgender activist from Lahore, said that getting an “X” gender identity card from NADRA requires only a few steps. One just needs to go to the nearest NADRA office and to get the “X” gender national identity card without any hurdle. However, the real battle starts when a transgender person (identifying with binary gender) wants to get either a male or a female identity card.</p>

<p>‘Khursand said that NADRA officials demand various kinds of medical documents to process the request, which include gender assessment forms and sex verification certificate. This is a clear violation of the law stating any Pakistani citizen can have identification documents based on the gender of their own choice.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.2.8 In November 2021, the English-language news site, Dawn, noted that the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) presented a bill in the Senate seeking an amendment to the Act, ‘… for the creation of a medical board that would recommend whether a person’s gender should change.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup> The amendment also indicated that the law in its current form could lead to the ‘legalisation of homosexual marriages’.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup> At the time of publication of this CPIN, the amendment bill had not been incorporated into the law, and was pending with the Standing Committee on Human Rights<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>3.2.9 With regard to the inclusion of begging by transgender persons as an offence under the TPPR Act, the ICJ March 2020 briefing states:</p>

<p>3.2.10 ‘Including begging by transgender people as a separate, distinct offence under the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act is at the very least questionable since for many transgender people in Pakistan, begging remains one of their limited livelihood opportunities. Laws related to beggary, including the Punjab Vagrancy Ordinance, have been significantly misused against the transgender community, allowing for law enforcement agencies to harass, blackmail, imprison and sexually assault transgender people. Furthermore, the police routinely interpret the vague penal clauses on “begging” and “vagrancy” to prohibit and penalize spiritual and celebratory rituals of the khawajasira community (for instance, at weddings and childbirth) that have crucial significance in the community’s folk tradition.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Penal Code</h3>

<p>3.3.1 The Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) does not specifically refer to same-sex sexual acts but deals with actions considered ‘unnatural offences’. Section 377 states ‘Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than two years nor more than ten years, and shall also be liable to fine … Explanation: Penetration is sufficient to constitute the carnal intercourse necessary to the offence described in this section.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">[footnote 22]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.3.2 According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) World December 2019 report, provisions under Section 377 of the PPC applied to all genders<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">[footnote 23]</a></sup>, though in the same report ILGA indicated same-sex sexual acts were illegal for men only<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">[footnote 24]</a></sup>. In its 2020 report, ILGA simply noted that same-sex sexual acts were criminalised<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:25" rel="footnote">[footnote 25]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>3.3.3 The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) Country Information Report for Pakistan, dated January 2022, based on a various sources, noted, ‘Uncertainty around the definition of “carnal intercourse” makes it unclear whether this provision applies to sexual activity between women.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:26" rel="footnote">[footnote 26]</a></sup> In an Independent Advisory Group on Country Information (IAGCI) commissioned review, dated 2015, by Professor of Politics at SOAS University of London, Dr Matthew Nelson, he noted that Section 377 of the PPC ‘criminalises “carnal intercourse against the order of nature”, which is usually read as prohibiting non-heterosexual sexual activity involving any form of penetration.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:27" rel="footnote">[footnote 27]</a></sup> Dr Matthew Nelson considered that any form of penetration outside of a conventional understanding of heterosexual sexual contact is criminalised: lesbians and other bisexual or trans groups are not necessarily exempt<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:28" rel="footnote">[footnote 28]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>3.3.4 However, whilst some sources did not clarify whether Section 377 of the PPC applied to lesbians, bisexual or trans persons, the Government of Pakistan (GoP) indicated, in its Global AIDS Monitoring 2020 progress report (covering January to December 2019) submitted to UNAIDS, that Section 377, ‘criminalizes male-to-male sex…’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:29" rel="footnote">[footnote 29]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.3.5 The Neengar Society, a non-profit organization working in Pakistan for the rights of religious and sexual minorities, told the Research Directorate of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) in 2013, that Section 294 – ‘Obscene Acts and Songs’ – of the PPC, was sometimes applied to trans persons and male sex workers<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:30" rel="footnote">[footnote 30]</a></sup>. In its 2020 report, ILGA repeated this assertion<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:31" rel="footnote">[footnote 31]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>3.3.6 Section 294 of the PPC states, ‘Whoever to the annoyance of others – a) does any obscene act in any public place, or b) sings, recites or utters any obscene songs, ballad or words, in or near any public place, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three months, or with fine, or with both.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:32" rel="footnote">[footnote 32]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.3.7 Section 375 of the PPC defines rape in gendered terms – as a crime that only a man can commit against a woman<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:33" rel="footnote">[footnote 33]</a></sup> – thereby omitting the perpetration of male rape or rape against trans persons<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:34" rel="footnote">[footnote 34]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:35" rel="footnote">[footnote 35]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> Sharia (Islamic law)</h3>

<p>3.4.1 Hudood legislation – in the late 1970s provisions were introduced to bring the Pakistan Penal Code into conformity with Sharia. The Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance from 1979 specifies penalties for various acts described as crimes against God according to the Koran and Islamic legal tradition. This includes ‘zina’, that is, sexual intercourse outside marriage<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:36" rel="footnote">[footnote 36]</a></sup>. A Federal Shariat Court may examine and decide whether any law is ‘repugnant to the injunctions of Islam’ and exercises jurisdiction over the lower courts deciding Hudood cases. The decisions of the Federal Shariat Court can be appealed to the Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:37" rel="footnote">[footnote 37]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>3.4.2 The Offence of Zina (Enforcement Of Hudood) Ordinance of 1979 states under section 4, ‘Zina: A man and a woman are said to commit “Zina” if they wilfully have sexual intercourse without being… married to each other … Explanation: Penetration is sufficient to constitute the sexual intercourse necessary to the offence of Zina.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:38" rel="footnote">[footnote 38]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.4.3 Dr Matthew Nelson, in his review of CPIT’s Pakistan COI products for the IAGCI, referred to section 4 of the Hudood Ordinance and noted:</p>

<p>‘This law does not specifically target LGBT groups. However, insofar as non-heterosexual relationships cannot be legalised in any form of marriage, it suggests that non-heterosexual sexual acts that involve penetration can be prosecuted. It should be noted that the same standard of “penetration” is used in the legal “explanations” pertaining to both Section 377 and the Hudood Ordinance. This standard is not necessarily restricted to gay men; it can be used to prosecute different forms of non-heterosexual and even heterosexual sexual contact…</p>

<p>‘[T]he legal punishment for zina (Sections 5 and 17 of the Ordinance) perpetrated by a Muslim is death. (For non-Muslims the punishment is lashing.) The evidentiary requirement for conviction, however, is very high, involving four [male] eyewitnesses [or confession<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:39" rel="footnote">[footnote 39]</a></sup>] …’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:40" rel="footnote">[footnote 40]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.4.4 According to a paper on Sharia and LGBT rights, by Javaid Rehman and Eleni Polymenopoulou of the Brunel Law School, published in 2013, ‘Regarding the punishment for homosexuality, there is a consensus among the four leading Sunni schools of thought and most Islamic scholars that homosexual acts are a major sin (fahicha) and may be punishable by death.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:41" rel="footnote">[footnote 41]</a></sup> The IRB noted, in a response on the treatment of sexual and gender minorities, covering events between 2017 and January 2019, that according to sources, ‘… under Sharia… homosexuals face the death penalty in Pakistan.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:42" rel="footnote">[footnote 42]</a></sup> The paper by Rehman and Polymenopoulou noted, ‘[F]or Islamic scholars who consider that the punishment of homosexuality is equivalent to the punishment for zina, the death sentence, provided the evidentiary requirements are met, may be also applied…’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:43" rel="footnote">[footnote 43]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.4.5 Landinfo’s (the Norwegian Country of Origin Information Centre) considered in its report of May 2013 ‘… that Sharia law in Pakistan, as opposed Iran and Afghanistan, does not authorise the death penalty for voluntary sex between persons of the same gender. Lifetime imprisonment under Penal Code paragraph 377 thus seems to be the strictest penalty.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:44" rel="footnote">[footnote 44]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.4.6 However, the GoP stated in its Global AIDS Monitoring 2020 progress report that, ‘Sharia… carries heavy penalties for homosexuality – of imprisonment for 2-10 years or for life, or of 100 lashes or stoning to death (depending on whether the person is married or not).’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:45" rel="footnote">[footnote 45]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.1 ILGA noted in its March 2019 State-Sponsored Homophobia report that ‘Pakistan has been particularly vocal at the Human Rights Council and at various UN fora in its refusal to embrace SOGI within the scope of the various human rights Treaty Bodies, and in its promotion of the “traditional values of humankind” resolutions at the Human Rights Council.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:46" rel="footnote">[footnote 46]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.2 The same report added, ‘During its 3rd cycle of the [Universal Periodic Review] UPR carried out in November 2017, Pakistan received seven SOGIESC [sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics] recommendations. It accepted two of them, whilst noting (functionally rejecting) all remaining five.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:47" rel="footnote">[footnote 47]</a></sup> Pakistan ‘rejected’ the recommendations to adopt legislative measures to decriminalise consensual same-sex sexual relations and to take measures to protect the LGBTIQ community from discrimination and violations to their human rights<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:48" rel="footnote">[footnote 48]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>4.1.3 The News International reported in February 2020 that parliamentarians had been approached by gay men requesting they have legal rights. Raising the issue in the Senate, Ghous Niazi MP said ‘… the government should not take dictation from Europe on the issue.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:49" rel="footnote">[footnote 49]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.4 Cedoca, the Documentation and Research Department of the Office of the Commissioner General for Refugees and Stateless Persons (CGRS), Belgium, published a report on the situation of sexual minorities in Pakistan, dated April 2020, covering events from August 2016 to 6 May 2020. The report cited an email dated 15 April 2020 from Qasim Iqbal, director of the NAZ Male Health Alliance (known as NAZ), a community-based organisation in Pakistan supporting men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender rights, which responded to questions posed by Cedoca. Iqbal stated in regard to the position of sexual minorities under the prime minister, Imran Khan’s leadership, ‘There has been no acknowledgement of the LGBQ community in Pakistan however there has been a strong message of solidarity with the Transgender community with their inclusion in most of the social programs that have been declared in Imran Khan’s tenure and many Transgender representatives being employed in advisory positions in governmental institutions.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:50" rel="footnote">[footnote 50]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.5 According to the DFAT report, ‘Some 13 transgender candidates stood for election in 2018, and in 2019 Pakistan’s Minister for Human Rights appointed a transgender woman to her department for the first time.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:51" rel="footnote">[footnote 51]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.7 The non-governmental organisation (NGO) Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) annual report for 2020 noted, in regard to Punjab province, that:</p>

<p>‘Hopeful signs of transgender people being integrated into the mainstream public domain are rare but there are some enlightening exceptions. Pakistan’s first transgender police officer was appointed in Rawalpindi. Reem Sharif, herself subject to discrimination and harassment in the past, was uniquely qualified as a “trans victim support officer” to resolve disputes and provide advice to the community.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:57" rel="footnote">[footnote 57]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.8 The USSD human rights report for 2020 noted that:</p>

<p>‘In 2019 the inspector general of police announced that the government would provide 0.5 percent of the office jobs in the Sindh police force to members of the transgender community. In May, Rawalpindi police launched a pilot project to protect transgender individuals. The project, called the Tahafuz Center, opened on May 12, and included the first transgender victim-support officer, also a member of the transgender community…</p>

<p>‘A local NGO reported that prison officials in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa housed transgender prisoners separately and that the provincial government formed a jail oversight committee to improve the prison situation. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police stations began offering a dedicated intake desk for transgender persons along with addition of transgender rights education in police training courses. Local NGOs working in the Islamabad Capital Territory and Punjab conducted transgender sensitization training for police officers.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:58" rel="footnote">[footnote 58]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.9 The HRCP 2020 report stated:</p>

<p>‘The Punjab Social Protection Authority’s (PSPA) new Masawaat programme is described as an initiative to mainstream transgender people through the provision of education, health and housing support in ensuring a minimum standard of living, and access to income-generating activities. However, the PSPA also mentions that “administrative efficiency grounds” will govern the selection of interventions from its Transgender Persons Welfare Policy and it is unclear when and how this programme will be administered.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:59" rel="footnote">[footnote 59]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.11 Despite some positive action for trans persons, the ICJ noted:</p>

<p>‘… Pakistan still remains one of the most vocal opponents to greater recognition and protection of human rights on the basis of SOGIESC. While a bare acknowledgment at the societal and governmental level exists for the historically recognized khawajasira community, in which all other transgender identities are then folded in through this law, it remains to be seen whether the protections afforded by the legislation will extend to transgender people who may also identify as lesbian, gay, pan or bisexual.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:61" rel="footnote">[footnote 61]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.12 The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) noted in its Human Rights and Democracy report 2020 that, ‘Pakistan’s Ministry of Human Rights advocated transgender rights. In February, Pakistan became the first country to include an openly transgender woman in its national delegation to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women Committee. However, same-sex relationships remained illegal, and LGBT+ people continued to face violence and discrimination.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:62" rel="footnote">[footnote 62]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.2.5 According to the English-language Pakistani newspaper, The News International, reporting on the above case in August 2020, Akash submitted a request for the medical examination to be stopped, which was denied. After this he failed to appear in court and claimed that he had divorced his wife in a bid for the case to be dropped. An arrest warrant for Akash was issued and Neha was also ordered to appear in court. The judge hearing the case claimed Akash was ‘impersonating as a boy’ to marry Neha and asserted ‘“We are living in an Islamic state rather in America.

<p>4.3.2 Dr Matthew Nelson stated that, due to the high evidentiary requirements, ‘LGBT convictions for zina are very rare.’ He added ‘However, the fear of prosecution under Section 377 or the Hudood Ordinance is significant for LGBT individuals, even despite the fact that convictions leading to formal legal punishments are rare.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:82" rel="footnote">[footnote 82]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span> Treatment by the police</h3>

<p>4.4.2 Reporting on trans women in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, Human Rights Watch (HRW) stated in May 2018 that, ‘According to transgender rights groups, on occasions the police have taken transgender women to the police station, they taunted them, forcibly removed their clothing, ordered them to dance, and poured cold water on them when they refused. Those who complained were subjected to more abuse.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:96" rel="footnote">[footnote 96]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.4.3 The HRCP report for 2018 noted, ‘Transgender people particularly are subjected to harassment, humiliation, and violence by the police, including sexual violence.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:97" rel="footnote">[footnote 97]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span> Police and judicial response to violence against LGBTI persons</h3>

<p>4.5.1 The 2014 IRB response noted that:</p>

<p>‘According to Al Arabiya News, an English-language news service based in Dubai, most hate crimes against LGBT people in Pakistan are unreported or are out of the public spotlight (24 Aug. 2014). Similarly, the WEWA [Women Employees Welfare Association] representative indicated that in cases in which gay men or lesbians are murdered, the family often does not report the motive of the crime in order to not dishonour the family, or claims it was an “honour killing” or a suicide (31 Dec. 2014).’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:100" rel="footnote">[footnote 100]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.5.2 The IRB report of 2019 cited:</p>

<p>‘The Director of the Neengar Society indicated that “[s]eeking police protection on the grounds of sexual orientation is not possible” in Pakistan and that “[r]elevant clauses do not exist in the Pakistani Penal Code or Code of Criminal Procedure”. However, the same source also stated the following:</p>

<p>‘“During recent years there have been reported cases of individuals who were arrested for crimes against members of sexual minorities. Although it is important to note that arrests are only made in cases of heinous offences [such as] murder, rape, physical torture, etc. Other cases like sexual harassment, homophobia, and extortion usually go unreported due to victims’ fear of defamation and persecution”.</p>

<p>‘Regarding the obstacles for sexual and gender minorities to report incidents to police, the same source further stated that having one’s “sexual orientation or gender identity [revealed] might increase risks and threats to safety and life of an individual”.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:101" rel="footnote">[footnote 101]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.5.3 The same report noted:</p>

<p>‘Concerning treatment of transgender persons by law enforcement agencies, FDI and NAZ Pakistan indicate the following:</p>

<p>‘“The police harass and mock the [t]ransgender complainants, and often make sexual advances. A complaint is rarely registered, and they exhibit an indifferent attitude. The transgender communities feel scared and intimidated by the police and often choose not to report the crimes. The police’s reputation is further tarnished in the community because of its pattern of profiling [transgender persons] and harassing them in public spaces”.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:102" rel="footnote">[footnote 102]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.5.4 The IRB 2019 report added ‘The Nation’s [2017] article on attacks against transgender persons reports that the Pakistani state “does nothing to protect them against the constant attacks they face on a daily basis” … RFE/RL reports that “[d]ozens of transgender people” protested in Peshawar in August 2018 to demand more protection from violent crimes.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:103" rel="footnote">[footnote 103]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.5.6 Reporting on events in 2019 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the HRCP noted in its section under trans persons that, ‘When Shakeela was forcibly taken from outside a mosque in Mardan on Eid day in June, beaten and her head shaved for refusing to pay extortion money to the gang, the police took no action. An FIR was only registered after a protest but no arrests were made.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:105" rel="footnote">[footnote 105]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.5.7 In July 2019, The News International reported that a local court in Peshawar sentenced to death the killer of a transwoman 2016<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:106" rel="footnote">[footnote 106]</a></sup>.

<p>4.5.8 Qasim Iqbal of NAZ stated in his email to Cedoca in April 2020:</p>

<p>‘Instead of protections for the LGBTQ community against violence, there are punitive laws that outlaw their gender and sexual identity. This deincentivizes people from reporting violations to law enforcement. There are no laws to prosecute violations against the queer community and this has inculcated a culture where violence against LGBTQ are often ignored or even nurtured by law enforcement. More recently, there has been legislation passed in the National Assembly and Senate that protects the rights of the Transgender community, but the discriminatory nature of law enforcement towards the transgender community still persists.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:109" rel="footnote">[footnote 109]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.5.9 Iqbal was also cited as saying:</p>

<p>‘There is no legislation that protects the LGBTQ community from violence. Even if cases are reported of violence against an LGBTQ person, the police are more likely to indite [sic] the accuser for involvement in homosexual acts as the victims feel endangered because of their sexual orientation and often do not even report cases. More recently, the transgender community has been gaining legal ground on reporting and prosecuting cases of violence against them. One such case was that a man accused of murdering a transgender person was arrested by the police and for the first time in Pakistani history was sentenced to prison for his crime after he was proven guilty in a court trial.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:110" rel="footnote">[footnote 110]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.5.10 The HRCP annual report for 2020 said that, ‘perpetrators are not apprehended’ when cases of violence against members of the transgender community were registered with the police<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:111" rel="footnote">[footnote 111]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>4.5.11 Similar to its 2018<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:112" rel="footnote">[footnote 112]</a></sup> and 2019<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:113" rel="footnote">[footnote 113]</a></sup> reports, the USSD 2020 human rights report noted, in regard to continued violence and discrimination against LGBTI persons, that, ‘The crimes often went unreported, and police generally took little action when they did receive reports.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:114" rel="footnote">[footnote 114]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.5.12 In an October 2021 Dawn article, it was reported that:</p>

<p>‘Addressing a news conference at Peshawar Press Club on Tuesday, Transgender Alliance president Farzana Jan said that the growing incidents of violence against transgender community forced many of its members to leave Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</p>

<p>‘On the occasion, Mahi Gul and Ghazala, members of the transgender community, alleged that influential people were involved in violence against them but police were reluctant to take action against the accused persons…</p>

<p>‘“We are not safe in Peshawar, not even in the presence of police,” they complained. They said that they were also citizens of the country and had right to live with peace.

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span> State complaint mechanisms</h3>

<p>4.6.1 Complaint mechanisms appeared to be limited to trans persons, as referred to in the TPPR Act.</p>

<p>4.6.2 In its analysis of the TPPR Act, the ICJ report of March 2020 noted:</p>

<p>‘The law does not create any new enforcement mechanisms. Section 18 provides that, in addition to remedies available under the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973; the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860; the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898; and the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, “the aggrieved transgender person shall have a right to move a complaint to the Federal Ombudsman, National Commission for Status of Women (NCSW) and National Commission of Human Rights (NCHR) if any of the rights guaranteed herein are denied to him or her.”</p>

<p>‘However, there have been no corresponding amendments in the legislation of the NCSW or the NCHR to expressly include transgender people in their mandate or to give them any additional powers and resources to enforce the rights provided in the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act.</p>

<p>‘Further, while the Act allows transgender people to approach the NCHR and the NCSW to seek redress, they do not place any obligations on these commissions to include in their mandate the rights of transgender people for the purposes of research, training etc.</p>

<p>‘Finally, among other things, the mandate of Federal Ombudsperson is to seek to “resolve complaints and provide relief to the public by carrying out independent investigations into complaints about ‘maladministration’ in any Federal Government agency”. In February 2018, the Ombudsperson appointed a commissioner for transgender rights. However, like the Ombudsperson, the Commissioner’s mandate is limited to Federal Government agencies and does not expend to provincial agencies…’ <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:116" rel="footnote">[footnote 116]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.6.3 The NCHR told Cedoca in an email dated April 2020 that it had ‘… received 35 complaints till date from transgender persons regarding violation of their rights relating to life, liberty, protection, freedom from torture and discrimination.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:117" rel="footnote">[footnote 117]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.1 The EASO report on Pakistan, dated August 2015, using a variety of sources, stated:</p>

<p>‘There are few Pakistani men and women who self-identify as LGBT; those who do, usually belong to the middle or higher classes, live in the big cities and live a double or secret life. Lesbians are even less visible than gay men.</p>

<p>‘Most Pakistanis do not know the meaning of the word “gay” and think it refers to transgender persons. The latter belong to the community of “hijras”, a heterogeneous community of transvestite, hermaphrodite, transsexual, homosexual persons and eunuchs (“khawaja sarra”). Due to rejection by their families, hijras often live within a structured community governed by a guru and settled in the shanty towns. The hijras make a living through artistic performances and singing and dancing during marriages and carnivals. Some of them consider themselves professional marriage dancers but they are often obliged to survive through begging and prostitution.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:118" rel="footnote">[footnote 118]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.2 Qasim Iqbal of NAZ, told Cedoca in an email dated 15 April 2020 that, despite the progressive Transgender Protection Act, the LGBTQ community ‘still have a long way to go for societal and legal acceptance.’ He noted:</p>

<p>‘Pakistan has been heavily influenced by 190 years of colonization that outlawed all forms of LGBTQ identities and subsequently was influenced by mainstream Islamic intolerance towards LGBTQ, marginalizing the community… The queer community is stigmatized and is considered a foreign concept that is not in accordance with traditional Pakistani Muslim values. Any expression of queerness is swiftly repressed and considered shameful. To add on, the media has only reinforced these social norms for the most part and pushes negative stereotypes regarding LGBTQ community.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:119" rel="footnote">[footnote 119]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.3 Iqbal also stated:</p>

<p>‘Pakistan has a homo-friendly culture, meaning it is common for two men to walk on the streets holding each other’s hands. It is also common to hug and kiss on the cheek in public. This does not mean that they are gay… Walking hand in hand amongst two men is perceived normal in certain social economic classes – it does not necessarily raise questions on a person’s sexuality as the [male] South Asian community can be openly physically affectionate.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:120" rel="footnote">[footnote 120]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.4 Iqbal further stated:</p>

<p>‘The LGBTQ community do not outwardly identify with their sexual orientation in Pakistan. For instance, an outwardly gay man or a transgender woman are considered promiscuous and deviant – if any suspicion of their sexual or gender identity becomes apparent they are easily denied access to basic services such as work, housing, justice, and healthcare without consequences. Another example we can consider is a flamboyant gay man or a masculine queer woman – they will have a more difficult time finding a safe and secure job environment where they will not be subjected regular harassment by their colleagues. Similarly, queer people also have a harder time accessing stigma free healthcare, especially limiting access to mental health services. Any indication of a person being sexually active with the same sex can lead to serious consequences. This is especially hard for the transgender community because they are more visible and thus it is easier to target them and subject them to discrimination.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:121" rel="footnote">[footnote 121]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.5 ILGA Asia noted in its 2021 report on Pakistan that:</p>

<p>‘In Pakistan, LGBTIQ is generally categorised into four different communities. For instance, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals are considered as the same community by the general population. They are not aware of terms like gender identity and expression or sexual orientation. Commonly, these terms are not used and understood in Pakistan except within civil society organizations. Intersex and transgender individuals are recognized by their clothing. If an intersex or transgender person is wearing female clothing, he/she/they would be stereotypically recognized as a transgender woman by the general population regardless of their gender identity and expression. As such, clothing is the main feature for their recognition.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:122" rel="footnote">[footnote 122]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.6 Qasim Iqbal of NAZ stated in April 2020, regarding religious tolerance, that, ‘The religious establishment is heavily influenced by the mainstream muslim doctrine of Islam and has no tolerance towards queerness. The queer community is considered a negative Western influence that needs to be cured with religious practices and local treatments. Islam is more tolerant of the transgender community as compared to the other LGBQ community. There is either no acknowledgement or only condemnation.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:123" rel="footnote">[footnote 123]</a></sup></p>

<span class="number">5.2 </span> LGB persons</h3>

<p>5.2.1 The IRB reported in January 2014 that, according to Inter-Press Service, Pakistan’s ‘conservative Muslim society’ view same-sex sexual relationships as a sin. A survey conducted by the Washington-based Pew Research Centre, published in June 2013, showed that 87% of respondents in Pakistan were of the opinion that ‘homosexuality should be rejected by society’. Several sources indicated that gay men and lesbians were rarely open about their sexual orientation<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:124" rel="footnote">[footnote 124]</a></sup>. The World Values Survey (WVS), an international research program devoted to the scientific and academic study of social, political, economic, religious and cultural values of people in the world<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:125" rel="footnote">[footnote 125]</a></sup>, surveyed 1,995 people in Pakistan in 2018, 77% of whom indicated that same-sex relationships were ‘never justifiable.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:126" rel="footnote">[footnote 126]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.2.2 The IRB added that according to the BBC, ‘homophobia has wide social and religious sanction’ and, according to the International New York Times, discrimination and prejudice against sexual minorities ‘run deep’ in Pakistani society. Other media sources described the gay community in Pakistan as ‘underground’. The Pakistan country advisor for the IGLHRC [now known as OutRight Action International] said that transgender people are the only ‘visible’ sexual minority in Pakistan, while there is ‘a lot of invisibility’ among gay men and lesbians, who keep their sexual orientation hidden. According to a WEWA [Women Employees Welfare Association] representative, no lesbians or gay men could be open about their sexuality and move ‘freely’ in Pakistani society<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:127" rel="footnote">[footnote 127]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>5.2.3 A 2015 article in The Express Tribune noted, ‘Pakistan is a conservative and patriarchal society where members of the LGBTQ community must live secret and self-confined lives to avoid discrimination, stigma and abuse. Under the weight of homophobia, heteronormativity and genderism, they are forced to adopt a lifestyle according to society’s assigned gender roles and expectations.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:128" rel="footnote">[footnote 128]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.2.4 Il Grande Colibri published an interview with Haseeb Rathore, a gay Muslim living in Lahore, dated September 2018. Haseeb spoke of how gay men in Pakistan spent their lives, stating:</p>

<p>‘Most gay men spend their life in guilt, carrying a burden of sins. In our society they only have two options: one is to come out of the closet and live a horrible life and being bullied; the other is to conceal their sexuality for the rest of their lives. People usually choose the second option. They get married and start living a dual life: one for the family and society, the other for their own satisfaction. This makes life very pathetic and a [sic] under continuous threat of being caught. Very few men come out and even when [/] if that happens, they get very little support from family and society.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:129" rel="footnote">[footnote 129]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.2.5 In its January 2019 report, the IRB presented similar country information as in its 2014<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:130" rel="footnote">[footnote 130]</a></sup> and 2015<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:131" rel="footnote">[footnote 131]</a></sup> reports on the situation for sexual and gender minorities in Pakistan, in that the gay community was ‘underground.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:132" rel="footnote">[footnote 132]</a></sup> The IRB 2019 report, quoting from a variety of sources, noted:</p>

<p>‘According to sources, sexual minorities in Pakistan are “deterr[ed] from acknowledging” or “reluctant to reveal” their sexual orientation or gender identity. According to a report by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) of the EU on an October 2017 meeting on Pakistan, citing a Country of Origin (COI) researcher from the Office of the Belgian Commissioner General for Refugees and Stateless Persons (CGRS), the LGBT community in Pakistan operates “behind closed doors”.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:133" rel="footnote">[footnote 133]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.2.6 The IRB report continued:</p>

<p>‘AFP reports that homosexuality is [translation] “strictly ignored” and that “LGBT associations only openly advocate for transgender rights, which are culturally accepted in Pakistan. They treat homosexuality only in the framework of the fight against AIDS”. In correspondence with the Research Directorate, the Director of the Neengar Society, […] similarly stated that “[s]exual minorities, except for transgender people, cannot live… openly. There is a clear risk of discrimination, violence, social boycott and degradation in social class and rank. In some cases a serious threat [to] life is also involved”.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:134" rel="footnote">[footnote 134]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.2.7 DFAT noted in February 2019 ‘Strong and widespread cultural, religious and social intolerance of homosexuality means it is not widely discussed or acknowledged in Pakistan.’ According to the same report, ‘[L]ocal sources say less societal shame is associated with having a lesbian child than a daughter having sex with a male out of wedlock, although stigma remains common.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:135" rel="footnote">[footnote 135]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.2.8 ILGA Asia noted in its 2021 report on Pakistan that, ‘Homosexuality is considered an unlawful, unethical and sinful act in the eyes of Pakistani society. The religious community does not support LGB persons at all. The holy book of Muslims – the Quran – openly declares homosexuality as a sin. They are labelled as “qaum-e-loot”. There are many hadiths against homosexuality.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:136" rel="footnote">[footnote 136]</a></sup></p>

The BBC pointed out that the fatwa was not legally binding<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:141" rel="footnote">[footnote 141]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>5.3.2 The News International reported in March 2018 that ‘… children suffering from congenital intersex abnormality, with dominant XX hormones, are surgically converted into females enabling them to lead a normal life with ability for procreation of offspring.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:142" rel="footnote">[footnote 142]</a></sup> StopIGM.org, an international human rights NGO of survivors and allies fighting Intersex Genital Mutilations (IGM) in children’s clinics, and for the right to physical integrity and self-determination for all children born with ‘atypical genitalia’, or Variations of Sex Anatomy, criticised the Birth Defects Foundation for describing intersex children in Pakistan as having ‘birth defects’ and for offering surgery to make them ‘normal’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:143" rel="footnote">[footnote 143]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>5.3.3 According to sources cited by the IRB 2019 report, ‘transgender persons are “marginalised” or “ostracized” by society. The BBC reports that “[t]ransgender men … are barely visible in the public sphere as a result of the social and cultural expectations of those who are assigned female at birth. Transgender women, meanwhile, are marginalised by society from an early age”.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:144" rel="footnote">[footnote 144]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.3.4 The same IRB report added, ‘A Pakistani actor, who made an appearance as a crossdresser on a very popular talk show, is cited by AFP as stating the following: [translation] “[w]e live in a culture of hypocrisy.

<p>5.3.5 The USSD human rights report for 2018 noted ‘According to a wide range of LGBT NGOs and activists, society generally shunned transgender women, eunuchs, and intersex persons, collectively referred to as “hijras” – a word some transgender individuals view as pejorative, preferring the term “khawaja sira” – who often lived together in slum communities and survived by begging and dancing at carnivals and weddings.

<p>5.3.6 In regard to trans persons, ILGA Asia noted in its 2021 report on Pakistan, commissioned and conducted by ILGA Asia from November 2020 to January 2021 and based on online in-depth interviews with staff members from 18 community-based organizations and networks, officials from UN agencies and government departments<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:149" rel="footnote">[footnote 149]</a></sup>, that the general population were only aware of intersex persons and ‘… they think that all transgender people are intersex because of their limited awareness.

<p>5.3.7 A September 2020 paper on gender dysphoria (a disparity between a person’s assigned and expressed gender and the distress associated with it), which cited various sources, noted that:</p>

<p>‘The term “transgender” has different connotations in Pakistani society. It usually refers to a group of individuals locally known as “hijras” or “khwaja siras” who do not conform to the traditional gender binaries and are widely thought to possess mystical powers. They are invited to sing and dance on occasions like the birth of a male child or a wedding and are supposed to bring good luck. Hijras live in close-knit communities or “addas” formed along the lines of a “guru-chela” relationship dating back to the master-disciple relationship in Sufism and speak a cryptic language called “Hijra Farsi.”</p>

<p>‘In present-day Pakistan, owing to increasing westernization, many young, non-binary, and transgender individuals are breaking away from this traditional system and adopting a global transgender identity.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:151" rel="footnote">[footnote 151]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span> Men who have sex with men (MSM)</h3>

<p>5.4.1 In 2014, the IRB cited a 2002 study of MSM in Lahore by the Naz Foundation International, an advocacy group working with MSM in Pakistan:</p>

<p>‘The frameworks of male to male sex, often substantially divergent and exclusive, involve males who self-identify as zenanas [“a woman in a man’s body”], males/men who take the penetrating role in male-to-male sex (known as giryas by zenanas) accessing zenanas, hijras, and at times, adolescent males. These males are usually perceived by giryas as feminised males/females which enables the girya to maintain his sense of manliness. Other dynamics include males who access other males for discharge and/or desire to be penetrated, males who desire male to male sex and do not gender themselves and usually indulge in mutual sexual activity – “giving and taking”, friends have sex with friends for mutual pleasure, and males in all male institutions.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:152" rel="footnote">[footnote 152]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.4.2 The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) report on Pakistan, dated August 2015, also noted that zenana have sexual relations with ‘malishia’, described as ‘… virile men because of their sexual practices. The term “malishia” refers more to a professional practice of massage and prostitution than to a sexual practice or identity.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:153" rel="footnote">[footnote 153]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.4.3 DFAT noted in February 2019 ‘While sex between males is common, homosexual identity is not.

<p>5.4.4 In its 2014 report, the IRB cited a BBC News article from 2013 ‘The BBC described Karachi as a “bustling with same-sex activity” in terms of men having sex with men, however it also indicated that it is difficult for gay men to maintain same-sex relationships, because “sex between men will be overlooked as long as no-one feels that tradition or religion are being challenged”.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:155" rel="footnote">[footnote 155]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.4.5 The IRB January 2019 report cited sources referring to MSM:</p>

<p>‘AFP reports that, according to the president of NAZ, an LGBT organization in Pakistan, [translation] “90% of Pakistani men are MSM […] simply because women are not easily accessible”. Without providing further details, the CGRS [Office of the Belgian Commissioner General for Refugees and Stateless Persons] researcher cited in the [2017] EASO meeting report on Pakistan, indicated that “[s]ources stated that it is common for straight men to indulge in Male to Male sex (MSM) and there is general acceptance within [Pakistani] society for this particular act”.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:156" rel="footnote">[footnote 156]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.5.2 According to research conducted by the IRB and reported in 2019 ‘As with many other issues, the extent of familial and societal discrimination and violence faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people tends to be inversely proportional to their socio-economic status.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:158" rel="footnote">[footnote 158]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.5.3 The 2019 DFAT report noted ‘People identifying as LGBTI from wealthy and influential families in large urban centres face less discrimination and violence than poor people in rural areas.

<p>5.5.6 The 2019 IRB report noted that, according to an AFP report of October 2018, ‘… although Pakistan has not convicted sexual minorities on the grounds of anti-homosexuality legislation, the situation is different within families, as [translation] “hundreds of homicides are committed each year in the country in the name of family “honour”.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:164" rel="footnote">[footnote 164]</a></sup> The same IRB report also stated, ‘Sources also report that “hate crimes” [or “honour killings”…] have been committed against transgender people.

<p>5.5.8 ILGA Asia noted in its 2021 report on Pakistan that:</p>

<p>‘The human rights situation of LGB individuals in terms of social and cultural aspects is not satisfactory. The term “LGBTIQ” itself is considered a “western agenda”. Families in general do not accept LGB individuals if they come out. Lesbian and gay individuals are forced to marry the opposite gender due to the pressures imposed by their families… On the other hand, there is a smaller community from mainstream society that accepts LGB.

<p>‘Pakistani media is heavily influenced by Pakistani society and reinforces the societal heteronormative norms that are ever present, especially the Urdu news outlets which are hostile towards queerness in any form. However, there are few local English medium outlets which are more progressive and report on Queer stories and narratives in a more sensitive way. Recently, mainstream media and cable news have been more sensitive to transgender community, with many positive stories about them and reporting on the violations that occur against them. The media has played a significant role in changing attitudes of society at large towards the transgender community. Many transgender activists and community leaders are often invited as guests on television broadcasted morning shows and evening news shows to discuss the plight of the transgender community and debate on issues from the transgender perspective. Additionally, the transgender community is gaining momentum in the Pakistani fashion industry with openly transgender models like Kami Sid walking major runways and modelling for major fashion brands.

Dating apps such as Grindr and Tinder are very often used by gay men and trans women. Queer women have a harder time using dating apps because of sexist societal norms, and lack of mobilization. There are many queer platforms on various social media sites - NAZ itself has a secret group on Facebook with about 1.000 members. Similarly, there is a large local queer presence on Instagram, Twitter and TikTok.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:178" rel="footnote">[footnote 178]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.7.3 Similarly, the ILGA Asia 2021 report on Pakistan noted:</p>

<p>‘Across the board, the LGBTIQ community in Pakistan is connected with one another, even if the exposure differs from person to person. People are increasingly connected with each other virtually, especially through social media apps, before they would meet physically or at gatherings and parties. They are connected through Facebook pages and groups. These groups are usually secret and handled by group administrators. LGBTIQ community members and their allies are the members of these groups. They also have Whatsapp groups. These groups are secret and only LGBTIQ community members are added into these groups. This allows the LGBTIQ community to be connected and be able to provide support to each other when needed.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:179" rel="footnote">[footnote 179]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.7.4 According to the 2020 report by ILGA, Section 34 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (2016) may be used to penalise LGBTI content. Section 34 of Act grants the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority the power to remove or block access to content if it considers it necessary ‘in the interest of the glory of Islam, public order, decency, or morality.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:180" rel="footnote">[footnote 180]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.7.5 In September 2020 it was reported that Tinder and Grindr, as well as other dating apps, had been blocked by the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority for disseminating ‘immoral content’. According to analytical data cited in September 2020, the gay dating app, Grindr, had been downloaded 300,000 in Pakistan over the past 12 months<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:181" rel="footnote">[footnote 181]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:182" rel="footnote">[footnote 182]</a></sup>. According to Deutsche Welle (DW) reporting in May 2021, lesser-known apps and VPNs (virtual private networks) were available so users could still arrange to meet<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:183" rel="footnote">[footnote 183]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>5.7.6 Reporting on the impact of COVID on the LGBTI community, DW indicated that meetings and ‘hook-ups’ were ‘… largely facilitated by social media, online groups and dating applications.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:184" rel="footnote">[footnote 184]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.8 </span> Violence and discrimination</h3>

<p>5.8.1 Il Grande Colibri reported in September 2020 that:</p>

<p>‘Even though the transgender population is considered as the most privileged amongst gender and sexual minorities, the rate of violence towards them and the number of murders is at an all-time high. Transgender men and women get harassed, and get physically and mentally abused by their own families, and are threatened to serious consequences for revealing their true gender identity. Those who join khawaja sira culture are more vulnerable because usually they end up being involved in begging, wedding dancing, and sex work.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:185" rel="footnote">[footnote 185]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.8.2 The DFAT report dated January 2022 noted that, despite laws protecting trans persons, they were:</p>

<p>‘… often marginalised, discriminated against and abused. Transgender women are often rejected by their families and turn to sex work, or earn their income by begging or dancing at carnivals and weddings. Such work is highly visible and workers are vulnerable to physical and sexual violence. There are frequent media reports of transgender people being targeted through rape, honour killings and societal violence. Such incidents are especially common in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where 66 transgender people were killed between 2015 and 2019 without any arrests being made, according to Trans Action Alliance, an NGO. Notwithstanding the law, many transgender people reportedly still face barriers to accessing health, policing and other services.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:186" rel="footnote">[footnote 186]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.8.3 HRCP noted that in 2019 ‘There are fewer reports of attacks on the transgender community in Sindh, although some incidents may not be publicised.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:187" rel="footnote">[footnote 187]</a></sup> However, the report added ‘Shabana, 30, was found stabbed to death in a rented flat in April in the Tariq Road area.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:188" rel="footnote">[footnote 188]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.8.4 Human Rights Watch (HRW) noted in its World Report 2021, covering 2020 events, that:</p>

<p>‘According to local human rights groups, at least 65 transgender women have been killed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province since 2015. In April, Musa, a 15-year-old transgender boy was gang-raped and killed in Faisalabad district, Punjab. In July, unidentified gunman in Rawalpindi district, Punjab, killed Kangna, a transgender woman. An unidentified assailant fatally shot Gul Panra, a transgender woman activist in Peshawar, in September. The murder prompted widespread condemnation on social media.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:189" rel="footnote">[footnote 189]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.8.5 In December 2020, The European Parliament’s LGBTI Intergroup wrote to the Pakistan government expressing their ‘… deepest concerns over the increasing killings, attempted killings, kidnappings and physical attacks against transgender rights defenders in Pakistan.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:190" rel="footnote">[footnote 190]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.8.6 Referring to incidents in 2020, the letter noted, ‘We have been alerted of a series of attacks against transgender rights defenders in the country, notably the killing of Beenish – actively involved in delivering resources to those in need during the pandemic – in end of October in Islamabad, the brutal physical attack and robbery of Nayyab Ali on 9 November in Islamabad and the kidnapping at gun point of Heera Malik in end of November.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:191" rel="footnote">[footnote 191]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.8.7 According to the letter, the attack on prominent trans rights activist, Nayyab Ali, followed a nomination for an award for her work on trans rights and was clearly ‘… in reprisal for her human rights work as the unidentified assailants threatened to kill Nayyab Ali if she continued to raise her voice for victims of violence in the transgender community.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:192" rel="footnote">[footnote 192]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.8.8 Reporting on events in 2020, the HRCP noted. ‘Based on press reports, HRCP recorded at least seven cases of rape and four cases of murder involving transgender victims in Punjab for the year.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:193" rel="footnote">[footnote 193]</a></sup> The same report noted that in Sindh province, ‘In December, the body of a transgender person was found at their house in Malir. Rescuers transported the body to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, where the person was identified as Amir alias Maria. The police said he lived alone and had been killed with a sharp-edged tool, although they could not ascertain why.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:194" rel="footnote">[footnote 194]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.8.9 Referring to events in 2020 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the HRCP report noted:</p>

<p>‘In June, two transgender persons, Bilal and Tahir, were injured while resisting the abduction of a friend, Ahmad, in Chamkani. In September, Shakil alias Gul Panra, a transgender person, was killed and another, Chahat, sustained serious injuries from gunshots fired by unidentified men in Peshawar’s Tehkal neighbourhood. In the same month, Saad Khan, a transgender person, was gunned down in Swabi by his 13-year-old brother for dancing at parties.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:195" rel="footnote">[footnote 195]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.8.10 According to the HRCP 2019 and 2020 reports there were no reports (in mainstream media) of violence against trans persons in Balochistan during those years<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:196" rel="footnote">[footnote 196]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:197" rel="footnote">[footnote 197]</a></sup>, though the 2020 report added ‘… such violence is rarely highlighted in Balochistan.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:198" rel="footnote">[footnote 198]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.8.11 The USSD report on human rights for 2020 stated that, ‘In July [2020] a video was shared online that depicted men in Rawalpindi assaulting a group of transgender women, who were held at gunpoint and raped after being forced to strip.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:199" rel="footnote">[footnote 199]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.8.12 Covering 2021 events, HRW noted ‘In July, activists claimed that the transgender community in Karachi was being targeted in an organized social media campaign to instigate violence against its members. On April 6, a 60-year-old transgender resident of Karachi’s Korangi neighborhood was shot and killed by unidentified assailants who broke into their home.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:200" rel="footnote">[footnote 200]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.8.13 The Office for the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) reported in October 2021 on Saro Imran, a trans youth advocate and social entrepreneur for the rights and empowerment of trans people in Multan, Pakistan, who said ‘Even with the progressive Protection of Rights Act, transgender people, especially youth, continue to face many challenges in the civic space such as harassment, security, and lack of access to social and economic opportunities…’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:201" rel="footnote">[footnote 201]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.8.14 The Express Tribune reported in December 2021 on the alleged rape and torture of a trans woman the day before Karachi’s Climate March, which she helped organise. According to the report, ‘… unidentified persons kept her in detention for three hours and tortured her to extract information regarding the march’s speeches. The assailants also allegedly threatened her to stop trans rights activism and related political activities, otherwise, the trans community would be subjected to greater violence in the future.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:202" rel="footnote">[footnote 202]</a></sup> Speaking to the Express Tribune, the Gender Interactive Alliance (GIA) said they believed the assailants were connected to the Sindh police ‘… given the history of police involvement in violence against transgender people.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:203" rel="footnote">[footnote 203]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> Presence</h3>

<p>6.1.1 The 2017 national census recorded 10,418 trans people (in a total population of over 200 million). The census, cited by the news site Dawn, recorded 6,709 trans persons in Punjab, 2527 in Sindh, 913 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 133 in Islamabad, 109 in Balochistan and 27 in the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:204" rel="footnote">[footnote 204]</a></sup>. Campaigners said that this overall figure was a huge underestimate, with one group stating there were 400,000 to 500,000 trans persons in Punjab province alone, whilst another estimated 300,000 across Pakistan<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:205" rel="footnote">[footnote 205]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:206" rel="footnote">[footnote 206]</a></sup>. DW noted that, ‘According to a 2019 Supreme Court census, the estimated population of transgender people in Pakistan is around 300,000, although the actual number could be higher.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:207" rel="footnote">[footnote 207]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.1.2 As sexual orientation outside of heterosexual norms were not recognised, there were no official statistics for the number of LGB persons.</p>

<p>6.1.3 The USSD human rights report for 2020 noted ‘Lesbian, gay, bisexual, male transgender, and intersex persons rarely revealed their sexual orientation or gender identity in the public sphere. There were communities of openly transgender women, but they were marginalized and were frequently the targets of violence and harassment.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:208" rel="footnote">[footnote 208]</a></sup> The USSD made the same findings in its 2018<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:209" rel="footnote">[footnote 209]</a></sup> and 2019<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:210" rel="footnote">[footnote 210]</a></sup> reports.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span> Meeting places and events</h3>

<p>6.2.1 In December 2013, the President of the Neengar Society told the IRB that social media groups and organised meetings in larger cities such as Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad, existed for LGBT persons; however, this culture exists only among the more socially and intellectually elite classes of Pakistan, and there are no openly gay communities in these cities<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:211" rel="footnote">[footnote 211]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>6.2.2 When interviewed about gay relationships in Pakistan, Haseeb Rathore, a gay man living in Pakistan, stated in September 2018 ‘Gay relationships are definitely realistic in Pakistan. Sometimes they are carried out from “inside” the closet, sometimes they are publicly open depending on how privileged you are and on how much pressure you can absorb from society and family.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:212" rel="footnote">[footnote 212]</a></sup> In contrast to this view, an April 2021 article in The Diplomat stated with regard to the possibility of same-sex relationships that, ‘While sex in Pakistan may be available regardless of the law, relationships are far from being possible.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:213" rel="footnote">[footnote 213]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.2.3 In an e-mail to Cedoca, dated 15 April 2020, Qasim Iqbal stated:</p>

<p>‘The underground gay scene is mostly accessible to the upper, upper middle and middle classes. These are private parties that take place mostly in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad. Invitations go out via SMS and Facebook and the venue is usually announced at the last minute. The organisers usually pay off the police so the police is actually there to protect the party boys. The gay scene is only underground because publicly being visible is a luxury only the elite queers enjoy. The majority of the local queer community operates underground, meeting for dates, hookups, hangouts and even large parties…’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:214" rel="footnote">[footnote 214]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.2.4 The DFAT report indicated similar and stated in its January 2022 report that cities such as Karachi have an active LGBTI underground scene, adding that, ‘There are reportedly pockets of acceptance among urban, upper-class communities…’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:215" rel="footnote">[footnote 215]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.2.5 The same source noted:</p>

<p>‘Public demonstration of queerness in Pakistan often makes local communities more vulnerable to violence, so it is often the more privileged class who get to be more visible and escape consequences. For example, the US embassy celebrated Pride in 2012 in Islamabad, and even publicly posted about the event. This lead to extreme backlash for local queer populations by the society at large. More recently, queer communities have become more organized and are becoming more visible with the help of their allies and have been taking part of movements actively such as the Aurat (Women’s) March, The Queer Futures Conference in LUMS University and other more exclusive congregations. South Asian Poetry and literature has a history of Queerness such as Ismat Chugtai and Manto who have documented queer experiences in their writing. More writers have found outlets for their creativity online and use social media to report on these narratives. NAZ also mobilizes large groups of the queer community for various events like the Pride Party in July 2019, where about 200 people from the queer community attended an underground party for socialization and celebration.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:216" rel="footnote">[footnote 216]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span> Civil society groups and NGOs</h3>

<p>6.3.1 DFAT noted in its February 2019 report ‘Given social stigma associated with homosexuality in Pakistan, advocacy efforts on behalf of the LGBTI community generally advance under the umbrella of the transgender community. Those that advocate for the LGBTI community are also vulnerable to attack.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:217" rel="footnote">[footnote 217]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.3.2 The IRB report stated in 2019 ‘The Director of the Neengar Society stated that the Pakistani “government does not support the work of LGBTQI advocacy organizations”.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:218" rel="footnote">[footnote 218]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.3.3 The IRB report added ‘The July 2018 BBC article reports that “[m]any” transgender persons “seek safety with gurus – leaders of small, scattered transgender communities – who give them food and shelter in return for their service and contribution to the group”. […] The Director of the Neengar Society stated that currently, there are no organizations providing temporary emergency shelter for sexual minorities<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:219" rel="footnote">[footnote 219]</a></sup>, although DFAT noted ‘Informal shelters exist within the LGBTI community, at the homes of community members.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:220" rel="footnote">[footnote 220]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.3.4 The USSD human rights report for 2020 noted that ‘The domestic NGO registration agreement with the government requires NGOs not to use terms the government finds controversial – such as… lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or intersex (LGBTI) persons – in their annual reports or documents.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:221" rel="footnote">[footnote 221]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.3.5 Qasim Iqbal stated in April 2020 in his email to Cedoca:</p>

<p>‘There are many organizations that operate all across Pakistan that cater towards the LGBTQ community or are at least inclusive of them in their project interventions. These organizations are mostly concentrated in larger cities but some can also be found in smaller areas. Most of the organizations operating in Pakistan are part of a network called the Gulabi Triangle, of which NAZ is the secretariat. This network consists of all the local organizations that have been working for the LGBTQ community in Pakistan.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:222" rel="footnote">[footnote 222]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.3.6 The Office for the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) reported in October 2021 on Saro Imran, a trans youth advocate and social entrepreneur for the rights and empowerment of trans people in Multan, Pakistan, who acknowledged that there were more grassroots level organisations for trans people since the Protection of Rights Act was passed<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:223" rel="footnote">[footnote 223]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>6.3.7 However, according to the ILGA Asia 2021 report on Pakistan:</p>

<p>‘The state is not very supportive of civil society organizations in Pakistan and they are highly surveilled to monitor their work and the people they are working with/for. The registration process with EAD [Economic Affairs Division] and the Punjab charity commission, renewal of registration, issues of opening bank accounts for the organizations, are just some of the issues that are creating hurdles for civil society organizations and limiting their scope of work. Registration with EAD is mandatory for the organizations to qualify for foreign funding opportunities. Due to these barriers, the unavailability of foreign funds is one of the major impediments. Unregistered organizations are not eligible to receive foreign funding.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:224" rel="footnote">[footnote 224]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.3.8 The same source noted:</p>

<p>‘Several community-based organizations (CBOs) and movements focusing on lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) rights do not want to publicize their work because they fear stigmatization. They are working under the ambit of transgender rights movement. That being said, transgender and intersex persons do have legal protection and support from the state; the TGPA [Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act 2018] protects their basic human rights. For the implementation of the TGPA, provincial policies are being developed with the consultation of community members.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:225" rel="footnote">[footnote 225]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.3.9 The 2019 IRB report identified several organisations offering support and/or advocacy for LGBTI persons:</p>

<p>‘The Neengar Society “launched a legal aid center in 2015 to extend paralegal and legal aid, consultation and support to members of sexual minorities”.</p>

<p>‘The Forum for Dignity Initiatives (FDI) is a</p>

<p>‘“research and advocacy forum working for sexual and gender minorities in Pakistan … [Their] activism promotes empowerment and understanding through community[-]motivated initiatives to improve the human rights situation of these groups. FDI initiatives include conducting research, advocating for legal rights, raising awareness and building capacity. [They] collaborate with multiple stakeholders including the government, civil society networks and like-minded groups. FDI lobbies and campaigns for voting opportunities. [They] discourage discrimination through the cis-heteronormative society by facilitating dialogues, debates, experience sharing and information dissemination”.</p>

<p>‘The NAZ Male Health Alliance, established in 2011, is an</p>

<p>‘“LGBT community[-]based organisation in Pakistan, and is providing technical, financial and institutional support for improving the sexual health, welfare and human rights of the LGBT community throughout the country. They do this by providing technical support and capacity[-]building exercises to various stake holders, networks, groups and organisations”.</p>

<p>‘Blue Veins is an NGO working in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that is “committed to build, strengthen and galvanize women &amp; transgender person[s’] collective power for a just and sustainable world - for all”.</p>

<p>‘The Gender Interactive Alliance Pakistan (GIA)</p>

<p>‘“work[s] for the equality and civil rights of transgender people in Pakistan. …</p>

<p>‘“Among [their] foremost projects is to lobby the government of Pakistan for: recognition of transgender people as equal citizens of Pakistan; providing free medical care to transgender people who are routinely denied public healthcare; and enabling entrepreneurship by providing economic opportunities for transgender people who are, by and large, left out of the mainstream economy. [They] also aim to provide a safe space for these people online so that their stories and experiences are not erased from our collective cultural experience”.</p>

<p>‘The Khawaja Sira Society (KSS) was “founded by Naz Male Health Society under the Global Fund Grant Round 9 in 2010 [and] is Pakistan’s first and biggest transgender community organization with 300,000 members, volunteers and associates across the country”. Their “vision is to ensure that transgender individuals have the same rights [as] their cisgender counterparts”. KSS runs a “comprehensive voluntary counseling and HIV test (VCT) for hijra communities”; 13,000 transgender persons have been registered in KSS’s VCT programmes.</p>

<p>‘TransAction, a network that was established by transgender and intersex activists in 2015 to focus on transgender and intersex issues, raises “awareness through education and training to the transgender and intersex community, their families and general society,” in “disadvantaged communities [in] Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Federally Administrated Tribal Areas (FATA)”.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:226" rel="footnote">[footnote 226]</a></sup></p>

<span class="number">7.1 </span> Access to healthcare</h3>

<p>7.1.1 Citing Gay Star News, the ILGA 2019 report noted ‘In September 2018, the Lahore High Court ruled that public hospitals in Punjab province must provide separate facilities for transgender patients to safeguard their right to privacy and protect them from discrimination and prejudice.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:228" rel="footnote">[footnote 228]</a></sup></p>

<p>7.1.2 The HRCP report noted that in November 2018 ‘[T]he Human Rights Minister and the Federal Minister for National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination, inaugurated a separate ward at PIMS Hospital in Islamabad, announcing free treatment and separate doctors for transgender patients.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:229" rel="footnote">[footnote 229]</a></sup> However, according to the USSD human rights report for 2018, local authorities often denied trans persons admission to hospitals<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:230" rel="footnote">[footnote 230]</a></sup>. The USSD human rights reports for 2019<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:231" rel="footnote">[footnote 231]</a></sup> and 2020<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:232" rel="footnote">[footnote 232]</a></sup> made similar findings.</p>

<p>7.1.3 Pakistan’s health insurance scheme was extended to trans persons in late 2019/early 2020<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:233" rel="footnote">[footnote 233]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:234" rel="footnote">[footnote 234]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>7.1.4 The HRCP reported that in December 2019, ‘… the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Health Department ‘… reserved 74 separate beds for transgenders at 19 government hospitals in 15 districts of the province, with another 124 beds to be allotted in the rest of public sector hospitals. This is in accordance with the 2018 Transgender Protection Act.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:235" rel="footnote">[footnote 235]</a></sup></p>

<p>7.1.5 A study of 382 people by the Good Thinkers Organization (GTO) Pakistan, a human rights NGO, on the effect of COVID-19 on the trans community in Punjab province, found, ‘Nearly 40% of the respondents informed that they visited hospitals and found nice behavior as well as treatment from the staff. They expressed their satisfaction and extended appreciation for staff at hospitals. Around 8% of the respondents expressed their grief on unfair behavior of staff at public health facilities.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:236" rel="footnote">[footnote 236]</a></sup></p>

<p>7.1.6 Another 2020 study of 214 trans persons in Lahore concluded, ‘Transgender community face physical, mental, social and reproductive health issues. About 70% trans-genders receive poor quality of health care services. Non acceptance, feeling ashamed, non-availability of CNIC [national identity card] and non-affordability have been reported as major barriers in getting desired health care.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:237" rel="footnote">[footnote 237]</a></sup></p>

<p>7.1.7 A September 2020 paper on gender dysphoria, which cited various sources, noted that:</p>

<p>‘In healthcare facilities, transgender individuals face harassment and are often turned away mainly because of the health professional’s ignorance and lack of experience in treating patients who do not conform to the strict gender binaries of the Pakistani society. Across Pakistan, there is no inclusion of transgender healthcare issues in the medical education curriculum. Additionally, doctors are hesitant to perform any gender-reassignment procedures, hormonal or surgical, for fear of religious and legal repercussions. At present, a court order is required to be able to perform a gender reassignment surgery in Pakistan.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:238" rel="footnote">[footnote 238]</a></sup></p>

<p>7.1.8 Referring to access to HIV and AIDS services, ILGA Asia noted in its 2021 report on Pakistan that although the services were available free of charge, ‘… people are not accessing them for several reasons, including issues surrounding rejection, stigma and discrimination. Those who may be infected avoid treatment because of the proximity of their houses to medical facilities, transportation costs, ignorance, or the lack of education.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:239" rel="footnote">[footnote 239]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span> Access to employment</h3>

<p>7.2.1 According to the IRB report dated 2015:</p>

<p>‘Sources indicate that lesbians, bisexuals and gay men are not open about their sexual orientation at the workplace … According to the IGLHRC country advisor, if they come out in the open about their sexual orientation, they would “face problems at work” and “would likely face harassment to conform and might lose their jobs” … The WEWA representative similarly said that LGB people hide their identity at work because it would be “hard for them to continue” their job or they might lose their position if people at work found out … According to the President of the Neengar Society, when their organization conducted a workshop on gender sensitivity, even though participants were open to having LGBT friends, 43 of 45 participants said they would not want to work with an LGBT person in their office because they wanted to present a “serious and professional environment” of their organization to the public … He expressed the opinion that this showed that if someone revealed their sexual orientation or gender identity to their colleagues, it would cost the person his or her job … The WEWA representative said that if LGB people revealed their identity at work, they might also face criminal charges.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:240" rel="footnote">[footnote 240]</a></sup></p>

<p>7.2.2 In its report covering 2019 events, the HRCP noted, ‘In October, the Sindh government fixed a 0.5 percent quota of jobs in all provincial government departments for transgender citizens. Earlier, in April, it was reported that a five percent quota of office jobs would be available to transgender people in the Sindh police force, and that they could also serve as regular duty police officers.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:241" rel="footnote">[footnote 241]</a></sup></p>

<p>7.2.3 In November 2020, Reuters reported on Pakistan’s first trans lawyer, Nisha Rao, who went from begging on the streets to earning a law degree and joining the Karachi Bar Association. She now works for an NGO fighting for transgender rights<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:242" rel="footnote">[footnote 242]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>7.2.4 In January 2022, Gulf News reported that a transgender woman, Sarah Gill, had become Pakistan’s first transgender doctor<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:243" rel="footnote">[footnote 243]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span> Accommodation</h3>

<p>7.3.1 As regards to renting a property, quoting from various sources, the IRB noted in its 2015 report:</p>

<p>‘Sources indicate that if a homosexual couple’s sexual orientation is known, they will not be able to rent an apartment in Lahore, Islamabad or Karachi … Sources indicate that people are even reluctant to rent places to a single man or a single woman in these cities …, because they do not want their tenant to bring someone else into the home. The president of the Neengar Society noted that the police in Lahore have issued orders not to rent out apartments to tenants without a “proper check,” because of the “conservative culture” and the “increase in terrorism” … According to the IGLHRC Country Advisor for Pakistan, two men or women might be able to rent a place if they keep their sexual orientation hidden, as it would appear that their motives were for economic reasons, but if they came out about their sexual orientation, “they would definitely have problems and lose their place to stay” … He noted that he did not know of any specific cases of housing discrimination, because gay men and lesbians keep their sexual orientation hidden. Similarly, the President of the Neengar Society said that since people are not open about their sexual orientation, it is unknown how many lesbian and gay people face housing issues in Lahore, Islamabad and Karachi … He was aware of a case in Islamabad, in which a male who had undergone sex reassignment surgery was asked to leave the house he rented and find another place to live, as well as a case from Lahore in which a lesbian couple could not find a place to live because they “looked like boys” …’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:244" rel="footnote">[footnote 244]</a></sup></p>

<p>7.3.2 The IRB also noted ‘Sources indicate that transgender people in Lahore, Islamabad and Karachi have difficulty accessing housing in good neighbourhoods and usually live in slums …, “shabby areas near truck workshops” …, or “in the margins in these cities”…’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:245" rel="footnote">[footnote 245]</a></sup> The USSD human rights reports for 2018, 2019 and 2020 all indicated that transgender women often lived together in slum communities<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:246" rel="footnote">[footnote 246]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:247" rel="footnote">[footnote 247]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:248" rel="footnote">[footnote 248]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>7.3.3 The IRB report of 2019 noted that according to FDI and NAZ Pakistan, ‘…discrimination against transgender persons also includes housing, as “[r]enting a house is particularly challenging as landlords usually refuse to accept them as tenants. Those who do usually extort higher rent and refuse to sign a legal contract”.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:249" rel="footnote">[footnote 249]</a></sup></p>
