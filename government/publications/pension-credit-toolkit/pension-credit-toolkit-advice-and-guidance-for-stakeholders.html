<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This toolkit is designed to provide some ideas and guidance for organisations wishing to encourage pensioners they have dealings with to claim Pension Credit where they might be entitled. We know that many organisations work with pensioners all the time and you do not need us to tell you how to do your job. In fact, if you have some top tips of your own, or things that have worked well, please share them with us and we can pass them on to others. We hope though that this toolkit will offer some support for organisations with less experience of working with and helping pensioners.</p>

<h2>About Pension Credit</h2>

<p>Pension Credit tops up weekly income to a guaranteed minimum level of £182.60 a week for single pensioners or £278.70 for couples. It is a tax-free payment for those who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have reached <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pension-credit-toolkit/pension-credit-toolkit-advice-and-guidance-for-stakeholders#qualifying-age">Pension Credit qualifying age</a>, which is State Pension age, and</li>
  <li>live in Great Britain</li>
</ul>

<p>Someone may still get Pension Credit if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have not paid National Insurance contributions</li>
  <li>have some savings or a small pension</li>
  <li>live with their grown-up family</li>
  <li>own their own home</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/pension-credit-calculator">Pension Credit calculator</a> to find out how much Pension Credit someone could get – without giving any personal details.</p>

<h3>A quick guide to entitlement</h3>

<p>There are 4 main questions when considering whether a pensioner may get Pension Credit:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How old are they?</li>
  <li>If they have a partner, how old is their partner?</li>
  <li>What is their weekly income? Is it less that £182.60 if they are single or £278.70 if they are a couple?</li>
  <li>Do they have any savings? Have they got less than £10,000?</li>
</ol>

<p>People who have more income or savings than this may still qualify for Pension Credit. But these questions are a good basic indication of who is likely to qualify.</p>

<p>If they are over 65 and reached their State Pension age before 6 April 2016, they could still qualify for Pension Credit if their weekly income is less than:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£218.80 if they are single</li>
  <li>£319.20 if they are a couple</li>
</ul>

<p>More information about Pension Credit can be found below.</p>

<h2>Promoting Pension Credit</h2>

<p>We know that some people may not be getting Pension Credit when they might be eligible for it. We’re committed to changing that.</p>

<p>The aim of this material is to raise awareness of Pension Credit and  help dispel some common misconceptions that might deter people from claiming it by highlighting that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>people of State Pension age may be entitled to Pension Credit even though they may have modest savings, or a retirement income or own their own home</li>
  <li>an award of Pension Credit can provide access to a range of other benefits such as help with housing costs, council tax, heating bills and for those aged 75 or over, a free TV licence</li>
</ul>

<p>If you work with people over State Pension age, or with those supporting them, or know anyone who might be eligible, then please encourage them to find out more.</p>

<h3>Use the power of friends and family</h3>

<p>We know that a nudge from a loved one can be a powerful motivator. If you are talking directly to friends and family of people over State Pension age, encourage them to talk about Pension Credit and the other benefits that come with claiming it with people they think may be eligible. This can help to open up important conversations that could make a real difference to the lives of their loved ones.</p>

<h3>Videos you can use to promote Pension Credit</h3>

<p>Please feel free to share the YouTube video on your website or social media.</p>

<h2>Know your audience</h2>

<p>We estimate that up to 1 million pensioner households may be entitled to Pension Credit, but do not claim it.</p>

<p>Some pensioners think because they’ve got savings or own their home they would not get any Pension Credit. Reaching these people is not always easy, but they may be more open to listening to people they trust. This might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>health visitors</li>
  <li>home help</li>
  <li>day care centre staff</li>
  <li>welfare advisers</li>
  <li>their General Practitioner (<abbr title="General Practitioner">GP</abbr>) and staff at the surgery</li>
  <li>the local pharmacist who prepares their prescriptions</li>
  <li>people at the Post Office where they collect their pension</li>
  <li>local councils</li>
  <li>friends and family</li>
</ul>

<h2>Life events</h2>

<p>Many pensioners claim Pension Credit when there is a change in their lives. So talking to them when these changes happen is a good idea.</p>

<h3>Life event triggers</h3>

<p>Many people claim when a life event makes them stop and think about their finances. These can be things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>changes in health</li>
  <li>bereavement</li>
  <li>birth of grandchildren</li>
  <li>divorce</li>
  <li>marriage</li>
  <li>depleted savings</li>
  <li>illness or disability</li>
</ul>

<p>Often, people have applied for Pension Credit in the past and have been told at the time that they were not eligible. But a change in their circumstances could make them ‘suddenly’ eligible.</p>

<p>When you’re talking to your customers, we suggest you might listen out for the changes that could mean they are now entitled to Pension Credit.</p>

<p>People are more likely to be susceptible to messages at different life-cycle points. Older pensioners who may have been ineligible (or just thought they were ineligible) in the past can become ‘suddenly eligible’ following important life changes. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>depletion of savings</li>
  <li>death of a partner</li>
  <li>leaving employment</li>
  <li>increasing ill-health</li>
  <li>becoming a carer</li>
  <li>developing a disability</li>
  <li>taking responsibility for a child</li>
</ul>

<p>They may become receptive to messages about improving their finances at these times.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/pension-credit-calculator">Pension Credit calculator</a> can be useful in finding out how much Pension Credit someone may be entitled to – without giving any personal details.</p>

<h2>Barriers to claiming Pension Credit</h2>

<p>There are a number of barriers that stop pensioners claiming Pension Credit. They may wrongly think they are not  eligible because they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have savings</li>
  <li>own their own home</li>
  <li>may be working</li>
  <li>may be getting a small occupational pension</li>
  <li>may have been turned down in the past</li>
</ul>

<p>Other factors may be that they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do not want to be seen as needing to claim</li>
  <li>feel that they’re able to manage</li>
  <li>do not think it’s worth applying (as the amount they get will be very small)</li>
  <li>do not recognise themselves as a Pension Credit claimant</li>
  <li>have not got around to it</li>
  <li>think it’s a complex and confusing subject</li>
  <li>already get other help and do not want to mess up the benefits they are getting</li>
</ul>

<h2>Talking to pensioners about Pension Credit</h2>

<p>Having listed above some of the main reasons pensioners may be put off from claiming Pension Credit, it may be helpful to try ‘myth busting’ some of the misconceptions people may have end encourage them to think again.</p>

<h3>They do not think they’ll be eligible for Pension Credit</h3>

<p>False – Do not rule anyone out. Around 1.5 million pensioners across the UK receive it.</p>

<h3>They’d get so little, it’s not worth claiming</h3>

<p>False – The average Pension Credit payment is actually over £65 per week – that’s well over an extra £3,000 per year. Plus, getting Pension Credit can provide a passport to help with things like rent, council tax, Cold Weather Payments and a free TV licence for people aged 75 and over.</p>

<h3>They have savings, so will not get anything</h3>

<p>False – People can have savings or another pension and still get extra money. Unlike other income related benefits like Universal Credit, there is no capital cut-off limit and for Pension Credit savings of under £10,000 are ignored.</p>

<h3>They own their own home, so they’ll not get anything</h3>

<p>False – Homeowners can get Pension Credit too. In fact, almost half of the people who get Pension Credit own their own home.</p>

<h3>They’re not eligible for Pension Credit – it’s for ‘old’ people</h3>

<p>False – People can claim as soon as they reach the qualifying age, which is now State Pension age.</p>

<h3>They cannot get a State Pension, so they’ll not be eligible</h3>

<p>False – They may be entitled to Pension Credit – even if they’re not entitled to a State Pension.</p>

<h3>They’ve been turned down for Pension Credit before, so it’s not worth applying again</h3>

<p>False – Personal circumstances could have changed and their income or capital may have changed as a result. The first £10,000 of savings will be ignored when working out if someone can get Pension Credit.</p>

<h3>It’s too complicated and claiming’s not worth the effort</h3>

<p>False – they can claim with one simple free phone call Even if someone only gets a small amount of Pension Credit, it can open the door to receiving other benefits and services like Cold Weather Payments and free dental treatment.</p>

<p>However, if they wish, people can fill out a paper claim form, which can now be downloaded from the GOV.UK website or an online claim can be made.</p>

<p>The Pension Service will also help them to claim other benefits (like Housing Benefit, which can help with paying rent) if they’re entitled to those as well.</p>

<p>However, they’ll need to contact their local council direct if they wish to apply for a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-council-tax-reduction">reduction in their Council Tax</a>.</p>

<h3>Other suggestions</h3>

<h4>Do not assume they’re not entitled</h4>

<p>Get them to check with a benefits adviser or an online benefits calculator.</p>

<p>Use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/pension-credit-calculator">Pension Credit calculator</a> to find out how much Pension Credit someone may be entitled to – without giving any personal details.</p>

<p>Or contact:</p>

</div>

<h4>They can manage</h4>

<p>Pensioners are often very proud and do not want to talk about benefits. It can help to point out that around 1.5 million pensioners get Pension Credit. If they’re entitled to it, why not claim it?</p>

<h4>Do not let them be put off</h4>

<p>Claiming benefits does not have to be complicated. Use the GOV.UK information to guide them through the process. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/pension-credit">Pension Credit claimant guide</a> contains basic information about Pension Credit and how to claim.</p>

<h4>Suggest they visit a registered advice provider</h4>

<p>People can find a trained benefits adviser. Visit:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/" rel="external">Citizens Advice</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ageuk.org.uk/" rel="external">Age UK</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Advice at home</h4>

<p>For very vulnerable claimants, The Pension Service’s home-visiting service will calculate the types of benefits they are entitled to, making it easier for them to understand which benefits they can claim.</p>

<h4>Appeals and tribunals</h4>

<p>Suggest that claimants ask their adviser if their organisation can help them with an appeal if their claim has been turned down.</p>

<h4>Do not forget the extras</h4>

<p>Make sure the claimant is getting their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/winter-fuel-payment">Winter Fuel Payment</a> and free bus passes, eye tests and gas safety inspections.</p>

<h4>Money management</h4>

<p>For hints and tips on budgeting, direct the claimant or their friends and family to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ageuk.org.uk/information-advice/money-legal/" rel="external">Age UK’s money advice</a> or contact:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Step Change Debt Charity on 0800 138 1111</li>
  <li>National Debtline on 0808 808 4000</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/" rel="external">Citizens Advice</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Claimants can get advice from their bank or Post Office if they have problems with chip and PIN.</p>

<h2>More information about Pension Credit</h2>

<h3>A quick guide to Pension Credit facts</h3>

<p>Around a third of those eligible for Pension Credit are not claiming it and could be missing out on extra money each week.</p>

<p>The average weekly amount of Pension Credit is over £65.</p>

<p>A change in circumstances can make someone newly eligible for Pension Credit (for example, bereavement, a change in health or disability). So even if they’ve applied before and did not get it, it may be worth another look.</p>

<p>Many people mistakenly believe they cannot get Pension Credit just because they do not know the real facts.</p>

<p>Qualifying for Pension Credit can mean help with other things like <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-council-tax-reduction">reduction in the amount of Council Tax they need to pay</a>.</p>

<p>If people have reached State Pension age, it means they’ll get topped up to a minimum income of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£182.60 a week if they are single</li>
  <li>£278.70 a week if they are a couple</li>
</ul>

<p>If they’re over 65 and reached their State Pension Age before 6 April 2016, they could still qualify for Pension Credit if their weekly income is below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£218.80 if they are single</li>
  <li>£319.20 if they are a couple</li>
</ul>

<p>People do not have to pay tax on any Pension Credit payments they may get.</p>

<p>Pension Credit can be backdated for a maximum period of 3 months.</p>

<p>Pensioners can get Pension Credit even if they have savings. The first £10,000 of savings is ignored – so if someone has been previously turned down because of the amount of their savings, it’s worth another check.</p>

<h3>Finding and using information about Pension Credit</h3>

<h3>The information people need when they apply for Pension Credit</h3>

<p>When someone makes a claim for Pension Credit, they’ll need the following information about the person making the claim:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their date of birth</li>
  <li>their National Insurance number – found on payslips, tax papers and letters from the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>how much money they have coming in each week – for example, this could be details of any pension they get from a former employer or a personal pension plan, and how often it’s  paid</li>
  <li>details of any savings and investments – The Pension Service will ask for the current balance in any bank and savings accounts and details of any investments, such as shares, premium bonds or unit trust certificates</li>
