<p>If someone has a disability and applies for Pension Credit, they may be entitled to extra money and may need to know who to contact.</p>

<h2>Disability benefits</h2>

<p>If someone has a disability they might be eligible for help through one of the 4 main benefits for disabled people:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Disability Living Allowance</li>
  <li>Personal Independence Payment</li>
  <li>Attendance Allowance</li>
  <li>Armed Forces Independence Payment</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disability Living Allowance (<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>)</h2>

<p><abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> is being replaced by Personal Independence Payment (<abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>) for disabled people.</p>

<p>Someone can only make a new <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> claim if they are under 16.</p>

<p>An adult might be getting <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> if they were under 65 when they claimed.</p>

<p>There are 2 components to <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the care component</li>
  <li>the mobility component</li>
</ul>

<p>The care component of <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> is paid at 3 different weekly rates, depending on how the disability affects someone:</p>

<ul>
  <li>higher rate £92.40</li>
  <li>middle rate  £61.85</li>
  <li>lowest rate  £24.45</li>
</ul>

<p>The mobility component of <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> is paid at 2 different weekly rates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>higher rate £64.50</li>
  <li>lower rate £24.45</li>
</ul>

<p>These can be paid at different rates depending on the level of needs someone has and can continue to be paid after the age of 65 if the entitlement conditions continue to be satisfied.</p>

<p><abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> is tax free. It is not means-tested and getting it will not reduce entitlement to Pension Credit.</p>

<p>Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/dla-disability-living-allowance-benefit"><abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> for adults</a>.</p>

<h2>Personal Independence Payment (<abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>)</h2>

<p><abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> is for people who are aged 16 or over and have not reached <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-age">State Pension age</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> is usually paid every 4 weeks and can be paid if you’re in or out of work. It is made up of 2 components (parts). Whether you get one or both of these depends on how your condition affects you.</p>

<p>Daily living component weekly rate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>standard – £61.85</li>
  <li>enhanced – £92.40</li>
</ul>

<p>Mobility component weekly rate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>standard – £24.45</li>
  <li>enhanced – £64.50</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> is tax free and is not treated as income when Pension Credit is worked out.</p>

<p><abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> was introduced for new claims in parts of the north of England from 8 April 2013, and nationwide from June 2013. Existing <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> claimants who were aged 16 to 64 on 8 April 2013, or reach age 16 after that date, are gradually being invited to claim <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>. If you’re already receiving <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>, you can find more through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/disability-living-allowance-is-ending-leaflet">‘<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> is ending’ leaflet</a>.</p>

<p>Read about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/pip"><abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2>Attendance Allowance</h2>

<p>If someone is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-age">State Pension age</a> or over, and not getting <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> or <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>, they may be entitled to Attendance Allowance if they have needs in relation to personal care or require supervision to stay safe. There is no mobility component to Attendance Allowance.</p>

<p>Attendance Allowance is paid at 2 different weekly rates, depending on how the disability affects someone:</p>

<ul>
  <li>higher rate £92.40</li>
  <li>lower rate £61.85</li>
</ul>

<p>Attendance Allowance is tax-free. It is not means-tested and getting it will not reduce entitlement to Pension Credit.</p>

<p>Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/attendance-allowance">Attendance Allowance</a>.</p>

<h2>Armed Forces Independence Payment (<abbr title="Armed Forces Independence Payment">AFIP</abbr>)</h2>

<p><abbr title="Armed Forces Independence Payment">AFIP</abbr> provides financial support to service personnel and veterans seriously injured as a result of service to cover the extra costs they may have as a result of their injury. Individuals awarded a Guaranteed Income Payment of 50% or higher under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme will be eligible.</p>

<p>Those eligible will receive a flat rate equivalent to the enhanced rates of both components (mobility and daily living) of <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Armed Forces Independence Payment">AFIP</abbr> weekly rate is £156.90.</p>

<p><abbr title="Armed Forces Independence Payment">AFIP</abbr> is not treated as income when Pension Credit is worked out.</p>

<p>Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-for-injury-received-while-serving/armed-forces-independence-payment-afip"><abbr title="Armed Forces Independence Payment">AFIP</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2>Extra Pension Credit for severely disabled people or carers</h2>

<p>If someone gets Attendance Allowance or the middle or highest rate care component of <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>, <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> or <abbr title="Armed Forces Independence Payment">AFIP</abbr>, they may be entitled to extra Pension Credit of £69.40.</p>

<p>If someone gets Carer’s Allowance they may be entitled to extra Pension Credit of £38.85. They may also get this extra Pension Credit if they are entitled to Carer’s Allowance but they are not being paid it, or being paid it at a lower amount than normal, because they are being paid a higher amount by another, income-maintenance benefit such as State Pension (this is called underlying entitlement).</p>

<p>Read about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/carers-allowance">Carer’s Allowance</a>.</p>

<h2>Care homes and paying for care</h2>

<p>People who have reached the minimum Pension Credit age while living permanently in care homes may be entitled to Pension Credit.</p>

<p>People should contact their local council if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wish to enter a care home, and</li>
  <li>need financial support</li>
</ul>

<p>The local council should assess their need for care and should carry out a means test. If appropriate, they should be encouraged to claim any benefits they are entitled to including Pension Credit.</p>

<h2>Going into hospital</h2>

<p>If someone is getting the severe disability extra amount as part of their Pension Credit, this will normally stop if they spend more than 28 days in hospital. This is the same as when their Attendance Allowance, <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>, or <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> stops.</p>

<p>The carer extra amount may also stop but otherwise their Pension Credit will keep going all the time they are in hospital.</p>

<h2>Housing Benefit</h2>

<p>Housing Benefit can help pay the rent for people on a low income or claiming benefits. It can help with all or some of the rent. There’s no set amount of Housing Benefit and what somebody will get depends on whether a person rents privately or from a council. A person must be State Pension age to claim it.
