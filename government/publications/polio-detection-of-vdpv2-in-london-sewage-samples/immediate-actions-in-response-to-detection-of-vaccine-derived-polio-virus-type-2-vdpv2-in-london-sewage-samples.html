<p>Immediate actions for the NHS:</p>

<h2>A. Polio clinical and laboratory surveillance</h2>

<p>Health professionals are strongly encouraged to fully investigate and report any suspected cases of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/acute-flaccid-paralysis-syndrome">acute flaccid paralysis / acute flaccid myelitis (AFP/AFM)</a> not explained by a non-infectious cause, as part of national surveillance for polio.</p>

<p>Case definition: acute flaccid paralysis/myelitis is characterised by rapid onset of weakness of an individual’s extremities, often including weakness of the muscles of respiration and swallowing, progressing to maximum severity within 10 days. The term ‘flaccid’ indicates weakness accompanied by hyporeflexia or areflexia in the affected limb(s).</p>

<p>Any patient meeting the above case definition, should:</p>

<p>i. be reported by calling the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) national duty doctor line (020 8200 4400) between 9am and 5.30pm 7 days a week</p>

<p>ii. have the following samples collected and sent to the <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> Virus Reference Department for poliovirus 
isolation and further characterisation:</p>

<p>a. 2 stool samples 48 hours apart</p>

<p>b. throat swabs / nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) and</p>

<p>c. cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (if collected)</p>

<p>iii. have an enhanced surveillance questionnaire completed by their responsible clinician</p>

<p>In addition, stool samples are encouraged for all acute neurological illness presentations including meningitis – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/polio-national-guidelines">national polio guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Local and regional laboratories should refer all local enterovirus positive samples to the Enteric Virus Unit (EVU).</p>

<h2>B. Polio vaccination check and offer</h2>

<p>Primary care colleagues and school aged immunisation providers should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>opportunistically check that patients are up to date with their polio-containing vaccines and catch-up anyone who is un/under vaccinated. This is particularly important in practices where vaccine coverage for the primary DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB course is below 85%</li>
  <li>check immunisation status of newly registered children and adults with a particular emphasis on new migrants, asylum seekers and refugees – <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vaccination-of-individuals-with-uncertain-or-incomplete-immunisation-status">bring them up to date with the UK schedule at the earliest opportunity</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background and interpretation</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> Global Specialised Polio Laboratory located at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (<abbr title="National Institute for Biological Standards and Control">NIBSC</abbr>) conducts routine environmental surveillance for wild type and vaccine-like polio viruses as part of the UK’s commitment to the <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> global polio eradication programme.</p>

<p>Vaccine-like type 2 poliovirus (PV2) isolates have been found in multiple sewage samples collected from the London Beckton Sewage Treatment Works between February and June 2022. This sewage treatment plant covers a large catchment area across North and East London and a population close to 4 million.</p>

<p>During this period, there has been some virus evolution. The virus isolated in the most recent samples contained 6 and 7 VP1 nucleotide changes from the Sabin 2 vaccine strain respectively and therefore is now classified as a vaccine-derived poliovirus (<abbr title="vaccine derived polio virus type 2">VDPV2</abbr>).</p>

<p>An average of 1 to 3 poliovirus isolates per year have been detected from UK sewage samples in recent years. However, these have all been single detections which are unrelated to each other. In this instance, the isolates identified between February and June 2022 are genetically related. This has prompted the need to investigate the extent of transmission of this virus in Northeast London.</p>

<p>The most likely scenario is that a recently vaccinated individual entered the UK before February 2022 from a country where oral polio vaccine (<abbr title="oral polio vaccine">OPV</abbr>) has been used for supplementary immunisation campaigns. While the UK stopped using <abbr title="oral polio vaccine">OPV</abbr> in 2004, several countries, including Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria have continued to use <abbr title="oral polio vaccine">OPV</abbr> containing type 2 virus for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://polioeradication.org/news-post/pakistan-polio-snapshot-april-2021/" rel="external">outbreak control.</a></p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/polio-national-guidelines">National Polio Guidelines</a> outline public health actions for consideration when one or more vaccine-related poliovirus type 2 [Level 2 (C)] are detected in environmental samples. A national standard incident has been declared by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and an Incident Management Team established.</p>

<p>The environmental surveillance is being enhanced in an attempt to assess the extent of <abbr title="vaccine derived polio virus type 2">VDPV2</abbr> transmission and identify areas for targeted action.</p>

<h2>Polio immunisation coverage</h2>

<p>The UK is committed to global polio eradication and key to achieving this is maintaining high vaccine coverage (&gt;= 95%) in the routine childhood immunisation programme. It is essential to maintain high uptake at the national, regional and local levels in order to reduce the risk of importations (including of vaccine-like poliovirus) leading to transmission in under-vaccinated communities and paralytic presentations occurring. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> will be working with local partners to develop plans for targeted IPV catch-up, starting in London.</p>
