<p>Make sure you are familiar with and understand the steps required to keep you and others safe:</p>

<h4>Hand hygiene</h4>

<p>Clean your hands thoroughly with soap and water or hand sanitiser after close contact with others and after touching any surfaces in the area you are working in.</p>

<h4><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr></h4>

<p>Where it is not possible to limit close contact and you are required to deliver hands on care, the following <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is recommended:</p>

<ul>
  <li>disposable gloves and a disposable plastic apron</li>
  <li>a fluid resistant surgical face mask (<abbr title="fluid resistant surgical face mask">FRSM</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>If a risk assessment indicates the likelihood of contamination by splashes, droplets of blood or body fluids, use disposable eye protection (such as a face visor or goggles).</p>

<p>Clean your hands thoroughly with soap and water or sanitiser before putting on and after taking off <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<p>The safe removal of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is a critical consideration to avoid self-contamination. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-use-for-non-aerosol-generating-procedures">Guidance on correct use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is available</a>. Use and dispose of all <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> according to the instructions and training provided by your employer or organisation.</p>

<h3>Providing assistance to someone who is unwell</h3>

<p>If you need to provide assistance to someone who is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-interim-guidance-for-first-responders/interim-guidance-for-first-responders-and-others-in-close-contact-with-symptomatic-people-with-potential-2019-ncov#symptoms">unwell</a>, if possible move the person to somewhere away from others. If this is not possible, ask others who are not involved in providing assistance to stay at least 2 metres away.</p>

<h3>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation</h3>

<p>If you are required to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (<abbr title="cardiopulmonary resuscitation">CPR</abbr>), you should conduct a risk assessment (in the police service this would be a dynamic risk assessment) to assess appropriate infection control precautions.</p>

<p>In adults, it is recommended that you do not perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation – perform chest compressions only. Compression-only <abbr title="cardiopulmonary resuscitation">CPR</abbr> may be as effective as combined ventilation and compression in the first few minutes where cardiac arrest has not occurred due to lack of oxygen (asphyxial arrest).</p>

<p>In children, cardiac arrest is more likely to be caused by a respiratory problem or lack of oxygen. Therefore, chest compressions alone are unlikely to be effective. If a decision is made to perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation, use a resuscitation face shield, if one is available.</p>

<p>If you perform mouth to mouth ventilation on someone with <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> you should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person" class="govuk-link">guidance for non-household contacts</a>.</p>

<p>If you perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation on someone who does not have <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr>, no additional actions need to be taken other than monitoring yourself for symptoms of <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> over the following 14 days. However, if they are subsequently diagnosed with <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> you may be contacted by NHS Test and Trace and asked to self-isolate.</p>

<p>If you develop symptoms of <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr>, however mild, you should arrange to have a PCR test, inform your employer and follow the  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Cleaning the area where assistance was provided</h3>

<p>Cleaning will depend on where assistance was provided. Follow the advice for cleaning in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings" class="govuk-link">non-healthcare settings</a>.</p>

<h4>If there has been a blood or body-fluid spill</h4>

<p>Keep people away from the area. Use a spill-kit if available, using the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in the kit or <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> provided by your employer or organisation and following the instructions provided with the spill-kit. If no spill-kit is available, place paper towels or roll onto the spill, and if you are not part of the emergency services, seek advice from them when they arrive.</p>

<h2>Handling the deceased</h2>

<p>If a person has died at home and <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> is suspected or confirmed, follow the advice set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-care-of-the-deceased">guidance for care of the deceased</a>.</p>

<h2>Additional advice</h2>

<h3>If emergency service responders are identified as a contact of a case of <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Emergency service responders who are identified as a contact of a case of <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> are exempt from self-isolation if they are fully vaccinated. They should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person">guidance for contacts of <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr></a> who are not legally required to self-isolate.</p>

<p>Additional requirements for returning to work are in place if the responder is a health or social care staff member. Refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings">management of staff and exposed patients and residents in health and social care settings guidance</a> for more information.</p>

<p>While providing frontline duties that involve contact with someone with <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr>, responders will only be exempt from being considered a close-contact for the purposes of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works" class="govuk-link">contact tracing and isolation</a> if clinical grade <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> has been worn appropriately, and if they have received and followed appropriate training in IPC. This applies regardless of the vaccination status of the staff member or the circulating variant of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<p>If there has been a breach in <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> or if the emergency service responder has had contact with someone with <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> (including in work settings such as staff rooms, canteens, offices and service vehicles), they will be considered a close contact for the purposes of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works">contact tracing and isolation</a> and should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings" class="govuk-link">guidance for management of staff and exposed patients and residents in health and social care settings guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Advice for police officers, staff and volunteers</h3>

<p>Police officers, staff and volunteers should not be performing clinical assessments. If you are concerned that someone you are managing needs medical assistance, call NHS 111 (or 999 if it is a medical emergency).</p>

<p>Where appropriate, in an operational setting, you should conduct a risk assessment and adopt appropriate precautions for infection control. In the police, this would be a dynamic risk assessment using the National Decision Making model.</p>

<p>For situations where close contact (less than 2 metres) with a person is unavoidable to fulfil the required duty (for example, when entering a household, carrying out an essential interview or arrest and restraint), the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-interim-guidance-for-first-responders/interim-guidance-for-first-responders-and-others-in-close-contact-with-symptomatic-people-with-potential-2019-ncov#PPE" class="govuk-link">use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr></a> as detailed above is recommended. The appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for a specific situation needs to be assessed on a case by case basis.</p>

<h2>Associated legislation</h2>

<p>Please note that this guidance is of a general nature. Employers should consider the specific conditions of each individual place of work and comply with all applicable legislation, including the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/37/contents" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974</a>.</p>
