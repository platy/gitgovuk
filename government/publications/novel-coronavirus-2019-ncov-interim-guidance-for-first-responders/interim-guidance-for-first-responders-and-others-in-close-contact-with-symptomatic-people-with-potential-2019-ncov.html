<h2>Who this guidance is for</h2>

<p>This guidance is for fire and rescue services, police services, ambulance services, individuals and members of voluntary organisations who, as part of their normal roles, may provide immediate assistance to individuals with potential coronavirus (<abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr>) infection. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-ambulance-trusts">More detailed guidance is available for NHS ambulance trust employees</a>.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The most important <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-initial-investigation-of-possible-cases">symptoms of <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr></a> are recent onset of any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new continuous cough</li>
  <li>a high temperature</li>
  <li>a loss of, or change in, the normal sense of smell (anosmia)</li>
</ul>

<p>For most people, <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> will be a mild illness, but in some people the illness may progress to severe pneumonia, causing shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. There are many other symptoms linked with <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr>.</p>

<h2>What is meant by a contact</h2>

<p>In this guidance, a contact is a person who has been close to someone who has tested positive for <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr>. A risk assessment may be undertaken to determine this, but a contact can be a person who has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>had face-to-face contact with someone less than a metre away</li>
  <li>been within one metre for one minute or longer without face-to-face contact</li>
  <li>been within 2 metres of someone for more than 15 minutes (either as a one-off contact, or added up together over one day)</li>
</ul>

<p>The contact can be any time from 2 days before the person who tested positive developed their symptoms (or, if they did not have any symptoms, from 2 days before their positive test was taken), and up to 10 days after.</p>

<h2>What to do if you are required to come into close contact with someone as part of your first responder duties</h2>

<h3>Reduce transmission risk</h3>

<p>Make sure you are familiar with and understand the steps required to keep you and others safe:</p>

<h4>Hand hygiene</h4>

<p>Clean your hands thoroughly with soap and water or hand sanitiser after close contact with others and after touching any surfaces in the area you are working in.</p>

<h4><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr></h4>

<p>Where it is not possible to limit close contact and you are required to deliver hands on care, the following <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is recommended:</p>

<ul>
  <li>disposable gloves and a disposable plastic apron</li>
  <li>a fluid resistant surgical face mask (<abbr title="fluid resistant surgical face mask">FRSM</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>If a risk assessment indicates the likelihood of contamination by splashes, droplets of blood or body fluids, use disposable eye protection (such as a face visor or goggles).</p>

<p>Clean your hands thoroughly with soap and water or sanitiser before putting on and after taking off <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<p>The safe removal of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is a critical consideration to avoid self-contamination. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-use-for-non-aerosol-generating-procedures" class="govuk-link">Guidance on correct use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is available</a>. Use and dispose of all <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> according to the instructions and training provided by your employer or organisation.</p>

<h3>Providing assistance to someone who is unwell</h3>

<p>If you need to provide assistance to someone who is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-interim-guidance-for-first-responders/interim-guidance-for-first-responders-and-others-in-close-contact-with-symptomatic-people-with-potential-2019-ncov#symptoms" class="govuk-link">unwell</a>, if possible move the person to somewhere away from others. If this is not possible, ask others who are not involved in providing assistance to stay at least 2 metres away.</p>

<h3>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation</h3>

<p>If you are required to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (<abbr title="cardiopulmonary resuscitation">CPR</abbr>), you should conduct a risk assessment (in the police service this would be a dynamic risk assessment) to assess appropriate infection control precautions.</p>

<p>In adults, it is recommended that you do not perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation – perform chest compressions only. Compression-only <abbr title="cardiopulmonary resuscitation">CPR</abbr> may be as effective as combined ventilation and compression in the first few minutes where cardiac arrest has not occurred due to lack of oxygen (asphyxial arrest).</p>

<p>In children, cardiac arrest is more likely to be caused by a respiratory problem or lack of oxygen. Therefore, chest compressions alone are unlikely to be effective. If a decision is made to perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation, use a resuscitation face shield, if one is available.</p>

<p>If you perform mouth to mouth ventilation on someone with <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> you should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person">guidance for non-household contacts</a>.</p>

<p>If you perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation on someone who does not have <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr>, no additional actions need to be taken other than monitoring yourself for symptoms of <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> over the following 14 days. However, if they are subsequently diagnosed with <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> you may be contacted by NHS Test and Trace and asked to self-isolate.</p>

<p>If you develop symptoms of <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr>, however mild, you should arrange to have a PCR test, inform your employer and follow the  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Cleaning the area where assistance was provided</h3>

<p>Cleaning will depend on where assistance was provided. Follow the advice for cleaning in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">non-healthcare settings</a>.</p>

<h4>If there has been a blood or body-fluid spill</h4>

<p>Keep people away from the area. Use a spill-kit if available, using the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in the kit or <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> provided by your employer or organisation and following the instructions provided with the spill-kit. If no spill-kit is available, place paper towels or roll onto the spill, and if you are not part of the emergency services, seek advice from them when they arrive.</p>

<h2>Handling the deceased</h2>

<p>If a person has died at home and <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> is suspected or confirmed, follow the advice set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-care-of-the-deceased">guidance for care of the deceased</a>.</p>

<h2>Additional advice</h2>

<h3>If emergency service responders are identified as a contact of a case of <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Emergency service responders who are identified as a contact of a case of <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> are exempt from self-isolation if they are fully vaccinated. This does not apply if they are identified as a close contact of a suspected or confirmed case of infection with the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. In this situation staff members are required to take a PCR test and self-isolate for the full 10 days. They must follow this advice even if they are within 90 days of a previous positive PCR test result.</p>

<p>Additional requirements for returning to work are in place if the responder is a health or social care staff member. Refer to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings" class="govuk-link">management of staff and exposed patients and residents in health and social care settings guidance</a> for more information.</p>

<p>While providing frontline duties that involve contact with someone with <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr>, responders will only be exempt from being considered a close-contact for the purposes of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works">contact tracing and isolation</a> if clinical grade <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> has been worn appropriately, and if they have received and followed appropriate training in IPC. This applies regardless of the vaccination status of the staff member or the circulating variant of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<p>If there has been a breach in <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> or if the emergency service responder has had contact with someone with <abbr title="novel coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> (including in work settings such as staff rooms, canteens, offices and service vehicles), they will be considered a close contact for the purposes of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works">contact tracing and isolation</a> and should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings">guidance for management of staff and exposed patients and residents in health and social care settings guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Advice for police officers, staff and volunteers</h3>

<p>Police officers, staff and volunteers should not be performing clinical assessments. If you are concerned that someone you are managing needs medical assistance, call NHS 111 (or 999 if it is a medical emergency).</p>

<p>Where appropriate, in an operational setting, you should conduct a risk assessment and adopt appropriate precautions for infection control. In the police, this would be a dynamic risk assessment using the National Decision Making model.</p>

<p>For situations where close contact (less than 2 metres) with a person is unavoidable to fulfil the required duty (for example, when entering a household, carrying out an essential interview or arrest and restraint), the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-interim-guidance-for-first-responders/interim-guidance-for-first-responders-and-others-in-close-contact-with-symptomatic-people-with-potential-2019-ncov#PPE" class="govuk-link">use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr></a> as detailed above is recommended. The appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for a specific situation needs to be assessed on a case by case basis.</p>

<h2>Associated legislation</h2>

<p>Please note that this guidance is of a general nature. Employers should consider the specific conditions of each individual place of work and comply with all applicable legislation, including the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/37/contents">Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974</a>.</p>
