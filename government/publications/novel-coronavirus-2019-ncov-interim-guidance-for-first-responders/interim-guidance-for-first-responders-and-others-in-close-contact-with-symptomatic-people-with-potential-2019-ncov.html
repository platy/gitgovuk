<h2>Who this guidance is for</h2>

<p>This guidance is for fire and rescue services, police services, ambulance services, individuals and members of voluntary organisations who, as part of their normal roles, may provide immediate assistance to individuals with potential coronavirus (COVID-19) infection.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The most important symptoms of COVID-19 are recent onset of any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new continuous cough</li>
  <li>a high temperature</li>
  <li>a loss of, or change in, the normal sense of smell (anosmia)</li>
</ul>

<p>Other symptoms linked with COVID-19 include shortness of breath, fatigue, loss of appetite, muscle ache, sore throat, headache, stuffy or runny nose, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. Any of these symptoms may also have another cause.</p>

<p>Most children and young people with COVID-19 experience a mild illness or do not have any symptoms at all. Children who have symptoms of COVID-19 are more likely to pass the virus onto others than those who do not.</p>

<p>Make sure you are familiar with and understand the steps required to keep you and others safe:</p>

<h4>Hand hygiene</h4>

<p>Clean your hands thoroughly with soap and water or hand sanitiser after close contact with others and after touching any surfaces in the area you are working in.</p>

<h4>Personal protection equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>)</h4>

<p>Where it is not possible to limit close contact and you are required to deliver hands on care, the following <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is recommended:</p>

<ul>
  <li>disposable gloves</li>
  <li>disposable plastic apron</li>
  <li>fluid resistant surgical face mask (<abbr title="fluid resistant surgical face mask">FRSM</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>If a risk assessment indicates the likelihood of contamination by splashes, droplets of blood or body fluids, use disposable eye protection (such as a face visor or goggles).</p>

<p>Clean your hands thoroughly with soap and water or sanitiser before putting on and after taking off <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<p>The safe removal of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is a critical consideration to avoid self-contamination. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-use-for-non-aerosol-generating-procedures">Guidance on correct use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is available</a>. Use and dispose of all <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> according to the instructions and training provided by your employer or organisation.</p>

<h3>Providing assistance to someone who is unwell</h3>

<p>If you need to provide assistance to someone who is <a class="govuk-link" href="#symptoms">unwell</a>, if possible move the person to somewhere away from others. If this is not possible, ask others who are not involved in providing assistance to stay at least 2 metres away.</p>

<h3>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation</h3>

<p>If you are required to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (<abbr title="cardiopulmonary resuscitation">CPR</abbr>), you should conduct a risk assessment (in the police service this would be a dynamic risk assessment) to assess appropriate infection control precautions.</p>

<p>In adults, it is recommended that you do not perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation – perform chest compressions only. Compression-only <abbr title="cardiopulmonary resuscitation">CPR</abbr> may be as effective as combined ventilation and compression in the first few minutes where cardiac arrest has not occurred due to lack of oxygen (asphyxial arrest).</p>

<p>In children, cardiac arrest is more likely to be caused by a respiratory problem or lack of oxygen. Therefore, chest compressions alone are unlikely to be effective. If a decision is made to perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation, use a resuscitation face shield, if one is available.</p>

<p>If you perform mouth to mouth ventilation on someone with COVID-19 you should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-people-with-covid-19-and-their-contacts">guidance for people with COVID-19 and their contacts</a>.</p>

<p>If you perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation on someone who does not have COVID-19, no additional actions need to be taken other than monitoring yourself for symptoms of COVID-19 over the following 14 days.</p>

<p>If you develop symptoms of COVID-19, you should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">arrange to have a PCR test</a> and follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-people-with-covid-19-and-their-contacts">guidance for people with COVID-19 and their contacts</a>.</p>

<h3>Cleaning the area where assistance was provided</h3>

<p>Cleaning will depend on where assistance was provided. Follow the advice for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">cleaning in non-healthcare settings</a>.</p>

<h4>If there has been a blood or body-fluid spill</h4>

<p>Keep people away from the area. Use a spill-kit if available, using the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in the kit or <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> provided by your employer or organisation and following the instructions provided with the spill-kit. If no spill-kit is available, place paper towels or roll onto the spill, and if you are not part of the emergency services, seek advice from them when they arrive.</p>

<h2>Handling the deceased</h2>

<p>If a person has died at home and COVID-19 is suspected or confirmed, follow the advice set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-care-of-the-deceased">guidance for care of the deceased</a>.</p>

<h2>Additional advice</h2>

<p>Emergency service responders who are identified as a contact of a case of COVID-19 should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-people-with-covid-19-and-their-contacts">guidance for people with COVID-19 and their contacts</a>.</p>

<p>Where appropriate, in an operational setting, you should conduct a risk assessment and adopt appropriate precautions for infection control. In the police, this would be a dynamic risk assessment using the National Decision Making model.</p>
