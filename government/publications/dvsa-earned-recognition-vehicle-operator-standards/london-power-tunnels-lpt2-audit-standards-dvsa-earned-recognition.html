<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document details the standards of the <abbr title="London Power Tunnels">LPT2</abbr> module, the assessment and evidence required during an audit to attain additional module status.</p>

<p>It is a public document and allows both the operator and the auditor to identify the areas where standards are met and where shortcomings need to be addressed.</p>

<p>Each of the applicable standards must be attained in order to meet the overall criteria whereby the operator should be able to demonstrate full and effective control in all cases. It is not possible to be entirely prescriptive in all cases, as each operator must be considered individually.</p>

<p>It is the operator’s responsibility to demonstrate the systems they have in place satisfy the required standards.</p>

<p>Before completing an audit, reference must be made to section 3 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dvsa-earned-recognition-guide-to-the-scheme">earned recognition scheme guide</a> and the audit sampling criteria defined below.</p>

<h2>Important note</h2>

<p>Contracts for some AM02 – <abbr title="London Power Tunnels">LPT2</abbr> projects require additional audit requirements over and above the mandatory earned recognition standards. <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Authority">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition can be used to gain acceptance to <abbr title="London Power Tunnels">LPT2</abbr> contracts, but you must satisfy all the applicable standards in sections 1 to 9 of the heavy goods vehicle (<abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr>) or public service vehicle (<abbr title="public service vehicle">PSV</abbr>) earned recognition standards, only then you may additionally choose to meet the standards in this optional module (AM02 - <abbr title="London Power Tunnels">LPT2</abbr>).</p>

<p>It is important to note that this is an optional module to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Authority">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition accreditation, so it is acceptable for operators to choose to apply these additional requirements to an individual operator licence, which is part of the earned recognition accreditation. This would include all the associated operating centres and specified vehicles on the selected licences applying for this module, rather than all the entities and licences in the earned recognition accreditation.</p>

<p>Operators can therefore decide to adopt this for individual licences in the accreditation or for the entire <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Authority">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition application entity. The <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Authority">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition accreditation and published list will clearly identify the status of the operator licences that have achieved the <abbr title="London Power Tunnels">LPT2</abbr> module standards in addition to the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Authority">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition accreditation.</p>

<p>Operators who already have <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Authority">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition accreditation may apply for this module and have a separate additional audit for the associated licences. To keep accreditation for this module, the following periodic <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Authority">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition audit would need to include standards for this <abbr title="London Power Tunnels">LPT2</abbr> module for the selected licences.</p>

<p>This module will need to be audited annually.</p>

<p>Vehicles specified on operator licences with this module would need to include additional check items for the periodical safety inspections, which will be included as part of the maintenance system key performance indicator (<abbr title="key performance indicator">KPI</abbr>) report.</p>

<p>We advise operators to discuss any notifiable alterations to their <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Authority">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition accreditation with the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Authority">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition team, as it could be more cost effective to bring the periodic <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Authority">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition audit forward to combine with an application for this module.</p>

<p>Operators will need to inform the authorised audit provider of their intention to contract for <abbr title="London Power Tunnels">LPT2</abbr> and to ensure the appropriate audit sections are completed. Failure to do so may result in the operator being excluded from <abbr title="London Power Tunnels">LPT2</abbr> contracts.</p>

<p>Once the audit has been successfully completed, the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Authority">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition scheme manager will notify the applicant of the accreditation status of each licence in the application. The operator’s <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Authority">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition <abbr title="London Power Tunnels">LPT2</abbr> accreditation status will be published on GOV.UK and identifiable with a vehicle registration mark via the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Authority">DVSA</abbr> online search application.</p>

<h2>CS.1 Additional vehicle safety equipment requirements</h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>Operators shall ensure vehicles are fitted with the following safety equipment to help protect and warn vulnerable road users.</p>

<p>When carrying out safety inspections, operators must check that these requirements are met and include the result of the checks in maintenance <abbr title="key performance indicator">KPI</abbr> reports.</p>

<ul>
  <li>CS.1.1 - Vulnerable road user warning signage, hi-vis marking to the rear of the vehicle and a flashing beacon</li>
  <li>CS.1.2	 - Side under-run protection of both sides of the vehicle</li>
  <li>CS.1.3 - An audible left turn alert</li>
  <li>CS.1.4 - Blind spot elimination to the front, side and rear of the vehicle</li>
</ul>

<h3>Auditor guidance and links</h3>

<p>There should be written evidence from the scheme undertaker where vehicles are exempt from side underrun protection which is additional to <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1986/1078/introduction/made" rel="external">Road Vehicles (Construction &amp; Use) Regulations 1986</a> requirements.</p>

<p>The operator should take all practical steps to either eliminate or minimise blind spots around the vehicle using indirect vision aids and driver audible alerts. The operator should have systems in place to ensure all equipment fitted is maintained in working condition at all times, as far as reasonably practicable.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Stick on Fresnel lenses are not considered as suitable alternative.</p>
</div>

<p>Principal Contractors shall set out in relevant plans the extent that vehicles over 7.5t also regularly accessing <abbr title="London Power Tunnels">LPT2</abbr> sites will be fitted with cameras with digital recording equipment and how the contractor and its supply chain will adopt better vehicle design or technology as a part of its normal fleet renewal strategy.</p>

<h2>CS.2 Site rules</h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
