<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document details the standards of the scheme, the assessment and evidence required during an audit to attain scheme status.</p>

<p>It is a public document and allows both the operator and the auditor to identify the areas where standards are met and where shortcomings need to be addressed.</p>

<p>Each of the applicable standards must be attained in order to meet the overall criteria and the operator should be able to demonstrate full and effective control in all cases. It is not possible to be entirely prescriptive in all cases, as each operator must be considered individually.</p>

<p>It is up to the operator to demonstrate the systems they have in place satisfy the required standards.</p>

<p>Before completing an audit, reference must be made to section 3 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dvsa-earned-recognition-guide-to-the-scheme">earned recognition scheme guide</a> and the audit sampling criteria.</p>

<h2>Earned recognition audit sampling criteria</h2>

<p>Audit sampling needs to be based on the following areas of measurement and considerations.</p>

<p>Areas of measurement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vehicles</li>
  <li>drivers</li>
</ul>

<p>Operating centres considerations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>type of management system and span of control should be considered in relation to sampling size</li>
  <li>where different management systems are used sampling must cover all of these</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition may wish to direct the audit or stipulate measures</li>
  <li>audit and verification checks should only be carried out at operating centres that have an administrative or management function</li>
  <li>the auditor check should include a minimum of one month’s operator analysis and subsequent actions</li>
  <li>in addition to the audit at the main operating centre and where required any verification checks at other operating centres must be rotated at the periodic audit</li>
  <li>maintenance records should conform with the current <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-maintaining-roadworthiness"><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> guide to maintaining roadworthiness</a>
</li>
  <li>the sample must be representative of the fleet including all types of vehicles, trailers and age range</li>
  <li>audit checks must sample records across all types of maintenance providers (for example manufacturers, independents and in-house)</li>
  <li>sampling from each operator licence</li>
  <li>if an operator carries out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/driving-dangerous-goods-and-special-loads">dangerous goods activities (<abbr title="Accord European relatif au transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route">ADR</abbr>)</a>, then at least one <abbr title="Accord European relatif au transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route">ADR</abbr> centre will be part of the audit</li>
</ul>

<span class="number">1.2 </span> Appropriate licence</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>The operator must be able to effectively demonstrate the specifics of the operation, enough for the auditor to clearly identify the nature of the business and that licences held are appropriate for the transport operations undertaken.</p>

  <li>vehicles over 2500kg used on international journeys for the purpose of hire and reward must be specified on an operator licence</li>
</ul>

<h4>Auditor guidance and links</h4>

<ul>
  <li>the operator licence must be available for inspection by the auditor</li>
  <li>drivers’ hours records that tie in with haulage operations evidenced from invoices</li>

<p>A vehicle that has been logged as off the road and has missed a scheduled safety inspection should only be brought back into service after a safety inspection confirms that it is roadworthy. The date

<p>The health and safety policy must be in writing if the operator has 5 or more employees. The operator does not need to have the policy in writing they have fewer than 5 employees, although it must still be relayed to staff.</p>

<p>Fatigue refers to the issues that arise from excessive working time or poorly designed shift patterns. It is considered to be a decline in mental or physical performance that results from prolonged exertion, sleep loss or disruption of the internal clock. It is also related to workload.</p>
