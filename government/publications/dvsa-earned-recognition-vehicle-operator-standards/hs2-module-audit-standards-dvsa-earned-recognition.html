<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document details the standards of the scheme, the assessment and evidence required during an audit to attain additional module status.</p>

<p>It is a public document and allows both the operator and the auditor to identify the areas where standards are met and where shortcomings need to be addressed.</p>

<p>Each of the applicable standards must be attained in order to meet the overall criteria and the operator should be able to demonstrate full and effective control in all cases. It is not possible to be entirely prescriptive in all cases, as each operator must be considered individually.</p>

<p>It is up to the operator to demonstrate the systems they have in place satisfy the required standards.</p>

<p>Before completing an audit, reference must be made to section 3 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dvsa-earned-recognition-guide-to-the-scheme">earned recognition scheme guide</a> and the audit sampling criteria defined below.</p>

<h2>Important note</h2>

<p>Contracts for the High Speed 2 (<abbr title="High Speed 2">HS2</abbr>) project require additional audit requirements over and above the mandatory earned recognition standards. <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Authority">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition (<abbr title="earned recognition">ER</abbr>) can be used to gain acceptance to <abbr title="High Speed 2">HS2</abbr> contacts but you must satisfy all the applicable standards in sections 1 to 9 of the <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> or <abbr title="public service vehicle">PSV</abbr> earned recognition standards. Only then you may additionally choose to meet the standards in this optional module (AM01 - <abbr title="High Speed 2">HS2</abbr>).</p>

<p>As this is an optional module it is therefore acceptable for operators to choose to apply these additional requirements to an individual operator licence, which is part of the <abbr title="earned recognition">ER</abbr> accreditation. This would include all the associated operating centres and specified vehicles on the selected licences applying for this module, rather than all the entities and licences in the <abbr title="earned recognition">ER</abbr> accreditation.</p>

<p>Operators can therefore decide to adopt this module for individual licences in the accreditation or for the entire <abbr title="earned recognition">ER</abbr> application entity. The <abbr title="earned recognition">ER</abbr> accreditation and published list will clearly identify the status of the operator licences, which have achieved the <abbr title="High Speed 2">HS2</abbr> module standards in addition to the <abbr title="earned recognition">ER</abbr> accreditation.</p>

<p>Operators who already have <abbr title="earned recognition">ER</abbr> accreditation may apply for this module and have a separate additional audit for associated licences. To keep accreditation for this module, the following periodic <abbr title="earned recognition">ER</abbr> audit would need to include standards for this <abbr title="High Speed 2">HS2</abbr> module for the selected licences.</p>

<p>This module will need to be audited annually.</p>

<p>Vehicles specified on operator licences with this module would need to include additional check items for the periodical safety inspections, which will be included as part of the maintenance system key performance indicator (<abbr title="key performance indicator">KPI</abbr>) report.</p>

<p>We advise operators to discuss any notifiable alterations to their <abbr title="earned recognition">ER</abbr> accreditation with the <abbr title="earned recognition">ER</abbr> team, as it could be more cost effective to bring the periodic <abbr title="earned recognition">ER</abbr> audit forward to combine with an application for this module.</p>

<p>Operators will need to inform the authorised audit provider of their intention to contract for <abbr title="High Speed 2">HS2</abbr> and to ensure the appropriate audit sections are completed; failure to do so may result in the operator being excluded from <abbr title="High Speed 2">HS2</abbr> contracts.</p>

<p>Once the audit has been successfully completed, the <abbr title="earned recognition">ER</abbr> Scheme Manager will notify the applicant the accreditation status of each licence in the application. The operator’s <abbr title="earned recognition">ER</abbr> and <abbr title="High Speed 2">HS2</abbr> module accreditation status will be published on GOV.UK and identifiable with a vehicle registration mark via the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Authority">DVSA</abbr> online search application.</p>

<h2>Use a sign when you visit an <abbr title="High Speed 2">HS2</abbr> site</h2>

<p>You may need to display a sign in your vehicle’s windscreen when you visit an <abbr title="High Speed 2">HS2</abbr> site. Not all contracts will need you to do this, so you should ask your contract supplier if they want you to display a sign.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You must not display the sign in your vehicle when you are not at an HS2 site.</p>
</div>

<p>You can only use signs from a supplier approved by <abbr title="High Speed 2">HS2</abbr>. You can order signs from:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.daweshighway.com/dvsa-earned-recognition/" rel="external">Dawes Highway Safety <abbr title="High Speed 2">HS2</abbr> identifiers</a></li>
</ul>

<p>When you place the sign in your windscreen, the ‘<abbr title="High Speed 2">HS2</abbr>’ side of the sign should face outside and the ‘<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Authority">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition’ side should face the inside of the cab.</p>

<h2>HS.1 Additional vehicle safety equipment requirements</h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>Operators shall ensure vehicles are fitted with the following safety equipment to help protect and warn vulnerable road users.
When carrying out safety inspections, operators check that these requirements are met and include the result of the checks in maintenance <abbr title="key performance indicator">KPI</abbr> reports.</p>

<ul>
  <li>HS.1.1 - Back and side pictorial warning sticker</li>
  <li>HS.1.2 - Side under-run protection of both sides of the vehicle</li>
  <li>HS.1.3 - An audible left turn alert</li>
  <li>HS.1.4 - Blind spot elimination to the front, side and rear of the vehicle</li>
  <li>HS.1.5 - Digital recording of activities outside the vehicle, where specified by the employer for vehicles regularly being used on <abbr title="High Speed 2">HS2</abbr> project</li>
</ul>

<p>The operator must route vehicles in the most efficient way considering weight restrictions, low bridges and the environmental impact. Where possible routes should be planned that minimise the distance travelled, and fuel used.</p>

<p>Where specific routes are required for contracts, procedures must be in place to ensure those routes are adhered to.</p>

<h3>Auditor guidance and links</h3>

<ul>
  <li>the operator should always use the most efficient route to reach a destination, where satnav is used it should be a specialist system showing low bridges and weight restrictions</li>
  <li>certain projects may require lorry routes (such as for vehicles over 7.5t) to be approved by a relevant planning authority and the contractor should demonstrate how deviation will be managed</li>
  <li>check for complaints to see if they are justified, could the operator use a different route to avoid the issues</li>
  <li>check evidence to ensure the policy is being adhered to</li>
</ul>

<h2>HS.8 Incidents on the road</h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>The operators must record and investigate any incidents including road traffic collisions and near misses. Procedures must be in place to determine the reasons and prevent reoccurrence.</p>

<p>Operators should complete the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tell-dvsa-about-a-collision-or-incident-if-youre-an-earned-recognition-operator">report a collision or incident if you’re a <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Authority">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition operator form</a> where required.</p>
