<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document details the standards of the scheme, the assessment and evidence required during an audit to attain scheme status.</p>

<p>It is a public document and allows both the operator and the auditor to identify the areas where standards are met and where shortcomings need to be addressed.</p>

<p>Each of the applicable standards must be attained in order to meet the overall criteria and the operator should be able to demonstrate full and effective control in all cases. It is not possible to be entirely prescriptive in all cases, as each operator must be considered individually.</p>

<p>It is up to the operator to demonstrate the systems they have in place satisfy the required standards.</p>

<p>Before completing an audit, reference must be made to section 3 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dvsa-earned-recognition-guide-to-the-scheme">earned recognition scheme guide</a> and the audit sampling criteria.</p>

<h2>Earned recognition audit sampling criteria</h2>

<p>Audit sampling needs to be based on the following areas of measurement and considerations.</p>

<p>Areas of measurement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vehicles</li>
  <li>drivers</li>
</ul>

<p>Operating centres considerations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>type of management system and span of control should be considered in relation to sampling size</li>
  <li>where different management systems are used sampling must cover all of these</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition may wish to direct the audit or stipulate measures</li>
  <li>audit and verification checks should only be carried out at operating centres that have an administrative or management function</li>
  <li>the auditor check should include a minimum of one month’s operator analysis and subsequent actions</li>
  <li>in addition to the audit at the main operating centre and where required any verification checks at other operating centres must be rotated at the audit every 2 years</li>
  <li>maintenance records should conform with the current <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-maintaining-roadworthiness"><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> guide to maintaining roadworthiness</a>
</li>
  <li>the sample must be representative of the fleet including all types of vehicles, trailers and age range</li>
  <li>audit checks must sample records across all types of maintenance providers (for example manufacturers, independents and in-house)</li>
  <li>sampling from each operator licence</li>
  <li>if an operator carries out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/driving-dangerous-goods-and-special-loads">dangerous goods activities (<abbr title="Accord European relatif au transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route">ADR</abbr>)</a>, then at least one <abbr title="Accord European relatif au transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route">ADR</abbr> centre will be part of the audit</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span> Authorised vehicles and trailers</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>While the operator may own more vehicles than the maximum number authorised on the licence, they may not use more than that number at any one time. Every vehicle must display a valid disc when in use.</p>

<p>The operator may hire vehicles for as long as required provided that they do not operate more than the total number of vehicles authorised on their licence.</p>

<p>The operator may also hire vehicles (with or without a driver) on a temporary basis for up to 14 days without replacing the discs of the operator from whom they hired from. However, operators cannot borrow just a disc from another operator. There must be a gap of 14 days before the operator hires the same vehicle again. This is referred to as a special arrangement to cover unforeseen emergencies or peaks in business when there is a requirement for more vehicles than they have been licensed to operate. In this case, the operator who hired out the vehicle is still legally the operator, as long as their disc is displayed.</p>

<p>The operator should make sure that the hiring agreement places every responsibility on the owner for maintaining the vehicles even while they are in the hiring company’s possession.</p>

<p>Although it is not a statutory requirement for operator licensing, a robust process for specifying all current vehicles on a licence should be demonstrated. Operators that are members of <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition scheme must specify operational vehicles on their licence before first use.</p>

<p>Full account of driver scheduling, and other duties must be incorporated into the process.</p>

<p>Great Britain domestic drivers’ hours rules apply to most passenger-carrying vehicles and goods vehicles that do not have to follow the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rules</p>

<p>If the operator carries out driving for a different public authority or for a business, and the vehicle is not a public service vehicle with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>up to 8 passenger seats - the driver does not need to follow drivers’ hours rules</li>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.2 </span> Flexible services</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>A flexible service is (all of the following):</p>

<ul>
  <li>serves one or more local communities or neighbourhoods within a specified geographical area</li>
  <li>is so flexible that it is not practical to identify all the roads to be used at any given time in advance - there may be fixed sections of the route but most of the journey is flexibly routed</li>
  <li>is provided primarily to carry passengers who have booked in advance and whose collective requirements determine the route of each journey even though other passengers may also be travelling</li>
  <li>is where the public pays separate fares</li>
  <li>is where separate fares are paid that do not vary based on the number of passengers carried on the journey</li>
</ul>

<p>Where an operator undertakes services other than local bus services, processes should be in place to effectively manage this work.</p>

<p>Flexible bus services can only operate wholly within England and Wales (but not in Scotland).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.3 </span> Permit schemes</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>Permits are issued to not-for-profit bodies to enable them to charge for providing transport without the need to hold an operator licence.</p>

<p>Some operators of small vehicles, minibuses and, in a few cases, larger buses are free from PSV operator licensing if they use their vehicle under a permit. These permits let the holder carry fare-paying passengers in restricted circumstances.</p>

<p>There are 2 permit schemes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/67/section/19" rel="external">section 19 of the Transport Act 1985</a> - standard and large bus permits are issued to not-for-profit groups concerned with education, religion, social welfare, recreation (standard permits only) or other activities of benefit to the community - these services are unable to register local bus services</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/67/section/22" rel="external">section 22 of the Transport Act 1985</a> - community bus permits are issued to groups that want to run a local bus service on a non-profit making basis - these services need to be registered</li>
</ul>

<p>The same legal entity cannot hold both an operator licence and a section 19 or 22 permit under the 1985 Act. This is regardless of whether an organisation is carrying out all services for exclusively non-commercial purposes.</p>

<p>Due to the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition scheme allowing separate entities to the scheme as one group, this may allow for section 19 and 22 permit holders to be within the scheme without the need for an operator licence.</p>

<p>Processes must be in place to operate services within the rules set by the relevant authority.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.4 </span> International bus and coach services</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>A community licence, issued by the traffic commissioner, must be held to operate a bus or coach service overseas. Authorisations are required from the country or countries on the route.</p>

<p>The documentation required depends on the type of service and which countries the operator wants to operate in.</p>

<p>For regular services, the operator must get permission from the Department for Transport and from the appropriate authorities in the countries being visited.</p>

<p>The operator should be aware of the requirements to run international bus or coach services and tours.</p>

<p>They should have processes in place to monitor them effectively.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.5 </span> Bus operator account management</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>Once a service has been registered, the operator is committed to running it in accordance with the registered particulars. Therefore, a system needs to be in place so that checks can be carried out to ensure the service remains punctual and reliable. This may be through, for example, periodic roadside monitoring of the services or collecting performance data electronically.</p>

<p>For cross-boundary Transport for London (TfL) services, it is advisable that TfL performance standards should apply to the whole route, including the section of the route outside London.</p>

<h4>Auditor guidance and links</h4>

<ul>
  <li>section 19 permit holders are not subject to bus operator account management investigations, section 22 can be dependent on the service</li>
  <li>punctuality figures must meet the window of tolerance (1 minute early and up to 5 minutes late) to achieve the 95% target as set by the upper tribunal</li>
  <li>in the case of frequent services, check the service interval and then ensure that the correct number of busses have departed within any 60 minute period</li>
  <li>where Punctuality compliance figures are below 95%, a public inquiry is likely to be called</li>
