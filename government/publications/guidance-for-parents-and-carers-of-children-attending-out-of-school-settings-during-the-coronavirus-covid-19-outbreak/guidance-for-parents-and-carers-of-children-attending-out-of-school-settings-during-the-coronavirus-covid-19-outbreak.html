<h2>Main changes to previous guidance</h2>

<p>We have updated the section on <a href="#choosing-after-school-clubs-and-out-of-school-activities-for-your-child" class="govuk-link">choosing after-school clubs and out-of-school activities</a> to make it clear that parents should try to limit the number of settings their children attend as far as possible.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guidance is for parents and carers and covers changes to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>after-school clubs</li>
  <li>holiday clubs</li>
  <li>tuition</li>
  <li>community activities</li>
  <li>other out-of-school settings for children and young people aged 5 and over during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic</li>
</ul>

<p>We recognise the importance of these settings in providing additional childcare options to parents and carers who are critical workers, and in providing enriching activities and promoting the wellbeing of vulnerable children and young people.</p>

<h2>Opening of after-school clubs and out-of-school activities for children during the national lockdown</h2>

<p>During the national lockdown, providers who run community activities, holiday clubs, breakfast and after-school clubs, tuition and other out-of-school provision for children can operate for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-maintaining-educational-provision">children of critical workers and vulnerable children and young people</a>. They should implement the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protective-measures-for-holiday-or-after-school-clubs-and-other-out-of-school-settings-for-children-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak/protective-measures-for-out-of-school-settings-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak" class="govuk-link">protective measures guidance</a> in place. Eligible children (children of critical workers children of critical workers and vulnerable children and young people) are able to attend settings such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tuition and learning centres</li>
  <li>extracurricular clubs</li>
  <li>uniformed youth organisations (for example, Scouts, Guides and cadet forces)</li>
  <li>supplementary schools</li>
  <li>private language schools</li>
  <li>religious settings offering education (for example madrassahs, yeshivas, Sunday schools)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who can attend after-school clubs and out-of-school activities</h2>

<p>During the national lockdown, out-of-school settings may only offer face-to-face provision to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-maintaining-educational-provision/guidance-for-schools-colleges-and-local-authorities-on-maintaining-educational-provision" class="govuk-link">children of critical workers</a>, where it is reasonably necessary to enable their parents or carers to go to work, search for work, attend education or training, or attend a medical appointment</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-maintaining-educational-provision/guidance-for-schools-colleges-and-local-authorities-on-maintaining-educational-provision" class="govuk-link">vulnerable children and young people</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Scientific advice suggests that there is a moderate to high degree of confidence that the susceptibility to clinical disease of younger children (typically until they become teenagers) is generally lower than for adults. However, it remains important that protective measures are put in place to help reduce the risk of transmission.</p>

<p>If your child is in one of the eligible groups (vulnerable children and young people or children of critical workers), and you choose to send them to an out-of-school setting during the national lockdown, the risk can be minimised for children of all ages by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensuring that you are sending them to a provider that has coronavirus (COVID-19) protective measures in place</li>
  <li>taking practical steps to reduce the risk of your child coming in close contact with someone who has the virus, such as encouraging your child to walk or cycle to the setting, getting dropped off by a member of your household in your private car rather than taking public transport. You should not car share with anyone outside your household (or bubble)</li>
  <li>discouraging your child from mixing with different peer groups outside of the specific activity or group setting</li>
</ul>

<h2>Children with health concerns</h2>

<p>Very few children are now known to be clinically extremely vulnerable. Read the latest guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">shielding and protecting people who are clinically extremely vulnerable</a>.</p>

<p>Shielding advice is currently in place, so all children deemed clinically extremely vulnerable are advised not to attend out-of-school settings.</p>

<p>Children and young people who are either children of critical workers or considered to be vulnerable, and whose parents or carers are clinically extremely vulnerable can continue to go to out-of-school settings. The Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) has published updated guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">shielding and protecting people who are clinically extremely vulnerable</a> outlining what steps should be taken to minimise the risk of infection and transmission of the virus.</p>

<p>If parents of children with significant risk factors are concerned, we recommend they discuss their concerns with the provider, to receive reassurance of the measures they are putting in place to reduce the risk.</p>

<p>We are aware that some parents and carers may look to holiday clubs and out-of-school settings to offer respite childcare for children with special educational needs or with an Education, Health and Care Plan (<abbr title="education, health and care plan">EHCP</abbr>). Parents or carers of disabled children may continue to access respite care to support them in caring for their disabled child. Further information on this is available in guidance for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-childrens-social-care-services/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-local-authorities-on-childrens-social-care#social-care-services-for-disabled-children-and-young-people">children’s social care services</a>. We have also asked providers to ensure that making provision available and accessible to these children, as far as possible, remains a priority in these current circumstances.</p>

<h2>Choosing after-school clubs and out-of-school activities for your child</h2>

<p>It is crucial that we are minimising the risk of transmission of the virus due to increased mixing between different groups of children. For this reason, you should consider sending your child to the same settings consistently and limit the number of settings your child attends as far as possible.</p>

<p>You should also keep an accurate record of when and where your child attends out-of-school settings to help <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace</a> identify people who may have been in contact with your child should they test positive for coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>We have released <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protective-measures-for-holiday-or-after-school-clubs-and-other-out-of-school-settings-for-children-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak/protective-measures-for-out-of-school-settings-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak" class="govuk-link">protective measures guidance for providers</a> to help them put in place protective measures to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus. While some providers will be Ofsted registered, not all will be, and there is no single responsible body with complete oversight of these settings, or the quality and safety of their provision. With this in mind, you will want to check with the provider that they have put in place protective measures, such as those described in this guidance, to reduce the risk of infection before you send your child to a particular setting.</p>

<h2>Protective measures in after-school clubs and out-of-school activities</h2>

<p>The government has released <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protective-measures-for-holiday-or-after-school-clubs-and-other-out-of-school-settings-for-children-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak/protective-measures-for-out-of-school-settings-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak" class="govuk-link">protective measures guidance</a> to help providers of out-of-school settings put measures in place to reduce the risk of infection and transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>The type of protective measures specific providers put in place will depend on their individual circumstances, such as the type of the activity they offer (for example whether children will be moving around rather than sitting at desks), the size and layout of their premises, and whether the activity is being held indoors or outdoors.</p>

<p>The key measures that every setting should have in place are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>minimising contact with staff, children and young people, and other individuals who are unwell by ensuring those who have coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms do not attend their setting - this also applies if a member of their family has symptoms or has tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), or if they have been advised individually by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/" rel="external">NHS Test and Trace</a> to isolate at home because they are the contact of a case that does not live in the same house</li>
  <li>encouraging staff and children attending to clean their hands more often than usual, including before and after activities and before and after using toilet or washroom facilities</li>
  <li>ensuring good respiratory hygiene by promoting the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach</li>
  <li>cleaning frequently touched surfaces more often than usual using standard products, such as detergent or bleach</li>
  <li>increased frequency of cleaning of toilets and washrooms</li>
  <li>minimising contact and mixing between groups of children by altering the environment to allow for social distancing between children and keeping children in the same bubbles that they are in during the school day, or otherwise in small consistent groups</li>
</ul>

<p>Before sending your child to a setting, you will want to ask providers what measures have been put in place to keep children, staff members and parents or carers safe, and any practicalities you need to be aware of such as collection and drop-off times and whether your child should bring their own water bottle or food to the setting.</p>

<h2>Bubbles and group sizes in out-of-school clubs and activities</h2>

<p>Where it is possible to do so, providers should try to work with you and the schools or early years settings which your child attends to ensure, as far as possible, your child can be kept in a group with other children from the same bubble they are in during the school day. This will minimise the amount of mixing between different groups of children outside of school, and therefore the risk of infection.</p>

<p>Where it is not possible or it is impractical for providers to group children in the same bubbles as they are in during the school day (for example, if there are only one or two children attending the provision from the same school or school day bubble), providers may need to group children with other children from outside their school day bubble, or from a different school.</p>

<p>If providers need to do this we are recommending that they, as far as possible, keep children in small groups of no more than 15 children with the same children each time wherever possible (that is, do not mix groups unless absolutely necessary). It would be appropriate for one staff member to supervise up to 2 small groups of children if necessary, depending on the type of provision or size of the group. Group sizes may need to be smaller than 15 children depending on factors such as the age of the children in attendance, size of the premises or the type of activity.</p>

<p>This means that when your child attends the first session they should be placed in a particular group or class of children and they should remain in that group for future sessions as far as possible. Providers will need to review these groups to minimise the amount of ‘mixing’ (that is, the number of different people each child comes into contact with). For example, when new children register for the club or activity, the provider may wish to first determine whether they attend the same school or early years setting as other children in the setting and group them together if appropriate.</p>

<p>Multiple groups of 15 plus staff can use the same shared space, if that is necessary, with distancing between the groups.</p>

<h2>What to do if your child is displaying coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms</h2>

<p>Anyone who has coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms, such as a raised temperature, a new continuous cough, or a loss of or change to their sense of smell or taste, should stay at home. They should not attend an out-of-school setting and should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">guidance for households with possible coronavirus (COVID-19) infection</a> and get a test.</p>

<p>If your child becomes unwell while at a setting, the provider should call you immediately to come and collect them. While your child is awaiting collection they will be kept separate from others by a distance of at least 2 metres, ideally in a well-ventilated room with appropriate adult supervision. When you collect your child you should take them straight home, do not use public transport and do not visit the GP, pharmacy, urgent care centre or a hospital unless the child is seriously unwell. In an emergency, call 999 if they are seriously ill or injured or their life is at risk.</p>

<p>Follow the NHS guidance on <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/when-to-self-isolate-and-what-to-do/">when to self-isolate and what to do</a> or contact NHS 119 via telephone if you do not have internet access.</p>

<p>If your child tests negative, they can usually return to the setting and the fellow household members can end their self-isolation subject to confirmation from local health protection professionals.</p>

<p>If your child tests negative but is unwell, they should not return to the setting until they are recovered.</p>

<p>If your child tests positive, <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NHS Test and Trace</a> will speak directly to those that have been in contact with your child to offer advice.</p>

<h2>Parent attendance at extra-curricular clubs, tuition and other out-of-school activities</h2>

<p>Parents and carers should not be allowed into the setting unless this is essential (for example, where children may have special care needs), and children should be dropped off and collected at the door if possible.</p>

<p>It is good practice for providers to give parents and carers a parental consent form to complete when enrolling children in a setting so they have at least one emergency contact number for each child and are aware of any medical conditions or allergies. However, it is particularly important during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak that you ensure the provider has your most up-to-date contact details in case of an emergency, such as your child falling ill with coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms while attending the setting.</p>

<p>If you are unable to supervise your child during a session, you will want to satisfy yourself that a provider has put protective measures in place to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, as well as having adequate health and safety and child protection procedures. In <a class="govuk-link" href="#annexa">annex A</a> we have included checklists to support you when choosing a setting for your child.</p>

<h2>Live performances of children’s dance, music and drama</h2>

<p>Live performances of children’s dance, music and drama should not take place for the duration of the national lockdown.</p>

<h2>Annex A: choosing a suitable provider</h2>

<p>This information provides some examples of positive signs to look out for to help you make good choices when choosing an out-of-school setting for your child, but this is not an exhaustive list.</p>

<h3>All providers</h3>

<p>Check to see if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>health and safety has been considered, specifically coronavirus (COVID-19) protective measures - providers with more than 5 staff members should have a written policy, small and self-employed providers do not need to have a written policy but should be aware of the risks and how to reduce them</li>
  <li>the environment appears safe (it is a well-maintained, clean building with a clear exit route in case of emergencies and a first aid kit available) and the provider knows what to do in the event of a fire or emergency</li>
  <li>rooms are well-ventilated, either by a ventilation unit or naturally (for example, open windows)</li>
  <li>soap or hand sanitiser is readily available for staff, children and parents or carers to clean their hands - the setting may also have posters promoting frequent handwashing or the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach</li>
  <li>the setting is cleaned frequently (for example, cleaning checklists in toilets are visible and completed regularly)</li>
  <li>the use of toilets and changing rooms is managed to prevent overcrowding</li>
  <li>children attending the setting are in school bubbles or small, consistent groups of no more than 15 children and one or 2 staff members</li>
  <li>social distancing is promoted, through physical markers for instance</li>
  <li>an appointed person is responsible for first aid</li>
  <li>the provider has relevant training to deal with child protection and safeguarding issues (for example abuse and neglect)</li>
  <li>a child protection policy can be given to parents on request - this should say how children can report concerns and how the provider will make parents aware of them</li>
  <li>there is an appointed safeguarding lead</li>
  <li>a parental consent form, which asks for medical information and emergency contact details, is needed before the child attends for the first time</li>
  <li>a complaints process is in place</li>
</ul>
