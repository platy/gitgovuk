<h2>Project objectives</h2>

<p>This Equality Impact Assessment related to the operational delivery of the Qualifying Asset Holding Companies (<abbr title="Qualifying Asset Holding Companies">QAHCs</abbr>) regime.</p>

<h3>Background to policy</h3>

<p>Finance Act 2022 introduces a new regime for the taxation of <abbr title="Qualifying Asset Holding Companies">QAHCs</abbr> and certain payments that <abbr title="Qualifying Asset Holding Companies">QAHCs</abbr> may make. 
A <abbr title="Qualifying Asset Holding Company">QAHC</abbr> must be at least 70% owned by diversely owned funds, or certain institutional investors, and mainly carry out investment activity.</p>

<p><abbr title="Qualifying Asset Holding Companies">QAHCs</abbr> facilitate the flow of capital, income and gains between investors and underlying investments, so that investors are taxed broadly as if they invested in the underlying assets and the <abbr title="Qualifying Asset Holding Company">QAHC</abbr> pays no more tax than is proportionate to the activities it performs.</p>

<h3>Phase 1 changes</h3>

<p>To ensure the regime rules are followed correctly and to provide support for <abbr title="Qualifying Asset Holding Company">QAHC</abbr> customers, dedicated communication channels have been created, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> <abbr title="Qualifying Asset Holding Company">QAHC</abbr> team to answer general <abbr title="Qualifying Asset Holding Company">QAHC</abbr> related queries </li>
  <li>an online form to allow <abbr title="Qualifying Asset Holding Company">QAHC</abbr> customers to make required notifications to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Customer groups affected</h2>

<p><abbr title="Qualifying Asset Holding Companies">QAHCs</abbr> that meet certain criteria and are used in a range of collective and institutional investment structures to hold investment assets, and the investment funds, institutions, individuals and other entities that invest in those structures.</p>

<h2>What customers will need to do</h2>

<h3>What customers need to do as a result of the change</h3>

<p><abbr title="Qualifying Asset Holding Companies">QAHCs</abbr> are required to make a notification to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. There are a number of occasions when they will be required to do this.</p>

<h3>How customers will access this service</h3>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has published an online form on a landing page on gov.uk, which customers must use in order to complete the notifications.</p>

<h3>When customers need to do this</h3>

<p>There are different deadlines for making different types of notifications. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has published guidance within the Investment Funds Manual and on gov.uk which provide further details.</p>

<h2>Assessing the impact</h2>

<p>We assessed the equality impacts on all the protected characteristic groups in line with the Equality Act and Public Sector Equality Duty, and Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act: racial groups, disabled, sex, gender reassignment, sexual orientation, age, religion or belief, pregnancy and maternity, marriage and civil partnership, people with dependents and those without, political opinion (for Northern Ireland only).</p>

<p>There is no evidence to suggest any specific impacts on those customers within any of the protected characteristic groups listed above. The online form is available in accessible formats and online guidance will be available. Extra support will be provided as required through regular business channels.</p>

<h3>People who use different languages (including Welsh language and British Sign Language)</h3>

<h4>Impact on Customers</h4>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is obliged to provide Welsh language versions of documents, publications and services.</p>

<h4>Proposed Mitigation</h4>

<p>The project will offer a Welsh language service to  customers, where proportionate, in line with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> protocol.</p>

<h3>Opportunities to promote Equalities</h3>

<p>We have considered opportunities to promote equalities and good relations between people in each of the protected characteristic groups and those outside of that group.</p>

<p>None have been identified.</p>

<p>A Full Equality Impact Assessment is not recommended.</p>
