<p>To help with efficient planning and approval of spending proposals for agile digital and IT projects, the following clarification of business case guidance has been produced in collaboration between HM Treasury and the Government Digital Service. This should release the potential of the agile approach to produce better systems more quickly and cheaply than conventional IT planning and project management while maintaining effective business planning and spending control processes.</p>

<p>This should enable a controlled early release of resources for the Discovery and Alpha phases of agile projects and enable a proportionate process of planning and control that delivers value for money without excessive bureaucracy.</p>

<h2>Existing guidance</h2>
<p>All current Treasury guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-green-book-appraisal-and-evaluation-in-central-governent">production and approval of business cases</a>, the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/major-projects-approval-and-assurance-guidance">Treasury approval processes</a>, the Treasury’s Departmental Spending Limits rules and the supplementary <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/digital-and-technology-spend-controls-version-5">Cabinet Office controls on digital and IT</a> operated through the spending mechanism remain unaffected by this.</p>

<p>Although this supplementary business case guidance focuses on projects that require <abbr title="HM Treasury">HMT</abbr> spending approval, it is expected (as with all current <abbr title="HM Treasury">HMT</abbr> business case guidance) that it will be understood as best practice and applied to all projects requiring spending approval including those falling within <abbr title="Departmental Spending Limits">DEL</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Agile spending project approval process</h2>
<p>The approval process for agile projects should be adapted to suit each project’s spend and the risk to the programme within which it sits. There are 3 categories for which different variants of the approval and business case process are appropriate as follows:</p>

<h3>Initial research and scoping stages of all Agile projects – Discovery and Alpha</h3>
<p>All agile Discovery and Alpha work is regarded as initial research and, subject to a limit of £750,000, would normally be undertaken from departments’ <abbr title="Departmental Spending Limits">DEL</abbr> budgets subject only to <abbr title="Cabinet Office">CO</abbr> controls. Agile projects are frequently part of wider business programmes to be delivered for reasons of either business transformation or business continuity. Even before Discovery and Alpha, departments should have a clear justification for why such scoping is financially and strategically worthwhile. This should be submitted in the <abbr title="Cabinet Office">CO</abbr> control form.</p>

<p>The Discovery and subsequent stages are learning phases that feed back into the evolving project business case and into the wider Programme Business Case of which the project is a part.</p>

<p>The relatively low level of spending involved, the need for <abbr title="Government Digital Service">GDS</abbr> approval of digital projects and the existence of an overarching programme business case (which defines the business scope, the outputs, their timing and the likely resource allocation of the agile project), allows the business case and approval to be streamlined and tailored to suit the needs of the programme and project. Thus, the classical three stage approval process (<abbr title="Strategic Outline Case">SOC</abbr>, <abbr title="Outline Business Case">OBC</abbr>, <abbr title="Full Business Case">FBC</abbr>) can be adapted to support something more suited to agile. This guidance clarification recommends more use of PBCs for programmes and project approvals using a light touch <abbr title="Outline Business Case">OBC</abbr> only (this may be iterative).</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Treasury">HMT</abbr> and <abbr title="Government Digital Service">GDS</abbr> have agreed that departments can spend up to £750,000 from within their own <abbr title="Departmental Spending Limits">DEL</abbr> budget on Discovery and Alpha as a research and scoping activity subject only to <abbr title="Cabinet Office">CO</abbr> IT/digital controls. If a particular project requires more than £750,000 this can be agreed by the overarching programme, in consultation with the relevant approving authority, which in many cases will be the <abbr title="HM Treasury">HMT</abbr> spending team.</p>

<p>Projects that are above <abbr title="Departmental Spending Limits">DEL</abbr> spending limits or which are novel or contentious require Treasury approval at these stages but the process should be adapted to suit the case and set out in the <abbr title="Programme Business Case">PBC</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Larger projects costing above £10 million</h3>
<p>Larger projects costing above £10 million (for the whole life of the project to the end of two years live running) or which pose significant risk to the programme should be approved by the Treasury through the project approval process but using an agreed plan of monitoring and approval points set out in the management plan of the <abbr title="Programme Business Case">PBC</abbr> rather than through a classic three stage process.</p>

<h3>Smaller projects costing below £10 million</h3>
<p>Smaller projects costing below £10 million that are not high risk to the overall programme can be approved and managed against the <abbr title="Programme Business Case">PBC</abbr> without needing a separate <abbr title="Outline Business Case">OBC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Project level approval for larger agile projects should use a light touch <abbr title="Outline Business Case">OBC</abbr> and try to minimise traditional detailed IT planning documents. Instead, they should focus on user needs, business outcomes, costs and milestones within the context of a wider programme business case. This project approval process should be agreed as part of the wider management plan of the wider <abbr title="Programme Business Case">PBC</abbr>. We recommend that management review meetings should use digital service demonstrations and agile artefacts (e.g. <a class="govuk-link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn_down_chart" rel="external">burn charts</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)#Product_backlog" rel="external">backlogs</a>).</p>

<p>Relatively inexpensive agile projects, which are not high risk to the programme within which they sit, can be approved as part of the programme approval process. That approval process should be planned as a part of the <abbr title="Programme Business Case">PBC</abbr> (currently branded as the Strategic Outline Programme and due to be rebranded later in 2014).</p>

<p>In some cases a programme will have numerous agile projects, each of which is below £10 million spend but which in aggregate cost over £10 million (this typically happens in a department wide transformation programme). In this case, a <abbr title="Programme Business Case">PBC</abbr> should be used rather than multiple OBCs, but the <abbr title="Programme Business Case">PBC</abbr> should contain a significant degree of economic scrutiny proportionate to the spend. It is also particularly crucial when managing a programme of agile work to schedule regular reviews and to use the service demonstration, burn charts and backlogs to give the approving authority a high level of visibility and control over the speed of progress and the prioritisation of tasks.</p>

<p>Using the <abbr title="Strategic Outline Programme">SOP</abbr>/<abbr title="Programme Business Case">PBC</abbr> process has the advantage that as well as being relatively light touch for the agile project it also highlights clearly how the agile work fits into a wider programme by flagging dependencies.</p>

<h4>Walkthrough of the process to obtain agile spend approval</h4>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Diagram explaining the agile spend approvals process" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/24876/agile_spend_approval.jpg"></div></figure>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Apply to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/spending-controls.html"><abbr title="Cabinet Office">CO</abbr> Spend Controls</a> for Alpha and Discovery funding</h3>

<p>This can be done before the business case for approval is complete based on an outline brief containing the business outputs required, the timing needed and likely scale of funding available because it qualifies as research and feeds back to inform the options appraisal in the business case.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Do Discovery and Alpha</h3>

<p>At the start of Discovery, if external approval will eventually be required departments should contact the <abbr title="HM Treasury">HMT</abbr> spend team and <abbr title="Major Projects Authorities">MPA</abbr> (if they haven’t already done so) to plan the engagement described in the next paragraph.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Develop and write a project business case and/or input to a <abbr title="Programme Business Case">PBC</abbr> (in parallel with, and informed by, Discovery and Alpha)</h3>

<p>Low Spending projects: where spending on agile is relatively low and external approval of the project business case is not likely to be required, the PBCs provides a more streamlined vehicle for managing external spending and approval where project spending is below £10 million.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Programme Business Case">PBC</abbr> currently known as the <abbr title="Strategic Outline Case">SOC</abbr> - template <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190602/Green_Book_guidance_public_sector_business_cases_using_the_Five_Case_Model_templates.doc">here</a>, see pages 8-19 - is a good vehicle for managing spending planning and approval where the agile spend is relatively low but is a vital enabler of a larger, wider programme with a total whole life programme spend above £10 million.</p>

<p>Higher Spending projects: alternatively, if the whole life agile project spending is likely to be above £10 million an <abbr title="Outline Business Case">OBC</abbr> is needed. The programme team should work on the business case and the <abbr title="Major Projects Authorities">MPA</abbr> Project Validation Review at the same time as the agile team complete Discovery and Alpha phases. The completion of the <abbr title="Project Validation Review">PVR</abbr> and <abbr title="Programme Business Case">PBC</abbr> is not a pre-condition for this work to begin. The programme business case should include an agile spend envelope with some sensible allowance for contingency. <abbr title="HM Treasury">HMT</abbr> must sign off a business case before you can move into Beta. If the expected project cost is £10 million or if the project poses high risk to the delivery of the programme, a project business case is required, but it does not need to take the form of the Full or Final Business where procurement is taken care of through the use of pre-competed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">digital frameworks</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Alpha digital service assessment</h3>

<p>This assesses the service against the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default">Digital by Default Service Standard</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5. </span> Apply to <abbr title="Cabinet Office">CO</abbr> Spend Controls to release Beta funding</h3>

<p><abbr title="Cabinet Office">CO</abbr> Spend Controls and <abbr title="HM Treasury">HMT</abbr> (for projects above delegated spend limits) both look at the proposed agile Beta spend. In general, <abbr title="HM Treasury">HMT</abbr>’s main focus is economic / financial (especially affordability, delivery and value for money); <abbr title="Cabinet Office">CO</abbr>’s focus is more on the appropriateness of the technology choices being made. <abbr title="Cabinet Office">CO</abbr> Spend Controls will only approve Beta funding to projects for which a working Alpha can be demonstrated.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6. </span> Beta and Live agile delivery</h3>

<p>During Beta and Live agile delivery, updates by the department to <abbr title="HM Treasury">HMT</abbr> and <abbr title="Major Projects Authorities">MPA</abbr> should normally focus on a digital service demonstration accompanied by agile artefacts (e.g. burn chart, backlog) rather than conventional technically detailed and lengthy IT project documents. The department should agree with <abbr title="HM Treasury">HMT</abbr> and <abbr title="Major Projects Authorities">MPA</abbr> what arrangements are appropriate to monitor, review and approve Beta and Live spend in each particular project. Review and approval points should be planned and agreed at the outset as part of the programme management plan and be aligned to selected reporting points and delivery appropriate to the particular service (e.g. every 6-12 months).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7. </span> Digital service assessments</h3>

<p>Assessments take place before a service is available publicly on the internet in Beta, and again before the service can be branded as “live”. These assess whether the service achieves all the points of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default">Digital Service Standard</a>, and hence give a sufficiently high quality user experience to enable that service to become digital by default.</p>

<p>If departments have further questions about how to apply this guidance, please contact your <abbr title="HM Treasury">HMT</abbr> spending team (or <abbr title="Government Digital Service">GDS</abbr>/<abbr title="Major Projects Authorities">MPA</abbr> as applicable).</p>
