<h2>Background on the <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> wastewater surveillance programme</h2>
<p>People who have had COVID-19 shed the virus during daily activities such as going to the toilet and blowing noses. The virus enters the sewer system through sinks, drains, and toilets. Fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (the virus that causes COVID-19) can be detected in sewage samples.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> programme – led by the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) and run in partnership with <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>, the Environment Agency, <abbr title="Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture">CEFAS</abbr>, academia and water companies – tests sewage in England for fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Samples are taken from sewage flowing into wastewater treatment plants and from key locations across the sewer network (manholes) on a daily basis.</p>

<p>The programme helps identify where the virus is circulating in England, detecting spikes in prevalence. It has the benefit of detecting the virus in asymptomatic individuals.</p>

<p>The programme now plays an important role in the detection of mutations of the virus, variants of concern (<abbr title="variants of concern">VOCs</abbr>) and variants under investigation (<abbr title="variants under investigation">VUIs</abbr>). This is done through genomic sequencing of wastewater samples to provide an indication of where <abbr title="variants of concern">VOCs</abbr> and <abbr title="variants under investigation">VUIs</abbr> may be present across England. The wastewater surveillance programme routinely sequences samples from sewers across the country to provide a national and local view of the presence of mutations and variants. Insights from wastewater testing are shared with local and national decision-makers.</p>

<p>Over time, <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> wastewater sampling sites have been changed and others have been added to optimise the programme’s coverage. Since the last <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wastewater-testing-coverage-data-for-19-may-2021-emhp-programme"><abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> population coverage publication on 10 June 2021</a> (based on coverage on 19 May 2021), the population coverage of the programme has increased by approximately 4%. The programme now provides coverage to approximately 74% of the population of England. The <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> team coordinates with programmes in the devolved administrations to provide UK-wide wastewater monitoring.</p>

<h2>Wastewater testing coverage data</h2>
<p>Population coverage estimates are produced by matching Lower Layer Super Output Areas (<abbr title="Lower Layer Super Output Areas">LSOAs</abbr>) and their associated populations to wastewater catchments. There are several sources of uncertainty in these estimates, for example in how <abbr title="Lower Layer Super Output Areas">LSOAs</abbr> are matched to the catchments and uncertainty about catchment boundaries (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#methodology">Methodology section</a> for further information). <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> estimates this uncertainty in wastewater catchments to be approximately ± 15%.</p>

<p>Table 1 shows the percentage of each regional population in England covered by wastewater sampling (based on coverage on 23 February 2022). The estimated population coverage of wastewater surveillance across England is 74%. This ranges across the regions from 61% in the South West and the South East to 79% in the North East and 100% in London.</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows the percentage of lower tier local authority (<abbr title="lower tier local authority">LTLA</abbr>) populations covered by wastewater sampling. This ranges from 0% (often in particularly rural areas) to 100%. Median coverage of <abbr title="lower tier local authorities">LTLAs</abbr> is 76%.</p>

<p>This data and data for <abbr title="lower tier local authority">LTLA</abbr> are available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wastewater-testing-coverage-data-for-23-february-2022-emhp-programme">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>Table 2 shows the percentage of each Index of Multiple Deprivation (<abbr title="Index of Multiple Deprivation">IMD</abbr>) decile in England covered by wastewater sampling (based on coverage on 23 February 2022).</p>

<p>Deciles are calculated by ranking the 32,844 neighbourhoods in England from most deprived to least deprived and dividing them into 10 equal groups (that is, each containing 3,284 or 3,285 neighbourhoods). These deciles range from the most deprived 10% of neighbourhoods (decile 1) nationally to the least deprived 10% of neighbourhoods nationally (decile 10).</p>

<p>The estimated population coverage of wastewater surveillance for the most deprived areas (decile 1) in England is 91%.</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows the percentage of population in each <abbr title="Index of Multiple Deprivation">IMD</abbr> decile, by region, covered by wastewater sampling. Similar to the trend seen across England, in all regions except London (where coverage is 100%) wastewater population coverage is higher for the more deprived areas (deciles 1 to 5) than for the less deprived areas (deciles 6 to 10).</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<h3>About this data</h3>

<p>The population coverage estimates reflect the population covered by wastewater catchments where the <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> programme samples wastewater and tests for SARS-CoV-2. The estimates represent a snapshot of the coverage of wastewater surveillance as of 23 February 2022.</p>

<h3>Data sources</h3>
<p>The population estimates of regions, <abbr title="lower tier local authorities">LTLAs</abbr> and <abbr title="Lower Layer Super Output Areas">LSOAs</abbr> – a standard ONS geography – with each <abbr title="Lower Layer Super Output Area">LSOA</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/censusgeography#super-output-area-soa" rel="external">containing approximately 1,500 people</a> are ONS estimates and are mid-2019 estimates of population. The population-weighted centroids of <abbr title="Lower Layer Super Output Areas">LSOAs</abbr> used in the <abbr title="Lower Layer Super Output Area">LSOA</abbr>-to-catchment matching algorithm (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#estimating-wastewater">Estimating wastewater testing population coverage</a>) are also sourced from ONS.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Index of Multiple Deprivation">IMD</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019">deciles are produced by ONS</a> and are calculated nationally. Each <abbr title="Lower Layer Super Output Area">LSOA</abbr> is assigned a decile from 1 (most deprived) to 10 (least deprived). There are a constant number of <abbr title="Lower Layer Super Output Areas">LSOAs</abbr> in each decile but due to population variations between <abbr title="Lower Layer Super Output Areas">LSOAs</abbr> the actual population in each decile varies slightly. Within a  region, there are substantial differences between populations in each decile.</p>

<p>The catchment boundaries for sewage treatment works (<abbr title="sewage treatment works">STWs</abbr>) were provided by the 9 water companies serving England:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Severn Trent</li>
  <li>South West Water</li>
  <li>Southern Water</li>
  <li>Wessex Water</li>
  <li>Thames Water</li>
  <li>Anglian Water</li>
  <li>Northumbrian Water</li>
  <li>Yorkshire Water</li>
  <li>United Utilities</li>
</ul>

<h3>Estimating wastewater testing population coverage</h3>

<p><abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> samples at sewer network sites (manholes in the street which generally serve a local area) and <abbr title="sewage treatment works">STWs</abbr>, which generally serve wider areas such as a city or town. A catchment, defined as an area from which wastewater flows into the sampling location, is associated with both <abbr title="sewage treatment works">STWs</abbr> and sewer networks. Sewer network sites almost always fall within the catchment of an <abbr title="sewage treatment work">STW</abbr>, so generally network sites do not count towards population coverage.</p>

<p>To estimate the population of catchments, <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> matched <abbr title="Lower Layer Super Output Areas">LSOAs</abbr> to all the catchment areas sampled (both sewer network sites and <abbr title="sewage treatment works">STWs</abbr>). If the population-weighted-centroid of an <abbr title="Lower Layer Super Output Area">LSOA</abbr> falls within the boundary of a catchment, then the whole population of the <abbr title="Lower Layer Super Output Area">LSOA</abbr> is assigned to that catchment. If an <abbr title="Lower Layer Super Output Area">LSOA</abbr> is served by multiple sites, such as an <abbr title="sewage treatment work">STW</abbr> and a network site, it is only counted once.</p>

<p>To calculate the population coverage in a region, a matching algorithm between <abbr title="Lower Layer Super Output Area">LSOA</abbr> and wastewater catchment is used to determine which <abbr title="Lower Layer Super Output Areas">LSOAs</abbr> are served within a region.</p>

<p>The sum of the populations of the <abbr title="Lower Layer Super Output Areas">LSOAs</abbr> covered by <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> samples in the region is divided by the region population to calculate the percentage coverage for the region. Similarly, the national coverage figure is calculated by summing the population covered in every region and dividing by the population of England.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Index of Multiple Deprivation">IMD</abbr> decile of each <abbr title="Lower Layer Super Output Area">LSOA</abbr> is then used to calculate the population coverage by <abbr title="Index of Multiple Deprivation">IMD</abbr> decile for England and for each region.</p>

<h3>Uncertainty, data quality and revisions</h3>
<p>The data presented provides a snapshot of wastewater testing coverage on 23 February 2022. The data has a degree of uncertainty and associated caveats:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the sites from which <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> samples from can change depending on testing capacity, epidemiological priorities and current local response activities, resulting in changes to the population covered</li>
  <li>the process of matching <abbr title="Lower Layer Super Output Areas">LSOAs</abbr> to catchment areas is approximate – there is uncertainty in the matching process where <abbr title="Lower Layer Super Output Areas">LSOAs</abbr> partially overlap the catchment boundary and this uncertainty is increased by other data quality issues and uncertainties:
    <ul>
      <li>the boundaries of wastewater catchments are mostly constant but can change depending on factors such as rainfall, as storm drains divert the flow of water to different parts of the network</li>
      <li>catchments of a site can change, particularly as there is uncertainty about the catchment areas of <abbr title="sewage treatment works">STWs</abbr> (given that one water company can own the <abbr title="sewage treatment work">STW</abbr> and a different water company can own the sewer infrastructure) – this may mean that an <abbr title="sewage treatment work">STW</abbr> serves a different catchment area to the one EHMP has assigned to it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>these data quality issues affect a minority of catchments and the <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> is confident in most catchment boundaries</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> wastewater monitoring data itself is generated by non-accredited research laboratories and should be considered experimental. Formal validation of wastewater monitoring as a variant surveillance system is underway.</p>

<p>If any substantial revisions occur in future publications of this data, this will be outlined in the publication – the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/standards-for-official-statistics-published-by-dhsc">published a revision policy for official statistics</a>.</p>
