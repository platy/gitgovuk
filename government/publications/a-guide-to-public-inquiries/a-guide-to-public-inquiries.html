<span class="number">2. </span>Public Inquiries</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>WHAT IS A PUBLIC INQUIRY?</h3>

<p>A public inquiry is a formal tribunal hearing, where a traffic commissioner is the decision maker. There are three main types of public inquiry - those held to determine licence applications; reviews of operating centres (for goods operator licences only); and those held for regulatory reasons, where the future of transport operations will be considered.</p>

<p>Public inquiries are usually held in person, similar to a court or other tribunal. In certain cases, a traffic commissioner may decide to hold an inquiry remotely with parties attending virtually (on-line). Due to the complexity of the proceedings the opportunity to do this is limited and parties will be advised in the letter calling them to the inquiry on whether the hearing is to be held in person or virtually, with any specific instructions. More commonly, the evidence of some witnesses is heard remotely, but parties will have the same opportunity to ask questions and clarify the facts with these witnesses. Much of the information contained in this guide is relevant to either in person or virtual hearings, but it has been written with ‘in person’ hearings as the most common type.</p>

<p>When hearing an application, the traffic commissioner will consider evidence from the applicant and if required any valid opposition to the application. When reviewing an operating centre, the traffic commissioner will consider evidence from the operator and any valid complainants. In regulatory cases the traffic commissioner will consider evidence from the operator and usually evidence provided by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/driver-and-vehicle-standards-agency">Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency</a> (DVSA) and/or other enforcement  bodies.</p>

<p>In all public inquiries the traffic commissioner may also hear from additional witnesses and, if the traffic commissioner considers it appropriate, may be assisted by a financial assessor.
When a traffic commissioner has received valid opposition (representation and/or objection) to an application, he/she may consider that it is appropriate to hold a public inquiry. This gives all interested parties an opportunity to present their case to the traffic commissioner.</p>

<p>A traffic commissioner may decide that a public inquiry is necessary in order to clarify information that has been received, which raises concerns. Additionally, a traffic commissioner must hold a public inquiry if he/she is considering taking regulatory action against an existing licence and the operator requests a hearing. Furthermore, a traffic commissioner must hold a public inquiry if he/she is considering taking regulatory action against a transport manager’s good repute and/or professional competence, and the hearing has been requested.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>PARTIES TO A PUBLIC INQUIRY</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>HOW WILL AN OPERATOR/APPLICANT/TRANSPORT MANAGER BE NOTIFIED OF A PUBLIC INQUIRY?</h3>

<p>A letter calling you to the inquiry will explain why a public inquiry is being held and give details of the legislation that it has been called under, together with the evidence that the traffic commissioner will consider. This will be sent to the correspondence address as given to the Office of the Traffic Commissioner and recorded  on the licence. Notification of a public inquiry will be dispatched giving at least 21-days’ notice in relation to an existing goods operator’s licence or application, 14-days’ notice in relation to an existing passenger operator’s licence or application and 28-days’ notice in relation to a public inquiry relating to a transport manager. These periods can be shortened with the agreement of the applicant/operator or transport manager. The timescales do not apply for cases adjourned from a data where notice had previously been given.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>HOW DO OBJECTORS/REPRESENTORS/COMPLAINANTS KNOW IF A PUBLIC INQUIRY IS TO BE HELD?</h3>

<p>For HGV operator licences, statutory objectors such as local authorities, planning authorities, the police, and certain trade associations and trade unions, may object to the grant of a goods licence application on the grounds of repute or fitness to hold a licence, financial standing, concerns about the operator’s arrangements for vehicle maintenance and drivers’ hours’ compliance, the professional competence of the operator and on the environmental and general suitability of an operating centre.</p>

<p>Owners and occupiers of land or buildings near an operating centre who feel that the use or enjoyment of their own land would be adversely affected by the proposed HGV operating centre use have a right to make their views known to a traffic commissioner. They are called representors; representations can be made only on environmental grounds.</p>

<p>Unlike objections, which are made in response to applications, complaints can be made at any time and by anyone. A complaint about an authorised operating centre can be on either environmental or road safety grounds. However, the traffic commissioner can only take immediate action if it is considered that the operator concerned is operating outside the terms of his/her licence; otherwise, the traffic commissioner can only act at what is known as the ‘Review Date’, which occurs every five years and is based on when the licence was first granted.</p>

<p>Anyone who has made a valid objection or representation will be advised in writing of the date, time and venue of the Inquiry and be invited to attend. They will normally be given at least 21-days’ notice and be asked to confirm whether or not they will be attending.</p>

<p>For passenger vehicle operator licences, only statutory objectors such as the police and local authorities can oppose the application. They may object to the grant of a passenger licence application on the grounds of repute (fitness) to hold a licence, financial standing, concerns about the operator’s arrangements for vehicle maintenance and drivers’ hours’ compliance and the professional competence of the operator.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>WHO SHOULD ATTEND THE PUBLIC INQUIRY?</h3>

<p>If the operator/applicant is a sole trader or partnership (including a limited liability partnership), the owner or partners should attend the inquiry. In the case of a company or LLP, at least one director should attend. If the company or LLP wishes to send a senior representative it should first seek permission from the traffic commissioner and will need to provide written authorisation from the board of directors to represent the company at the inquiry. An inquiry may be adjourned or the case may proceed without the ability to make representations, should this authorisation not be provided.</p>

<p>Failure to attend the inquiry could result in the traffic commissioner determining the case in your absence.</p>

<p>There is no provision to apply for the costs or the expense of attendance at a public inquiry and the traffic commissioner has no power to make any such award.</p>

<p>In the case of an application, it is for the objector/representor to decide whether they wish to attend the public inquiry. The traffic commissioner may attach less, or no weight, to their opposition to the application if the applicant does not have the opportunity to question the basis of the opposition.</p>

<p>Any party to an inquiry can ask that someone represent them at that hearing. This can be a qualified advocate: Counsel (barrister in England and Wales or member of the Faculty of Advocates in Scotland), or a solicitor. Anyone else, including a transport consultant can only speak if the agreement of the traffic commissioner is obtained in advance. There is no duty solicitor present at the inquiry nor is ‘Legal Aid’ available for representation. It is for you to consider whether to seek independent advice as soon as possible after receiving the letter notifying you of the public inquiry. A traffic commissioner is unlikely to accept a request to adjourn the inquiry on the day on the grounds that you now wish to be represented.</p>

<p>If you decide to be represented, you should pass the letter calling you to the inquiry to your representative as soon as possible to allow sufficient time for proper preparation of your case and notify the Office of the Traffic Commissioner.</p>

<p>Before entering any agreement to be represented you should ensure that your proposed representative has a good knowledge of operator licensing legislation and the requirements of the traffic commissioners. These are specialist matters and not all lawyers or consultants will have sufficient experience to represent you effectively. If you are a member of a trade association, they may be able to recommend a representative to you. If you are contacted by someone wishing to represent you, you should try to establish their experience before making any agreement. You might do this by asking for references from previous clients or asking them to explain guidance contained in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/senior-traffic-commissioners-statutory-guidance-and-statutory-directions">Statutory Documents</a> issued by the Senior Traffic Commissioner. The Office of the Traffic Commissioner is unable to make recommendations of representatives, but can confirm factual information, such as whether a particular representative is known to the traffic commissioner and whether they are likely to be approved to represent you at the public inquiry.</p>

<p>Once appointed your representative should familiarise themselves with the facts of the case and the traffic commissioner should be advised in advance of the name of the person who will be attending.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>WHAT HAPPENS IF I CANNOT ATTEND?</h3>

<p>If an operator/applicant and/or transport manager cannot attend on the date given for the public inquiry they can request an adjournment. However, hearings will not usually be adjourned unless there is a good and compelling reason to do so. The traffic commissioner will therefore need to know the reasons why the relevant person cannot attend. Where for instance there is a pre-booked holiday the traffic commissioner may ask for evidence that it was booked before the date of the letter calling that person to the public inquiry. A traffic commissioner is not automatically bound to accept a medical certificate. Requests for adjournments on medical grounds must be supported by medical evidence which states if and why a person cannot attend a hearing. No tribunal is automatically bound by a medical certificate and may use its discretion to disregard a certificate, particularly where;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the certificate states that the party is unfit to work (as opposed to unfit to attend a hearing);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the nature of the ailment, (e.g. a broken arm), does not seem to be capable to prevent attendance at the hearing;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the party is certified as suffering from stress / anxiety / depression and there is no indication of the party recovering within a realistic timetable.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>THE HEARING</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS</h3>

<p>If anyone attending the inquiry has any specific requirements or needs to be taken into account e.g. for religious purposes, wheelchair access, hearing or sight impairment, or if you need an interpreter, please notify the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/traffic-commissioners/about/access-and-opening">Office of the Traffic Commissioner</a> at least two weeks before the date of the inquiry in order that the necessary arrangements can be made.</p>

<p>Traffic commissioners understand that a wide range of conditions may present difficulty for those attending hearings. As well as the obvious visual physical conditions, some people may have conditions that are not obvious, but which may present additional challenges. Attendees at hearings can be assured that any matter raised with staff or the commissioners will be handled in full confidence. All reasonable steps will be taken to accommodate individual needs, but it is important that the Office of the Traffic Commissioner is given suitable notice.</p>

<p>If attendees have particular preferences on how they are addressed, e.g. the use of pronouns, or on any other matter that they consider sensitive, they should raise it with staff either before the day of the hearing or before it commences.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>PROVISION OF DOCUMENTS</h3>

<p>The letter advising operators and transport managers of a hearing will also include specific directions and instructions. These should be complied with in full. It is usual for certain documents to be required to be sent in advance of a hearing. Commonly requested documents relate to vehicle maintenance records and evidence to show compliance with drivers’ hours. It is important that any document or evidence is sent to the relevant Office of the Traffic Commissioner in the time period stated, so that there is sufficient time for it to be properly considered. If documents are not received in accordance with instructions, a traffic commissioner may decide not to take them into account. This could have a negative impact for the operator or transport manager.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>ARRIVAL AT THE VENUE</h3>

<p>Unless instructed otherwise, it is advisable to arrive at the venue at least one hour before the inquiry is due to start and to bring any correspondence informing you of the inquiry together with any case papers that were sent to you with the letter, and photographic identification.</p>

<p>Objectors/representors/complainants should ensure that they have registered their attendance with the Public Inquiry Clerk who will make a note of names of people attending, and of those who want to speak at the Inquiry. Any failure to register could result in losing the opportunity to be heard.</p>

<p>You may be asked to produce photographic identification, such as a passport or driving licence, to confirm your identity. Failure to present the required identification may lead to the traffic commissioner refusing to hear from you. If you are uncertain as to what identification is acceptable you should contact the Office of the Traffic Commissioner for clarification.</p>

<p>The Public Inquiry Clerk will advise you of where to sit and will try to answer any questions that you may have about the proceedings. The actual start time may depend on other cases listed for hearing that day. Please ensure that your mobile phone is switched off before you enter the public inquiry room.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>THE PROCEEDINGS</h3>

<p>These proceedings are formal hearings and persons attending are expected to show respect to others and for the proceedings themselves. The traffic commissioner should be addressed as Sir or Madam, depending on the identified gender or simply as ‘Commissioner’.</p>

<p>Evidence is not given under oath but witnesses are required to tell the truth at all times. Any failure to do so could lead to the traffic commissioner finding that the person is not of good repute or fit to hold a licence or to act as a transport manager. It could also impact on the weight given to that person’s evidence. Furthermore, the giving of false evidence to a traffic commissioner could refer to the matter being referred to the police and criminal charges could follow.</p>

<p>The inquiry is open to members of the public and any other interested parties. The traffic commissioner will consider, on request, whether to hear certain sensitive evidence in private session, e.g. financial information or personal medical information.</p>

<p>After the clerk has announced the case and given brief details, the traffic commissioner will outline the nature of the proceedings to ensure that everyone understands why it is taking place and the procedures to be followed.</p>

<p>Everyone who is entitled to give evidence, make submissions, or make representations will be given the opportunity to speak and to ask relevant questions. It is for the traffic commissioner to determine what is relevant for the purposes of the proceedings. Anyone giving evidence to the inquiry can expect to be asked questions by the applicant/operator, or by a representative acting on their behalf. The traffic commissioner will also put questions to all parties.</p>

<p>When considering an application, the traffic commissioner will have a copy of all valid objections and/or representations. The traffic commissioner may allow additional information to be presented (but that is unlikely to include extra grounds) or for additional documents or photographs to be produced at the inquiry. It is helpful if additional copies of documents can be brought to the hearing since this will avoid having to take up a lot of time passing around the originals.</p>

<p>During the proceedings the traffic commissioner may ask the operator what the effects may be on his/her business if he/she were to take action against the licence. In the case of applications, the traffic commissioner might ask about the potential impact of conditions on the proposed operation.</p>

<p>Finally, the traffic commissioner will consider all the evidence which has been put before him/her.</p>

<p>It may be helpful to prepare some notes in advance, listing the relevant points you wish to raise at the inquiry bearing in mind the factors the traffic commissioner may take into account.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span>RECORDING OF THE INQUIRY</h3>

<p>The proceedings will be recorded so that a transcript can be produced, should one be required. (Normally transcripts are ordered only in cases where there is an appeal against the traffic commissioner’s decision.) Please note that during the inquiry personal information may be recorded and could be put into the public domain unless you ask for this information to be given in private. Any such request may be granted at the discretion of the traffic commissioner.</p>

<p>Please note that any information that you provide to the inquiry may be disclosed to third parties for enforcement purposes.</p>

<p>It is not permitted for any other recording of the proceedings to be made by anyone attending the inquiry.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span>THE DECISION</h3>

<p>The standard of proof in proceedings before a traffic commissioner is the civil standard, (i.e. less than that required for a criminal court case, where the test is ‘beyond all reasonable doubt’). In a public inquiry a traffic commissioner only needs to be satisfied that the case has been proved on the ‘balance of probabilities’, in- otherwords “is it more likely than not” that a particular thing happened.</p>

<p>In most cases interested parties will be informed of the outcome of the inquiry on the day and this will be confirmed in writing within a few days. In some cases, the traffic commissioner might want to consider their decision further, in which case the written decision will be sent to you as soon as possible, usually within 28 days of the traffic commissioner receiving all the relevant information.</p>

<p>All objectors/representors/complainants will receive written confirmation of the decision and a statement of the traffic commissioner’s reasons, if so requested.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.7 </span>APPEALS</h3>

<p>Applicants, operators and statutory objectors have different rights of appeal to the Administrative Appeal Chamber (Transport) of the Upper Tribunal. Details of how to appeal will be set out in the decision letter, which will be sent  out after the inquiry.</p>

<p>Traffic commissioners have discretion to direct that certain decisions, usually relating to suspension or revocation of an operator’s licence, shall not take effect until an appeal is lodged and dealt with by the Upper Tribunal.</p>

<p>An application for a stay should be made at the earliest opportunity but may still be refused. Where a stay is refused the party has a right of appeal to a judge of the Administrative Appeals Chamber of the Upper Tribunal.</p>

<p>A traffic commissioner can only review his/her decision to grant or refuse an application if he/she is satisfied that there has been some procedural irregularity in dealing with it. A request to review the traffic commissioner’s decision must be made as soon as possible and in any event within two months of the date of the traffic commissioner’s original decision. Representors are directed to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://dvsauk.sharepoint.com/sites/TCCO/TC%20Communications/Misc/2019-20%20annual%20report%20tables%20combined%20set.xlsx" rel="external">Guide to making Representations, Objections and Complaints</a></p>

<p>The Upper Tribunal is an independent judicial body, which was set up to hear and determine appeals against decisions of the Traffic Commissioners. Decisions are published on their <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions?tribunal_decision_categories%5B%5D=transport-traffic-commissioner-and-doe-ni-appeals">website</a>. Decisions made before June 2015 can be found at:
<a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.transporttribunal.gov.uk/Aspx/Default.aspx" rel="external">http://www.transporttribunal.gov.uk/Aspx/Default.aspx</a></p>

<p>All traffic commissioners seek to maintain the highest standards of personal and professional conduct. Any complaint that a traffic commissioner has in some way fallen short of these standards is taken seriously. A complaint regarding conduct is quite separate to any appeal to the Upper Tribunal that you may wish to pursue. The publication <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/traffic-commissioners-complaints-protocol-and-bias-guidelines-for-traffic-commissioners">‘Third Party Complaints Protocol For Traffic Commissioners And Deputy Traffic Commissioners’</a> provides further information.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Who are traffic commissioners and what is their role?</h3>

<p>Traffic commissioners are appointed by the Secretary of State for Transport. They are a non-departmental public body, working independently from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport">Department for Transport (DfT)</a> and its Agencies. It is the traffic commissioner who ultimately decides whether to call an applicant, operator, transport manager and/or driver(s) to a hearing. The public inquiry allows the traffic commissioner the opportunity to examine, in a formal setting, the applicant/operator and/or transport manager, and to hear evidence before reaching a decision on whether to grant or refuse an application or to take regulatory action against an existing licence. Traffic commissioners are specialist independent regulators who act in a judicial capacity when conducting a public inquiry. That means that they have to ensure that, like any other tribunal in Great Britain, the proceedings are fair and free from interference or bias.</p>

<p>More information about what the traffic commissioners do is available do from their website at:</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/traffic-commissioners/about">https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/traffic-commissioners/about</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>How will the traffic commissioner consider finance?</h3>

<p>The letter calling an operator to a public inquiry will advise whether the traffic commissioner is considering availability of finance against the level of resources which an operator or applicant is expected to demonstrate.</p>

<p>When considering this issue, the traffic commissioner will seek answers to three key questions, which were identified by the Transport Tribunal in appeal 1992/D41 J J Adam (Haulage) Ltd. These questions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How much money can the operator find if the need arises?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How quickly can they find it?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where will it come from?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The traffic commissioner will consider finance to be available if you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>money in the bank which is capable of being used (i.e. it is not already needed for the payment of debts in the ordinary course of the business), or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an overdraft at your disposal in the sense that there is a balance undrawn before the limit is reached, or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you have debts which are obtainable because they are due and likely to be easy to collect or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have assets from which money is easy to get in the sense that the assets are items which can be readily sold without any adverse effect on the ability of the business to generate money,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>or you have some other way in which to come up with money at fairly short notice.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to note that a licence holder must be able to demonstrate that adequate finance is available continually during the life of a licence. It is not sufficient to demonstrate adequate finance on the day of the inquiry through short term solutions e.g. temporary loans that are to be repaid in the near future.</p>

<p>A list of the types of evidence which might be relied upon can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/senior-traffic-commissioners-statutory-guidance-and-statutory-directions">statutory guidance</a> issued by the Senior Traffic Commissioner. You are strongly advised to read that guidance and to seek independent advice if you do not understand the requirements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>What is meant by good repute or fitness to hold a licence?</h3>

<p>All holders of a standard operator’s licence, a restricted PSV licence and transport managers must be of good repute. All holders of a restricted goods licence must be fit to hold a licence.</p>

<p>When considering good repute and fitness the traffic commissioner may take into account the operator or applicant’s conduct as well as any relevant convictions or any other information which appears to relate to the licence holder’s fitness to meet the licence obligations and a transport manager’s ability to act as a transport manager on a standard licence.</p>

<p>The relevant convictions are stated in legislation. Convictions for road transport offences and other serious offences may result in a mandatory loss of repute.</p>

<p>The letter calling you to the public inquiry will advise what evidence the traffic commissioner is considering and if you have any questions relating to this you should contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/traffic-commissioners/about/access-and-opening">Office of the Traffic Commissioner</a> for advice.</p>

<p>Further detail on good repute and fitness can be found in the statutory guidance and directions issued by the Senior Traffic Commissioner that can be found at: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/traffic-commissioners-good-repute-and-fitness-march-2019">Traffic commissioners: good repute and fitness - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>How can I determine whether a transport manager is internal or external?</h3>

<p>A transport manager must also have a genuine link to the operator. The application and other forms require a declaration to be made that an internal transport manager has that genuine link. For an ‘Internal’ transport manager that might be demonstrated if the transport manager is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the licence holder; or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>one of the partners whose name is on the licence; or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is a director of the company in whose name the licence is held; or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a full or part-time employee.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The traffic commissioner can check this at any time during the application process or during the life of the licence and as against previous declarations by requesting proof of employment, such as a contract.   Employment might be demonstrated in a number of ways, starting with tax and employee contributions. In general, an employee (internal) is normally part of the employer’s organisation and does their work as an integral part of the business whereas an independent contractor (external) is not usually integrated into the organisation but is an accessory to it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span>What is professional competence?</h3>

<p>Professional Competence is usually demonstrated by producing of a certificate (CPC) which meets the requirements set out in the legislation. Some people are exempt from the requirement through qualifications gained or by holding an Acquired Rights certificate issued by the Secretary of State to those people who demonstrated they had ‘continuously managed’ a road haulage or a road passenger transport operation in the UK or one or more EU Member States for the period of 10 years ending 4 December 2009. New Acquired Rights certificates for heavy goods vehicles are no longer available and alternative qualifications would be required in order to carry out the role of a transport manager.</p>

<p>Changes to the operator licensing system to bring into the licensing scheme vehicles (or combinations) over 2.5 tonnes and up to 3.5 tonnes that are engaged in hire or reward operations into the EU, has led to the reintroduction of ‘Acquired Rights’ certificates for this type of operation only. It is intended that these will be limited to a three-year period to allow people to obtain the full qualification. These certificates will not exempt people managing a heavy goods vehicle fleet. This legislation is not yet in force.</p>

<p>The holder of a certificate of professional competence is deemed to possess knowledge corresponding to the level set out in the legislation unless found otherwise by a traffic commissioner. It is not possible to list all of the duties which
a transport manager might be expected to undertake, although the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/senior-traffic-commissioners-statutory-guidance-and-statutory-directions">Statutory Guidance and Statutory Directions</a> may assist.</p>

<p>Various functions might be carried out by different teams or divisions within a business, but the transport manager retains ultimate responsibility for discharging the statutory duty. If a traffic commissioner finds otherwise, then the traffic commissioner can order that transport manager to undertake rehabilitative measures which include the re-sitting of the qualification examination to obtain a Certificate of Professional Competence.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span>What is an ‘environmental’ public inquiry?</h3>

<p>This is short-hand for a public inquiry to determine the suitability of an operating centre for a HGV vehicle operator’s licence. It is just one of a number of matters which the traffic commissioner has to consider when deciding on the application. Owners and occupiers of property near the proposed operating centre who believe that their use or enjoyment of their own property would be prejudicially affected can make representations on environmental grounds only. Those representations have to comply with a number of conditions required by law that ensure the proceedings are fair before they can be treated as valid.</p>

<p>The traffic commissioner can take into account:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the nature or use of any other land in the vicinity of the operating centre and the effect which the issue of the licence would be likely to have on the environment;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the site has been used as an operating centre before, the extent to which the grant of the application would result in a change which would adversely affect the environment of its vicinity;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if it has not been used as an operating centre before, any information known to him/her about planning permission relating to the operating centre or other land in the vicinity of the operating centre;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the number, type and size of authorised motor vehicles and trailers;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the arrangements, or proposed arrangements, for the parking of motor vehicles or trailers;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the nature and the times of use of the land as an operating centre;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the nature and times of use of equipment installed (or proposed to be installed) at the operating centre in connection with its use as an operating centre;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the means by which, and frequency of, vehicles authorised by the licence entering and leaving the operating centre.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Generally speaking the traffic commissioner may consider the effects of: Noise – from the applicant’s vehicles moving in and out of, and while at, the operating centre; Visual Intrusion – the effect the parking of vehicles at the operating centre may have on the outlook from a representor’s property or land; Vibration – the effect vehicle movements may have, either at the operating centre or on their way in or out of the operating centre; Fumes/Pollution – the effect of fumes from the applicant’s vehicles on the use or enjoyment of property.</p>

<p>The traffic commissioner can grant or refuse the application in full or in part and can impose environmental and/or road safety conditions, but there are limits to his/her jurisdiction. The traffic commissioner can only impose conditions on the use of an operating centre in respect of the applicant and cannot place restrictions on any vehicles which are visiting the site or are using it for other purposes. The public inquiry is quite separate from any that the highway, planning or local authorities might conduct. The use of the premises for other purposes is the responsibility of the local planning authority. Concerns regarding the public highway leading to the operating centre or the surrounding road network are matters for highway authorities.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.7 </span>What happens if I do not meet the statutory requirements?</h3>

<p>A public inquiry is not a criminal court and so the traffic commissioner will be concerned with the position of the operator at the date of the public inquiry. One way of showing that you meet the conditions/undertakings on an existing licence is to bring the records requested in the letter calling you to public inquiry to the hearing. Simply put if the traffic commissioner finds that the requirements are not met then he/she may refuse an application and/or take action against the licence or your repute/professional competence as a transport manager.</p>

<p>However, the legislation does allow the holder of a standard licence (but not applicants) to ask the traffic commissioner for a period of time (‘period of grace’) to rectify the situation. The traffic commissioner is not obliged to grant a period of grace. The maximum periods allowed under the legislation are as follows:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Shortcoming</td>
      <td>Maximum Period of Grace</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Transport Manager, Departure from employment</td>
      <td>6 months</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Transport Manager, Death or physical incapacity</td>
      <td>6 + 3 months</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Effective &amp; Stable Establishment</td>
      <td>6 months</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Financial Standing</td>
      <td>6 months to demonstrate that the requirement will be met on a permanent basis</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
