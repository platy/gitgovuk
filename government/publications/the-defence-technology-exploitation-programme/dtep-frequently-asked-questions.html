<h4>Q. What support will be available for innovators?</h4>
<p>A. We strongly advise you initially contact your regional innovation partner (via the website). The Innovation Partners are located throughout the UK and are available to help you understand opportunities across the Defence and Security community. A DASA Business Relationship Manager will be available to give you guidance on forming an effective consortium as well as working with you throughout the submission process.</p>

<h4>Q. Is DTEP open to the participation of non-UK entities as collaboration partners?</h4>
<p>A. Suppliers may collaborate and sub-contract with other SMEs, Research and Technology Organisations (RTO’s) or Academia. Given DTEP’s objective to help the UK expand its competitive, pioneering and world-class defence and security industries, collaborators must also be UK-registered and must carry out project development activity in the UK.</p>

<h4>Q. How long do you anticipate the application process to be from launch to first decision release?</h4>
<p>A. Assuming we receive submissions into both the first outline and full submission cycles, we hope to release the decisions (which will be subject to review and credit check by Innovate) to the first round of applicants in March 2023.</p>

<h4>Q. What will the submission process be?</h4>
<p>A. Please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-defence-technology-exploitation-programme/guidance-document-the-defence-technology-exploitation-programme-dtep?preview=6792768">guidance document</a> for full details</p>

<h4>Q. How can I go about seeking a Higher Tier supplier to partner with?</h4>
<p>A. We anticipate that the majority of collaborations would be formed through existing contacts, networks and associations. However, you may also receive support in the following ways: 1) via&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-a-dasa-innovation-partner">DASA’s Regional Innovation Partner</a>&nbsp;Contacts,&nbsp;2) by utilising Industry Bodies such as ADS, TechUK, Make UK, TDI info and others, 3) via the new&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/introducing-the-ideas-marketplace">DASA Ideas Marketplace</a>.</p>

<h4>Q. Can I work with a Higher Tier supplier I’m already working with?</h4>
<p>A. Yes, provided both parties meet the definitions set out in the guidance.</p>

<h4>Q. What is the difference between project cost, grant funding and Higher Tier contribution? How does this add up?</h4>
<p>A. Example breakdown of a £1,000,000 project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lower Tier supplier submits proposal and requests grant funding (at 50% of project value) = £500,000</li>
  <li>Lower Tier supplier raises remaining funds (at 50% of project value) = £500,000</li>
  <li>Higher Tier supplier provides own resources<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> totalling a minimum of 15% of the grant value (these are non-eligible project costs, but equivalent value of £75,000).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Q. Can Higher Tier suppliers provide the matching 50% of total project expenditure?</h4>
<p>A. No. Only the Lower Tier supplier in a DTEP project is eligible to receive grant funding, and must therefore demonstrate the financial resources to cover the remainder of the total project costs. The Higher Tier supplier must provide non-financial support through their own resources, totalling a minimum of 15% of the grant value.</p>

<h4>Q. Does the submission have to be linked to the Capability Areas?</h4>
<p>A. Yes. Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1093678/MOD_Enduring_Capability_Challenges.pdf" rel="external">this document</a> for further information.</p>

<h4>Q. Does the funding qualify against State Aid?</h4>
<p>A. Yes, in Northern Ireland and for Subsidy control in the rest of the UK.</p>

<h4>Q. What is really in it for the Higher Tier?</h4>
<p>A. Higher Tier suppliers have early access to new technology, material or novel processes, delivering novel solutions. They are able to collaboration with an SME to undertake R&amp;D that does not have to sit on their on balance sheet (IRAD) and are able to access knowledge and skills to their benefit that may otherwise have been difficult to source. They will be better able to meet the end user and customer requirements by pulling upon a wider pool of expertise, knowledge and technology.</p>

<h4>Q. Can a business unit within a larger (non SME) organisation bid as a Lower Tier provided they are a separate legal entity?</h4>
<p>A. No. This sort of organisation would likely fail at the Grant stage. The ultimate beneficial owner of such an entity is a large company, and would thus cannot be eligible for grants for SMEs.</p>

<h4>Q. When is the Ideas Market Place launching?</h4>
<p>A. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/introducing-the-ideas-marketplace">DASA Ideas Marketplace</a> is now live. Find out more here. This is a new platform which will become more beneficial as the number of users increases.</p>

<h4>Q. Can I resubmit an idea I’ve previously proposed to DASA?</h4>
<p>A. Yes, as long as you’ve met the criteria of DTEP, as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-defence-technology-exploitation-programme/guidance-document-the-defence-technology-exploitation-programme-dtep?preview=6792768">guidance</a>.</p>

<h4>Q. What happens if the project fails? Will I have to repay the grant?</h4>
<p>A. No assuming that the grant <a class="govuk-link" href="https://apply-for-innovation-funding.service.gov.uk/info/terms-and-conditions" rel="external">terms and conditions</a> have been met.</p>

<h4>Q. Which organisations do assessors work for and how is our IP protected during assessment?</h4>
<p>A. There will be suitable non-disclosure agreements in place as required to protect your IP.</p>

<h4>Q. Is is possible to submit more than one proposal in parallel?</h4>
<p>A. Yes, although the capacity of an SME to support more than one project at once would be part of the assessment process for whether to award more than one grant to a single organisation. We anticipate Higher Tier partners might be able to support multiple projects, but they wouldn’t receive the grant funding.</p>

<h4>Q. How can I make sure my IP is protected when working with the Higher Tier partner?</h4>
<p>A. As with any commercial and technical discussion, both the parties should follow standard business practice and process. The Business Relationship Manager can support the consortium in these areas.</p>

<h4>Q. Where can I get advice about whether my idea fits into the capability areas?</h4>
<p>A. We strongly recommend you contact your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-a-dasa-innovation-partner">regional Innovation Partner</a> to discuss the alignment of your idea to the capability areas.</p>

<h4>Q. How long will DTEP run for?</h4>
<p>Initially until March 2025, with future years pending the spending review.</p>
