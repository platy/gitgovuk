<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Defence and Security Accelerator (DASA) supported by Innovate UK has launched a new opportunity to apply for grant funding: The Defence Technology Exploitation Programme (DTEP). This £16M programme, running initially for 3 years, is owned by MOD’s Directorate of Industrial Strategy and Exports (DISE) and was announced in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/defence-and-security-industrial-strategy">Defence and Security Industrial Strategy</a> (DSIS) in March 2021.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>What is the Defence Technology Exploitation Programme?</h3>

<p>DTEP is designed to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across the UK to develop innovative materials, technologies and processes, and to enhance defence supply chains. DTEP was announced as part of the Defence and Security Industrial Strategy (DSIS) which laid out plans to drive innovation and improvements in productivity and efficiency, and to accelerate the development of next-generation technologies; ensuring the UK expands its competitive, pioneering and world-class defence and security industries.</p>

<p>DTEP aims to inspire companies to win new business, develop industrial capabilities, and provide new cutting-edge answers to defence problems at home and abroad. The programme will offer up to 50% grant funding to collaborations between UK-registered Lower Tier Suppliers and Higher Tier Suppliers (see definitions in <a class="govuk-link" href="#Lower-Tier-Supplier">section 2.1</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Higher-Tier-Supplier">section 2.2</a>, developing projects which support the current and upcoming equipment capabilities and technology priorities of the Ministry of Defence (MOD). The maximum total allowable value of each DTEP project is £1M (therefore, the maximum grant award is £500K).</p>

<p>The grant awards will be provided by Innovate UK. It should be noted that for this programme, you will be asked to agree to the Innovate UK Terms and Conditions, which can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://apply-for-innovation-funding.service.gov.uk/info/terms-and-conditions" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<p>DTEP aims to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>strengthen the technology development capabilities of UK defence supply chain companies</li>
  <li>create / sustain high value jobs in the UK defence supply chain</li>
  <li>enable the development of technologies in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-defence-capability-framework">MOD Enduring Capability Challenges</a> (<a class="govuk-link" href="#section-3">see section 3</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>What are the benefits of applying to DTEP?</h3>

<p>DTEP will give you the opportunity to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>deliver new technology, materials or processes into the UK defence supply chain</li>
  <li>create new cutting-edge supply chain collaborations that align to the MOD Enduring Capability Challenges</li>
  <li>develop the industrial capabilities of your SME</li>
  <li>scale up and supply to defence</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>What are the core criteria?</h3>

<p>Before considering entering into the DTEP submission process, you must ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are based in the UK and plan to deliver your project in the UK</li>
  <li>you intend to partner with a UK-registered Higher Tier Supplier (as defined in <a class="govuk-link" href="#Higher-Tier-Supplier">section 2.2</a>) at the point of submission and for the duration of the project</li>
  <li>your project has a strong alignment with at least one of the given MOD Enduring Capability Challenges (as detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-3">section 3</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>How do I apply and what support is available?</h3>
<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/157784/DTEP_Process.jpg"></div></figure>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Identify: Define a project that would deliver a benefit to the defence supply chain by delivering new processes, materials or technology. You are strongly encouraged to discuss with your regional DASA Innovation Partner and identify a Higher Tier Supplier to form a consortium. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-a-dasa-innovation-partner">DASA Innovation Partners</a> are located throughout the UK and are available to help you understand opportunities across the Defence and Security community. A DASA Business Relationship Manager will be available to give you guidance on forming an effective consortium as well as working with you throughout the submission process. The DASA Business Relationship Manager’s role is to support the formation of supply chain consortia for appropriate development projects, and to help you to understand the mechanics and dynamics of the programme.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Review: Fill out a DTEP outline proposal. The project will be reviewed by an Industry Project Review Panel which will include experts from industry, across a range of defence organisations and representing a wide range of UK regions where possible. The Panel will review your outline proposal for innovation, alignment to the MOD Enduring Capability Challenges (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-3">section 3</a>), and commercialisation potential. At this stage, you will receive feedback from the Panel via a DASA Business Relationship Manager, which will help you develop the proposal. The DASA Business Relationship Manager will also provide guidance on collaboration agreements and intellectual property protection.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pitch: Complete a DASA DTEP full proposal utilising feedback. Present your project to a final Industry Project Review Panel (Dragons’ Den style) and receive feedback from your DASA Business Relationship Manager. As in step 2, the panel will be comprised of experts from industry and will again review your presentation for innovation, alignment to the MOD Enduring Capability Challenges and commercialisation potential.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assessment: Your proposal and feedback from the Industry Project Review Panel will then be passed to MOD assessors, who  will assess your proposal for its alignment to the MOD Enduring Capability Challenges and against the criteria detailed in section 5, <a class="govuk-link" href="#mandatory-criteria">here</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#assessment">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Award: If your project is recommended for funding, you will be asked to complete a form through Innovate UK’s Innovation Funding Service. Innovate UK will award a grant subject to a successful credit check. The project can then be started with the Higher Tier Supplier and any other consortium partners (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Lower-Tier-Supplier">section 2.1</a>). The DASA Business Relationship Manager will support you during the delivery of the project. Innovate UK will assign you a Monitoring Officer who will monitor your progress throughout the project. Your Monitoring Officer is your first point of contact for official notifications, queries and correspondence with Innovate UK.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Further detail for each of these technical areas of interest can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1093678/MOD_Enduring_Capability_Challenges.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>We are interested in…</h3>

<p>Your proposal should include evidence of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>technology, processes or materials that can be pulled into the defence supply chain</li>
  <li>collaboration with a Higher Tier Supplier evidence of potential commercialisation pathway through to strategic supplier</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>We are not interested in…</h3>

<p>We are not interested in proposals that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are low-TRL research</li>
  <li>constitute consultancy, paper-based studies or literature reviews which just summarise the existing literature without any view of future innovation</li>
  <li>offer demonstrations of off-the-shelf products requiring no experimental development (unless applied in a novel way to the challenge)</li>
  <li>offer no real long-term prospect of integration into defence and security capabilities</li>
  <li>offer no real prospect of out-competing existing solutions</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Funding</h2>

<p>DTEP offers companies grant funding of up to 50% of a total project expenditure. There is no lower limit to project cost, however, it is expected that most project totals will be between £100K and £500K. The competition will have a maximum allowable project value of £1M (i.e. maximum grant award of £500K). Projects must plan to start within 6 months of Innovate UK grant award and run for a maximum duration of 18 months.</p>

<p>The Higher Tier Supplier must contribute a minimum of 15% of the grant value (7.5% project value) through their own resources, e.g. staff time, equipment, facilities, expertise etc. This in addition to (not part of) the total project value. This should be detailed within the full proposal.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Process</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Defining your project</h3>

<p>The first step is to consider the scope of your innovation, what you intend to achieve through the project and its alignment with one of the MOD Enduring Capability Challenges. Make sure that you have read the full detail of the identified capability <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1093678/MOD_Enduring_Capability_Challenges.pdf">here</a>. We strongly recommend that you then contact your regional DASA Innovation Partner by submitting a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-a-dasa-innovation-partner">contact form</a>. Your DASA Innovation Partner can give guidance on the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strength of the alignment to the MOD Enduring Capability Challenges.</li>
  <li>Collaboration with a Higher Tier partner.</li>
  <li>Overall suitability to enter DTEP at this time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Form a consortium</h3>

<p>A collaboration could form in a number of ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An existing work relationship or your own current networks. We would anticipate that the majority of collaborations would form in this way.</li>
  <li>Through guidance from your regional DASA Innovation Partner, who may have suitable contacts.</li>
  <li>At future DASA collaboration events.</li>
  <li>By signing up to the new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/introducing-the-ideas-marketplace">DASA Idea’s Marketplace</a>. Use of keywords and the search function could help you find a consortium partner.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have a Higher Tier Supplier identified, your regional DASA Innovation Partner, along with a DASA Business Relationship Manager, will look at your readiness to enter DTEP. They will work with you to understand your readiness to engage with the Higher Tier Supplier. Some points for consideration at this juncture will include (but not be limited to):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your current level of intellectual property protection.</li>
  <li>What you have already registered or not registered.</li>
  <li>How familiar you are with handling issues of confidentiality (e.g. use of non-disclosure agreements).</li>
  <li>How best to share proprietary information.</li>
  <li>To what extent you have previously collaborated.</li>
  <li>Who you have collaborated with.</li>
  <li>Knowledge of collaboration agreements.</li>
  <li>Possible future commercial relationship arrangements.</li>
</ul>

<p>The outcome of this discussion will be the provision of guidance and tools to suit your needs in order to prepare you for the outline submission process.</p>

<p>The DASA Business Relationship Manager will be able to offer further guidance in forming the consortium, including appropriate collaboration agreements and protection of intellectual property.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Outline submission</h3>

<p>Having identified the remit of your project and formed a consortium with a Higher Tier Supplier you are eligible to enter the first submission stage: the outline proposal. Submissions will be received via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/defence-and-security-accelerator-submit-your-research-proposal">DASA Online Submission Service</a> for which you will be required to register. Only proposals submitted through the DASA Online Submission Service will be accepted. The DTEP outline proposal option can be found under the “DASA Innovation Outline” service category once you have logged in and clicked the “Start now” button.</p>

<p>Submissions are accepted throughout the year with close dates for review set every three months.</p>

<p>The outline proposal form will ask you for the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Project summary, what you hope you hope to achieve and alignment to MOD Enduring Capability Challenges, route to commercialisation and benefit to the defence supply chain.</li>
  <li>An overview of your collaboration with a Higher Tier Supplier.</li>
</ul>

<p>The DASA Business Relationship Manager will be able to give you guidance in completing this form.</p>

<p>The outline submission will be reviewed by an initial Industry Project Review Panel. Your submission will be shared in full with the Panel who will have non-disclosure agreements in place to protect your intellectual property and ensure there are no conflicts of interest.</p>

<p>Please note that by submitting your outline proposal, you are agreeing to the information sharing detailed above.</p>

<p>The panel will review the outline proposal to ensure that it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is innovative</li>
  <li>aligns with one of the MOD Enduring Capability Challenges and therefore addresses a defence need</li>
  <li>has a viable route to market</li>
</ul>

<p>You will receive feedback following this review. This will be released to you and the DASA Business Relationship Manager will discuss it with you. If you are successful at this stage, you will be invited to move on to the next submission stage.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Full submission</h3>

<p>Once you have received approval of your outline proposal following the panel review, you will be eligible to complete the full submission form. Proposals can be submitted throughout the year, with four assessments scheduled throughout the year. Once you have received approval of your outline proposal you can enter into any of these cycles. You do not need to submit your full proposal for the next closing date. Your DASA Business Relationship Manager will be available to give guidance and advice as you prepare your full DTEP proposal which will be submitted through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/defence-and-security-accelerator-submit-your-research-proposal">DASA Online Submission Service</a>. Only proposals submitted through the DASA Online Submission Service will be accepted.</p>

<p>Please note that by submitting a full proposal, you are agreeing to the Innovate UK terms and conditions that can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://apply-for-innovation-funding.service.gov.uk/info/terms-and-conditions" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Mandatory criteria</h4>

<p>In order for a proposal to be taken forward to full assessment, it must meet the following mandatory criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It must align with one of the five MOD Enduring Capability Challenges.</li>
  <li>It must be&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-terms-and-conditions-and-contract-guidance#what-dasa-funds">Technology</a>, Business or System&nbsp;Readiness&nbsp;Levels 3&nbsp;to&nbsp;7.&nbsp;The project should also fit the definition of industrial research, which can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/guidance-for-applicants/general-guidance/categories-of-research-and-development/" rel="external">here</a>. It must comprise a supply chain technology consortium of at least two entities, one of which is a Lower Tier Supplier (and will submit the proposal), one of which is a Higher Tier Supplier (as defined in <a class="govuk-link" href="#Lower-Tier-Supplier">section 2.1</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Higher-Tier-Supplier">section 2.2</a>).</li>
  <li>Both Lower and Higher Tier Suppliers must be based in the UK, intending to carry out project work in the UK and intending to exploit the results from or in the UK.</li>
  <li>The project must have a total project value which doesn’t exceed £1M (maximum grant value of £500K).</li>
  <li>The Higher Tier Supplier must contribute a minimum of 15% of the grant value (7.5% of the project value) through their own resources, e.g. staff time, equipment, facilities, expertise etc. This in addition to (not part of) the total project value.)</li>
  <li>The proposal must demonstrate a viable route to market.</li>
  <li>The proposal must have a maximum project duration of 18 months. There is no lower limit to project duration, but we would typically expect to fund projects lasting upwards of 12 months.</li>
  <li>Projects must plan to start within 6 months of grant award date.</li>
  <li>The proposal identifies the need (or not) for MOD Research Ethics Committee (MODREC) approval (<a class="govuk-link" href="#MODREC">see below</a>).</li>
  <li>The Lower Tier Supplier has done all the following (<a class="govuk-link" href="#CRA">see below</a>): submitted a Supplier Assurance Questionnaire (SAQ) number; attached the email from the Defence Cyber Protection Partnership (DCPP); attached the submitted SAQ form.</li>
</ul>

<h4>What is required for the full submission</h4>

<ul>
  <li>When submitting a proposal, you must complete all sections of the online form, including an appropriate level of information to allow assessment of the bid and a completed finances section.</li>
  <li>Completed proposals must comply with the financial rules set for this competition. The upper project value for this competition is £1M (i.e. maximum grant award of £500K) (ex VAT). Proposals will be rejected if the financial cost exceeds this capped level. The Higher Tier Supplier must contribute a minimum of 15% of the grant value (7.5% of the project value) through their own resources, e.g. staff time, equipment, facilities, expertise etc. This in addition to (not part of) the total project value.) Include detail of how this contribution will be made in your proposal.</li>
  <li>You must include a list of other current or recent government funding you may have received in this area if appropriate, making it clear how this proposal differs from this work.</li>
  <li>Your proposal must outline how you will complete all activities/services and provide all deliverables within the competition timescales (maximum of 18 months from the project start). Proposals with any deliverables (including final report) outside of the timeline will be rejected as non-compliant. Please note that you will be asked to provide a detailed project plan and project finances to Innovate UK if you are recommended for funding. At this stage, assessors just need to understand how the project will be structured.</li>
  <li>The proposal must also include a brief (uncosted) outline of the next stages of work required for commercialisation and evidence of routes to commercialisation with Higher Tier Supplier.</li>
</ul>

<p>Within your proposal, you must also demonstrate that the project team:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Has the right mix of skills and experience to complete the project.</li>
  <li>Has a track record in managing research and development projects.</li>
  <li>Has clear objectives and roles or responsibilities.</li>
  <li>Has additional benefits by being part of a consortium.</li>
</ul>

<h4>How to outline your commercialisation plan</h4>
<p>A higher technology, system or business maturity level is expected by completion of the project. Include the following information to help the assessors understand your commercialisation plans to date:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The intended defence customer users of your final product and whether the consortium has previously engaged with them.</li>
  <li>Awareness of, and alignment to, any existing end user procurement programmes.</li>
  <li>The anticipated benefits (for example, in cost, time, improved capability) that the solution will provide to the defence supply chain.</li>
  <li>Whether it is likely to be a standalone product or integrated with other technologies or platforms.</li>
  <li>Expected additional work required beyond the end of the grant to develop an operationally deployable commercial product (for example, “scaling up” for manufacture, cyber security, integration with existing technologies, environmental operating conditions).</li>
</ul>

<p>Long term projects may not be able to articulate commercialisation in great detail, but it should be clear that there is a strong potential to benefit the defence supply chain.</p>

<h4>Ethical/legal/regulatory factors</h4>

<p>You must identify any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-ethical-legal-and-regulatory-guidance">ethical / legal / regulatory factors</a> within your proposal and how the associated risks will be managed, including break points in the project if approvals are not received.<br>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-ethical-legal-and-regulatory-guidance#mod-research-ethics-committee">MODREC</a> approvals can take up to five months and you should plan your work programme accordingly. If you are unsure if your proposal will need to apply for MODREC approval, then please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-ethical-legal-and-regulatory-guidance">MODREC Guidance</a> for Suppliers or contact your DASA Innovation Partner or Business Relationship Manager for further guidance.</p>

<h4>Failure to provide the above listed will automatically render your proposal non-compliant.</h4>

<p>You must take reasonable account of the guidance on trusted research and innovation issued by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cpni.gov.uk/" rel="external">Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure</a></p>

<p>You must also comply with the requirements stated in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-national-security-and-investment-act-alongside-regulatory-requirements">The National Security and Investment (NSI) Act 2020</a></p>

<p>You should be aware in relation to the potential future export of technology and products developed as part of DTEP of the HMG’s guidance on export controls and licencing <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/business-and-industry/export-controls">Export controls and licensing</a>, including <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-strategic-export-control-lists-the-consolidated-list-of-strategic-military-and-dual-use-items">MOD’s guidance around Export controls</a>. If applicable, your DASA Business Relationship Manager will be able to advise further on this.</p>

<h4>Cyber risk assessment</h4>

<h4>Supplier Assurance Questionnaire (SAQ)</h4>
<p>Innovators must complete a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=7WB3vlNZS0iuldChbfoJ5Tv4OR9pb0BHial1Ag-WKXVUOFk3Sk9SS0JDQ0FRWjhYNDhTVldHUDJaNy4u" rel="external">Supplier Assurance Questionnaire (SAQ)</a>, using the DASA Risk Assessment Reference (RAR) for this competition: RAR-804954121 and answer questions for risk level “Very Low”.<br>
DASA has completed a Cyber Risk Assessment (CRA) for this competition. In order to submit to this competition innovators are required to work towards cyber resilience. If selected for funding, the innovator must prove cyber resilience before a grant will be awarded.</p>

<h4>Defence Cyber Protection Partnership</h4>

<p>The Defence Cyber Protection Partnership (DCPP) will review your SAQ submission and respond with a reference number within 2 working days. The completed SAQ form and resulting email response from DCPP must be downloaded and included within the DASA submission service portal when the proposal is submitted. Please allow enough time to receive the SAQ reference number prior to competition close.<br>
If the proposal is being funded, the SAQ will be evaluated against the CRA for the competition, and it will be put it into one of the following categories:</p>

<ol>
  <li>compliant – no further action</li>
  <li>not compliant – if successful in competition and being funded, the innovator will be required to complete a Cyber Implementation Plan (CIP) before the grant is awarded, which will need to be reviewed and agreed with the relevant project manager<br>
Innovators can enter a proposal without all controls in place, but are expected to have all the cyber protection measures necessary to fulfil the requirements of the grant in place at the time of grant award, or have an agreed Cyber Implementation Plan (CIP).<br>
The CIP provides evidence as to how and when potential innovators will achieve compliance. Provided the measures proposed in the CIP do not pose an unacceptable risk to the MOD, a submission with a CIP will be considered alongside those who can achieve the controls. A final check will be made to ensure cyber resilience before the grant is placed. Commercial staff cannot progress without it. This process does not replace any grant specific security requirements.<br>
Further guidance for completing this process can be requested by emailing the DASA Help Centre: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:accelerator@dstl.gov.uk">accelerator@dstl.gov.uk</a>.<br>
Additional information about cyber security can be found at: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dcpp-cyber-security-model-industry-buyer-and-supplier-guide">DCPP: Cyber Security Model industry buyer and supplier guide</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Assessment of the full proposal</h4>

<p>The assessment of full DTEP proposals will happen in three stages.</p>

<ol>
  <li>You will be asked to present your project to the Industry Project Review Panel. As with the outline proposal, suitable non-disclosure agreements will be in place to protect your intellectual property and avoid conflicts of interest. The DASA Business Relationship Manager will be able to give you guidance in order to prepare for this presentation. Panel meetings will be hybrid with an option to attend remotely and further details will be issued on receipt of your full proposal. Dates of these can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="#dates">section 9</a>. You will receive feedback following the presentation.</li>
  <li>Your proposal will be subject to a MOD assessment, using the criteria which can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1093679/DTEP_Assessment_Criteria.pdf">here</a>. Please note that the DTEP assessment criteria varies slightly from the standard DASA assessment criteria. The feedback of the Industry Project Review Panel will be taken into consideration by MOD assessors.</li>
  <li>Following assessment, proposals will be discussed at a MOD decision conference. If your proposal is recommended for funding at the MOD decision conference, Innovate UK will request further details and complete a credit check as detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#grant">section 6</a>. If you are unsuccessful at this stage, you will receive feedback and you will be allowed to resubmit your proposal should you wish.</li>
</ol>
