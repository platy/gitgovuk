<p>Pollinators are a priority for the UK government. We know that bees, and other pollinating insects, are an essential part of our environment and play a crucial role in food production.</p>

<p>Defra works in partnership with many organisations and partners as part of the Pollinator Advisory Steering Group to help our precious pollinators survive and thrive.</p>

<p>Everyone has a part to play, and here is where you can find details of how to get more beautiful butterflies and buzzing bees in your local area.</p>

<h2>Bees’ Needs Week 2022</h2>

<p>Bees’ Needs Week (18 to 24 July) is an annual event coordinated by Defra, working alongside charities, businesses, conservation groups and academic institutions to raise awareness of bees and other pollinators.</p>

<p>This year, we’re working with the University of Reading, Historic Royal Palaces and Pollinating London Together to showcase the importance of pollinators at the amazing Superbloom site at the Tower of London.</p>

<p>We’ll be there on Monday 18 July with some exciting interactive activities. During the rest of the week, Defra and our partners will be sharing information to help you learn more about bees and pollinators, and how to support them.</p>

<p>Defra works with a host of organisations to share ideas, action and activities on the many ways in which everyone can help bees and other pollinators.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5 simple </span> steps</h2>

<p>There’s plenty of information and advice available on what you can do. You can read more about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bumblebeeconservation.org/bees-needs/five-simple-actions/" rel="external">5 Simple Actions that anyone can take to help pollinators</a> which are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Grow more flowers, shrubs and trees.</li>
  <li>Let patches of land grow wild.</li>
  <li>Cut grass less often.</li>
  <li>Do not disturb insect nests and hibernation spots.</li>
  <li>Think carefully about whether to use pesticides.</li>
</ol>

<p>We’d love to have as many people and organisations involved as possible and sharing more. To get involved email us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:beesneeds@defra.gov.uk">beesneeds@defra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>For media enquiries, contact the Defra press office on 020 8225 7318.</p>

<h2>Apply to be a Bees’ Needs champion</h2>

<p>The awards recognise and celebrate examples of exceptional initiatives undertaken by local authorities, community groups, farmers and businesses to support pollinators. In previous years we have given these awards to people and organisations who have taken inspiring action, however big or small, to benefit pollinators.</p>

<p>Whether that’s creating a wildflower patch, educating the local community about pollinators, or taking special measures on your farm.</p>

<p>There are 2 categories:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Local communities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Farming.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Application consent</h2>

<p>By submitting an application you consent to your information being shared with members of the judging panel at Defra, Championing the Farmed Environment (CFE) and Nature Friendly Farming Network (NFFN).</p>

<p>If successful, details of your award will be shared publicly.</p>

<p>By attaching photographs you confirm that you have obtained permission from the photographer for Defra, CFE, NFFN and carefully selected organisations to use the attached images (and any subsequently requested) for all purposes of publication, exhibition, press, television, and website coverage of the Bees’ Needs Awards 2022 to 2023; and in particular, for Defra, CFE and NFFN to make copies, retouches, reductions, and enlargements of them without payment or permission.</p>

<p>As far as you are aware, such action by, or on behalf of Defra, CFE and NFFN will not breach any copyright of the image. Defra, NFU, CFE and NFFN reserve the right not to credit the photographer, though usually every effort is made to do so.</p>

<p>Where people feature prominently in an image, you confirm that the original photographer was given permission to take the photograph (by a parent or guardian if the subject is under 18 years of age) and can supply signed model release forms if necessary to prove this.</p>

<h2>Flow-Insect Timed (FIT) Counts</h2>

<p>This year, you can also get involved with invaluable Citizen Science.</p>

<p>All you need to do is simply spend 10 minutes watching flowers and insects in good weather. FIT Counts can be done anywhere, including gardens and parks in warm, dry weather, any time from April to September.</p>

<p>Every single count helps make our data more meaningful, to help us learn more about where pollinators live and how their numbers are changing.</p>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ukpoms.org.uk/fit-counts" rel="external">instructions for FIT Counts</a> and help us help pollinators!</p>

<h2>National pollinator strategy</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-pollinator-strategy-for-bees-and-other-pollinators-in-england">National pollinator strategy</a> is a 10 year plan published in 2014, developed after a thorough review of the evidence base and wide consultation.</p>

<p>It sets out how government, beekeepers, conservation groups, farmers, researchers, industry and the public can work together to improve the status of pollinating insect species in England.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pollinator-action-plan-2021-to-2024">National Pollinator Strategy Action Plan</a> sets out more specifically how we will act to fulfil the vision, aims and objectives of the Strategy, over the period 2021 to 2024. It details what we will do and how we will monitor progress.</p>

<p>It also reflects the refreshed aims of the strategy, as agreed with the Pollinator Advisory Steering Group as we reach the strategy’s midpoint in 2019 to 2020.</p>
