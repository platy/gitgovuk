<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The National Drugs Control System (NDS) is an online facility designed to allow you to make applications for licences for the import and export of controlled drugs and precursor chemicals. It is also where licence holders can add preparations and overseas trading partners to their accounts. This guide will provide information on how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>register for an NDS account</li>
  <li>set up trading partners and preparations</li>
  <li>apply for import and export licences for controlled drugs and precursor chemicals</li>
  <li>endorse licences online</li>
</ul>

<p>The Drugs and Firearms Licensing (DFLU) are available to provide assistance at any stage of the process, Monday to Friday, between 9am and 5pm. Our email is <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dflu.ie@homeoffice.gov.uk">dflu.ie@homeoffice.gov.uk</a> and our telephone number is 0300 0724654.</p>

<p>Please email us in the first instance or if you require any clarification regarding the content of this document.</p>

<h2>Domestic licence to trade</h2>

<p>Before companies can register for an NDS account they must have a valid United Kingdom Controlled Drug or Precursor Chemicals domestic licence in place, covering the appropriate schedules for the substances they wish to import or export. In most circumstances, a company which handles controlled substances under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 requires a controlled drugs domestic licence. A company which handles precursor chemicals which are controlled under Regulation (EC) No. 273/2004 requires a precursor chemical domestic licence or registration, although this does depend on the chemical, activity and in some cases, quantities.</p>

<h2>How to register for a controlled drug/precursor chemical licence</h2>

<p>New and current licensees who wish to handle controlled substances should first <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/drugs-licensing">visit the drugs licensing website</a>. All requirements, including the costs of registering and the costs of a licence are shown here.</p>

<p>The Domestic Licensing team may be contacted on:</p>

<p>Drugs Domestic Licence â 0300 105 4848</p>

<p>Email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dflu.dom@homeoffice.gov.uk">dflu.dom@homeoffice.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Applying for an NDS account</h2>

<p>The NDS home page may be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://DFLU.homeoffice.gov.uk" rel="external">https://DFLU.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>New users should click the âregister nowâ button on the blue menu bar. This will take you to a User Registration screen.</p>

<p>Complete all the relevant information, the email address that you register to your User Account is where any licences will be sent to.</p>

<p>Please check the âAllowed to Submitâ box if your company permits you to submit applications to the Home Office (if you do not select this box, you will only be able prepare draft for a colleague to then submit).</p>

<p>Once you have completed all the data, submit the request and email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dflu.ie@homeoffice.gov.uk">dflu.ie@homeoffice.gov.uk</a> and let the team know you have submitted your request.</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong></p>

<p>Do not apply for an NDS account unless you hold a domestic controlled drug or domestic drug precursor licence.</p>

<p>You will need an account for each site that controlled drugs / drug precursor will be shipped from / to.</p>

<p>The registered email address is where any issued import / export licences will be sent to (please ensure this is accessible to others in the event of your absence). You cannot use the same email address for multiple accounts.</p>

<p>You must notify <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dflu.ie@homeoffice.gov.uk">dflu.ie@homeoffice.gov.uk</a> if you leave a company and / or no longer require an NDS account.</p>

<h3>Logging on for the first time</h3>

<p>Once you have received your login details you will be able to log in to the system for the first time.</p>

<p>Click on âLoginâ and enter your user name and password to access the system.</p>

<p>To change your password:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on âuser settingsâ on the blue menu bar.</li>
  <li>Select âChange Passwordâ and change your password immediately.</li>
</ol>

<p>NDS passwords expire every 60 days, please update your password within this window.</p>

<p>If your password expires you will need to contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dflu.ie@homeoffice.gov.uk">dflu.ie@homeoffice.gov.uk</a>, providing your user name to get this reset. Once this has been reset you have 10 days to change your password.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to ensure your password it kept up to date. If it does expire it takes 48 hours for your account to be reactivated.</p>

<h2>Process for requesting preparations / establishments</h2>

<p>To apply for an import or export licence you will need to have overseas trading establishments (these are referred to as âForeign Trading Establishmentsâ on NDS) and if relevant, preparations (eg finished dose products) added to your account.</p>

<p>If you are shipping âpreparationsâ your licence application needs to match this. You must not select raw materials / pure substances in absence of a preparation in your account. In the case of export applications, this will be apparent from the detail on the import licence e.g. an application to ship raw material against an import licence for finished dose medication will be rejected.</p>

<p>Email your request to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dflu.ie@homeoffice.gov.uk">dflu.ie@homeoffice.gov.uk</a>, with the subject <strong>âPreparation requestâ</strong> or <strong>âForeign trading establishmentâ</strong></p>

<h3>For âpreparationsâ requests:</h3>

<p>Provide as much detail as possible, eg product name, dosage, base drug, quantity, format, pack size etc.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Matrifen 50</p>

<p>Fentanyl 5.5mg</p>

<p>5 patches / pack</p>
</div>

<p>If you know what brand you are shipping, it is important to apply for that brand. In some cases, products that have the same dosage / delivery can have different overall base drug quantities per unit, fentanyl patches are an example of this.</p>

<h3>For âforeign trading establishment requests:</h3>

<p>Provide as much detail as possible, eg company name and full address</p>

<p>If your company has multiple sites, please indicate which site this should be added to. This should be indicated as the first line of the site address or town. Do not reference your user account.</p>

<p>If we have it already set up on the wider NDS database we will consider your request and advise you of the outcome. It will take up to 24 hours for any additions to show on your account.</p>

<p>If itâs not set up then we will let you know and ask you to register it on NDS (guidance below). You <strong>must reply by return</strong> with the request ID once youâve created the request. Failure to do that will result in your request being cancelled. We will then consider the request and advise you of the outcome. It will take up to 24 hours for any additions to show on your account.</p>

<h3>Applying for trading partners</h3>

<p>If advised that the trading partner you require does not exist on the system you must register them directly on NDS.</p>

<p>Click âMastersâ on the blue menu bar</p>

<p>Select âRegister foreign establishmentâ</p>

<p><strong>Foreign establishment:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the country from the drop down menu</li>
  <li>Fill out the name of the establishment</li>
  <li>Fill out the address details (for long addresses, you can add more information in the âstreet name lineâ using a comma to separate each line).</li>
  <li>Please ensure the postcode / zip code is entered into the âzip codeâ section and not in any other sections.</li>
  <li>Please ensure something is entered into the âcityâ and âstateâ sections.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can either save as a draft if you need to check something and come back to it later or submit the request.</p>

<p>Once you have submitted the request, reply on the email thread where the Import / Export team have authorised you to register the âForeign Trading Establishmentâ and advise the team of the request ID. We will consider your request and advise you of the outcome. It will take up to 24 hours for any additions to show on your account.</p>

<h3>Applying for a preparation</h3>

<p>If advised that the preparations of drugs that you intend to trade in does not exist on the system, you will need to request through NDS. All substances are available already, but an application will not be granted if you do not have the correct domestic licence for the selected substance.</p>

<p>Select âMastersâ from the blue menu bar</p>

<p>Click on âRegister preparationâ</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Preparation Type: select the format of the product eg tablets, capsules, ampoules etc.</li>
  <li>Preparation Name: Enter the name of the product, this can be a brand name or generic (it must not reference the quantity/pack in the case of tablets / caps / injections / ampoules etc, however liquids in bottles should reference the total content in ml.</li>
  <li>UOM: how the preparation is packaged eg packs, bottles, barrels.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Controlled substance:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Substance Name: enter the base drug.</li>
  <li>Qty / Volume: this should be in grams (NB this should be per dose, with the exception of any bottles which should represent the total amount in the bottle).</li>
  <li>Click âInsertâ to add the record.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Package size:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Enter the number of doses per Unit of Measurement (with the exception of liquids in bottles which should always be â1â).</li>
  <li>It is not essential to add an EAN code.</li>
</ol>

<p>Submit the request (or save it as draft if necessary).</p>

<p>Once you have submitted the request, reply on the email thread where the Import / Export team have authorised you to register the âPreparationâ and advise the team of the request ID. We will consider your request and advise you of the outcome. It will take up to 24 hours for any additions to show on your account.</p>

<p>This information must be recorded accurately as this is the information that will appear on your licence.</p>

<p>If we have to cancel any applications, we will provide you with the reason.</p>

<h2>Applying for an export licence for controlled drugs</h2>

<p>Before starting your licence application please ensure that you have already have the foreign trading establishment / preparation you require in your account.</p>

<p>General Notes: select whether the substances are for domestic use or for re-export in the country you are exporting to (you cannot submit a request for products that are for domestics use and for re-export on the same licence, they must be split across 2 licences). It is important to record this accurately as substances that are for re-export do not come off a countryâs estimates.</p>

<p>Attachments: you must attach an import permit or letter of no objection (LONO) from the relevant Competent National Authority to your export application.</p>

<p><strong>Exporter details:</strong></p>

<p>This will be pre-populated with your licensed site details.</p>

<p><strong>Substance / prep name:</strong></p>

<p>Click âadd new recordâ and then select the raw material / API substance or finish dose preparation you are shipping from the drop down menu (please note that only the preparations you have in your account will be visible).

<p>You can go back in and edit any of these details whilst the licence application is in draft mode. You will not be able to change any details once the licence has been submitted</p>

<p><strong>User comments:</strong></p>

<p>You can add any supporting comments or statements here that are relevant to the application. These will not appear on the licence.</p>

<h3>Final steps</h3>

<p>You can save your licence application by clicking the âsave as draftâ button and access it later â this is useful if you need to check any information before submitting the licence.</p>

<p>Once you are satisfied that your application is complete you can click the âSubmit Requestâ button. You can check the status of your request by clicking âImport / Exportâ from the blue tool bar at the top of the main NDS screen and then selecting âImport / Export Requestsâ from the drop down menu.

If you then need to cancel a licence please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dflu.ie@homeoffice.gov.uk">dflu.ie@homeoffice.gov.uk</a> with the web ID and a member of the team can cancel it for you. Once a licence is âIn Reviewâ or âApprovedâ, it cannot be cancelled and the licence fee will be charged.</p>

<h2>Applying for an import licence for controlled drugs</h2>

<p>This process for applying for an import licence is very similar to applying for an export licence.</p>

<p>Before starting your licence application please ensure that you have already have the foreign trading establishment / preparation you require in your account.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select âImport / Exportâ from the blue menu bar.</li>
  <li>Select âImport / Exportâ requests from the drop down menu which will take you into a new screen.</li>
  <li>Select âCreate Imp / Exp Requestâ button.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Request type:</strong></p>

<p>From the drop down menu select âimport controlled drugsâ</p>

<p><strong>General information:</strong></p>

<p>Type of Permit: select either âsingle productâ or âmultiple productsâ (you can add up to 4 lines on each licence.</p>

<p>General Notes: select whether the substances are for domestic use or for re-export from the UK (you cannot submit a request for products that are for domestics use and for re-export on the same licence, they must be split across 2 licences). It is important to record this accurately as substances that are for re-export do not come off the UK estimates.</p>

<p>Attachments: you will generally not need to attach any documentation to an import licence application, exceptions to these are MHRA notifications for CPBM imports.</p>

<p><strong>Importer details:</strong></p>

<p>This will be pre-populated with your licensed site details</p>

<p><strong>Exporter details:</strong></p>

<p>Country: select the country you are importing from.</p>

<p>CA Department: select the CA from the drop down or leave this blank.</p>

<p><strong>Shipment details:</strong></p>

<p>Itinerary: If you have this information please enter if here, if not, leave it blank.</p>

<p>Notes: any comments you add here will be added to the licence, if these are deemed irrelevant or provide conflicting information to substances being shipped, these will be deleted.</p>

<p><strong>Substance / prep name:</strong></p>

<p>Click âadd new recordâ and then select the raw material / API substance or finish dose preparation you are shipping from the drop down menu (please note that only the preparations you have in your account will be visible).

Please note that once a licence is âIn Reviewâ or âApprovedâ, it cannot be cancelled and the licence fee will be charged.</p>

<h2>Applying for an import permit for precursor chemicals</h2>

<p>Import licenses are only required for Category 1 precursor chemicals.</p>

<p>The process for applying for an import licence for precursor chemicals is again largely similar to applying for a controlled drugs import licence.</p>

<p>Applications <strong>must</strong> be made either by the named Responsible Officer or Guarantor, both of whom should have NDS accounts. Where any licence is requested on their behalf, notes must be added in the âuser commentsâ section to confirm they are aware of application.</p>

<p>You must attach a copy of your Category 1 Precursor Chemical domestic licence to the application as well as a completed âImport PC Questionnaire &amp; Checklistâ document (you can obtain a copy of this from <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dflu.ie@homeoffice.gov.uk">dflu.ie@homeoffice.gov.uk</a>).</p>

<p>Please include	information	on	the	ultimate	consignee,	broker,	carrier	and manufacturer, if known, as it will aid our processing of the application.</p>

<h2>Applying for an export licence for precursor chemicals</h2>

<p>The process for applying for an export licence for precursor chemicals is again largely similar to applying for an export licence for controlled drugs. However, the process will take longer as DFLU need to obtain consent from the Competent Authority of the importing country.</p>

<p>This is known as âpre-export notificationâ (PEN) and takes 17 working days. Once this time has passed and provided there are no objections from the importing country, the licence will be granted. We undertake all PEN actions for you, you do not need to do anything additional other than apply for a licence on NDS and factor in timings in your export planning.</p>

<p>Overall you should allow 20 working days for an Export PC licence application to be considered (this allows for time to review the application, input the proposed export onto PEN, the clearance time, and if approved by the overseas competent national authority, the licence issue). Any queries can significantly add to this time so please provide all the required information.</p>

<p><strong>Please note the following:</strong></p>

<p>You must attach the corresponding import licence and/or make reference to it in the âImport Authorisation Documentâ section. Some countries do not issue individual import licences for each shipment of precursor chemicals and instead issue an annual âblanketâ licence. Ultimately, it is your responsibility to obtain as much information as you can from the importer as queries from overseas Competent National Authorities (CNA) through the PEN system can significantly add to the lead-time for export licences. In some cases where not enough information is provided, overseas CNAâs will object to the shipment on PEN and the process will need to be restarted with a fresh application on NDS.</p>

<p>You must attach a copy of your domestic precursor chemical licence to the application.</p>

<h2>Endorsing licences</h2>

<p>Part of your obligations as a holder of a domestic licence for controlled drugs or precursor chemicals is endorsing the quantity of goods shipped on each licence. The Home Office, as the United Kingdom Competent Authority, is a signatory to the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances 1971, and, the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988. Through these, the UK is allocated an agreed yearly limit (the âestimate <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>â) for controlled drugs and precursor chemicals that can be imported. The same process is applied globally, so when exporting we have regard to the âestimatesâ for the receiving country in our considerations.</p>

<p>As such, you are required to upload the endorsement immediately after the shipment has been sent/received or on the expiry date of the licence, if it is not used. This is a condition of all licenses issued.</p>

<p>Timely endorsement of licences maintains the integrity of the estimate system for all licencees, allows DFLU to process licence applications as quickly as possible, and enables the UK to meet its international obligation under UN conventions. Any delays with endorsements will result in a suspension of your account until they have been cleared.</p>

<h3>How to endorse a licence</h3>

<p>After shipment, the bottom section of Copy 1 of your licence must be completed, titled âFollowing shipment you must detail below the actual amount of each substance/preparation shipped and endorse onlineâ</p>

<p>You can complete the shipment section ready for endorsement on Copy 1 of your licence. You can annotate the PDF electronically. You must endorse the licence in the unit of Measure it was issued in. For example, if the licence was issued for packs of a finished dose preparation, you must endorse it in packs, rather than the base drug quantity.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Log into your NDS account.</li>
  <li>Select âimport / exportâ from the blue menu bar.</li>
  <li>Select âimport / export endorsementsâ.</li>
  <li>Click âmore â¦.â at the end of the licence you want to endorse.</li>
  <li>Enter the endorsement date (this must be within the validity of the licence). If you did not use the licence, select the last day of the validity period.</li>
  <li>Attach the endorsed licence. (in most cases, if a licence is not attached, the endorsement will be rejected).</li>
  <li>The Importer / Export details will be pre-populated.</li>
  <li>In the âSubstance /Preparationâ section you will see the details of the approved licence. Click on âEditâ.</li>
  <li>Add in the quantity you either shipped or received. This should be in the UOM that the licence was issued in. If you did not use the licence please record the quantity as 0.000001. This is because in some reports, NDS does not recognise 0.0 and the licence appears as unendorsed.</li>
  <li>Click âupdateâ and repeat the process for any additional lines you need to endorse.</li>
  <li>In the âuser commentsâ section, please add any narrative that would support your endorsement.</li>
  <li>You can either âsave as draftâ or âsubmitâ. Once submitted you cannot alter any detail on the endorsement.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Please note</strong></p>

<p>You can check the status of your endorsement in the âImport / Export Endorsements Statusâ this will be either âApprovedâ (endorsement still to be submitted), âEndorsement Submittedâ (waiting to be reviewed by DFLU), âEndorsedâ (endorsement approved by DFLU), âCancelledâ (endorsement has been cancelled by DFLU).</p>

<p>If we need to cancel the endorsement, we will provide some detail in the âCA Comments sectionâ. This will then need to be endorsement manually, which is time consuming for all parties to please make every effort to submit a full, accurate and timely endorsements.</p>

<p><strong>Manual endorsements:</strong></p>

<p>This needs to be completed by a member of the Import / Export team. Please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dflu.ie@homeoffice.gov.uk">dflu.ie@homeoffice.gov.uk</a> with a copy of your endorsed licence, stating the date of endorsement and the quantity. We will confirm when this has been completed. Please note that the status of the endorsement will always remain as âCancelledâ even after it has been manually endorsed. It is therefore recommended that you retain the email that confirms the endorsement has been completed manually.</p>
