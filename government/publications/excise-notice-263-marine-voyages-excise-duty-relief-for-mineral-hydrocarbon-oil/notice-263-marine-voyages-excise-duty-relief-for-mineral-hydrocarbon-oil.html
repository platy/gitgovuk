<p>This notice cancels and replaces Notice 263 May 2016. This notice has been updated as a result of the UK leaving the EU. This notice is not the law. It is our view of what the law says and nothing in this notice takes the place of the law.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> What this notice is about</h3>

<p>It is about the entitlement and procedures for reclaiming excise duty on fuel used in vessels used to make ‘marine voyages’ - see paragraph 2.3.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Who should read this notice</h3>

<p>Oil suppliers, and the owners, charterers, hirers and masters (or their agents) of vessels engaged in ‘marine voyages’.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> The law covering this notice</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979</li>
  <li>The Hydrocarbon Oil (Payment of Rebates) Regulations 1996.</li>
  <li>The Hydrocarbon Oil Duties (Marine Voyages Reliefs) Regulations 1996.</li>
  <li>The Hydrocarbon Oil Duties (Marine Voyages Reliefs) (Amendment) Regulations 2010</li>
</ul>

<p>EU law (which applies only to Northern Ireland):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Council Directive 2008/118 (which repealed Council Directive 92/12/EEC)</li>
  <li>Council Directive 2003/96/EC</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> General</h2>

<p>You can buy ‘red diesel’ at quaysides, marinas and on inland waterways. ‘Red diesel’ is gas oil that has been chemically marked and dyed to show that it has borne a rebated (reduced) rate of excise duty because it must not be used in road vehicles. Red diesel is much cheaper than road fuel sold at a garage forecourt, so we do not expect you to claim for refund of duty on road fuel. If you do, we may delay repayment of duty on road fuel while we verify that you did use the oil in your vessel.</p>

<p>Where a delivery of marine fuel is made from a duty suspended or netting location HMRC expect traders to make sure the calibration and continuing accuracy of measuring equipment. Further details on HMRC’s accuracy requirements can be found in paragraph 4.7 of Notice 179. Traders who deliver duty paid marine fuel should make sure deliveries are carried out from metered and calibrated tanks in line with requirements set by Trading Standards.</p>

<p>If you supply marine fuels you must be registered under the Registered Dealers in Controlled Oil (RDCO) scheme. More information can be found in Notice 192 - Registered dealers in controlled oil.</p>

<p>If you need to know the duty rates you should use to make your claim, please contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/excise-enquiries">excise helpline</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> What an ‘eligible vessel’ is</h3>

<p>An ‘eligible vessel’ is any vessel that you use on a marine voyage, including hovercraft, but not private pleasure craft. Private Pleasure Craft are defined as:</p>

<p>‘…any craft used by its owner or the natural or legal person who enjoys its use, either through hire or through any other means, for other than commercial purposes, and in particular, other than for the carriage of passengers or goods or for the supply of services for consideration or for the purposes of public authorities’.</p>

<p>So, if you use your vessel for pleasure use, or you hire it out and the hirer uses it purely for pleasure, you cannot claim relief on the fuel used for the voyage. However, you can claim relief for fuel used in pleasure craft in some circumstances and we explain this in more detail in the following paragraphs.</p>

<p>If your vessel is a commercial vessel and you use it on a marine voyage then it is an ‘eligible vessel’ and you can claim relief. For example, if you operate one of the following types of vessel, you would be eligible to claim relief on the fuel used, as long as you comply with the other requirements of this notice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>foreign-going commercial vessels</li>
  <li>coastal vessels</li>
  <li>dive boats</li>
  <li>UK fishing boats</li>
  <li>foreign-owned fishing boats refuelling in the UK</li>
  <li>ferries, lighters, pilot boats, tugs, tenders and other similar vessels</li>
  <li>certain safety/rescue vessels - see paragraph 2.4</li>
  <li>vessels undergoing trials (but not basin or dock trials whilst stationary, that is, not ‘engaged on a voyage’)</li>
  <li>hovercraft</li>
  <li>passenger vessels used for pleasure trips - go to paragraph 2.5</li>
</ul>

<p>Isle of Man residents must claim relief through the Isle of Man Customs and Excise. Please send your claims to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Isle of Man Customs and Excise
<br>PO Box 6
<br>Custom House
<br>North Quay
<br>Douglas
<br>Isle of Man
<br>IM99 1AG
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>This list is not exhaustive and you may qualify for relief even if your vessel is not listed above. If in doubt, please contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/excise-enquiries">excise helpline</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Oils you can claim relief on</h3>

<p>You can claim relief on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>heavy oil such as gas oil or fuel oil</li>
  <li>light oil such as petrol</li>
</ul>

<p>which you use as fuel for the machinery of eligible vessels during a marine voyage. The paragraphs below explain what we mean by ‘eligible vessel’ and ‘marine voyage’.</p>

<p>There is no duty on either marked kerosene or lubricating oil so you will not need to submit any claims if you use these oils.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Marine voyages</h3>

<p>A marine voyage is one in which you are, at all times, either within the limits of a port or at sea. It does not include any part of a voyage where you are on inland waterways.</p>

<p>You can claim relief for any eligible vessel for voyages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>made between a UK port and any foreign port</li>
  <li>made between UK ports, including a return to the same port</li>
  <li>where the vessel is moving from place to place within a port</li>
  <li>made between a UK port and a mooring at sea</li>
  <li>made between moorings at sea</li>
</ul>

<p>A mooring is a structure or apparatus set out in a permanent manner to which a vessel or floating object may be secured.</p>

<p>Vessels moored temporarily whilst engaged on a voyage, or temporarily at anchor whilst engaged on a voyage, are still considered to be undertaking a marine voyage.</p>

<p>You cannot claim relief for any voyage made on an inland waterway which is not within the limits of a port. For example, you cannot claim for fuel used on a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>barge which you use on canals or inland waterways</li>
  <li>passenger vessel which takes passengers across an inland lake</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> How a safety or rescue vessel may qualify for relief</h3>

<p>You can claim relief if you use the vessel solely as a safety or rescue vessel throughout the marine voyage, or if you combine the safety or rescue function with another, commercial, purpose. You may not be able to claim relief if you use the vessel for pleasure at the same time as you are carrying out the safety or rescue function.</p>

<p>For example, provided that you comply with the conditions set out in this notice, you can claim if you make a marine voyage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in a vessel which is acting as a ‘declared facility’ for public authorities, (for example, the coastguard)</li>
  <li>where your vessel is acting as a ‘safety vessel’ for a yacht club or sailing association race or regatta and you carry only an appropriate complement of safety-trained personnel and no other passengers</li>
  <li>where your vessel is acting as a ‘safety vessel’, as above, and you also carry paying passengers for the trip</li>
</ul>

<p>However, you would not be able to claim for a marine voyage where your vessel is acting as a ‘safety vessel’, but where you are also carrying non-paying spectators or passengers. On this occasion you are using the vessel for pleasure purposes and are therefore not eligible to claim the relief.</p>

<p>We may check your claim for relief on these voyages, and below we have listed some of the evidence we may expect to find to confirm that your vessel was used as a safety or rescue vessel during the voyage.</p>

<p>We would expect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you to equip a safety or rescue vessel with appropriate supplies such as lifesaving equipment, and to carry personnel trained in marine safety and rescue techniques</li>
  <li>the voyage to coincide with events or training exercises which require a safety or rescue function, unless you are carrying out routine patrol or standby duties in a vessel such as a coastguard vessel or oil rig safety vessel</li>
  <li>to find a reference to your vessel’s safety or rescue function in the records of the organisation using it</li>
  <li>to find some evidence that you had used the vessel for a commercial function, if you make all or part of your claim on that basis</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> Vessels hired out for pleasure purposes</h3>

<p>If you own or charter a private pleasure craft you cannot claim relief. However, if you have a business which hires out vessels then you may be able to claim relief even where the vessel is used for pleasure purposes. For example, as long as you comply with the other requirements of this notice, you can claim relief on marine voyages of boats:</p>

<ul>
  <li>used for pleasure trips carrying paying passengers</li>
  <li>hired out for diving, fishing, water skiing and so on carrying paying passengers and appropriate equipment and providing specialised services</li>
</ul>

<p>These examples are not an exhaustive list and if you have any difficulties in deciding whether a particular voyage qualifies for relief, you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/mineral-oils-reliefs">contact the Mineral Oil Reliefs Centre</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span> How to get relief</h3>

<p>You can obtain relief by using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>duty-free heavy oil delivered direct to the vessel from a duty-suspended mineral oil installation - see paragraph 3 of this notice</li>
  <li>duty-paid light or heavy oil on which you claim repayment - see paragraph 4</li>
  <li>duty-paid light or heavy oil supplied at a duty-exclusive price by an approved duty-deferment trader who is also approved for netting - see paragraph 5</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.7 </span> Applications for relanding heavy oil</h3>

<p>If you have a requirement to reland heavy oil which you have purchased free of duty or on which you have made a reclaim of duty under the arrangements described in this notice, please apply in writing.  You need to demonstrate your need and then if authorised we will then provide written permission and instructions on how to repay the duty. Please write to:</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Duty-free heavy oil from a duty-suspended mineral oil installation</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> How duty-free heavy oil is shipped</h3>

<p>If you wish to obtain duty free heavy oil, you should make a statement on one copy of the delivery note as follows:</p>

<p>‘I ………………………………………………………………………………….(name of signatory)</p>

<p>apply under the terms of Notice 263, on behalf of the owners of</p>

<p>this vessel …………………………………………………………………….(name of vessel)</p>

<p>lying at …………………………………………………………………………(place)</p>

<p>embarking to the destination ………..……………………………………………………….</p>

<p>(details of voyage)</p>

<p>for the delivery without payment of excise duty of the heavy oil specified. The oil is to be delivered directly into the vessel, for use on board this vessel while engaged on a marine voyage. HMRC permission must be obtained before diversion to alternative use.</p>

<p>Date ……………. …………………………………………………………..’(master, mate, chief engineer or other authorised person)</p>

<p>The oil delivery note must be signed and show the duty status of the oil being delivered on board and contain the following wording:</p>

<p>‘This oil has not borne excise duty and must be used only on board vessels on marine voyages. HMRC permission must be obtained before diversion to alternative use’.</p>

<p>You should also see Appendix K of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-179-motor-and-heating-fuels-general-information-and-accounting-for-excise-duty-and-vat">Notice 179 Motor and heating fuels: general information and accounting for excise duty and VAT</a>.</p>

<p>Warehousekeepers must receive a signed copy of the receipted delivery note to act as a receipt from the ship’s master or other authorised person. The quantity of oil shown on the receipted delivery note should, where practical, be the volume received on board the vessel in standard litres, that is the number of litres at 15º Centigrade, but if this is difficult to arrange, ask our officer about using bulk litres. We can make special arrangements for regular traffic. If you fall into this category, please see paragraph 3.3.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Who can sign applications and receipts for duty-free heavy oil</h3>

<p>You can sign applications and receipts if you are the owner, commercial charterer or hirer, master or other authorised person of the ship concerned.</p>

<p>If you, as the owner cannot conveniently provide your signature we will also accept the signature of a shore superintendent or similar responsible person who acts for the owner, commercial charterer or hirer. This might happen with trawlers or other quick-turnaround vessels</p>

<p>If you are the builder of a vessel which is undergoing trials, either yourself or another responsible person can sign applications and receipts</p>

<h3 class="3">
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Regular traffic and special arrangements</h3>

<p>If your vessels regularly obtain fuel from the same duty-suspended oil installation then you may, by prior agreement with HMRC, make omnibus (multiple) applications to ship heavy oil duty-free instead of making a single application on each separate occasion that oil is required.</p>

<p>You will need to make an application, on which you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide a list, in duplicate, of all the vessels to which you would like the concession to apply, stating each vessel’s name, net tonnage and engine capacity</li>
  <li>state the precise location at which the bunkering of the listed vessels will take place</li>
  <li>give the name and location of the duty-suspended oil installation from which the heavy oil is to be delivered to the listed vessels (if more than one installation is involved, a separate application is required for each)</li>
  <li>provide the written consent of each warehouse keeper who is to supply the heavy oil to comply with the requirements of paragraph 3.4</li>
  <li>undertake to send a monthly list to the Mineral Oil Reliefs Centre (please see paragraph 2.5 for contact details) for each of the installations from which heavy oil has been received</li>
</ul>

<p>The monthly list should show the dates of the deliveries and the quantities and descriptions of heavy oil delivered to each vessel. Each list must be supported by the following declaration by the owner, commercial charterer or hirer, master or other authorised person:</p>

<p>‘I/We* (on behalf of)<em>……………………………………………………….. (owners/charterers/hirers</em>)</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> Official forms for warehousekeepers</h3>

<p>For audit assurance purposes, warehouse-keepers must keep records of all heavy oil shipped free of excise duty in a format agreed with us.</p>

<p>Warehouse-keepers need to retain the application and receipt for all deliveries for production to us on request.</p>

<p>When a delivery of duty suspended marine fuel is made by an intermediary supplied by the warehouse-keeper, it is the responsibility of the warehouse-keeper to obtain evidence of how much fuel has been delivered. We expect warehouse-keepers and intermediaries to agree a means of providing HMRC with the necessary evidence of the amount of fuel delivered to a vessel.</p>

<p>A warehouse-keeper who we supply directly with the duplicate copy of the list of vessels provided by the owner or charterer as at paragraph 3.3 above may deliver heavy oil free of excise duty to the vessels specified on the list, provided that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the vessels are entitled to receive heavy oil duty-free</li>
  <li>the warehouse-keeper issues a delivery note and obtains a receipt on it signed by the master, mate, chief engineer or other authorised person for each delivery of heavy oil (this delivery note being retained by the warehouse-keeper for production to our officer on request), and</li>
  <li>the warehouse-keeper keeps records of all such shipments, in a format agreed with us</li>
</ul>

<p>If the special arrangements for regular traffic outlined in paragraph 3.3 above have been implemented there is no requirement, in the interests of avoiding unnecessary duplication, to supply individual receipt notes under this paragraph as well.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span> Restrictions that apply to heavy oil shipped duty-free</h3>

<p>You may only use heavy oil which has been shipped duty-free as fuel for the machinery of the specified vessels while engaged on a marine voyage.</p>

<p>You must not re-land this oil in the UK unless authorised in advance by HMRC. If you misuse or re-land such oil without authorisation you could face prosecution, liability to legal penalties and payment of the appropriate duty and VAT on the quantities involved.</p>

<p>You must not make any further claim, for example a drawback claim, for oil that has been shipped duty-free
deliveries to marine vessels for bunkering may only be made duty-free if the vessel is supplied directly from the approved tax warehouse at its own wharf or by a marine bunkering vessel, which is approved as part of that warehouse. All other marine bunkering deliveries must be made duty paid either at the full rate for heavy oil, or, if marked, at the rebated rate for heavy oil.</p>

<p>You can find more details on marking, please see Section 8 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-179-motor-and-heating-fuels-general-information-and-accounting-for-excise-duty-and-vat/excise-notice-179-motor-and-heating-fuels-general-information-and-accounting-for-excise-duty-and-vat">Notice 179</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Who can claim repayment of excise duty</h3>

<p>You can only claim repayment of excise duty which has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>been paid</li>
  <li>in respect of which no drawback or other claim has been or will be made</li>
</ul>

<p>You can claim if you are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the owner, commercial charterer or hirer or the ship’s master</li>
  <li>a sole agent if authorised in accordance with this paragraph (see the glossary for the definition of sole agent)</li>
  <li>a supplier of the oil acting as sole agent</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are the ship’s master you may be authorised to claim and receive payment on behalf of an owner, commercial charterer or hirer who must give their written authority in the following manner:</p>

<p>To the Officer, Mineral Oil Reliefs Centre, HM Revenue and Customs.</p>

<p>‘I/We* ……………………………………………………………………………….(owner/charterer/hirer*) (full name in BLOCK LETTERS)</p>

<p>of ……………………………………………………………………………………..(name(s) of vessel(s))</p>

<p>hereby authorise the ship’s master to claim and receive repayment of the excise duty paid in respect of oil used as fuel for the machinery of the above vessel(s) in respect of which the claims are made under the terms of Notice 263, and I/we* hereby authorise the ship’s master to make such declarations as may be required for this purpose.</p>

<p>I/We* agree that all receipts given by the ship’s master shall be sufficient evidence for all such repayments referred to above.</p>

<p>Address …………………………………………………………………………….</p>

<p>………………………………………………………………………….</p>

<p>Date …………………………………………………………………………………</p>

<p>*Delete as appropriate</p>

<p>If you are an agent then you may be authorised to claim and receive payment on behalf of an owner or charterer. You must be a person or firm who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is the sole agent for the vessel(s) in question, and</li>
  <li>is to make all claims for the vessel(s) when taking on fuel at any port in the UK, and</li>
  <li>has a business connection with the vessel(s), (for example, a shipping agent or ships’ store supplier)</li>
  <li>is in a position to make the declaration on the claim form that the oil has actually been used as fuel for the machinery of the vessel(s)</li>
</ul>

<p>We will not accept any claim from an agent without these qualifications. Both agents and vessel owners have a responsibility to make sure that any changes in the circumstances concerning the use of agents are notified to HMRC promptly. The use of an agent for one-off transactions should be discouraged. Agents should only be appointed if the situation warrants it – that is, there is a regular and continuing need at a particular port, rather than merely an occasional one.</p>

<p>The owner or charterer must give the following written authority in respect of each agent:</p>

<p>To the Officer, Mineral Oil Reliefs Centre, HM Revenue and Customs</p>

<p>‘I/We* ……………………………………………………………………………(owner/charterer/hirer*) (full name in BLOCK LETTERS)</p>

<p>of ………………………………………………………………………………….(name(s) of vessel(s))</p>

<p>The master of a vessel can authorise an agent to apply for repayment on behalf of the owner or charterer provided that written authority as above has been given by the owner or charterer.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> How to claim</h3>

<p>You should claim on form HO50 - <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fuel-duty-claim-for-repayment-of-excise-duty-on-mineral-oil-used-on-commercial-vessels-ho50">Fuel Duty: claim for repayment of excise duty on mineral oil used on commercial vessels</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> How often you should claim</h3>

<p>You may claim for oil used within the last 3 years. This period ends on the last day of the most recent marine voyage for which you are making the claim.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span> The minimum amount for claims</h3>

<p>We will not normally accept any claim for less than £250 duty. If necessary, defer your claim for up to 3 years until it amounts to £250 or more. You must then send it in within 3 months after the end of the claim period it covers.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span> If your claim does not reach £250 after 3 years</h3>

<p>Your claim may still be accepted and you should send it to the Mineral Oil Reliefs Centre (please see paragraph 2.5 for contact details) in the usual way.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span> The rate of duty paid to show on your claim</h3>

<p>You must show the rate of mineral (hydrocarbon) oil excise duty actually paid. Where a Budget change in the duty rate occurs during the period of the claim, you should show separate details on the claim of the duty paid at pre and post-Budget rates.</p>

<h3 class="7">
<span class="number">4.7 </span> Records to keep in support of your claim</h3>

<p>You must sign a delivery receipt note provided by the supplier for all oil included in your claim, showing the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>date or dates on which the oil was purchased</li>
  <li>name and address of the seller</li>
  <li>name of the purchaser</li>
  <li>date and place of shipment of the oil</li>
  <li>name of the vessel</li>
  <li>quantity and description of the oil received on board.</li>
  <li>details of marine voyages destination</li>
  <li>duty status of oil and price paid</li>
</ul>

<p>Usually, bills or invoices should have the supplier’s receipt for payment. However, we will accept a separate form of receipt if it is related to an advice or advices giving the details above.</p>

<p>Although we do not require you to send the receipted bills or invoices with your claim, you must keep all such supporting documentation for 6 years, cross-referenced to the relevant claim, in accordance with the Revenue Traders (Accounts and Records) Regulations 1992.</p>

<p>We may ask you to produce this supporting documentation for verification purposes, either at your premises or by sending it to our officer. Failure to do so may result in the claim being refused.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.8 </span> Can a single claim cover more than one vessel</h3>

<p>You can make grouped claims (that is, claims covering 2 or more vessels or journeys) for a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fleet under one ownership or chartering</li>
  <li>definite group of vessels (for example, participating in a co-operative or similar association)</li>
  <li>group of vessels in different ownership but having the same sole authorised agent</li>
</ul>

<p>Such claims should be made by the owner, charterer, or sole authorised agent of all the vessels covered by the claim. We will not accept grouped claims from traders (for example, oil supply firms) whose interest in the vessels is limited to their business as suppliers.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.9 </span> How to make an omnibus claim</h3>

<p>You must submit a single Form HO 50 in respect of the total claim to the Mineral Oil Reliefs Centre.</p>

<p>You should supply the following details with each claim, either in the form of a schedule or other format by prior agreement with us:</p>

<ul>
  <li>particulars of each vessel as required on form HO 50 (name of vessel, net tonnage, engine description and capacity)</li>
  <li>the quantities and descriptions of oil supplied for each vessel</li>
  <li>the date of each supply</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.10 </span> Records you should keep in support of omnibus claims</h3>

<p>You must keep:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all the records detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para4.7">paragraph 4.7</a>, cross-referenced to the relevant claim</li>
  <li>a copy of each accompanying schedule, cross-referenced to the relevant claim</li>
  <li>all such supporting documentation for 6 years as detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para4.7">paragraph 4.7</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Where oil subject to a grouped claim is supplied from depots where a general stock is kept for the use of a fleet or group of vessels, and issues are made to individual vessels as required, records are to be kept (in a format agreed with our officer) showing in detail particulars of oil stocks received and of deliveries to each of the vessels.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.11 </span> The powers officers have</h3>

<p>Our officers can request any information they feel is necessary which relates to a Marine Voyages claim from either the claimant or any other third party.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.12 </span> Restrictions that apply to light or heavy oil shipped as duty-paid</h3>

<p>You may only use light or heavy oil shipped duty-paid as fuel for the machinery of the specified vessels while engaged on a marine voyage.</p>

<p>You must not re-land such oil in the UK unless authorised in advance by HMRC. If you misuse or re-land such oil without authorisation, you could face prosecution, liability to legal penalties and payment of the appropriate duty and VAT on the quantities involved.</p>

<p>Repayment claims are limited to the quantity of oil delivered on board an eligible vessel, as evidenced by the signed delivery receipt.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Heavy oil shipped duty-paid at a duty-exclusive price under the netting arrangements</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Where to get oil at duty-exclusive prices</h3>

<p>You will be able to buy oil at a duty-exclusive price when it is supplied under arrangements approved by HMRC and is delivered directly to an eligible vessel. An approved person is a person who is authorised to account for excise duty on a deferment basis. The approved person will have already paid the relevant excise duty but will reclaim it by setting off the relevant amount in his account; this is called ‘netting off’.</p>

<p>You can find more details on approved persons and ‘netting’ in Part 12 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-179-motor-and-heating-fuels-general-information-and-accounting-for-excise-duty-and-vat">Notice179: motor and heating fuels -  general information and accounting for excise duty and VAT</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Conditions that apply to the delivery of such oil</h3>

<p>The oil must be for use as fuel in a ship embarking on a marine voyage and must not be re-landed in the UK unless authorised in advance by HMRC. The ship’s owner, charterer, master or other authorised person must sign a copy of the delivery note and provide a copy to the supplier to retain.</p>

<p>The quantity of oil shown on the receipt should be the amount delivered on board in standard litres (15ºC); details of how this can be achieved can be found in Appendix H of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-179-motor-and-heating-fuels-general-information-and-accounting-for-excise-duty-and-vat">Notice 179: motor and heating fuels - general information and accounting for excise duty and VAT</a>. If such measurement creates a difficulty and one of our officers permits it, measurements may be taken in bulk litres.</p>

<p>The receipt must include a declaration in the following terms:</p>

<p>The quantity of heavy oil specified hereon has been received on board the vessel</p>

<p>(name of vessel) ………………………………………………………………………….</p>

<p>IMO identification number ……………………………………………………………….</p>

<p>This quantity of heavy oil has been delivered by</p>

<p>(supplier oil company name) …………………………………………………………….</p>

<p>directly to the vessel at a price which is reduced by a sum equal to the duty on that oil, for use as fuel for the machinery of the said vessel while engaged on a marine voyage. No claim will be made to HM Revenue &amp; Customs in respect of this oil under the Hydrocarbon Oil (Marine Voyages Reliefs) Regulations 1996 by or on behalf of</p>

<p>(name in BLOCK LETTERS of owner, charterer or hirer of the vessel) 
………………………………………………………………………………………………..
In the event that the oil is not used on the said vessel while engaged on a marine voyage, a sum equal to the amount of duty paid / set off on delivery of the oil will be paid to HM Revenue &amp; Customs by or on behalf of the said owner, charterer or hirer.</p>

<p>Signed (owner, charterer, hirer, master or authorised person)</p>

<p>…………………………………………………………………………………………………
Date …………………………………………………………………………………………..</p>

<p>When a delivery of marine fuel at a duty exclusive price is made by an intermediary supplied by a trader approved for netting, it is the responsibility of that approved trader to obtain evidence of how much fuel has been delivered on board the vessel before any set-off can take place. We expect approved traders and intermediaries to agree a means of providing HMRC with the necessary evidence of the amount of fuel delivered to a vessel to allow the set-off of duty on the deferment statement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span> Regular traffic and special arrangements</h3>

<p>You can apply for authority to supply a monthly scheduled receipt for deliveries made to vessels under the netting arrangements in a similar manner to that outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para3.3">paragraph 3.3</a>. The same requirements apply.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Penalties and Appeals</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> Penalties and how to avoid them</h3>

<p>If you misuse or re-land heavy oil which you have purchased free of duty under the arrangements described in this notice, or give inaccurate or incomplete information, you could face prosecution and financial penalties as well as having to repay the duty and VAT. You can avoid this by making sure that you comply with all the relevant conditions and give full and accurate information in your claim.</p>
