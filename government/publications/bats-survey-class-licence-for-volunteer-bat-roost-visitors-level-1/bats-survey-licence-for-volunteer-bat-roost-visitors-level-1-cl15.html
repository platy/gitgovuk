<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Important</h3>

<p>This licence authorises acts that would otherwise be offences under the legislation referred to above. Failure to comply with its terms and conditions:</p>

<p>i. may be an offence against the Habitats Regulations or the 1981 Act, or mean that the licence cannot be relied upon and an offence could therefore be committed. The maximum penalty available for an offence under the Habitats Regulations or 1981 Act is, at the time of the issue of this licence, an unlimited fine and/or a six month custodial sentence</p>

<p>ii. may result in your permission to use this licence being withdrawn. Natural England will inform any person or organisation whose permission to use this licence is withdrawn in writing. This sanction may be applied to other similar licences, and</p>

<p>iii. may mean that you are not able to rely on this licence as a defence in respect to the prohibitions within the Animal Welfare Act 2006 or the Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996. Breaching a condition of a licence issued under the 1981 Act is not in itself an offence but doing so may mean that the licence cannot be relied upon and an offence could therefore be committed. If the activity that you wish to undertake is not covered by this licence, or if you are unable to comply with any of the terms and conditions which apply to the use of this licence, then you will need to apply to Natural England for an individual licence. This licence is not a consent for the purposes of Part II of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) in respect to SSSIs. It is your responsibility to get consent or assent if required before this licence can be used on any SSSI. See Advice (r - t) for further information.</p>
</div>

<p>Issued by and on behalf of Natural England on 1 January 2022.</p>

<h2>Information and advice specific to this licence</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Working during the coronavirus pandemic</h3>

<p>Anyone acting under this licence should follow Defra’s advice on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-surveying-and-mitigation-works-affecting-wildlife">surveying and mitigation work during the coronavirus pandemic</a> - also available on request from Natural England: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:wildlife.scicons@naturalengland.org.uk">wildlife.scicons@naturalengland.org.uk</a>. This advice is a minimum precaution to reduce the risk of accidental transmission of the virus from humans to wild animals, and may be updated. You should check GOV.UK before you act.</p>

<p>Any products used to clean and disinfect equipment should be safe for use where there could be contact with animals, and used at an effective and safe dilution rate. ‘Safe4 Disinfectant’ is considered to be a safe and appropriate product for cleaning and disinfecting equipment that could come into contact with animals. Use at a dilution of 1:50 to be effective against COVID-19.</p>
</div>

<h3>Level 1 and Level 2 <abbr title="Volunteer Bat Roost Visitors">VBRV</abbr> class licences</h3>

<p>a. There are 2 <abbr title="Volunteer Bat Roost Visitors">VBRV</abbr> class licences. These differ in the activities permitted: 
Level 1 (WML-CL15) permits a Registered Person (and their Assistant) to undertake certain activities. This is the Level 1 licence.</p>

<p>Level 2 licence (WML-CL16) additionally permits the Registered Person to train unlicensed VBRVs. To register to use the Level 2 licence, you require evidence to show you have attended a Natural England and Bat Conservation Trust (<abbr title="Bat Conservation Trust">BCT</abbr>) ‘Bat trainer’s’ course and will <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bats-survey-class-licence-for-volunteer-bat-roost-visitors-level-2">need to apply</a> to Natural England.</p>

<h3>Guidance on surveying</h3>

<p>b. The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-2861" rel="external">Bat Workers Manual</a> is available from the JNCC website. More <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/bats-surveys-and-mitigation-for-development-projects">general advice</a> is available on GOV.UK. You will be expected to check whether this guidance has been updated and if so, to ensure that you act in accordance with the most up to date version.</p>

<h3>Relevant legislation and good practice</h3>

<p>c. A licence is not required for the short-term keeping of injured bats that were obtained legally for the purpose of tending them in order to release them when no longer disabled. However, if the bats are to be kept for longer than six months then the carer should apply for a licence to possess bats. This can be done using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-protected-species-apply-for-a-licence-to-possess-them">possession licence application form</a> (WML-A37).</p>

<p>d. Natural England recommends that anyone handling bats wears gloves and is suitably vaccinated against rabies.</p>

<p>e. Persons acting under this licence may photograph bats in connection with licensed work provided that this causes no additional disturbance.</p>

<p>f. Persons acting under a licence should have regard to legislation and good practice relevant to the action(s) undertaken, including animal welfare and the Animal Welfare Act 2006 (2006 Act). It is an offence to cause any unnecessary suffering to an animal (including birds) under the control of man (section 4 of the 2006 Act). This applies to the humane dispatch of captured animals and the treatment of animals held in traps or nets, including decoy birds and non-target animals. The application of Animal Welfare Act 2006 to wildlife management activities is explained in Natural England leaflet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wildlife-management-advice-notice-the-animal-welfare-act-2006-wml-gu02">Wildlife Management Advice Note: The Animal Welfare Act 2006: what it means for wildlife</a> (WML-GU02).</p>

<h3>Registering to use this licence</h3>

<p>g. Only Registered Persons, or persons authorised or supervised by a Registered Person (see Condition 6), may act under this licence. Anyone seeking to become a Registered Person must apply to Natural England. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-a-wildlife-licence">register online</a> to use this licence. Alternatively applications can be submitted by email or post (contact details below). Applications require supporting evidence (including references) indicating appropriate knowledge and experience of the species covered by this licence and the management techniques permitted (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reference-to-support-a-protected-species-licence">Reference guidance</a>). Applications require evidence that they have attended and successfully completed a Natural England/<abbr title="Bat Conservation Trust">BCT</abbr> ‘Bat trainer’s’ course.</p>

<p>h. Once registered, a person is entitled to use this licence so long as they satisfy the licence’s terms and conditions; annual re-registration is not required. Failure to comply by the terms and conditions, including the recording and reporting requirements, will, by default, render registration null and void. The annual reporting process is used to verify a person’s desire to remain registered.</p>

<p>i. It is the responsibility of Registered Persons to maintain their expertise at an appropriate level to act under this licence and it is also their responsibility to ensure that Assistants have appropriate training, experience and instruction, including on mitigation measures commonly employed, to act under this licence.</p>

<p>j. Anyone seeking to confirm whether a person is registered to use this licence should contact Natural England Wildlife Licensing (contact details below).</p>

<p>k. A person’s registration may be revoked by Natural England, for example, if that person breaches the conditions of this licence. In these circumstances Natural England will normally give 28 days’ notice of our intention to revoke a person’s registration.</p>

<p>l. Registration to use this licence to disturb or capture bats indicates that the licensee has demonstrated an appropriate level of competence in these activities. The licence should not be used or taken to indicate competence in any other activity that may be associated with work on bats and is not to be used by those undertaking scientific recording including surveys to inform development proposals, National Bat Monitoring Programme, bat box checks or hibernation surveys etc. To register to use our Bat Class Survey Licences you will need to apply to Natural England: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/bat-licences">https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/bat-licences</a>.</p>

<h2>Information and advice for all class and general licences</h2>

<h3>General information</h3>

<p>m. Natural England checks compliance with licences and the attached conditions. Where breaches are identified, these may be subject to enforcement action.</p>

<p>n. Ordinarily, licences will be reissued on 1 January each year (NB you do not need to re-register for those with registration requirements). Please note, however, that they can be modified or revoked at any time by Natural England or the Secretary of State, but this will not be done unless there are good reasons for doing so. You are advised to check the terms and conditions of a licence prior to your first use of it each year in case of amendments.</p>

<h3>The limits of licences</h3>

<p>o. Licences permit action only for the purposes specified on that licence.</p>

<p>p. Licences do not permit actions prohibited under any other legislation, nor do they confer any right of entry upon land.</p>

<p>q. Unless otherwise stated the provisions of Natural England licences only apply landward of the mean low water mark in England. The Marine Management Organisation is responsible for all licensing seaward of the mean low water mark.</p>

<h3>Protected sites</h3>

<p>r. You can search for and view details about all SSSIs by using Natural England’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteSearch.aspx" rel="external">Designated Sites system</a>. The notification documents for each SSSI contain a list of operations that require Natural England’s prior consent.</p>

<p>Owners and occupiers of land notified as SSSIs are required to give written notice to Natural England before either beginning any of these operations, or allowing someone else to carry out those operations. SSSI consent can only be given to a SSSI owner or occupier. It may be given with or without conditions, or in some cases, consent may not be granted. A similar process applies to public bodies and statutory undertakers (as defined under Section 28G of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended)) and this obligation applies even where the operations are carried out on land outside of the SSSI.</p>

<p>s. Please note that as the licensee you will not be able to undertake the licensed activity on a SSSI until the owner or occupier of the SSSI has applied for, and received, Natural England’s written SSSI consent. If you do so, you may be at risk of committing an offence. As the licensee, if you wish to exercise this licence on a SSSI you must contact the relevant owners or occupiers of the SSSI and ensure they give written notice to Natural England of their proposal to permit you to carry out licensed activity on their SSSI. You should wait until a SSSI consent decision has been received by the SSSI owner/occupier before you begin to exercise this licence on a SSSI. See GOV.UK for further information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-areas-sites-of-special-scientific-interest">how to get SSSI consent</a> from Natural England.</p>

<p>t. In considering whether to issue consent or assent for activities likely to affect a SSSI that is a European site, in other words a Special Protection Area (SPA) or Special Area of Conservation (SAC), Natural England will carry out a Habitats Regulations Assessment, as required by the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 (as amended) (‘the Habitats Regulations’) to ensure there will be no adverse effects on the European site.</p>

<h3>Using and sharing your information</h3>

<p>u. There is significant public interest in wildlife licensing and in those who benefit from receiving a wildlife licence. We may make information publicly available, for more information, please see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/natural-england-privacy-notices/wildlife-licensing-privacy-notice">privacy notice</a>.</p>

<p>Registered VBRVs are required to submit a report of action to Natural England on an annual basis giving details for each site that the licence was used. This form will be used to renew your registration. If you fail to do this, you’re no longer registered to act under the licence. The report of action template (LR-CL15-16) and application forms are available online at: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bats-report-action-taken-under-a-volunteer-bat-roost-visitor-licence">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bats-report-action-taken-under-a-volunteer-bat-roost-visitor-licence</a>. You must return a report of action taken under a <abbr title="Volunteer Bat Roost Visitors">VBRV</abbr> licence form (LR-CL15-16) no later than 30 June each year, even if you’ve taken no action.</p>
