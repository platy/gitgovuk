<p>Work is underway in NHS Test and Trace to digitally label samples associated with surge testing, through an end-to-end process from sample to sequence. In the interim, this preliminary analysis uses a pragmatic proxy of samples identified through local surge testing initiatives as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>specimens taken at a mobile test unit (<abbr title="mobile test unit">MTU</abbr>), regional test site (<abbr title="regional test site">RTS</abbr>) or local test site (<abbr title="local test site">LTS</abbr>) that has been designated by NHS Test and Trace as related to surge testing, during the period surge testing was in operation 
PLUS</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>specimens from a home test kit delivered to a postcode within a designated surge test area, during the period surge testing was in operation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Tests undertaken as part of surge testing but from persons resident in other postcodes or processed through a test site not designated as surge testing using the definition above, will not be included in this proxy.</p>

<p>Indicators are presented by ‘locality’ of area targeted for surge testing and the test sites linked to it (including <abbr title="mobile test unit">MTU</abbr> deployment). Locality names are the operational names assigned by Test and Trace and do not necessarily relate to strict geographical boundaries. Specimens from individuals who do not reside in the locality – but who have been tested at a site associated with the locality for surge testing – may be included.</p>

<p>All variant of concern or variant under investigation  samples identified through surge testing are verified through established <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> dataflows and matched to the earliest positive specimen of a case in the daily line list of cases. Therefore, this report does not include sequencing for any cases with a positive specimen taken prior to surge testing. Data from the last 7 days has been excluded to allow time for sequencing data to be reported.</p>

<p>Lateral Flow Device (<abbr title="Lateral Flow Device">LFD</abbr>) testing and cases first identified using <abbr title="Lateral Flow Device">LFD</abbr> are included. Cases first identified using <abbr title="Lateral Flow Device">LFD</abbr> may have a later <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>  sample which has been sequenced. <abbr title="Lateral Flow Device">LFD</abbr> contribution to case rate is assumed to be similar in surge and non-surge areas and therefore should not impact comparative sequencing estimates.</p>
