<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://analytics.phe.gov.uk/apps/chime/" rel="external">COVID-19 Health Inequalities Monitoring in England (CHIME) tool</a> brings together data relating to the direct impacts of coronavirus (COVID-19) on factors such as mortality rates, hospital admissions, confirmed cases and vaccinations.</p>

<p>By presenting inequality breakdowns – including by age, sex, ethnic group, level of deprivation and region – the tool provides a single point of access to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>show how inequalities have changed during the course of the pandemic and what the current cumulative picture is</li>
  <li>bring together data in one tool to enable users to access and use the intelligence more easily</li>
  <li>provide indicators with a consistent methodology across different data sets to facilitate understanding</li>
  <li>support users to identify and address inequalities within their areas, and identify priority areas for recovery</li>
</ul>

<p>In the September 2022 update, data have been updated for deaths, hospital admissions and vaccinations. Data for confirmed cases are no longer being updated in the tool and March 2022 remains the most recent data point.</p>

<p>Confirmed cases for ethnic groups, which had previously only been available to December 2021, have now been updated to March 2022. Two changes have been implemented for confirmed cases by ethnic group. The change in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ukhsa.blog.gov.uk/2022/02/04/changing-the-covid-19-case-definition/" rel="external">COVID-19 case definition</a>, which was made in February 2022, has now been implemented. The method of assigning an ethnic group for confirmed cases has also changed. These changes have resulted in revisions to the trends reported for confirmed cases for all ethnic groups. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/covid-19-health-inequalities-monitoring-in-england-tool-chime/method-for-assigning-ethnic-group-in-the-covid-19-health-inequalities-monitoring-for-england-chime-tool">Methods of assigning ethnicity for data within CHIME</a> are documented</p>

<p>Changes have also been made to the confirmed case rates presented for all ages, with age-standardised rates replaced by crude mortality rates.</p>

<p>The next updates will be 09:30 on 15 December 2022.</p>

These have been supplemented in this update with comparable mortality rates for all causes of deaths and deaths not involving COVID-19. Data on confirmed cases of COVID-19 were not updated in the February release of the CHIME tool. They have been updated in this release and the change to the COVID-19 case definition which was made in February 2022 has been adopted. The impact of the change in case definition on data for ethnic groups is still being investigated, however, and so data for confirmed cases broken down by ethnic group have not been updated.</p>

The provisional life expectancy estimates and life expectancy breakdowns are now based on final data for 2020. 

In response to user feedback, the age groups used for age-specific rates for confirmed cases by ethnic group have been changed so that working age populations are more easily identifiable.
