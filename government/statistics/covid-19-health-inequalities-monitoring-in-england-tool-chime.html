<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://analytics.phe.gov.uk/apps/chime/" rel="external">COVID-19 Health Inequalities Monitoring in England (CHIME) tool</a> brings together data relating to the direct impacts of coronavirus (COVID-19) on factors such as mortality rates, hospital admissions, confirmed cases and vaccinations.</p>

<p>By presenting inequality breakdowns – including by age, sex, ethnic group, level of deprivation and region – the tool provides a single point of access to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>show how inequalities have changed during the course of the pandemic and what the current cumulative picture is</li>
  <li>bring together data in one tool to enable users to access and use the intelligence more easily</li>
  <li>provide indicators with a consistent methodology across different data sets to facilitate understanding</li>
  <li>support users to identify and address inequalities within their areas, and identify priority areas for recovery</li>
</ul>

<p>In the March release indicators have been updated with the latest available data, including the release of provisional life expectancy estimates for 2021. The February release of the CHIME tool included mortality rates for upper tier local authorities, and deprivation quintiles within upper tier local authorities, for deaths involving COVID-19. These have been supplemented in the March update with comparable mortality rates for all causes of deaths and deaths not involving COVID-19.</p>

<p>Data on confirmed cases of COVID-19 were not updated in the February release of the CHIME tool. They have been updated in this release and the change to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ukhsa.blog.gov.uk/2022/02/04/changing-the-covid-19-case-definition/" rel="external">COVID-19 case definition</a> which was made in February 2022 has been adopted. The impact of the change in case definition on data for ethnic groups is still being investigated, however, and so data for confirmed cases broken down by ethnic group have not been updated.</p>

The provisional life expectancy estimates and life expectancy breakdowns are now based on final data for 2020. 

In response to user feedback, the age groups used for age-specific rates for confirmed cases by ethnic group have been changed so that working age populations are more easily identifiable. The new age groups are: 0 to 24, 25 to 49, 50 to 64 and 65+. These replace the previous age groups: 0 to 24, 25 to 49, 50 to 74 and 75+.</p>
