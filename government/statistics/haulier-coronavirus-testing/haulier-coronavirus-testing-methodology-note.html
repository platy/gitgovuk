<p>These statistics will be published by the Department for Transport on a weekly basis commencing Thursday 11 March 2021. This document sets out information on the data sources and methodology used to produce them.
These statistics have been produced quickly in response to developing world events.</p>

<p>They have not been reviewed against the <a href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">Code of Practice for Statistics</a>, however they have been prepared using professional standards that are aligned with the Code’s pillars of Trustworthiness, Quality and Value.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Coronavirus testing of hauliers <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/protocol-agreed-to-reopen-french-border-to-uk-arrivals" class="govuk-link">began in late December</a> following the closure of the French-UK border. An agreement was made that hauliers crossing the border would be required to provide proof of a negative test. Testing facilities were therefore established in Kent, including at Sevington and Manston, as part of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/kent-traffic-management-on-m20-motorway-to-dover-and-eurotunnel" class="govuk-link">wider on-going traffic management</a>.</p>

<p>Testing was quickly rolled out further on the weekend of 2 January 2021 to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/haulier-advice-site-locations" class="govuk-link">Information and Advice Sites (IASs)</a> across Great Britain. These sites are based at service stations along key routes into ports to ease pressure on testing capacity and traffic flows.</p>

<p>From 23:00 on 21 February 2021, requirements have been relaxed for hauliers who return to France after spending less than 48 hours in the UK, in addition to those who hold a negative test from Ireland within the previous 72 hours. This change has reduced the amount of testing conducted and is consequently marked in the accompanying table as a break in series. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-a-coronavirus-covid-19-test-if-youre-an-hgv-or-van-driver">Guidance on current testing arrangements for hauliers</a> is maintained on GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>Coverage and data sources</h2>

<p>There are currently three different types of location at which hauliers can be tested:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Testing site</th>
      <th scope="col">Operator</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/haulier-advice-site-locations" class="govuk-link">Information and Advice Sites (IASs)</a></td>
      <td>Initially the Ministry of Defence, switching to a private contractor under contract to DfT from 15 January 2021.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Kent (including Sevington and Manston)</td>
      <td>Initially the Ministry of Defence, switching to two private contractors under contract to DfT from 12 February 2021</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Mass testing locations, such as workplaces (e.g. supermarket distribution centres)</td>
      <td>Department for Health and Social Care</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The statistics published by DfT only include data for tests conducted as part of traffic management in Kent and the IASs. They do not include tests conducted as part of wider mass testing. These testing data include all hauliers conducting international travel (e.g. both Heavy Goods Vehicles and vans).</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>The statistics we produce focus on the number of tests conducted (rather than the number of vehicles tested) and therefore include all occupants of a vehicle, not just the driver.</p>

<p>These are produced by summing the total number of tests conducted by each of the three contractors in Kent and at IASs. We also publish a weekly positivity rate, based on the number of positive tests divided by the total number of tests undertaken.</p>

<h2>Quality</h2>

<p>The organisations conducting haulier testing have changed since testing commenced in late December 2020, and the information collected and supplied by contractors has also expanded over time. This means that the data presented are not always available on a consistent basis for the full period during which testing has taken place.</p>

<p>In particular, there was a need to estimate a small number of tests (less than 8k) conducted prior to 20 January 2021. This arose due to a gap in data provision, caused by the process of transition between testing providers. Similarly, from 18 January 2021 to 2 February 2021 tests at some sites were counted using a different process to that used since. Though running totals were revised, weekly totals from this period are not comparable to later weeks.</p>

<p>In addition, a robust statistical estimate of positivity was not available at all sites prior to 3 February 2021 due to insufficient data being held by DfT. For this reason, an overall positivity rate prior to this date is also not presented in these statistics. However, data that were collected at selected sites during this time showed positivity that was comparable to that seen in the weeks that immediately followed this period.</p>

<p>Despite the above, and due to remedial action, that has since been taken, we believe the quality of the data is sufficient to provide an overall estimate of the volume of testing conducted since its commencement in late December. Similarly, we believe weekly estimates of testing and positivity since 20 January 2021 can be considered as robust.</p>
