<p>This publication covers the fifth grant for the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (<abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>) administered by HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) up to 15 September 2021.</p>

<p>The release is classified as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/guidetoexperimentalstatistics" rel="external">Experimental Statistics</a> as the methodologies used to produce the statistics are still in their development phase. As a result, the data are subject to revision. These statistics have been produced quickly in response to developing world events.</p>

<p>The Office for Statistics Regulation, on behalf of the UK Statistics Authority, has reviewed them against several key aspects of the Code of Practice for Statistics and regards them as consistent with the Code’s pillars of Trustworthiness, Quality and Value.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Main findings</h2>

<ul>
  <li>To date £27.7bn has been paid in <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grants in total (up to 15 September 2021). Across the five grants 2.9 million individuals have received a grant and 10.2 million total grants have been claimed</li>
  <li>Around 5.0 million individuals reported self-employment income for the tax year 2019 to 2020, and had their data assessed for potential <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> eligibility. In order to be assessed, a self-employed individual needed to have traded in the tax year 2019 to 2020 and submitted a Self-Assessment tax return on or before 2 March 2021 for that year</li>
  <li>Via this process, 3.3 million self-employed individuals were identified as potentially eligible for the fifth grant.  This is a similar size population as those potentially eligible for the earlier <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grants. (Potentially eligible means that they met the criteria for the scheme based on Self-Assessment tax returns from 2019 to 2020 and earlier years. However, some of the businesses will not have been affected by Coronavirus or have ceased trading since 2019 to 2020 so will not have been eligible)</li>
  <li>Not all potentially eligible individuals will claim the grant. As of 15 September 2021, 1.1 million of this population have claimed the fifth grant, representing a take-up rate of 33%. The value of these claims totals £2.5 billion</li>
  <li>The 1.1 million successful claims can be divided into categories: a higher grant (worth 80% of 3 months’ average trading profits capped at £7,500) and a lower grant (receiving 30% of 3 months’ average trading profits capped at £2,850). There have been 778,000 higher grant claims (71%) and 315,000 lower grant claims (29%)</li>
  <li>Among female claimants, 79% claimed the higher grant. Among male claimants, 68% claimed the higher grant. The proportion of higher grant claims rises with age. Individuals in other service activities (87%) and arts, entertainment and recreation (85%) have the highest proportion of claims for the higher grant. The lowest proportions are in agriculture, forestry and fishing (52%) and construction (60%)</li>
  <li>Around 500,000 people are brought into scope who either became self-employed in 2019-20 or were ineligible for the first three grants, but now may be eligible for the fifth grant based on their 2019-20 tax return</li>
  <li>There are 57,000 (28% take-up) claims by individuals that were newly self-employed in 2019-20, meaning they did not trade in any of 2016-17, 2017-18 or 2018-19. 60,000 (21% take-up) claims are by individuals that were assessed for the third grant and found ineligible but are now eligible to claim based on their 2019 to 2020 tax returns. Some of the 60,000 individuals had not been assessed for the third grant as they did not trade in 2018 to 2019, but they had traded before 2018 to 2019 and began trading again in 2019 to 2020</li>
  <li>For the fifth grant the average value per claim was £2,300. Around two-thirds of the potentially eligible population are male (2.3m). The average claim for female claimants is lower at £1,900 compared to the average claim for male claimants of £2,400</li>
  <li>No single age group dominates take-up of the fifth grant, although take-up is notably lower among the over 65s at 20%</li>
  <li>The sector with the highest number of potentially eligible individuals and the highest proportion of claims is the construction industry. By 15 September, construction workers had made 378,000 claims for the fifth grant, totalling £966 million. Construction is the largest sector among the self-employed population with 1.2 million individuals assessed for eligibility</li>
  <li>The two regions with the highest number of fifth grant claims are London (268,000) and the South East (148,000), reflecting their relative population sizes</li>
  <li>Of the 1.7 million that did not meet one or more of the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> eligibility criteria, 1.4 million (84%) had trading profits less than non-trading profits (e.g. income from employment, investment or other income sources), 0.5 million (32%) had trading profits of £0 or made a loss, and 0.2 million (11%) had trading profits over £50,000. (N.B. Individuals may be counted more than once). This represents a slight increase on the 1.6 million individuals who were assessed as ineligible for the fourth grant in the July statistics</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>About this release</h2>
<p>The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (<abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>) provides support for self-employed individuals whose business has been affected by Coronavirus (COVID-19). Applications for the fifth grant opened 29 July and closed 30 September 2021. To make a claim for the fifth grant businesses must have had a new or continuing impact from coronavirus between 1 May 2021 and 30 September 2021.</p>

<p>This grant is worth either 80% or 30% of three months’ average trading profits, paid out in a single instalment, and capped at £7,500 for the higher percentage or £2,850 for the lower percentage. These categories will be referred to as the higher grant and lower grant respectively.</p>

<p>To claim the fifth grant, individuals have to compare their pandemic year turnover with that from 2019 to 2020 or 2018 to 2019, their reference year.  If turnover in the pandemic period is down by 30% or more compared to turnover in the reference period, the higher 80% grant can be claimed.  Otherwise, individuals are eligible for the lower grant only. Newly self-employed individuals are exempt from the turnover test and are able to claim the higher grant.
To be eligible for the fifth grant an individual must have traded in both tax years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2019 to 2020 and submitted their tax return on or before 2 March 2021</li>
  <li>2020 to 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>They must either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be currently actively trading but impacted by reduced activity, demand or capacity due to COVID-19</li>
  <li>have been previously trading but are temporarily unable to do so due to COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<p>They must also declare that they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>intend to continue to trade</li>
  <li>reasonably believe that there will be a significant reduction in trading profits compared to what they might expect absent the pandemic</li>
</ul>

<p>The data used in this release covers claims for the fifth grant up to 15 September 2021.  The claims window closed on 30 September 2021. This data has been matched with other <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> data to present breakdowns of claims by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gender</li>
  <li>age</li>
  <li>sector of the economy</li>
  <li>geography</li>
</ul>

<p>Notes</p>

<ol>
  <li>The lower average claim for the second grant is a result of grants being paid out at 70% of an individual’s three months’ average trading profits, rather than 80% as for the first, third and fourth grants</li>
  <li>The fifth grant has a lower average claim due to some claimants receiving a 30% lower grant instead of the 80% higher grant</li>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Self-Employment Income Support Scheme fifth grant claims and eligibility</h2>

<p>Around 5 million individuals who reported income from self-employment were assessed for <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>: 3.3 million of these were found to be potentially eligible and 1.7 million were found to be ineligible.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has received 1.1 million claims for the fifth grant of the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (<abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>) from a total potentially eligible population of 3.3 million. This represents a take-up rate of 33%. These claims totalled £2.5 billion with an average award of £2,300 per claimant.</p>

<p>Eligibility for <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> required an individual to have levels of income which met specific tests on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their 2019 to 2020 tax year income, or</li>
  <li>the combination of income for consecutive tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, 2018 to 2019, and 2019 to 2020 where available</li>
</ul>

<p>With 2019 to 2020 tax year income assessed for the first time, some individuals could claim a grant that were previously unable to do so. These individuals are now described as either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>newly self-employed previously ineligible, meaning they were assessed for the third grant, but did not meet the criteria for eligibility, for example because their trading profit was less than their non-trading income</li>
  <li>newly self-employed, meaning they traded for the first in 2019-20 and did not trade in any of 2016-17, 2017-18 or 2018-19</li>
</ul>

<p>Around 500,000 people are brought into scope who either became self-employed in 2019-20; or were ineligible for previous grants, but now may be eligible for the fifth grant on the basis of submitting their 2019-20 tax return.</p>

<p>Of the 1.7 million individuals who were assessed to be ineligible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>84% (1,398,000) had a trading profit that was less than their non-trading income</li>
  <li>32% (532,000) had a trading profit £0 or less</li>
  <li>11% (181,000) had trading profit exceeding £50,000 per year</li>
  <li>8% (133,000) were ineligible for other reasons</li>
</ul>

<p>Figures above represent all criteria that apply to each individual from both sets of tests. Additionally, within each element individuals can be ineligible for multiple reasons and, as a result, there is a high level of overlap between the categories.
The take-up rate of the fifth grant among individuals who were newly self-employed or previously ineligible for the third grant is noticeably lower than the full population.</p>

<p>Figure 1 shows the number of claims for the fifth grant and the potentially eligible population by gender. Table 2 also shows claim values by gender.</p>

<p>Of 5.0 million individuals who were assessed, male claimants make up around two-thirds (65%) and make up a slightly higher proportion (68%) of the potentially eligible population.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has received 788,000 claims from male claimants totalling £1.89 billion compared to 304,000 claims from women for £590 million. Male claimants have a higher take-up rate than female claimants (35% compared to 29%) and their average grant value (£2,400) is higher than the average for female claimants (£1,900). Female claimants had a higher percentage of claims receiving the higher grant than male claimants (79% compared to 68%).</p>

<p>Figure 2 and Table 5 show the assessed for potential eligibility population, the potentially eligible population and volumes of claims made for the fifth grant by age group. Table 5 also shows claim values by age.</p>

<p>Around 89% of individuals who were assessed as potentially eligible were between the ages of 25 and 64, with 92% of claimants coming from this age group. Take-up of the grant in these age-groups is at or above 28%.</p>

<p>The take-up rate is noticeably lower for those who are aged 65 and over (20% have claimed), although they have the highest average claim value at £2,700 and the highest percentage receiving the higher grant (77%). The youngest age group have the lowest average claim value at £1,700 and the lowest percentage receiving the higher grant (64%).</p>

<p>Self-employed individuals are asked to provide a description of their business activity on their self-assessment returns. These activities have been mapped across to the Standard Industrial Classification (<abbr title="Standard Industrial Classification">SIC</abbr>) 2007 to enable analysis to be carried out by industry sector. Where an individual has multiple sources of self-employed income the activity with the highest income has been used for the analysis.</p>

<p>Figures 3 and 4 show the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> populations and number of claims for the fifth grant made by industry sector.</p>

<p>The construction industry has the largest population of individuals who were assessed for potential eligibility with over 1.2 million and over 1 million of these were potentially eligible to apply. By 15 September construction workers had made 378,000 claims totalling £966 million; an average of £2,600 per claimant.</p>

<p>Self-employed individuals in the transportation and storage sector make up 8% of the potentially eligible population and made 136,000 claims totalling £259 million. Administrative and support services also make up 8% of the potentially eligible population and have made 74,000 claims totalling £118m.</p>

<p>The highest rates of being assessed as potentially eligible were from individuals working in the construction industry (84%) and transportation and storage (81%).</p>

<p>Lower rates of being assessed as potentially eligible were found for individuals working in real estate activities (29%), financial and insurance activities (41%), agriculture, forestry and fishing (45%) and professional, scientific and technical activities (46%).</p>

<p>Agriculture, forestry and fishing had the lowest percentage of claimants receiving a higher grant (52%), with the construction industry having the second lowest percentage (60%). The highest percentages of claimants receiving the higher grant were found in other service activities (87%) and arts, entertainment and recreation (85%)</p>

Using the claimant’s Self-Assessment address, claims can be mapped to countries of the UK, English regions and lower geographies.</p>

<p>Figure 6 shows the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> population and number of claims made by country and region.</p>

<p>London has the largest number of individuals that were assessed for eligibility (900,000), the largest potentially eligible population (622,000) and the largest number of claims (268,000) totalling £617 million.</p>

<p>England had the highest proportion of assessed individuals that were found to be eligible (67%), followed by Wales (65%), Scotland (64%) and Northern Ireland (63%).</p>

<p>The take-up rate varies across the UK with most nations and regions having a take-up rate between 28% and 34%. London has the highest take-up rate (43%) while the take-up rates in Northern Ireland (26%) and in the South West are the lowest (25%).</p>

<p>The percentage of claimants receiving the higher grant is very consistent across the UK, with each country and region (other than two exceptions) having between 70% and 73%. The exceptions are Scotland which has the highest percentage (78%) and London which has the lowest percentage (69%).</p>

<p>Self-employed individuals in Scotland have made 65,000 claims totalling £154m; in Wales 39,000 claims for £82m have been made and in Northern Ireland 24,000 claims for £53m have been submitted.</p>

<p>Sections 10-12 of this bulletin consider the breakdown of the number of claims received in each country and region by different demographics (industry, gender and age).  Comparable information relating to the value of claims, the potentially eligible population and take-up rates can be found in tables 6 and 7 in the accompanying tables.</p>

<p>Figure 8 shows the breakdown of claims in each region and country by industry sector.  Construction, transport and administrative services have the largest number of claims overall and are shown as separate categories on the chart. Other smaller industries have been combined.</p>

<p>The industry profile of claimants does not vary greatly between countries and regions. The main exceptions are seen in the construction industry and agriculture, forestry and fishing.</p>

<p>Individuals working in the construction industry account for the highest proportion of claims in every country and region of the UK. London has the highest proportion, with 43% of claims being from those working in construction and Scotland has the lowest with 25%.</p>

<p>The second largest sector by number of claims is Transportation and storage. This industry accounts for 15% of claims in North West, West Midlands and Scotland. The lowest proportion of claims for this sector are in the South West (7%) and Wales (8%).

<p>The area with the highest proportion of male claimants in the potentially eligible population is Northern Ireland (73%) and the lowest areas are Scotland and the South West (64% each). A similar pattern is seen in the number of claims received by 15 September with male claimants accounting for 77% of claims in London, 75% of claims in West Midlands and 65% of claims in South West.</p>

<p>Since the average claim amount is higher for male claimants than female claimants as well, men account for an even higher proportion of total claim values. In the West Midlands (78%) and London (81%) of total claim values are from men. The lowest male share is in the South West where 70% of the total amount claimed is claimed by men.</p>

<p>Figure 9 shows the proportion of claims within each region by gender. The majority of claims for the fifth grant are made by men, ranging from 65% of claims in the South West to 77% in London.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>Background to the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme</h2>

<p>The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (<abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>) was announced on 26 March 2020 as part of the UK government’s support package for businesses and self-employed people during the coronavirus outbreak in early 2020.</p>

<p>The scheme was open to self-employed individuals and members of a partnership who met the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>traded in the tax year 2018 to 2019 and submitted their Self-Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year, and</li>
  <li>traded in the tax year 2019 to 2020, and</li>
  <li>intend to continue to trade in the tax year 2019 to 2020, and</li>
  <li>carried on a trade which had been adversely affected by coronavirus</li>
</ul>

<p>A business could be adversely affected by coronavirus if, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They were unable to work because they:
    <ul>
      <li>were shielding</li>
      <li>were self-isolating</li>
      <li>were on sick leave because of coronavirus</li>
      <li>had caring responsibilities because of coronavirus</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>They have had to scale down or temporarily stop trading because:
    <ul>
      <li>their supply chain has been interrupted</li>
      <li>they have fewer or no customers or clients</li>
      <li>their staff are unable to come in to work</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The grant is not open to limited companies or those operating a trade through a trust.</p>

<p>To work out eligibility, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> first look at the 2018 to 2019 Self-Assessment tax return. Trading profits must be between £0 and £50,000 and at least equal to non-trading income. If an individual was not eligible based on the 2018 to 2019 Self-Assessment tax return, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> then looked at an average of the tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, and 2018 to 2019.</p>

<p>The scheme allows an eligible individual to claim a taxable grant worth 80% of three months’ average trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering 3 months’ worth of profits, and capped at £7,500 in total. The first grant closed for claims on 13 July 2020.</p>

<p>On the 17 August 2020 applications for the second grant opened. This was a taxable grant worth 70% of three months’ average trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering three months’ worth of profits, and capped at £6,570 in total. The second grant closed for claims on 19 October 2020.</p>

<p>On 30 November 2020 applications for the third grant opened. This was a taxable grant worth 80% of three months’ average trading profits, paid out in a single instalment and capped at £7,500 in total. The third grant closed for claims on 29 January 2021.</p>

<p>The eligibility rules changed slightly for the third grant. To be eligible for the third grant an individual must have been eligible for the first and second grant and also declare that they intend to continue to trade and either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are currently actively trading but are impacted by reduced activity, capacity or demand due to COVID-19</li>
  <li>were previously trading but are temporarily unable to do so due to COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<p>The Government announced at Budget 2021 that the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (<abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>) will continue until September, with a fourth and a fifth grant.</p>

<p>On 22 April 2021 applications for the fourth grant opened. The claims window closed on 1 June 2021. Eligibility for the fourth grant is based on a person’s tax returns for either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the 2019 to 2020 tax year, or</li>
  <li>an average of the consecutive tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, 2018 to 2019, and 2019 to 2020, if a person is not eligible based on 2019 to 2020 alone</li>
</ul>

<p>With 2019 to 2020 tax year income assessed for the first time, some individuals could claim a grant that were previously unable to do so. These individuals are now described as either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>newly self-employed, meaning the individual started trading in 2019-20 having   not traded in any of 2016-17, 2017-18 or 2018-19.</li>
  <li>previously ineligible, meaning they were assessed for the third grant, but did not meet the criteria for eligibility, for example because their trading profit was less than their non-trading income</li>
</ul>

<p>On 29 July 2021 applications for the fifth grant opened. The claims window closed on 30 September 2021. This grant introduced two levels of grant based on the reduction in turnover experienced. These two levels are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a grant of 80% of 3 months’ average trading profits capped at £7,500 for those with a turnover down by 30% or more, or</li>
  <li>a grant of 30% of 3 months’ average trading profits capped at £2,850 for those with a turnover down by less than 30%</li>
</ul>

<p>To be eligible for the higher grant, the individual’s turnover must have fallen by 30% or more between their reference year and the pandemic year. Newly self-employed individuals are not subject to the turnover test and can claim the higher grant.</p>

<p>The statistics presented in this release cover claims for the fifth grant in the scheme up to 15 September 2021.</p>

<p>More information about the fifth <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant can be found on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-employment-income-support-scheme-fifth-grant/self-employment-income-support-scheme-fifth-grant" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> coronavirus (COVID-19) guidance and support</a> page on gov.uk.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>Glossary</h2>

<p>The assessed for potential eligibility population are those self-employed individuals who <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> identified as having traded in the tax year 2019 to 2020 and submitted their Self-Assessment tax return on or before 2 March 2021 for that year.</p>

<p>The potentially eligible population are those who <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> identified as being potentially eligible for a <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant based on the information held from their Self-Assessment tax returns relating to the tax years; 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, 2018 to 2019, and 2019 to 2020. This is the group who have been invited to claim for a grant. This does not attempt to assess if a business was affected by coronavirus or whether they continued trading after 2019 to 2020.  So, it is the potentially eligible population based only on the information in the self-assessment returns and not all will apply for the grant.</p>

<p>The assessed to be ineligible population are those self-employed individuals who <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> identified as having traded in the tax year 2019 to 2020 and submitted their Self-Assessment tax return on or before 2 March 2021 for that year but were found not to be eligible after being assessed against the criteria. Trading profits must be between £0 and £50,000 and at least equal to non-trading income. For an individual to be found ineligible based on the income criteria they need to be found ineligible based on the 2019 to 2020 Self-Assessment tax return and the combination of the relevant fields for consecutive tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, 2018 to 2019, and 2019 to 2020. Individuals are also included in the ineligible figures in this publication if an individual’s grant calculation resulted in an amount of £0 or less and if they are recorded as having ceased trading on the self-assessment systems.</p>

<p>The number of claims is defined as the total number of individuals who had submitted a claim for a grant by the 15 September 2021 that had been either paid, sent for payment or had been received and were awaiting various checks. Only non-rejected claims are included, with the majority of these having been paid or sent for payment. However, a small number of claims were still being processed and could be rejected.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span>Methodology and data sources</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.1 </span>Coverage</h3>

<p>This publication covers all self-employed individuals assessed for potential eligibility for the fifth grant as of 15 September 2021. Generally, this includes individuals that <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> identified as having traded in the tax year 2019 to 2020 and submitted their Self-Assessment tax return on or before 2 March 2021 for that year.</p>

<p>Small changes in the numbers of eligible and ineligible individuals between publications may be observed as <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> continue to review and monitor <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> data systems to identify all potentially eligible individuals and to ensure that only genuine <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> customers are invited to claim.</p>

<p>The claim information covers individuals who had submitted a claim for the grant by 15 September 2021 which had not been rejected or failed certain compliance checks.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.2 </span>Data sources used in this release</h3>

<p>The data for this release come from HM Revenue and Customs’ (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s) system for administering <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>. It covers the whole population rather than a sample of people or companies.</p>

<p>Additional data from HM Revenue and Customs’ (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s) Self-Assessment system and other <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> administrative systems has been matched with <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> data to produce the data released here.</p>

<p>The age, gender and postcode of residential address has been collected from the self-assessment account for each individual. The industry information has been collected from the Self-Assessment tax return for the tax year ending 5 April 2020 and relates to the self-employment business description provided on that return.</p>

<p>To produce the geographic breakdowns, the claimants’ residential postcode has been matched to Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>) data that links UK Post Codes to geographic areas. The geographic areas that have been presented in this release are Country and English Region, Local Authority and Parliamentary Constituency.</p>

<p>The self-assessment system is a live operational dataset and, as such, details such as residential address may be updated at any point.  The allocation of geography and industry in these statistics is based on the latest reported information.  As a result, it is possible for an individual claimant’s characteristics to change between the first publication of <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> statistics on 11 June 2020 and subsequent publications.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.3 </span>Ineligible population compared against Self-Employment Income Support Scheme eligibility criteria</h3>

<p>Analysis of the assessed ineligible population against the eligibility criteria is as a result of additional analysis of the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> data in order to provide a description of this group of individuals. An individual can be outside of the criteria for multiple reasons for both the 2019 to 2020 Self-Assessment tax return and the tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, 2018 to 2019, and 2019 to 2020. Additionally, it is possible for the same individual to be ineligible due to different criteria across these two stages. For the purposes of the figures presented here, ineligible individuals are recorded against all the categories that apply to that individual. As a result, individuals can be ineligible in multiple ways and there is a high level of overlap between the categories presented.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span>Strengths and limitations</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.1 </span>Experimental Statistics status</h3>

<p>This release is classed as Experimental Statistics as the methodologies used to produce the statistics are still in their development phase. This does not mean that the statistics are of low quality, but it does signify that the statistics are new and still being developed. As the methodologies are refined and improved, there may be revisions to these statistics.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.2 </span>
<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Self-Employment Income Support Scheme Management Information</h3>

<p>Management information (<abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr>) on the number and value of <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> claims received was previously published by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> at various dates since the scheme was launched on 13 May 2020. 
This <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> report will no longer be published and instead the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Coronavirus statistics page will point towards these statistics.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.3 </span>Differences compared to Survey of Personal Incomes</h3>

<p>In <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Survey of Personal Incomes individuals are considered as self-employed if <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> received or expects to receive SA forms covering income from self-employment in their 2018 to 2019 Self-Assessment tax return.  
The population assessed for <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> eligibility here includes only those individuals who submitted 2019 to 2020 Self-Assessment tax returns by 2 March 2021 and included data on self-employment in that return.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.4 </span>Differences compared to other sources</h3>

<p>Other organisations such as the Office for National Statistics and Institute for Fiscal Studies have published information about <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> either from surveys or estimates derived from previously published data.  We believe these <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> statistics provide a more reliable picture as they are based on administrative data from the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> claim and Self-Assessment systems.</p>
