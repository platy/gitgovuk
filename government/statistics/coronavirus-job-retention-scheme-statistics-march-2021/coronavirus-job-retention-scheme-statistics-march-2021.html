<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (<abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>) was announced on 20 March 2020 and has supported employers in paying their employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>This is the tenth release of Official Statistics on the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>. This release provides analysis of claims for periods up to 28 February 2021. The data used includes claims submitted to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> by 15 March 2021.</p>

<p>The data for February is not yet fully complete as while claims relating to February should have been filed by 15 March 2021, employers could file claims later with the agreement of <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> if they had a reasonable excuse. Claims for February can also be amended until 29 March 2021. Together these factors are likely to have a small effect on the statistics.</p>

<p>Based on figures for January, it is estimated that the number of employments furloughed reported for February could increase by around 4%. The February figures should therefore be considered as provisional and will be revised in a future release.</p>

<p>This release also presents the cumulative number of jobs furloughed since the start of the scheme in March 2020 up to 15 March 2021. It also includes figures for the cumulative number of <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes that have claimed under the Job Retention Scheme and the total amount claimed. This replaces the previously published management information figures. In addition, this release includes new tables with cumulative figures by local authority and parliamentary constituency.</p>

<p>This release presents breakdowns at 31 January and 28 February 2021, including new tables at the 3-digit <abbr title="Standard Industrial Classification">SIC 2007</abbr> level and a breakdown of furloughing for local authority by broad industry sector.</p>

<p>We will continue to publish statistics on the Job Retention Scheme and the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension in future months. These statistics are Experimental Statistics and are subject to revisions. Further information on the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>, the compilation of these statistics and the meaning of the term Experimental Statistics is provided later in this publication.</p>

<h3>Next release</h3>

<p>The next release will be published on 6 May 2021.</p>

<h2>Main points</h2>

<p>The key points from this release covering the period to 28 February 2021 are below. Figures for February 2021 are provisional and subject to revision as additional claims for the period are received. Broadly, the age, gender and regional patterns of furloughed employments in February, and the business size breakdown of employers, are similar to those seen in January.</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of employments furloughed grew sharply in November and stood at 4.0 million at 31 December. The employments furloughed increased further in January to 4.9 million employments furloughed on 31 January (revised figure following late claims and amendments)</li>
  <li>provisional figures for February are slightly lower at 4.7 million furloughed at 28 February, but final levels are expected to be broadly similar to January once all claims and amendments for February have been received</li>
  <li>the levels of furloughing seen in these figures reflects the changes to restrictions on individuals, households and businesses across the UK since the autumn</li>
  <li>provisional figures show that all sectors have seen a slight reduction in levels of furlough between 31 January and 28 February. Once all claims and amendments for February have been received it is expected that we will see broad consistency in the levels of furlough for all sectors across the two months. The other service activities sector is an exception to this, which saw a slight increase in furloughing between 31 January and provisional figures for 28 February</li>
  <li>at 31 January, 41% of employers had staff furloughed. Provisional estimates show that this remained the same at 28 February. 16% of employments eligible for furlough were furloughed at 31 January. Provisional estimates show this remained broadly consistent at 15% at 28 February, but final figures are expected to show a take-up rate of 16% when all claims and amendments for February have been received</li>
  <li>since the start of the scheme a cumulative total of 11.4 million jobs have been supported by the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> at various times. This is across all claims submitted to 15 March 2021</li>
  <li>the accommodation and food services sector had the highest take-up rate at 31 January at 68% of eligible employers furloughing and provisional estimates show this increased to 69% of employers at 28 February. 1.23 million employments were furloughed in this sector on 31 January. Provisional estimates show the number of employments furloughed decreased to 1.15 million on 28 February</li>
  <li>furloughing of staff in the wholesale and retail sector peaked on 24 April at 1.85 million employments furloughed. This dropped to 356,400 employments furloughed at 31 October. The number of employments furloughed increased throughout November, December and January to 985,100 at 31 January. Provisional figures show that at 28 February, furloughing in this sector had decreased to 918,500 employments furloughed</li>
  <li>this publication includes a more detailed breakdown of furlough rates by 3-digit <abbr title="Standard Industrial Classification">SIC 2007</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the beverage serving activities sector had the highest proportion of eligible employments furloughed at 31 January, with a take-up rate of 86%. This was followed by the hotels and similar accommodation sector which had 79% of its eligible employments furloughed. Provisional figures for 28 February show these sectors had employment take-up rates of 78% and 69% respectively, the largest take-up rates of all sectors</li>
  <li>the restaurants and mobile food service activities had the highest number of employments furloughed at 31 January with 466,400 employments furloughed. Provisional figures show this sector had 444,100 employments furloughed at 28 February</li>
  <li>in the passenger air transport sector, there were 200 employers (61% of employers eligible) furloughing 35,100 employments (52% of eligible employments) at 31 January. At 28 February, provisional figures show this remained similar with 35,300 employments furloughed</li>
  <li>overall, medium and large sized employers had a lower proportion of their employees furloughed under the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> than small and micro-sized employers in January and February</li>
  <li>provisional figures for 28 February show that employers with 250 or more employees had 9% of eligible employees furloughed compared with 15% across all employers. Employers with 2 to 4 employees had the highest proportion of eligible employees furloughed at 35%</li>
  <li>across the UK, where it was possible to link the data, 2.40 million females were furloughed at 31 January compared with 2.24 million males. Provisional estimates show a broadly similar pattern with 2.34 million females furloughed at 28 February and 2.14 million males</li>
  <li>provisional figures for the end of February showed that London had the highest furlough take-up rate at 17% of jobs where the employee was resident in London furloughed against a UK average of 15%. London also had the highest take-up in January</li>
  <li>the under 18 age band had the highest take up rate for both females and males at 31 January, 40% and 30% respectively. Provisional estimates for 28 February show that the under 18 age band continued to have the highest take-up rates at 39% for females and 28% for males</li>
  <li>employees aged 18 to 24 and 65 and over were more likely than average to be furloughed while levels of furloughing were lowest among employees aged 50 to 54</li>
  <li>1.37 million employments were on partial furlough at 31 January, 28% of the total employments furloughed. Provisional estimates show this figure decreased to 1.27 million employments furloughed at 28 February, 27% of the total employments furloughed</li>
</ul>

This should be sent to <a href="mailto:CJRS.Statistics.Enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>.Statistics.Enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.  Responses will then be taken into consideration when developing future releases.</p>

<p>For these statistics, an ‘employer’ is defined as a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme, and ‘employments’ are defined according to the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> criteria. Further details are within the <a class="govuk-link" href="#background">background</a> section.</p>

<p>An individual employed by more than one employer is counted once for each employment furloughed. Two individuals who have been employed in the same role with an employer at different times are counted as two separate employments. In this release the terms ‘employments’ and ‘jobs’ are used interchangeably.</p>

<p>As with previous releases, where we have been unable to match the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims with other <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> data, we have denoted this as ‘unknown’ in the tables within this release.</p>

<p>This release reports a <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> take-up rate for both employers and employments, where appropriate. The take-up rate has been calculated using <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> data, to estimate the eligible population of both employers and employments.</p>

<p>When the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension was introduced on 1 November 2020, it again became possible to claim support for furloughing jobs that had not been previously furloughed. The criteria for eligibility for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> were amended for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension.</p>

<p>For furloughing from November 2020 onwards, the numbers of jobs presented as ‘eligible employments’ and used to calculate take-up figures reflect the criteria for eligibility for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension. They are based on a list of employees employed on 30 October 2020 and included in <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Real Time Information submissions for 20 March 2020 to 30 October 2020.</p>

<p>The figures for February 2021 are based on claims received to the deadline of 15 March 2021. In some circumstances, late claims can be made with a reasonable excuse and in agreement with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. Claims may also be amended until 29 March 2021. Therefore, the data for February 2021 is incomplete and should be considered to be provisional.</p>

<p>It is estimated that the overall total number of employments furloughed in February will be in the region of 4% higher once all claims are submitted and revisions applied.</p>

<p>Except for the figures in the next section (titled: Cumulative claims and jobs furloughed since the start of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>), the data in this release shows the total number of employments furloughed each day from March 2020 to February 2021.</p>

<p>The first three releases of these statistics, published in June, July and August 2020, reported estimates of the total number of jobs that had been furloughed at any time over the March to June period, based on the latest data available at the time of those releases. With the introduction of flexible furlough on 1 July, this statistical release series began reporting estimates of the number of jobs furloughed each day, with additional breakdowns for the last day in each month.</p>

<p>The data presented in this release comes from combining details about furloughing from the job level data and the total number of furloughed staff included in each claim.</p>

<h2>Cumulative claims and jobs furloughed since the start of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>
</h2>

<p>This section of the release presents the cumulative number of jobs furloughed since the start of the scheme in March 2020 up to 15 March 2021. It also includes figures for the cumulative number of <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes that have claimed under the Job Retention Scheme and the total amount claimed.</p>

<p>Table 1 shows that there have been 11.4 million unique jobs supported by the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> since its inception. This is a cumulative figure and covers all jobs furloughed at any time since the start of the scheme.</p>

<p>As described in detail in the methodology section of this release, the methodology used to calculate this figure has been improved and now uses job-level data rather than totals from claim forms submitted by employers. As a result, the figure is not directly comparable with the previously published management information figures.</p>

<p>This methodology change does not affect published figures on the number of jobs furloughed at the end of each month, or the more detailed statistics on the number of jobs furloughed each day.</p>

<p>An individual employed by more than one employer is counted once for each employment furloughed. Two individuals who have been employed in the same role with an employer at different times are counted as two separate employments. In this release the terms ‘employments’ and ‘jobs’ are used interchangeably.</p>

<p>The figures in table 1 are based on claims received up to 15 March 2021, the deadline for claims relating to February 2021. As well as claims made for February and earlier, these figures include claims for employments furloughed after February 2021 where the claim was received by 15 March 2021.</p>

<p>Table 1 also includes the total number of employer <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes that had claimed support up to 15 March 2021 and the value of claims submitted.</p>

<p>All these figures together with the figures previously published as management information on the main <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> COVID-19 statistics page can be found in table 1 of the spreadsheet that accompanies this release.</p>

<p>Figures on the cumulative number of jobs furloughed broken down by local authority and Parliamentary constituency can also be found in tables 1a and 1b of the spreadsheet that accompanies this release.</p>

<h2>Employments furloughed over time</h2>

<p>This section of the release presents the number of employments furloughed each day from the scheme’s start up to 28 February 2021. The chart in figure 1 shows the number of jobs furloughed under claims for support to the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>. The underlying data for this figure can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/972000/CJRS_Statistics_March_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx" class="govuk-link">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>Key points to note from <a class="govuk-link" href="#fig-1">figure 1</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>initially the number of employments furloughed increased quickly following the announcement of the scheme on 20 March, reaching 4.8 million on 23 March and 6.8 million by the end of March</li>
  <li>following further strong growth at the start of April, the number of employments furloughed increased gradually and peaked at 8.9 million on 8 May 2020. After the early May peak, the number of employments furloughed decreased slowly, before a fall of around 670,000 employments between the end of May and the start of June</li>
  <li>the number of employments that were furloughed then continued to reduce until the end of October, falling from 6.8 million at 30 June to 2.4 million at 31 October</li>
  <li>the number of employments furloughed increased on 1 November to 3.7 million, this figure continued to rise throughout November to 3.9 million on 30 November, corresponding to increased restrictions on individuals, households and businesses seen across the UK in the autumn</li>
  <li>the number of employments furloughed remained steady throughout December, with 4.0 million employments furloughed at 31 December</li>
  <li>latest figures show the employments furloughed increased in January to 4.9 million employments furloughed on 31 January, coinciding with tighter restrictions on business opening that were introduced on 6 January</li>
  <li>provisional figures for February are slightly lower at 4.7 million furloughed at 28 February, but final levels are expected to be broadly similar across January and February once all claims and amendments for February have been received</li>
</ul>

<h2>Employments furloughed over time by industry</h2>

<p>This section breaks down the overall time series included above by the employer’s industrial sector. Figure 2 is a set of charts, one for each of 15 industrial sectors experiencing higher numbers of jobs furloughed. The underlying data for this figure and 6 other sector categories not shown in the chart can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/972000/CJRS_Statistics_March_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx" class="govuk-link">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>The key points to note from <a class="govuk-link" href="#fig-2">figure 2</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>following on from the latest release which covered the period to 31 January, provisional figures show that all sectors have seen a slight reduction in levels of furlough between 31 January and 28 February. Once all claims and amendments for February have been received it is expected that we will see broad consistency in the levels of furlough for all sectors</li>
  <li>the other service activities sector is an exception to this, which saw a slight increase in furloughing between 31 January and provisional figures for 28 February</li>
  <li>furloughing of staff in the wholesale and retail sector peaked on 24 April at 1.85 million employments furloughed. This dropped to 356,400 employments furloughed at 31 October. The number of employments furloughed increased throughout November, December and January to 985,100 at 31 January. Provisional figures show that at 28 February, furloughing in this sector had decreased to 918,500 employments furloughed</li>
  <li>accommodation and food services peaked at 1.65 million employments furloughed on 10 April, this fell to 1.23 million employments furloughed at 31 January. Provisional figures show that the number of employments furloughed decreased through February to 1.15 million at 28 February</li>
  <li>the manufacturing sector had a peak of 911,000 employments furloughed on 17 April. This declined to 188,200 at 31 October. Through November, December and January the number of employments furloughed increased to 317,500 at 31 January. Provisional estimates show that this figure dropped to 294,800 at 28 February</li>
  <li>in construction, furloughing peaked on 14 April with 723,600 employments furloughed, this fell to 169,700 at 30 November. This figure increased through December and January to 245,700 employments furloughed at 31 January. Provisional estimates show that at the end of February the number of employments furloughed had decreased to 229,200</li>
  <li>furloughing in the arts and entertainment sector peaked later than other sectors on 15 May with 455,100 employments furloughed on that date. By 31 October this had dropped to 159,600 employments furloughed. Through November, December and January this figure increased to 317,700 employments furloughed at 31 January. Provisional figures show that this figure remained broadly similar with 313,400 employments furloughed at 28 February</li>

<h2>Employments furloughed over time by employer size</h2>

<p>In addition to the sectoral breakdown we also provide a breakdown of the number of employments furloughed per day by employer size. The employer size has been calculated based on an estimate of the number of employments eligible to be furloughed. We assume a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme to be the equivalent of an employer.</p>

<p>Presented in figure 3 is a set of charts, one for each employer size band. The underlying data for these charts can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/972000/CJRS_Statistics_March_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx" class="govuk-link">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>The key points to note from <a class="govuk-link" href="#fig-3">figure 3</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>across most employer sizes, the number of employments furloughed increased in January and then remained broadly constant in February</li>
  <li>at 31 December, 1.24 million employments were furloughed by large employers with 250 or more employees. This increased to 1.64 million at 31 January. Provisional estimates show that the number of employments furloughed decreased to 1.50 million at 28 February</li>
  <li>employers with 20 to 49 employments had 559,800 employments furloughed on 31 December. This figure increased to 658,200 at 31 January. Provisional estimates show that the number of employments furloughed remained similar at 634,800 at 28 February</li>
  <li>employers with one employment had 172,000 employments furloughed at 31 December. The employments furloughed then increased through January, dropping slightly at the end of the month to 195,000 at 31 January. Provisional figures show that this remained broadly constant at 191,100 at 28 February</li>

<h2>Employments furloughed over time by country and region</h2>

<p>This section provides a geographic breakdown of the number of employments furloughed each day from 1 July 2020 up to 28 February 2021. This is based on the residential address information that <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> holds for employees. This does not directly translate to the employee’s usual place of work, or employer’s centre of operations which may be in a different region.</p>

<p>For example, an employee who lives in Wales and normally commutes daily to work in Bristol would be included within the count for Wales, rather than for South West England. At present these statistics are only available for 1 July onwards (see methodology section for more information). Figures for February should be considered to be provisional.</p>

<p>Presented in figure 4 is a set of charts, one for each region. The underlying data for these charts can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/972000/CJRS_Statistics_March_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>The key points to note from <a href="#fig-4" class="govuk-link">figure 4</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>across all English regions, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the number of employments furloughed increased from 31 December to 31 January. Provisional figures show that furloughing then remained similar through February</li>
  <li>1.90 million employments were furloughed in England at 31 October. This figure increased through to 2021 with 3.89 million employments furloughed at 31 January. Provisional estimates show that the number of employments furloughed was consistent in February with 3.75 million at 28 February</li>
  <li>in London – the English region with the most furloughed staff from July 2020 to February 2021, there were 644,400 employments furloughed at 30 November. This increased to 654,100 employments furloughed at 31 December and 735,600 employments furloughed at 31 January. Provisional estimates show similar levels of furloughing in February with 710,800 employments furloughed at 28 February</li>
  <li>the number of employments furloughed in Scotland on 30 November was 228,300. This figure increased to 288,900 employments furloughed at 31 December and 373,000 employments furloughed at 31 January. Provisional figures show a broad consistency in the number of employments furloughed to 364,100 at 28 February</li>
  <li>the number of employments furloughed in Wales was 125,000 at 30 November. This increased to 158,700 employments furloughed at 31 December and increased further to 183,400 employments furloughed at 31 January. Provisional estimates show the number of employments furloughed was similar in February with 175,200 at 28 February</li>
  <li>on 30 November, the number of furloughed employments in Northern Ireland was 79,300. This increased to 96,500 employments furloughed at 31 December and 109,000 employments furloughed at 31 January. Provisional figures show that the number of employments furloughed remained consistent through February to 106,500 at 28 February</li>

<h2>Employments furloughed over time by gender</h2>

<p>This section provides analysis showing the number of employments furloughed each day from 1 July 2020 up to 28 February 2021, broken down by the claimants’ gender.  The underlying data for figure 5 can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/972000/CJRS_Statistics_March_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx" class="govuk-link">accompanying spreadsheet</a>. At present these statistics are only available for 1 July onwards (see the <a href="#methodology" class="govuk-link">methodology section</a> for more information).</p>

<p>The key points to note from <a href="#fig-5" class="govuk-link">figure 5</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>since 1 July, more employments have been furloughed with female job holders than where the employee was male</li>
  <li>for employments where the employee was female, there were 1.19 million employments furloughed at 31 October. This increased to 1.92 million employments furloughed at 31 December and then increased further to 2.40 million employments furloughed at 31 January. Provisional figures show that this number remained broadly consistent throughout February to 2.34 million at 28 February</li>
  <li>for employments where the employee was male, there were 1.14 million at 31 October. At 30 November this had increased to 1.79 million and continued to increase through December to 1.88 million employments furloughed at 31 December</li>
  <li>after increasing further in January to 2.24 million employments at 31 January, provisional figures show that this was similar in February with 2.14 million employments furloughed at 28 February</li>

<h2>Employments furloughed over time by age</h2>

<p>This section provides analysis for the number of employments furloughed each day from 1 July 2020 up to 28 February 2021, broken down by age band. The claimant’s age is calculated at 1 March 2020 for employments furloughed up to 31 October, and at 1 November 2020 for employments furloughed from 1 November onwards.</p>

<p>Figure 6 is a set of charts, one for each age band. The underlying data for figure 6 can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/972000/CJRS_Statistics_March_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx" class="govuk-link">accompanying spreadsheet</a>. At present these statistics are only available for 1 July onwards (see methodology section for more information).</p>

<p>The key points to note from <a class="govuk-link" href="#fig-6">figure 6</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>across all age bands the number of employments furloughed increased between 31 December and 31 January and then remained broadly similar through February</li>
  <li>for employments where the employee was aged 25 to 34, the number of employments was 526,000 on 31 October, the highest across all age bands. This increased to 865,800 at 30 November, 887,900 at 31 December and 1.06 million at 31 January. Provisional figures show that this figure was similar at 1.02 million at 28 February</li>
  <li>the number of employments furloughed with employees in the 18 to 24 age band was 325,300 on 31 October. This increased to 641,300 on 30 November, 651,000 on 31 December and 770,400 at 31 January. At 28 February, provisional figures show that 719,300 employments were furloughed in the 18-24 age band</li>
  <li>where the employee was 65 or over, the number of employments furloughed was 111,900 at 31 October. At 30 November, the number of employments furloughed had risen to 156,200 before a small decline to 153,200 at 31 December. This then increased again to 186,200 employments furloughed at 31 January. Provisional estimates show that the number of employments remained broadly constant in February to 184,600 at 28 February</li>

<h2>Employments furloughed over time by furlough type</h2>

<p>This section provides a breakdown of the overall time series by employments furloughed fully and partially. On 1 July, the option was introduced for employers to furlough their employees for part of their usual hours, with the employee free to work the remainder. Therefore, the time series shown in figure 7 starts at 1 July.</p>

<p>The underlying data for figure 7 can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/972000/CJRS_Statistics_March_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx" class="govuk-link">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>The key points to note in <a class="govuk-link" href="#fig-7">figure 7</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of employments furloughed on a full-time basis decreased month on month from July to 31 October, where it stood at 1.36 million. The number of employments fully furloughed then increased through November to 2.36 million at 30 November before a slight decline to 2.33 million employments furloughed at 31 December</li>
  <li>this increased again in January with 3.29 million employments fully furloughed at 31 January and provisional figures show that this was similar in February with 3.23 million employments fully furloughed at 28 February</li>
  <li>the number of employments claimed for while the employee was working some of their usual hours has remained steady between when this was made possible on 1 July and October. At 31 October there were 977,200 employments flexibly furloughed. This increased to 1.37 million at 30 November and 1.48 million at 31 December</li>
  <li>the number of employments flexibly furloughed decreased to 1.37 million at 31 January, with provisional figures showing a further decrease to 1.27 million at 28 February</li>
  <li>this means that a lower proportion of jobs were partially furloughed in January and February 2021 than in November and December 2020, which is consistent with the greater restrictions on business activity in place during January and February</li>
</ul>

<h2>Furloughing by Employer Size at 31 January and provisional figures for 28 February</h2>

<p>Where it has been possible to match <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> data to Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>), we have estimated the size of each employer in terms of number of employees potentially eligible for <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> support.</p>

<p>For this data, we have assumed that <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme is the equivalent to an employer. For some employers, this is not an exact one-to-one equivalent. For example, some organisations operate multiple payrolls for different groups of employees and in other situations, a group of companies may pool their payrolls together under one <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme. However, in our view <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes provides a reasonable proxy for employers for the purposes of this release.</p>

<p>The employer size has been calculated based on an estimate of the number of employments eligible to be furloughed.</p>

<h2>Furloughing by Countries and Regions at 31 January and provisional figures for 28 February, including gender breakdown</h2>

<p>We also provide a geographic breakdown of <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims based on the residential address information that <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> holds for employees. This does not directly translate to the employee’s usual place of work, or employer’s centre of operations which may be in a different region. For example, an employee who lives in Wales and normally commutes daily to work in Bristol would be included within the count for Wales, rather than for South West England.</p>

<p>Figures 8a and 8b show the number of furloughed employments by each of the English regions, and the totals for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. For some employments it has not been possible so far to link the employment to the employees’ area of residence and these are included in the unknown category.</p>

<p>The key points from figures <a class="govuk-link" href="#fig-8a">8a</a> and <a href="#fig-8b" class="govuk-link">8b</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>London and the South East accounted for 1.39 million of the furloughed employments at 31 January. Provisional estimates show this was similar in February when they accounted for 1.34 million of the furloughed employments at 28 February</li>

  <li>figures for 31 January and provisional estimates for 28 February show that the under 18 age group had the lowest number of employments furloughed across both months, 115,000 employments at 31 January and 111,200 employments furloughed at 28 February</li>

<p>The key points to note are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at 31 January, across all countries and regions except for Northern Ireland, the accommodation and food services sector had the highest number of employments furloughed, followed by the wholesale and retail sector.

  <li>provisional estimates for 28 February show the accommodation and food service sector had the highest number of employments furloughed in all local authorities except for West Midlands where the wholesale and retail sector overtook the accommodation and food services sector</li>
  <li>in London, 26% of the employments furloughed were in the accommodation and food services sector on 31 January. Provisional estimates show this was similar in February at 25% at 28 February</li>
  <li>Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland combined had 164,400 employments furloughed in the accommodation and food services sector at 31 January. Provisional estimates show this remained broadly consistent at 158,300 at 28 February</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The government announced the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (<abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>) on 20 March 2020. It was introduced to support employers through the COVID-19 period, this has commonly been referred to as the furlough scheme. It works by providing grants to employers of up to a maximum 80% of salary to a maximum value of £2,500 per employee (until the end of August).</p>

<p>Up to the end of July, the scheme also met some of the cost of employer pension contributions and employer National Insurance Contributions.</p>

<p>The scheme is based around <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) system. For an employer to qualify for the scheme they need to have created a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme by 19 March 2020. In these statistics, an employer is defined as a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme.</p>

<p>The rules for an employment to qualify to be covered by the scheme are set out in guidance, and two of the key rules are that the furloughed employee must have been employed on 19 March 2020 and the employer must have submitted a Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) submission to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> for the employee by this date.</p>

<p>Up to date information about the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-for-wage-costs-through-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme">online</a>. The pages on applying for support, for example, include further details of the eligibility criteria. Older versions of the guidance can be found in the National Archive by following the links from the guidance pages.</p>

<h3>Changes to the scheme from 1 July 2020</h3>

<p>The scheme closed to new entrants from 30 June 2020. After this date, employers have only been able to furlough employees they furloughed for a full three-week period prior to 30 June 2020.</p>

<p>As a consequence of the closure of the scheme to additional employees and the minimum three-week furlough period that applied until the end of June, the final date that an employer could have furloughed an employee for the first time was 10 June 2020.</p>

<p>Employers had until 31 July 2020 to make any claims in respect of the period to 30 June 2020. A small number of claims have been made since this date. These claims relate to exceptions as set out in the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> guidance (for example, for employees being furloughed who have been absent from work and who had been paid Statutory Maternity Pay).</p>

<p>From 1 July 2020, employers have had the flexibility to bring furloughed employees back to work part time. Additionally, employers have the flexibility to decide the hours and shift patterns of their employees – with the government continuing to pay 80% of salaries for the hours they do not work.</p>

<p>From 1 September 2020, the scheme supported 70% of salaries for hours not worked, reducing to 60% from 1 October 2020.</p>

<p>When claiming the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> grant for furloughed hours, employers need to report and claim for a minimum period of a week. Employers had until 30 November 2020 to submit claims for support from the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Changes to the scheme from 1 November 2020</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> scheme was extended from 1 November 2020. The rules for an employment to qualify to be covered by the extended scheme are set out in guidance.</p>

<p>The two key rules are that the furloughed employee must have been employed on 30 October 2020, and the employer must have submitted a Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) submission to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> for the employee between 20 March 2020 and 30 October 2020, notifying a payment of earnings for that employee. This may differ where they have made employees redundant, or they stopped working for the employer on or after 23 September 2020 and have subsequently been re-employed.</p>

<p>For claim periods from 1 November to 30 April 2021, employers with a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme can claim 80% of an employee’s usual hours worked, up to a maximum of £2,500 per month. The £2,500 cap is proportional to the hours not worked.</p>

<h3>Changes to the scheme from 1 May 2021</h3>

<p>It was announced on 3 March 2021 that the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> was to be extended further, beyond 30 April 2021 to 30 September 2021. To be eligible for furlough from the 1 May 2021 onwards, the employee must have been employed on 2 March 2021 and the employer must have submitted a Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) submission to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> for the employee between 20 March 2020 and 2 March 2021, notifying a payment of earnings for that employee.</p>

<p>For claim periods from 1 May to 30 June 2021, employers with a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme will be able to claim 80% of an employee’s usual hours worked, up to a maximum of £2,500 per month. The £2,500 cap is proportional to the hours not worked.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2021, the scheme supports 70% of salaries for hours not worked, reducing to 60% from 1 August 2021.</p>

<h2>Glossary</h2>

<p>An employer is defined within this release as a Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) Scheme. In some circumstances this does not map directly to what is commonly understood to be an employer. For example, some organisations operate multiple payrolls, and in other situations, a group of companies may pool their payrolls together under one <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme. However, in our view <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes provides a reasonable proxy for employers for the purposes of this release.</p>

<p>An employment is defined within this release as anyone who meets the scheme criteria set out within the published guidance. We have applied this definition in order to keep the presentation simple and the difficulty in separating out Office Holders (such as directors) from what are generally considered employees. Further information on the eligibility criteria is set out in the <a href="#background" class="govuk-link">background section</a> section above.</p>

<h2>Measuring the data</h2>

<h3>Data source and collection</h3>

<p>The data for this release comes from HM Revenue and Customs’ <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims. It covers the whole population rather than a sample of people or companies, and it will allow for more detailed estimates of the population.</p>

<p>These statistics are classed as <a rel="external" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/guidetoexperimentalstatistics" class="govuk-link">Experimental Statistics</a> as they are still in development.</p>

<p>Additional data from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Real Time Information system has been matched with <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> data in order to produce the statistics released here.</p>

<h3>Coverage</h3>

<p>This publication covers all <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims made by employers from the start of the scheme up to 15 March 2021 for support for the wages of furloughed staff up to 28 February 2021. The data for February is incomplete as claims relating to February may still be filed; thus, the figures for February should therefore be considered provisional results and will be revised in future releases.</p>

<h3>Methodology (except table 1)</h3>

<p>This section provides notes on the methodology and implications for interpreting the figures.</p>

<p>The statistics in this release count employments. Therefore (for example), an employee with jobs at two employers will be counted twice if both jobs are furloughed.</p>

<p>The criteria for eligibility for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> were amended for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension.</p>

<p>The numbers of jobs presented as ‘eligible employments’ and used to calculate take-up figures reflect the criteria for eligibility for the extension to the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> scheme. They are based on a list of employees employed on 30 October 2020 and included in <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Real Time Information submissions for 20 March 2020 to 30 October 2020. Only employments in <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> submissions received by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> by 30 October are counted.</p>

<p>Following the criteria for qualifying for the scheme, this is supplemented by a list of people who were employed on 23 September 2020 but who left their job before 30 October and who were later re-employed by the same employer.</p>

<p>In this release employers are described as eligible to claim the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> if they employed staff for which the criteria to be eligible for furlough were met. Employers are grouped into size bands in some tables according to the number of employees they had who were eligible to be furloughed under the extension to <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>.</p>

<p>In some circumstances <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> holds incomplete information about employments, for example where a leaving date had not been submitted by employer. In this situation, an estimate of the probability that an individual was employed on the qualifying dates has been used.</p>

<p>The assessment of whether a person was employed on the qualifying dates is based on the methodology used for the joint <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>/ONS statistics release, <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/earningsandemploymentfrompayasyouearnrealtimeinformationuk/march2021" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Earnings and employment from Pay As You Earn Real Time Information</a>.</p>

<p>Employers making claims for 100 or more employees at a time are required to submit the details of the employees furloughed in a spreadsheet-type file. While these claims have been processed from a customer service perspective, the processing of this information for these statistics has been complex and the processing of data on some employments has not been completed. This is a factor behind the unknown category in the tables.</p>

<p>The completeness of this data has gradually improved since the first release, and we expect some further (smaller) improvements.</p>

<p>The geographic and flexible furlough breakdowns of employments include all employees that employers have furloughed where it has been possible to link claim data on furloughed employments to classifying information (such as the employee’s gender and address).</p>

<p>The linking has been performed using employees’ National Insurance numbers to data held within <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) system. When the employer-submitted National Insurance numbers are not of sufficient quality to be matched with other <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> data, the employments have been categorised as ‘unknown’.</p>

<p>The geographic breakdowns in the tables and maps use a postcode lookup file from Office for National Statistics (ONS) data to link UK postcodes to geographic areas.</p>

<p>Industrial sector information is based on the Interdepartmental Business Register (IDBR) produced by the ONS. Where <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes are absent from the IDBR, we have used sector information from Companies House, linking on employer name where possible. This provides Standard Industrial Classification codes (<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialclassificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007" rel="external" class="govuk-link">UK <abbr title="Standard Industrial Classification">SIC 2007</abbr></a>) for employers that have made a claim. Where we have been unable to determine SIC codes, we have reported the sector as ‘unknown’.</p>

<p>The time series in this bulletin show figures for the number of employments furloughed each day, using all claims submitted to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> by 15 March 2021.</p>

<p>In producing the time series statistics some challenges had to be tackled. These included dealing with data on amendments to claims and claims for overlapping periods. In addition, claims for 100 or more furloughed staff may include staff furloughed for varying periods. These factors combined with some incomplete data (as mentioned above) make counting the number of employees furloughed over time complex.</p>

<p>The method employed is designed to generally prevent overcounting employments and may in certain circumstances very slightly undercount. Consequently, for the period to the end of June, the time series presented in this bulletin may typically slightly undercount the number of furloughed employments.</p>

<h3>Methodology (cumulative figures - table 1)</h3>

<p>The methodology used for the figure for the cumulative number of jobs ever furloughed since the start of the scheme (table 1 above and tables 1, 1a, 1b in the spreadsheet accompanying this release) has been improved. For figures up to 13 December 2020, the method used was based on the figures for the total number of jobs furloughed on each claim. This choice had to be made because at the time the job-level information available for statistical purposes was incomplete for larger claims.</p>

<p>Over time – and particularly with the introduction of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension – the previous method had started to undercount the total number of jobs furloughed.</p>

<p>The original method took the total number of jobs furloughed from all the claims made by each <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme. It then found the maximum number of jobs furloughed for each employer across all their claims. Finally, it summed these values for all <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes to arrive at a total number of employees furloughed.</p>

<p>The new approach uses job-level data. For this, we calculate the number of unique National Insurance numbers in the claims made by each employer, and then sum these. This information is supplemented by the employee’s name and payroll number in a small number of cases.</p>

<p>The cumulative number of employers making <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims is calculated as the number of distinct <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes that have submitted a claim since the start of the scheme. The cumulative value of claims made is calculated as the sum of the amount claimed for each submitted claim.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of flexible furlough employers have been able to cancel claims made on the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims portal within 72 hours of making a claim. From the figures dated 15 February 2021 onwards, claims cancelled in this way have been excluded.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> separately publishes figures for the value of claims paid to employers, in its monthly publication on tax receipts. Those figures are on a cash basis and reflect the time that the payments were made rather than the date that claims were received, so are slightly different to the figures included in this release.</p>

<h3>Rounding of figures in the tables accompanying this release</h3>

<p>Rounding has been applied to the figures in the tables accompanying this release, with counts rounded to the nearest 10 for Tables 17 and 18 Local Authority by sector, and to the nearest 100 for all other tables, amounts are rounded to the nearest million.</p>

<h2>Strengths and limitations</h2>

<p>HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) grants pre-release access to <a rel="external" href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/about-the-authority/what-we-do/uk-statistical-system/types-of-official-statistics/" class="govuk-link">Official Statistics</a> publications, and in accordance with the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> policy, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hmrc-statistics-pre-release-access-list" class="govuk-link">pre-release access has been granted to a number of people</a> to enable the preparation of a ministerial briefing.</p>

<h3>Experimental Statistics status</h3>

<p>The release is classed as Experimental Statistics as the methodologies used to produce the statistics are still in their development phase. This does not mean that the statistics are of low quality, but it does signify that the statistics are new and still being developed. As the methodologies are refined and improved, there may be revisions to these statistics.</p>

<p>Rather than waiting until the development work has been completed, the statistics are being published now to involve potential users in developing the statistics. We hope that this encourages users to provide us with their thoughts and suggestions of how useful the statistics are and what can be done to improve them. Comments can be sent by email to <a href="mailto:CJRS.Statistics.Enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>.Statistics.Enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>More information about what it means for Official Statistics to be classified as Experimental Statistics is available from the <a rel="external" href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/experimental-statistics-official-statistics-in-development" class="govuk-link">Office for Statistics Regulation</a>.</p>

<h3>Office for Statistics regulation review</h3>

<p>These statistics have been produced quickly in response to developing world events. The Office for Statistics Regulation, on behalf of the UK Statistics Authority, has reviewed them against several key aspects of the Code of Practice for Statistics and regards them as consistent with the Code’s pillars of Trustworthiness, Quality and Value.</p>

<h3>Strengths of the data</h3>

<p>The data used in this release includes all claims made by employers up until 15 March 2021 for support for the wages of furloughed staff up to 28 February 2021, rather than a sample. We have linked <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> data to Pay As You Earn Real Time Information data (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) to provide the additional information presented in this release.</p>

<h3>Revisions</h3>

<p>In future iterations of this statistics release there may be some further revisions reflecting improvements to the data processing and methodology.</p>

<p>The figures in this release incorporate data on claims received by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> up to 15 March 2021 and cover employments furloughed up to 28 February 2021. The data for February is incomplete as late claims for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension may still be filed with reasonable excuse and <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> agreement. Amendments to February claims may be made until 29 March 2021.</p>

<p>Based on figures for January it is expected that these factors will result in an increase in the level of furloughed jobs reported for February of about 4%. Thus, the figures for February should therefore be considered provisional results and are likely to be revised slightly upwards in a future release.</p>
