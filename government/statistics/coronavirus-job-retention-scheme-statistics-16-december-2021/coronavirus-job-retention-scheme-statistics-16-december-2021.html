<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> provided support for paying the wages of staff on furlough until the scheme closed on 30 September 2021. This is the final publication in this series of official statistics releases.</p>

<p>The data shows that, when it closed on 30 September, the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> was supporting 410,000 employers who had a total of 1.16 million jobs on furlough.</p>

<p>These statistics provide analysis of claims for support in paying the wages of staff on furlough up to the close of the scheme on 30 September 2021. The data used includes claims submitted to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> by 21 November 2021.</p>

<p>Claims for September 2021 could have been amended until 28 October 2021. Therefore, the data for September is considered complete, in line with the definition used in this publication series, although in a small range of specific circumstances, late claims and amendments can be made with a reasonable excuse and in agreement with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>This release of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> statistics updates the material presented in previous releases and additionally contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a table of the total number of jobs on furlough since the start of the scheme by employer sector and size in tables 1c and 1d respectively of the accompanying spreadsheet</li>
  <li>a table of the overall number of individuals on furlough since the start of the scheme by age and gender in table 1e of the accompanying spreadsheet</li>
  <li>a table showing how long jobs have been on furlough, in table 21 of the accompanying spreadsheet</li>
</ul>

<p>These statistics are classed as Experimental Statistics. Further information on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, the compilation of these statistics and the meaning of the term Experimental Statistics is provided later in this publication.</p>

<h3>Next release</h3>

<p>This is the final release.</p>

<h2>Main points</h2>

<p>The key points from this release covering the period to 30 September 2021 are below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>since the start of the scheme a total of 11.7 million jobs have been supported by the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> at various times from 1.3 million employers. This is across all claims submitted to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> by 21 November 2021</li>
  <li>there have been 10.8 million individuals ever placed on furlough at any time over the lifetime of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>, 5.7 million males and 5.0 million females. The remaining 0.1 million belong to individuals whose gender is not available in the data. (The number of individuals is less than the number of jobs supported. Individuals could have had more than one job with more than one employer put on furlough over the course of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the furlough scheme ended on 30 September 2021 with 1.16 million jobs on furlough. Over the course of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>, jobs on furlough peaked at 8.9 million on 8 May 2020 then fell to 2.4 million by 31 October 2020. From November 2020 the number of jobs on furlough rose again to 5.1 million on 19 January 2021 then decreased each month until the end of the scheme</li>
  <li>at the end of the furlough scheme on 30 September 2021 21% of eligible employers had staff on furlough, falling from the 2021 peak of 41% in January. Between March and June 2020, 61% of eligible employers put staff on furlough</li>
  <li>the wholesale and retail sector had the most jobs supported by the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> with a total of 2.25 million jobs on furlough during the lifetime of the scheme</li>
  <li>the passenger air transport sector had the highest take-up rate at the end of each month from 31 May 2021 to the end of the scheme. In this sector, 38% of eligible employments were on furlough at the end of the scheme. 41% of eligible employers in the sector were still claiming support when the scheme closed</li>
  <li>employers with 250 or more employees had the most jobs supported by the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> over the lifetime of the scheme (3.9 million), while employers with 20 to 49 employees had the second highest number supported (1.5 million)</li>
  <li>use of furlough was highest in London and near most London airports at the end of September. The take-up rates for these areas were around double the UK average of 4%</li>
  <li>between July 2020 and April 2021, more employments were put on furlough with female job holders than male job holders, between May and September 2021 the situation reversed. This reflects decreases in the number of jobs on furlough in sectors such as accommodation and food, which typically have higher numbers of female employees</li>
  <li>for most of the scheme’s life the under 25 age band were the most likely to be put on furlough. As restrictions eased from spring 2021, the level of furlough in this age band decreased faster than other bands. By the end of the scheme, the take-up rate of furlough for employees aged under-25 was the lowest across all age bands at 3%</li>
  <li>employments where annual pay was estimated to be between £5,000 and £10,000 had 8% of eligible employments on furlough at 30 September, the highest proportion of any pay bracket.   Based on the national minimum wage these employments are likely to be part-time</li>
  <li>there were 329,000 employments on furlough continuously since March 2020, 28% of the total jobs on furlough at 30 September 2021</li>
</ul>

<h2>About the data in this release</h2>

<p>The data used for this release contains all <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims made by 21 November 2021.</p>

<p>These statistics have been developed considering user feedback and requests. Whilst this is the last release in this series, we would welcome any further feedback from users. This should be sent to <a href="mailto:CJRS.Statistics.Enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>.Statistics.Enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>We have also published a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/background-quality-report-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme-statistics" class="govuk-link">Background Quality Report (BQR) for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> publications</a> which helps users of the statistics understand their strengths and limitations.</p>

<h3>Key limitations and revisions</h3>

<p>The figures for September 2021 are based on claims received by the 21 November 2021. This date was chosen to allow enough time for amendments to claims to be processed and incorporating late claims as far as practicable whilst enabling the same quality assurance processes to take place in line with the previous release.</p>

<p>Claims for September 2021 could have been amended until 28 October 2021. Therefore, the data for September is considered complete, in line with the definition used in this publication series.</p>

<p>In a small range of specific circumstances, late claims and amendments can be made with a reasonable excuse and in agreement with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. The volume of these claims is very low and not expected to affect the published figures substantially. Thus, the figures are not scheduled to be updated in a formal release.</p>

<h2>Total number of jobs on furlough at any time throughout the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>
</h2>

<p>This section of the release presents the total number of unique jobs on furlough since the start of the scheme in March 2020 up to its closing date on 30 September 2021. It also includes figures for the total number of <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes (employers) that have claimed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and the total value of all claims. This data includes all claims received by 21 November 2021.</p>

<p>Table 1 shows that employers claimed support to put 11.7 million unique jobs on furlough under the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>. This is a cumulative figure and covers all jobs on furlough for at least part of the duration of the scheme since it began.</p>

<p>An individual employed by more than one employer is counted once for each employment from which they have been put on furlough. Two individuals who have been employed in the same role with an employer at different times are counted as two separate employments. In this release the terms ‘employments’ and ‘jobs’ are used interchangeably.</p>

<p>Table 1 also includes the total value of claims submitted. The figures for the number and value of claims do not take account of voluntary repayments nor remove claims not paid for compliance reasons. Claims cancelled by employers within 72 hours of making the claim are excluded.</p>

<p>The most recent figures in table 1 are based on claims received up to 21 November 2021, the cut-off date for data collection for this report. Claims for September 2021 could have been amended until 28 October 2021. Therefore, the data for September is considered to be complete.  In a small range of specific circumstances, late claims and amendments can be made with a reasonable excuse and in agreement with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>The method used to calculate the number of jobs on furlough since the start of the scheme was improved for the February 2021 release of these statistics. As a result, the figures in table 1 are not directly comparable with the management information published before that release.</p>

<p>This methodology change is described further in the methodology section of this release and does not affect published figures on the number of jobs on furlough at the end of each month, or the more detailed statistics on the number of jobs on furlough each day.</p>

<p>In this release we also include the total number of employments on furlough at any time by local authority and UK Parliamentary constituency, as well as by employer sector and size. These figures can be found in tables 1a to 1d of the accompanying spreadsheet.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> separately publishes figures for the value of claims paid to employers in its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hmrc-tax-and-nics-receipts-for-the-uk" class="govuk-link">monthly publication on tax receipts</a>. The timing of those figures reflects when payments are made rather than when claims are received, so compiled on a slightly different basis to the figures included in this release.</p>

<h2>Total number of individuals on furlough at any time throughout the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>
</h2>

<p>This section of the release presents the total number of individuals ever on furlough since the start of the scheme in March 2020 up to its closing date on 30 September 2021. If an individual has been put on furlough in more than one job during the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> they will only appear in this data once. Individuals have only been counted where they can be reliably identified from their National Insurance number.</p>

<p>The number of individuals benefiting from the scheme (10.8 million) is less than the total number of jobs supported (11.7 million). This is because a person may have been on furlough from more than one job with more than one employer throughout the duration of the scheme.</p>

<p>For instance, someone may have been on furlough during the first few months of the pandemic, returned to work then moved to another job later in 2020, and then put on furlough again. This person would be counted twice in the total number of jobs supported but only once for the number of individuals benefitting from the scheme.</p>

<p>This data includes all claims approved by 21 November 2021.</p>

<p>Key points to note for this section are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there have been 10.8 million individuals ever placed on furlough at any time over the lifetime of the scheme</li>
  <li>more males were put on furlough over the lifetime of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> than females. Table 2 shows a total of 5.7 million males were put on furlough compared to 5.0 million females. The remaining 0.1 million belong to individuals where the gender is not available in the data</li>
  <li>there was very little use of furlough in some sectors where more females are employed than males, such as education and health</li>
  <li>more females were put on furlough than males in the under 18 and 18 to 24 age bands</li>
  <li>more individuals in the 18 to 24 age band were supported by furlough over the course of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> than any other age band with 1.8 million individuals on furlough</li>
</ul>

<h2>Employments on furlough over time</h2>

<p>This section of the release presents the number of employments on furlough each day from the start of the scheme up to its end on 30 September 2021.</p>

<p>Where an employer made a claim for fewer than 16 jobs (fewer than 100 jobs before 27 May 2021), <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> collected the start and end date of the claim but did not collect the furlough start and end dates for each individual job that made up the claim. For these jobs, we use the claim period to estimate when the job was on furlough.</p>

<p>For example, if an individual job in one of these claims was on furlough from 1 May to 16 May 2021, but the full claim period was from 1 May to 31 May, the job would be counted as on furlough until 31 May. This limitation leads to an overestimate in the number of jobs on furlough at the end of the month during periods where levels of furlough are decreasing.</p>

<p>The chart in figure 1 shows the number of jobs on furlough under claims for support to the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>. The underlying data for this figure can be found in the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1040606/CJRS_Statistics_16_December_2021_-_Extension_2_reference_tables.xlsx">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>Key points to note from figure 1 are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>final figures show that the number of employments on furlough at the end of the scheme on 30 September 2021 was 1.16 million</li>
  <li>the number of employments on furlough peaked at 8.9 million on 8 May 2020. This figure fell to 2.4 million on 31 October 2020, rose again to 5.1 million employments on furlough at 19 January 2021 and then decreased each month until the scheme ended on 30 September 2021</li>
  <li>at the end of the furlough scheme on 30 September 2021, 21% of eligible employers had staff on furlough. The proportion of employers with staff on furlough fell from the 2021 peak of 41% in January. Early in the scheme, between March and June 2020, 61% of eligible employers had staff on furlough</li>
  <li>the levels of furlough seen in these figures reflect the changes to restrictions on individuals, households and businesses across the UK over time</li>
</ul>

<h2>Furlough by industry</h2>

<p>This section presents analysis of <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims according to the primary economic sector of employers’ activity.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#tab-3">Table 3</a> shows the total number of employments ever on furlough broken down by sector, <a class="govuk-link" href="#tab-4">table 4</a> shows the take-up rates for eligible employments in each sector at 30 September 2021.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#fig-2">Figure 2</a> shows the number of employments on furlough by day in each of the 15 industrial sectors that experienced higher levels of furlough. The underlying data for these charts can be found in the <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1040606/CJRS_Statistics_16_December_2021_-_Extension_2_reference_tables.xlsx" class="govuk-link">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>Additional figures for the value of claims can be found in tables 10 and 10a of the accompanying spreadsheet. The figures relating to the value of claims do not take account of voluntary repayments nor remove claims not paid for compliance reasons. Claims cancelled by employers within 72 hours of making the claim are excluded.</p>

<p>Figures for the net amount of cash provided in grants to employers under the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hmrc-tax-and-nics-receipts-for-the-uk"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s statistics on tax receipts and expenditure</a>.</p>

<p>The key points to note are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the wholesale and retail sector had the most jobs supported by the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> with 2.25 million employments on furlough at any time since the start of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>at the start of furlough, the wholesale and retail sector had the most jobs on furlough on a single day with 1.85 million on 24 April 2020</li>
  <li>when levels of furlough peaked again between November 2020 and January 2021, the accommodation and food services sector had the most employments on furlough. This sector also took longer to recover due to the slower easing of restrictions on social gatherings</li>
  <li>the arts, entertainment and recreation sector had a much wider peak in 2021 compared to many other sectors. Levels of furlough in this sector remained high for longer, reflecting the impact on this sector due to restrictions on indoor gatherings</li>
  <li>the other service activities sector had the highest take-up rates of all the sectors at the end of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>, with 11% of eligible employments on furlough at 30 September 2021. This was closely followed by the arts, entertainment and recreation sector which had 10% of eligible employments on furlough</li>

Data prior to 31 May 2021 is available from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hmrc-coronavirus-covid-19-statistics#coronavirus-job-retention-scheme" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> coronavirus statistics collections page</a>.</p>

<p>The key points to note are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>between 31 January 2021 and the end of the scheme, the restaurants and mobile food service activities industry group had the highest number of employments on furlough. This sector also had the largest number of employments on furlough between March and June 2020</li>
  <li>at 31 January 2021 the beverage serving activities industry group had the highest take-up rate at 91%. However, the take-up rate dropped substantially as restrictions were eased and at the end of the scheme this group’s take-up rate was only 8%</li>
  <li>since levels of furlough last peaked in January 2021, the primary education and secondary education groups had the largest percentage fall in the number of employments on furlough to the end of the scheme (94%). Restaurants and mobile food service activities had the largest decrease in jobs on furlough, falling by 383,500 employments between 31 January and 30 September 2021</li>
  <li>industry groups among those related to tourism had the highest take-up rates at 30 September 2021: notably passenger air transport (38%), and travel agency and tour operator activities (35%)</li>
  <li>the other service activities sector had the highest take-up rates of all the sectors with 11% of eligible employments on furlough at 30 September 2021. This is mainly driven by other personal service activities with a take-up rate of 15% and repair of personal and household goods (14%)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Furlough by employer size</h2>

<p>This section presents analysis of <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims according to the employer size. The employer size has been calculated based on an estimate of the number of employments eligible to be on furlough.</p>

<p><a href="#tab-5" class="govuk-link">Table 5</a> shows the total number of employments ever on furlough by employer size band. <a href="#tab-6" class="govuk-link">Table 6</a> shows the employments on furlough and the take-up rates in each size band at 30 September 2021</p>

<p><a href="#fig-3" class="govuk-link">Figure 3</a> presents the number of employments on furlough by day in each employer size band between 1 October 2020 and the closure of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> at 30 September 2021. The underlying data for this chart can be found in table 4 of the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1040606/CJRS_Statistics_16_December_2021_-_Extension_2_reference_tables.xlsx" rel="external" class="govuk-link">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>Table 9 in the accompanying spreadsheet provides figures for the value of these claims. These figures do not take account of voluntary repayments nor remove claims not paid for compliance reasons. Claims cancelled by employers within 72 hours of making the claim are excluded.</p>

<p>The key points to note are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>employers with 250 or more employees had the most jobs supported by furlough with 3.9 million jobs on furlough over the lifetime of the scheme. The group with the second largest total number of jobs supported was the 20 to 49 employee size band, with 1.5 million employments on furlough</li>
  <li>at its peak in May 2020, employers with 250 or more employees had 3.45 million jobs on furlough whereas employers with one employee peaked in April 2020 at 295,700 employments on furlough. At their second peaks in January 2021 the peaks were lower at 1.64 million and 207,000 respectively</li>
  <li>employers with 250 or more employees saw a 96% reduction in employments on furlough between the beginning of the scheme and the closure at 30 September 2021, in comparison with a 63% reduction amongst employers with one employee. This may be indicative of the varying impact of the pandemic on businesses of differing sizes</li>
  <li>for all employer sizes, the number of employments on furlough decreased each month between February and September 2021, this recovery occurred faster in the largest companies</li>
  <li>the proportion of largest employers (with 250 or more employees) using the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> reduced from 58% in February to 22% at the end of September 2021. Between March and June 2020, 73% of the largest employers had used the scheme</li>
  <li>employers with 2 to 4 employees had the highest proportion of eligible employments on furlough at 30 September (17%). Employers with 250 or more employees had only 1% of eligible employees on furlough when the scheme closed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Furlough by country and region</h2>

<p>This section presents a geographic breakdown of <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims. The breakdown is based on the residential address information that <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> holds for employees. This may not directly translate to the employee’s usual place of work, or employer’s centre of operations which may be in a different region.</p>

<p>For example, an employee who lives in Wales and normally commutes daily to work in Bristol would be included within the count for Wales, rather than for South West England. At present these statistics are only available for 1 July onwards (see <a href="#methodology" class="govuk-link">methodology section</a> for more information).</p>

<p><a href="#tab-7" class="govuk-link">Table 7</a> shows a breakdown of the total number of employments ever on furlough for each region and country of the UK. This data includes all information from the start of the furlough scheme in March 2020 to its closure at 30 September 2021.</p>

<p><a href="#fig-4" class="govuk-link">Figure 4</a> presents the number of employments on furlough in each country and region by day between 1 October 2020 and the closure of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> on 30 September 2021. <a href="#fig-5" class="govuk-link">Figure 5</a> shows the employments on furlough by country and region and gender at 30 September 2021, whilst <a href="#fig-6" class="govuk-link">figure 6</a> shows the take-up rates for this date.

<p>The key points to note are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>London consistently had the largest number of employments on furlough. A total of 1.64 million employments were on furlough at any time in London during the lifetime of the scheme. There were 232,700 employments on furlough in this region at 30 September when the scheme closed, 6% of the total eligible</li>
  <li>in Scotland, a total of 911,900 employments were on furlough during the course of the scheme. Final figures show 80,800 employments were on furlough when the scheme closed on 30 September 2021, 3% of the total eligible</li>
  <li>in Wales, 474,600 employments were ever on furlough over the course of the scheme. Final figures show 40,500 employments were on furlough when the scheme closed on 30 September 2021, 3% of the total eligible</li>
  <li>in Northern Ireland a total of 287,100 employments were on furlough during the scheme. Final figures show 26,600 employments were on furlough when the scheme closed on 30 September 2021, 4% of the total eligible</li>
  <li>in England, there were 9.65 million employments supported by furlough over the whole scheme. Final figures show there were 971,900 employments on furlough when the scheme closed on 30 September 2021, 4% of the total eligible</li>
  <li>London, the South East and the South West have a more pronounced fall in the number of employments on furlough during December 2020 when compared with the other regions and countries in the UK. This may be indicative of the geographical variation in restrictions seen at that time in the UK</li>

<h2>Furlough by country, region and sector</h2>

<p>Tables 17a to 17e in the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1040606/CJRS_Statistics_16_December_2021_-_Extension_2_reference_tables.xlsx" class="govuk-link" rel="external">accompanying spreadsheet</a> show the number of employments on furlough by local authority and sector for each month between May and September 2021.</p>

<p>The key points to note are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at 31 January 2021, the accommodation and food services sector had the most employments on furlough in each region and country, except for Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland, the wholesale and retail sector had the most employments on furlough</li>
  <li>levels of furlough in the accommodation and food services sector decreased more than in other sectors as restrictions eased. At 30 September 2021 the wholesale and retail sector had the largest number of employments on furlough across two thirds of the regions and countries of the UK</li>
  <li>at 30 September 2021, the accommodation and food services sector had the largest number of employments on furlough in Scotland and London. However, in the North East and the West Midlands the largest number of employments on furlough were in the manufacturing sector</li>
  <li>at 30 September 2021, in London, 18% of the employments on furlough were in the accommodation and food services sector</li>
</ul>

<h2>Furlough by local authority and UK Parliamentary constituency</h2>

<p>This section presents a geographic breakdown of <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims by local authority and UK Parliamentary constituency. The breakdown is based on the residential address information that <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> holds for employees. This may not directly translate to the employee’s usual place of work, or employer’s centre of operations which may be in a different local authority or constituency.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#fig-7">Figure 7</a> presents a map of the take-up rate for employments on furlough by local authority. Darker shades indicate a higher furlough take-up rate at 30 September 2021. The data underlying this map can be found in table 12 of the <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1040606/CJRS_Statistics_16_December_2021_-_Extension_2_reference_tables.xlsx" class="govuk-link">accompanying spreadsheet</a>. This table additionally provides a gender breakdown which is not shown in the map.</p>

<p>A table of the total number of employments ever on furlough broken down by local authority can be found in table 1a of the accompanying spreadsheet.</p>

<p>The key points to note for local authorities are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the top 3 local authorities with the most jobs supported by the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> over the duration of the scheme were Birmingham (183,400), Leeds (133,800) and Glasgow City (108,900)</li>
  <li>at 30 September 2021 when the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> ended, the majority of local authorities had a take-up rate of the national average (4%) or lower. However local authorities with the highest take-up rates were double the national average at 8%</li>
  <li>four of the ten local authorities with the highest proportion of eligible jobs on furlough at 30 September were near airports, Hounslow (8%) and Ealing (8%) near Heathrow airport, Newham (8%) and Redbridge (8%) near London City airport</li>
  <li>a further five of the local authorities with the highest take-up rates were London boroughs: Barnet (8%), Brent (8%), Barking and Dagenham (7%), Enfield (7%) and Haringey (7%). One of the local authorities in the top 10 take-up rates was outside of London: Epping Forest in Essex County (7%)</li>
  <li>in Scotland, the local authority with the largest total number of employments ever on furlough over the duration of the scheme was Glasgow City with 108,900 employments, the second highest was City of Edinburgh with 87,500. At 30 September 2021 take-up rates were broadly similar across all local authorities. East Renfrewshire had the highest take-up rates at 5% of eligible employments</li>
  <li>the local authority with the largest number of employments on furlough over the course of the scheme in Northern Ireland was Belfast with 51,200 employments. At 30 September 2021 all local authorities were broadly similar to the average take-up rate of 3% to 4% of eligible employments</li>

<p>The key points to note for UK Parliamentary constituencies are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the top 3 Parliamentary constituencies with the most jobs supported by furlough over the duration of the scheme were West Ham (44,200), Tottenham (37,300) and East Ham (37,000). All of the top 10 were in London and the South East</li>

<h2>Furlough by gender</h2>

<p>This section provides analysis showing the number of employments on furlough each day from 1 July 2020 up to 30 September 2021, broken down by the claimants’ gender. The underlying data for figure 9 can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1040606/CJRS_Statistics_16_December_2021_-_Extension_2_reference_tables.xlsx" rel="external">accompanying spreadsheet</a>. At present these statistics are only available for 1 July onwards (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#methodology">methodology section</a> for more information).</p>

<p>The key points to note are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>between July 2020 and April 2021, more employments were put on furlough with female job holders than male job holders</li>
  <li>between May and September 2021, more employments were put on furlough with male job holders than female job holders. This reflects decreases in the number of jobs on furlough in sectors such as accommodation and food which typically have higher numbers of female employees</li>
  <li>at 30 September 2021 there were 527,200 employments on furlough with female job holders compared to 615,100 employments with male job holders</li>
</ul>

<h2>Furlough by age</h2>

<p>This section provides analysis of <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims broken down by age band. The claimant’s age was calculated at 1 March 2020 for employments on furlough up to 31 October 2020, at 1 November 2020 for employments on furlough from 1 November 2020 to 30 April 2021 and at 1 May 2021 for employments on furlough from 1 May 2021 onwards.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#fig-10">Figure 10</a> shows the proportion of eligible employments on furlough by day in each age band. <a href="#fig-11" class="govuk-link">Figure 11</a> compares the number of employments on furlough by age band and gender at 30 September 2021, whilst <a href="#fig-12" class="govuk-link">figure 12</a> shows the take-up rates on this date. At present these statistics are only available for 1 July onwards (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#methodology">methodology section</a> for more information).</p>

<p>The underlying data for these charts can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1040606/CJRS_Statistics_16_December_2021_-_Extension_2_reference_tables.xlsx" rel="external">accompanying spreadsheet</a>. Tables 14a to 14e contain a breakdown by age, local authority and gender for each month between May 2021 and September 2021. Tables 19a to 19d contain breakdowns by age and sector for each month between June 2021 and September 2021.</p>

<p>The key points to note are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for all age bands the number of employments on furlough and the take-up rates decreased each month between February and September 2021 after peaking in January 2021</li>
  <li>for most of the time the scheme ran employees aged under 25 were the most likely to be put on furlough. As restrictions eased in spring 2021, particularly in hospitality and retail sectors, the level of furlough in this age band decreased faster than other bands. By the end of the scheme the furlough take-up rate for employees aged under 25 was the lowest across all age bands at 3%</li>
  <li>at 30 September 2021 the 65 and over age band had the highest furlough take-up rates of 6% and 7%, for jobs held by female and male employees respectively. Throughout the scheme, employments held by employees in the 65 and over age band have had one of the top two highest take-up rates</li>
  <li>take-up rates reduced more slowly in older age groups compared to younger ones between July and September 2021</li>
</ul>

<h2>Furlough type</h2>

<p>This section provides a breakdown of the number of employments on furlough by day by full and flexible furlough. On 1 July 2020, the option was introduced for employers to furlough their employees for part of their usual hours, with the employee free to work the remainder. Therefore, the time series shown in <a class="govuk-link" href="#fig-13">figure 13</a> starts at 1 July 2020.</p>

<p>The underlying data for figure 13 can be found in table 8 of the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1040606/CJRS_Statistics_16_December_2021_-_Extension_2_reference_tables.xlsx">accompanying spreadsheet</a>, with further breakdowns by sector and region available in tables 15 and 16.</p>

<p>The key points to note are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for the first few months after flexible furlough was introduced in July 2020 the number of employments on flexible furlough remained fairly steady, whilst the number of employments on full furlough decreased substantially</li>
  <li>in November 2020 when the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> was extended the number of employments on both types of furlough rose. Jobs on flexible furlough stabilised again, but the use of full furlough increased in January 2021, reflecting the tighter restrictions across the UK at this time</li>
  <li>since May 2021 the number of employments on full and flexible furlough were comparable and reductions followed a similar pattern until the end of the scheme</li>
  <li>the number of employments on full furlough at 30 September 2021 was 645,900 and there were 505,000 employments on flexible furlough</li>
  <li>at 30 September the wholesale and retail; repair of motor vehicles sector had the largest number of jobs on flexible furlough with 74,600, 43% of all jobs on furlough in that sector. The manufacturing sector had 59% of jobs on furlough, on flexible furlough (71,500 employments)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Estimated annual pay (employments)</h2>

<p>This section includes a breakdown of employments by annual pay band at 30 September 2021.</p>

<p>The estimated annual pay is based on the gross pay over the period April 2019 to March 2020. The gross pay figure is estimated as pay before any tax, National Insurance or pension contributions are deducted from an employee’s pay.</p>

<p>If a job does not span the full 12 months the pay from the other months is annualised, or if annual pay data is not available for that period then data from April 2020 to March 2021 is used.</p>

<p>These figures are estimated gross pay rate for employments, as employees may have more than one job these figures may not represent the pay received by individuals. Additionally, as jobs may not last for a full year, the figures should not be interpreted as total annual amounts of pay for jobs on furlough.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#tab-8">Table 8</a> shows the distribution of pay for employments on furlough on 30 September 2021. The underlying data for these tables can be found in table 20 of the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1040606/CJRS_Statistics_16_December_2021_-_Extension_2_reference_tables.xlsx">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>The key points to note are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>slightly over half (51%) of employments on furlough at 30 September had estimated annual pay of £15,000 or less</li>
  <li>employments with estimated annual pay of between £5,000 and £10,000 had the highest proportion of eligible employments on furlough at 30 September at 8%</li>
  <li>based on the national minimum wage these employments are likely to be part-time employments</li>
</ul>

<h2>How long jobs have been on furlough continuously</h2>

<p>This section includes a new breakdown of the number of employments on furlough at 30 September 2021 broken down by how long jobs have been on furlough continuously. Employments are defined as on furlough continuously if they were on either full or flexible furlough without a break in furlough lasting more than 3 days.</p>

<p>For example, the jobs included in the March 2020 category in table 9 were on furlough between March 2020 and 30 September 2021, without any breaks in furlough exceeding 3 days during this period.</p>

<p><a href="#tab-9" class="govuk-link">Table 9</a> shows the number employments on furlough up to 30 September 2021 broken down by the month the furlough period started, and in table 21 of the <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1040606/CJRS_Statistics_16_December_2021_-_Extension_2_reference_tables.xlsx" class="govuk-link">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>The key points to note are that as of 30 September 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>employments on furlough since March 2020 made up the largest proportion of employments on furlough at 30 September 2021 (28%). 328,700 employments were put on furlough in March 2020 at the start of the first national lockdown</li>
  <li>the number of employments beginning furlough in April 2020 was also high as lockdowns were extended past March</li>
  <li>there was a spike in employments starting furlough in November 2020 (156,600) and May 2021 (52,200), which coincides with more jobs becoming eligible for furlough at the start of the further extensions of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> due to tighter restrictions</li>
  <li>employments beginning furlough in January 2021 were also high (56,100), coinciding with periods of tighter restrictions across the UK</li>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The government announced the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (<abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>) on 20 March 2020. It was introduced to support employers through the COVID-19 period, this has also been known as the furlough scheme.</p>

<p>The scheme is based around <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) system. It works by providing grants to employers of up to a maximum 80% of salary to a maximum value of £2,500 per employee. Up to the end of July 2020, the scheme also met some of the cost of employer pension contributions and employer National Insurance Contributions.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hmrc-coronavirus-covid-19-statistics">The latest information about the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme</a> can be found on the GOV.UK website along with information about the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> evaluation programme.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-a-previous-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme-claim#check-guidance-for-the-scheme" class="govuk-link">Guidance on applying for support, further details of the eligibility criteria, and repayments</a> can be found on the GOV.UK website. Older versions of the guidance can be found in the National Archive by following the links from the guidance pages.</p>

<h3>Changes to the scheme from 1 May 2021</h3>

<p>It was announced on 3 March 2021 that the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> would be extended further, beyond 30 April 2021 to 30 September 2021. To be eligible for furlough from the 1 May 2021 onwards, the employee must have been employed on 2 March 2021 and the employer must have sent a Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) submission to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> for the employer between 20 March 2020 and 2 March 2021, notifying a payment of earnings for that employee.</p>

<p>As with the extension to the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> between November 2020 and April 2021, for claim periods from 1 May to 30 June 2021, employers with a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme were able to claim for 80% of an employee’s usual hours worked, up to a maximum of £2,500 per month.</p>

<p>For staff who are placed on flexible furlough, the £2,500 cap was reduced by multiplying by the proportion of the employee’s usual hours for which they were put on furlough.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2021, the scheme supported 70% of salaries for hours not worked, reducing to 60% from 1 August 2021. 
The scheme closed on 30 September 2021.</p>

<h2>Glossary</h2>

<p>An employer is assumed within the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> statistics to have in effect the same scope as a Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) Scheme. While most employers operate a single <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme, for some employers a single <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme does not relate exactly to what is commonly understood to be an employer.</p>

<p>For example, some organisations operate multiple payrolls, and in other situations, a group of companies may pool their payrolls together under one <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme. However, in our view <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes provides a reasonable proxy for employers for the purposes of this release.</p>

<p>An employment is defined within this release as anyone who meets the scheme criteria set out within the published guidance. We have applied this definition in order to keep the presentation simple and the difficulty in separating out Office Holders (such as directors) from what are generally considered employees. Further information on the eligibility criteria is set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#background">background section</a> above.</p>

<h2>Measuring the data</h2>

<h3>Data source and collection</h3>

<p>The data for this release comes from HM Revenue and Customs’ <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims. It covers the whole population rather than a sample of people or companies, and it will allow for more detailed estimates of the population.</p>

<p>Additional data from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Pay As You Earn Real Time Information system has been matched with <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> data in order to produce the statistics released here.</p>

<h3>Coverage</h3>

<p>This publication covers all <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims made by employers from the start of the scheme up to 21 November 2021 for support for the wages of staff on furlough up to 30 September 2021. The data for September 2021 is considered complete as the deadline for amending claims relating to September passed on 28 October 2021.</p>

<p>In a small range of specific circumstances, late claims and amendments can be made with a reasonable excuse and in agreement with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Methodology (except table 1)</h3>

<p>This section provides notes on the methodology and implications for interpreting the figures.</p>

<p>The data presented in this release comes from combining details about furlough from the job level data and the total number of staff on furlough included in each claim.</p>

<p>The statistics in this release count employments. Therefore (for example), an employee with jobs at two employers will be counted twice if both jobs are put on furlough.</p>

<p>The criteria for eligibility for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> were amended for the first and second <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extensions.</p>

<p>For furlough from 1 May 2021 onwards, the number of jobs presented as ‘eligible employments’ and used to calculate take-up figures reflect the criteria for eligibility for the second extension to the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> scheme. They are based on a list of employees employed on 2 March 2021 and included in <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Real Time Information submissions from 20 March 2020 to 2 March 2021.</p>

<p>In this release employers are described as eligible to claim the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> if they employed staff for which the criteria to be eligible for furlough were met. Employers are grouped into size bands in some tables according to the number of employees they had who were eligible to be put on furlough under the extension to <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>.</p>

<p>In some circumstances <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> holds incomplete information about employments, for example where a leaving date had not been submitted by employer. In this situation, an estimate of the probability that an individual was employed on the qualifying dates has been used.</p>

<p>The assessment of whether a person was employed on the qualifying dates is based on the methodology used for the joint <a rel="external" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/earningsandemploymentfrompayasyouearnrealtimeinformationuk/previousReleases" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>/<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> statistics release, Earnings and employment from Pay As You Earn Real Time Information</a>.</p>

<p>In producing the time series statistics some challenges had to be tackled. These included dealing with data on amendments to claims and claims for overlapping periods. In addition, claims where 16 or more staff are being put on furlough may include staff on furlough for varying periods.</p>

<p>These factors combined with some incomplete data (as mentioned above) make counting the number of employees on furlough over time complex.</p>

<p>The method employed is designed to generally prevent overcounting employments so far as possible, however it may in certain circumstances very slightly under or over count.</p>

<p>Employers making larger claims may submit start and end dates for the periods that individual employees were on furlough when those dates were different to the overall period covered by the claim. But for smaller claims <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> does not collect the furlough start and end dates for each job separately.</p>

<p>For larger claims employers had to send <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> a separate file containing the details of the jobs claimed for. Before 27 May 2021 this applied to all claims for 100 or more jobs on furlough. From this date employers claiming for between 16 and 99 jobs could also use this method to submit their claim.</p>

<p>For jobs included in smaller claims (submitted without the more detailed information submitted with larger claims), we use the claim period to estimate when the job was on furlough.</p>

<p>For example, if a job in one of the smaller claims was on furlough from the 1 May to 16 May 2021, but the full claim period was from 1 May to 31 May, the job would appear to be on furlough for the full month. This leads to an overestimate in the number of jobs on furlough at the end of the month during periods where levels of furlough are decreasing.</p>

<p>The demographic breakdowns of employments include all employees that employers have put on furlough where it has been possible to link <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> data to classifying information (such as the employee’s gender and address). The linking has been performed using employees’ National Insurance numbers to data held within <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) system.</p>

<p>When the employer-submitted National Insurance numbers are not of sufficient quality to be matched with other <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> data, the employments have been categorised as ‘unknown’.</p>

<p>The geographic breakdowns in these statistics use a postcode lookup file from Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>) data to link UK postcodes to geographic areas.</p>

<p>The breakdown by estimated annual pay in these statistics is based on the gross pay over the period April 2019 to March 2020. If a job does not span the full year the pay from the other months is annualised. If annual pay is not available for this period April 2020 to March 2021 is used.</p>

<p>Industrial sector information is based on the Interdepartmental Business Register (IDBR) produced by the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>. Where <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes are absent from the IDBR, we have used sector information from Companies House, linking on employer name where possible. This provides <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialclassificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Standard Industrial Classification codes (UK <abbr title="Standard Industrial Classification">SIC 2007</abbr>)</a> for employers that have made a claim. Where we have been unable to determine SIC codes, we have reported the sector as ‘unknown’.</p>

<p>The figures for the number and value of claims do not take account of voluntary repayments nor remove claims not paid for compliance reasons. Claims cancelled by employers within 72 hours of making the claim are excluded.</p>

<h3>Methodology (cumulative figures - table 1)</h3>

<p>The methodology used for the figure for the cumulative number of jobs ever on furlough since the start of the scheme (table 1 in the commentary and tables 1, 1a, 1b, 1c and 1d in the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1040606/CJRS_Statistics_16_December_2021_-_Extension_2_reference_tables.xlsx">accompanying spreadsheet</a>) has been improved. For figures up to 13 December 2020, the method used was based on the figures for the total number of jobs on furlough on each claim.</p>

<p>This choice had to be made because at the time the job-level information available for statistical purposes was incomplete for larger claims.</p>

<p>Over time – and particularly with the introduction of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension – the previous method had started to undercount the total number of jobs put on furlough.</p>

<p>The original method took the total number of jobs on furlough from all the claims made by each <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme. It then found the maximum number of jobs put on furlough for each employer across all their claims. Finally, it summed these values for all <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes to arrive at a total number of employees ever on furlough.</p>

<p>The new approach uses job-level data. For this, we calculate the number of unique National Insurance numbers in the claims made by each employer, and then sum these. This information is supplemented by the employee’s name and payroll number in a small number of cases.</p>

<p>The cumulative number of employers making <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims is calculated as the number of distinct <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes that have submitted a claim since the start of the scheme. The cumulative value of claims made is calculated as the sum of the amount claimed for each submitted claim.</p>

<p>Table 1e in the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1040606/CJRS_Statistics_16_December_2021_-_Extension_2_reference_tables.xlsx">accompanying spreadsheet</a> contains figures for the total number of individuals ever on furlough since the start of the scheme. If an individual has been put on furlough in more than one job with more than one employer during the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> they will only appear in this data once. Individuals have only been counted where they can be reliably identified from their National Insurance number.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of flexible furlough employers have been able to cancel claims made on the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims portal within 72 hours of making a claim. From the figures dated 15 February 2021 onwards, claims cancelled in this way have been excluded.</p>

<p>The figures for the number and value of claims do not take account of voluntary repayments nor remove claims not paid for compliance reasons. Claims cancelled by employers within 72 hours of making the claim are excluded.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> separately publishes figures for the value of claims paid to employers, in its monthly publication on tax receipts. Those figures are on a cash basis and reflect the time that the payments were made rather than the date that claims were received, so are slightly different to the figures included in this release.</p>

<h3>Rounding of figures in the tables accompanying this release</h3>

<p>Rounding has been applied to the figures in the tables accompanying this release. Claim amounts are rounded to the nearest million in table 1. Counts are rounded to the nearest 10 for tables 14a to 14e (local authority by age and gender) and tables 17a to 17e (local authority by sector). All other tables are rounded to the nearest 100.</p>

<h2>Strengths and limitations</h2>

<p>HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) grants pre-release access to <a href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/about-the-authority/uk-statistical-system/types-of-official-statistics/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Official Statistics</a> publications, and in accordance with the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> policy, pre-release access has been granted to a number of people to enable the preparation of a ministerial briefing. Further details, including <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hmrc-statistics-pre-release-access-list" class="govuk-link">a list of those granted access</a>, can be found on <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s website.</p>

<p>We have also published a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/background-quality-report-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme-statistics" class="govuk-link">Background Quality Report (BQR)</a> for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> publications which helps users of the statistics understand their strengths and limitations.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/businessservices/bulletins/businessinsightsandimpactontheukeconomy/latest" rel="external">Business insights and impact on the UK economy statistics (known as BICS)</a> published by the Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>) are based on a fortnightly survey. The furlough statistics in the BICS publications have been more timely, however they exclude some industry sectors (such as agriculture and finance) and being based on a survey the estimates have a margin of error associated with them.</p>

<p>In contrast to the BICS statistics on furlough the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> statistics are based on administrative data for the whole population of employers that use the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>. The <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> statistics provide more detailed breakdowns of the characteristics of the employers using the scheme, the employees that have been on furlough, and how the use of the furlough scheme changed over time.</p>
