<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>The ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/statistics/forced-marriage-unit-statistics-2021" rel="external">Forced Marriage Unit Annual Statistics 2021</a>’ 
release details the number and characteristics of cases reported to the Forced Marriage 
Unit (<abbr title="Forced Marriage Unit">FMU</abbr>) via its public helpline and email inbox from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Forced Marriage Unit">FMU</abbr> logs all calls and emails received to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the records. The main categories of data that are captured by the 
<abbr title="Forced Marriage Unit">FMU</abbr> case log include (if volunteered, as some callers may wish to remain anonymous):</p>

<ul>
  <li>details of the caller/source of information</li>
  <li>focus country</li>
  <li>UK region where the victim/potential victim lives</li>
  <li>sex, age, location and nationality of the person at risk</li>
  <li>disability – be it physical, learning or both, and/or any condition that may affect mental capacity</li>
  <li>sexual orientation (only if volunteered)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Uses of the statistics</h3>

<p>Uses made of the <abbr title="Forced Marriage Unit">FMU</abbr> statistics are listed below using the standard categorisation for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/about-the-authority/uk-statistical-system/types-of-official-statistics/" rel="external">official statistics</a> 
(as shown in the United Kingdom Statistics Authority (UKSA) monitoring brief 6/2010):</p>

<p><strong>a) Informing the general public’s choices:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>about the state of the economy, society and the environment – figures on forced marriages are used by the media in articles on law and order</li>
  <li>about the performance of government and public bodies – figures on levels and trends in reported cases of forced marriage are requested via 
parliamentary questions (PQs) and freedom of information (FOI) requests to gauge performance in general or in specific areas</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>b) Government policy making and monitoring:</strong></p>

<p><abbr title="Forced Marriage Unit">FMU</abbr> statistics are used to inform policy development and operational decisions surrounding forced marriage, as well as to monitor the performance and 
effectiveness of the <abbr title="Forced Marriage Unit">FMU</abbr> and to tailor its prevention and outreach activity.</p>

<p><strong>c) Resource allocation typically by central and local government:</strong></p>

<p><abbr title="Forced Marriage Unit">FMU</abbr> statistics demonstrate the types of referrals being made and their geographical range, which may be considered when allocating certain resources.</p>

<p><strong>d) Supporting third sector activity:</strong></p>

<p>Civil society organisations use <abbr title="Forced Marriage Unit">FMU</abbr> statistics to protect the rights and civil liberties of citizens. For example, the statistics were used in campaigning 
and debates surrounding the passage of the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Minimum Age) Bill.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Glossary</h2>

<p><strong>Female Genital Mutilation (<abbr title="Female Genital Mutilation">FGM</abbr>)</strong> - The partial or total removal of external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical 
reasons. Further information is available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/female-genital-mutilation">‘Female genital mutilation’</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Focus Country</strong> - The country to which the forced marriage risk relates. This could be the country where the forced marriage (or <abbr title="Female Genital Mutilation">FGM</abbr>) is due to take place, 
the country where it has taken place, and/or the country that the spouse is currently residing in.</p>

<p><strong>Forced marriage</strong> - A forced marriage is one in which one or both spouses do not (or, in the case of adults who lack the relevant mental capacity, cannot) 
consent to the marriage, and violence, threats, or any other form of coercion is involved (a marriage of a person who lacks the relevant mental capacity 
is also a forced marriage even if violence, threats or other forms of coercion are not involved). Coercion may include emotional pressure, physical force 
or the threat of it, and financial pressure. Section 3 outlines the relevant legislation.</p>

<p><strong>Forced Marriage Protection Order (<abbr title="Forced Marriage Protection Order">FMPO</abbr>)</strong> - FMPOs can be made by courts to protect a person who has been, or is being, forced into marriage against 
their will by imposing restrictions against the effecting of marriage. A <abbr title="Forced Marriage Protection Order">FMPO</abbr> is unique to each case and contains legally binding conditions and 
directions that change the behaviour of a person or persons trying to force someone into marriage. Further information and guidance on how to apply for a 
<abbr title="Forced Marriage Protection Order">FMPO</abbr> is available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/forced-marriage-protection-orders-fl701">‘Forced marriage protection orders (FL701)’</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Forced Marriage Unit (<abbr title="Forced Marriage Unit">FMU</abbr>)</strong> - The <abbr title="Forced Marriage Unit">FMU</abbr> is a joint Home Office and Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (<abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office">FCDO</abbr>) unit. It was established in 2005 
to lead on the Government’s forced marriage policy, outreach and casework. The unit also leads on consular casework relating to <abbr title="Female Genital Mutilation">FGM</abbr> victims who are 
overseas. The unit can assist victims inside the UK, where support is provided to any individual, and those who are overseas, where consular assistance 
is provided to British nationals, including dual nationals.</p>

<p><strong>Helpline</strong> - The <abbr title="Forced Marriage Unit">FMU</abbr> operates a helpline from 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday (+44 (0) 20 7008 0151). Outside of these hours, consular assistance is 
available 24/7 by contacting the nearest overseas British Embassy, High Commission or Consulate, or by calling 020 7008 5000 in the UK.</p>

<p><strong>Mental capacity</strong> - Under the Mental Capacity Act 2005, a person lacks capacity in relation to a matter if at the material time he/she is unable to 
make a decision for himself/herself in relation to the matter because of an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain.</p>

<p><strong>Reluctant sponsor</strong> - A person who is sponsoring an unwanted spouse to come to the UK.</p>

<p><strong>Repatriation</strong> - To come back to the UK or to their country of ordinary residence.</p>

<p><strong>Status of marriage</strong> - The status of the marriage is recorded under four categories to enable the <abbr title="Forced Marriage Unit">FMU</abbr>’s caseworkers to tailor the approach taken and 
provide the best support based on the individual circumstances. These categories are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘UK Pre’ (this means that the victim is in the UK and the marriage is yet to take place; the marriage could be in the UK or overseas)</li>
  <li>‘UK Post’ (the victim is in the UK and the marriage has taken place)</li>
  <li>‘Overseas Pre’ (the victim is overseas, and the marriage is yet to take place)</li>
  <li>‘Overseas Post’ (the victim is overseas, and the marriage has taken place)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Legislation and regulations</h2>

<p>Forced marriage legislation is devolved (although the <abbr title="Forced Marriage Unit">FMU</abbr> provides support and advice regardless of where in the UK the victim/potential victim is based).</p>

<p>The relevant legislation can be found at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/12/section/121/enacted" rel="external">England and Wales: Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014, Section 121</a>.</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/12/section/122/enacted" rel="external">Scotland: Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014, Section 122</a>.</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/nia/2015/2" rel="external">Northern Ireland: Human Trafficking and Exploitation (Criminal Justice and Support for Victims) Act (Northern Ireland) 2015, Part 2</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The legislation in all areas of the UK criminalises the following behaviour:</p>

<ul>
  <li>using violence, threats or another form of coercion to cause somebody to enter into a marriage, if they believe (or ought reasonably to believe) 
that this would cause them to enter into the marriage without free and full consent</li>
  <li>deceiving someone with the intention of causing them to leave the UK to be forced into marriage</li>
  <li>causing someone who lacks the mental capacity to consent to a marriage to enter into one (whether they are pressured to or not)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Marriage and Civil Partnership (Minimum Age) Act 2022 received Royal Assent on 28 April 2022. As well as raising the minimum age of marriage and 
civil partnership to 18 in all circumstances in England and Wales, it will expand the ambit of the criminal offence of forced marriage in England and 
Wales such that it is always illegal to arrange for an under-18 to marry, even if violence, threats or any other form of coercion are not used. This 
change in the law has not yet been brought into force, and did not apply during the period covered by these statistics.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-right-to-choose-government-guidance-on-forced-marriage">The government’s Multi-agency statutory guidance for dealing with forced marriage, and multi-agency practice guidelines</a> provides detailed guidance about the work of the <abbr title="Forced Marriage Unit">FMU</abbr>, and how to protect, advise and support victims of forced marriage, including information and practice 
guidelines for professionals.</p>

<p>Forced Marriage Protection Orders can be used to help victims at risk of a forced marriage or following a forced marriage. Guidance on how to apply for 
a Forced Marriage Protection Order is available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-forced-marriage-protection-order">‘Apply for a forced marriage protection order’</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Quality and methodology</h2>

<p><strong>Data source</strong></p>

<p>The statistical release comprises data held by the <abbr title="Forced Marriage Unit">FMU</abbr> from all cases referred to the unit through the public helpline, inbox, or through consular staff 
overseas. The data is collated, anonymised and published on an annual basis.
The <abbr title="Forced Marriage Unit">FMU</abbr> privacy notice is available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fcdo-and-home-office-privacy-notice-forced-marriage-unit-fmu">‘<abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office">FCDO</abbr> and Home Office privacy notice: Forced Marriage Unit (<abbr title="Forced Marriage Unit">FMU</abbr>)’</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Data coverage</strong></p>

<p>The statistics only reflect cases which have been referred to the <abbr title="Forced Marriage Unit">FMU</abbr> and do not reflect the true scale of forced marriage, which is often a hidden crime.</p>

<p>The main statistics collected and published by the <abbr title="Forced Marriage Unit">FMU</abbr> include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>source of information</li>
  <li>enquiry type</li>
  <li>focus country</li>
  <li>UK region where the victim/potential victim lives</li>
  <li>sex</li>
  <li>age</li>
  <li>victim location</li>
  <li>nationality of the person at risk</li>
  <li>disability – be it physical, learning or both, and/or any condition that may affect mental capacity</li>
  <li>sexual orientation (only if volunteered)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Rounding</strong></p>

<p>Data are provided rounded in the data tables and percentages may not sum to 100%. Caution should be exercised when comparing small differences between 
time periods.</p>

<p><strong>Quality assurance process</strong></p>

<p>The two heads of the <abbr title="Forced Marriage Unit">FMU</abbr> carried out an initial quality assurance process by checking entries on the database to ensure that all categories and fields 
were completed correctly, and removing duplicated records and ‘cases’ which should not have been included in the data (such as general enquiries related 
to forced marriage). The data was then filtered into the required categories and tables were produced which form the basis of the analysis. The data and 
the analysis were quality checked by senior members of staff from Home Office and the <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office">FCDO</abbr>. Home Office statisticians carried out the final quality 
assurance process to ensure that the data was accurate and the commentary is unbiased and appropriately described the trends seen in the data.</p>
