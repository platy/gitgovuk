<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This experimental statistics publication includes counts of payrolled employments in the UK from HM Revenue and Customs’ (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) Pay as You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) data and <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Migrant Worker Scan (<abbr title="Migrant Worker Scan">MWS</abbr>).</p>

<p>As individuals who were furloughed as part of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme should still have their employments reported through the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> system, they should feature in these data and contribute toward the employment statistics for the relevant period.</p>

<p>Payrolled employment counts in this publication are broken down by geographical regions (NUTS1), industrial sectors (SIC2007) and nationality groupings (UK, EU and non-EU). Further EU nationality breakdowns (EU14, EU8, EU2 and Other EU) are also provided for the total counts of payrolled employments in the UK by industry.</p>

<p>Nationality breakdowns are determined using <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s <abbr title="Migrant Worker Scan">MWS</abbr>. Nationality is reported by individuals when they register for a National Insurance number through the adult National Insurance number registration process. If an individual has subsequently naturalised or changed nationality, this will not be reflected in these statistics.</p>

<p>These statistics cover the period 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2021. During this period there are key dates we refer to relating to EU exit and the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. These dates are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>23 June 2016 - The UK held a referendum and 52% of those who voted chose to leave the EU</li>
  <li>29 March 2017 - Article 50 was triggered starting a two-year countdown to the UK formally leaving the EU on 29 March 2019. After further extensions to this deadline, the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and entered a transition period</li>
  <li>23 March 2020 - Announcement of the first COVID-19 lockdown and introduction of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout this article we have used June 2019 as a pre-pandemic reference point. This is two years prior to the latest point in the data. As the data in this release are non-seasonally adjusted, comparing the same months in each year helps to assess the recovery of payrolled employments.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Care needs to be taken when comparing these statistics with other sources. It is important to consider the coverage of these statistics.</p>

<p>Payrolled employments cannot be directly compared with payrolled employees. As payrolled employees can have multiple payrolled employments, payrolled employment counts follow the same trend as payrolled employee counts, but counts will be higher.</p>

<p>Employments from the PAYE system cannot be compared with all jobs. These statistics only include employments from the PAYE system, they do not include employments from non-payrolled sources such as self-employment.</p>

<p>For example, any comparisons to estimates from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) should be treated with caution. Differences between the two sources are possible for reasons including, but not limited to, sampling variability in the LFS as well as definitional differences in nationality and payrolled employments as outlined above.

<p>Further information is in the comparability and related publications section of this release.</p>

<p>These statistics are Experimental Statistics and are subject to revisions. Further information on the data sources and the meaning of the term Experimental Statistics is provided later in this publication.</p>

<h2>Main points</h2>

<h3>Payrolled employments in the UK, July 2014 to June 2021</h3>

<ul>
  <li>in July 2014, there were 28.39 million payrolled employments in the UK. UK nationals accounted for 88% (24.87 million), EU nationals accounted for 6% (1.84 million) and non-EU nationals also accounted for 6% (1.69 million)</li>
  <li>in June 2016, the UK voted ‘leave’ in the United Kingdom EU membership referendum. Over the next three years (up to and including June 2019): payrolled employments of UK nationals increased by 522,000 (2%), payrolled employments of EU nationals increased by 304,000 (13%) and payrolled employments of non-EU nationals increased by 254,000 (14%)</li>
  <li>in March 2020, the Government announced that they would be implementing measures intended to halt the spread of COVID-19. At this point, there were 30.46 million payrolled employments in the UK. Over the next ten months, payrolled employments of UK nationals decreased by 848,000 (3%), payrolled employments of EU nationals decreased by 199,000 (8%) and payrolled employments of non-EU nationals decreased by 9,000 (&lt;1%)</li>
  <li>between March 2021 and June 2021, the total number of payrolled employments increased by 956,000. Of this increase, 804,000 were held by UK nationals, 92,000 by non-EU nationals and 60,000 by EU nationals</li>
  <li>in June 2021, payrolled employments of non-EU nationals were 186,000 above the pre-pandemic level at 2.23 million. Comparatively, payrolled employments of UK nationals were 197,000 below the pre-pandemic level at 25.79 million and payrolled employments of EU nationals were 171,000 below the pre-pandemic level at 2.48 million</li>
</ul>

<h3>Payrolled employments by region and nationality, July 2014 to June 2021</h3>

<ul>
  <li>in the UK, London consistently had the highest number of payrolled employments held by non-UK nationals between July 2014 and June 2021. Payrolled employments held by EU and non-EU nationals in London each peaked in November 2019 at 861,000</li>
  <li>between June 2016 and June 2019, all countries and regions of the UK experienced an increase in the number of payrolled employments</li>
  <li>between June 2019 and June 2021, the total number of payrolled employments in the UK decreased. However, the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber, East Midlands and Northern Ireland experienced small increases in payrolled employment counts</li>
  <li>in June 2021, London had the highest proportion of payrolled employments held by EU nationals out of all of the regions and countries of the UK, at 18%. This was followed by the East at 9%. London also had the highest proportion of payrolled employments held by non-EU nationals at 20%, followed by the South East at 8%</li>
</ul>

<h3>Payrolled employments by industry and nationality, July 2014 to June 2021</h3>

<ul>
  <li>between June 2016 and June 2019, payrolled employments in health and social work increased by 257,000, the largest increase across all industries. Of this increase, 169,000 were held by UK nationals, 57,000 by non-EU nationals and 31,000 by EU nationals</li>
  <li>between June 2019 and June 2021, accommodation and food services saw the largest decrease in payrolled employments. The total number of payrolled employments decreased by 124,000, largely due to a drop of 98,000 in payrolled employments held by EU nationals</li>
  <li>in June 2021, agriculture, forestry and fishing had the largest proportion of payrolled employments held by EU nationals at 17%. Health and social work, administrative and support services and information and communication were the industries with the highest proportion of payrolled employments held by non-EU nationals, all at 11%</li>
</ul>

<h3>About the data in this release</h3>

<p>The data in this release covers the period 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2021. It is a count of all payrolled employments that were active in a given month using <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> for <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> data. This only includes employments paid through <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and not through other sources of income such as self-employment.</p>

<p>This release predominately focuses on payrolled employments held by non-UK nationals (EU and non-EU). The joint <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/earningsandemploymentfrompayasyouearnrealtimeinformationuk/previousReleases" rel="external">Earnings and employment from <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr></a> release between <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and the Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>) remains the primary source of information on payrolled employees. Information on how this statistical release differs from the joint <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> statistics can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#comp">comparability section</a> .</p>

<p>In these statistics, we group by three broad nationality groups (UK, EU and non-EU) and four EU sub-groupings (EU14, EU8, EU2 and Other EU). More information on these groupings is provided below.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>UK</h4>

<p>The 4 countries of the United Kingdom; England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland</p>

<h4>EU</h4>

<p>The EU consists of the 27 countries of the EU. All the individual countries that make up the EU are listed below under the EU14, EU8, EU2 and Other EU headings</p>

<h4>EU14</h4>

<p>Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Republic of Ireland, Spain and Sweden</p>

<h4>EU8</h4>

<p>Eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004: Czech Republic, Estonia, Poland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Slovenia</p>

<h4>EU2</h4>

<p>Bulgaria and Romania</p>

<h4>Other EU</h4>

<p>Malta, Cyprus and Croatia</p>

<h4>non-EU</h4>

<p>non-EU countries excludes the UK and all EU countries identified above</p>
</div>

<h3>Key limitations and revisions</h3>

<p>Payrolled employment counts are a measure of payrolled employee jobs; therefore, a single employee might have multiple concurrent employments across different 2007 Standard Industry Classification (<abbr title="Standard Industry Classification">SIC</abbr>) code groupings. Values for employee jobs are calculated based on the proportion of each month in which the employment was being worked (for example, if an employment started halfway through the month, then it would be counted as half a payrolled employment when aggregated up).</p>

<p>This approach aligns with the methodology used in the monthly earnings and employment estimates from <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> data. Occupational pensions and income from non-payrolled sources such as self-employment are not included.</p>

<h2>Payrolled employments in the UK by nationality, July 2014 to June 2021</h2>

<p>This section of the release presents counts of payrolled employments in the UK, broken down by nationality, from July 2014 to June 2021.</p>

<p>The data in this release are non-seasonally adjusted, therefore the effects of regular, or seasonal, patterns have not been removed from these series.</p>

<p>The underlying data for both charts in this section can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1057055/Payrolled_employments_in_the_UK_by_region__industry_and_nationality__from_July_2014_to_June_2021__.xlsx" rel="external">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<h2>Annual growth rates in payrolled employment counts by industry and nationality, July 2014 to June 2021</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#fig-11">Figure 10</a> compares the number of payrolled employments in each month with the same month in the previous year. Where the annual growth rate is positive, the number of payrolled employments are higher than they were in the same month in the previous year. Where the annual growth rate is negative, the number of payrolled employments are lower than they were in the same month in the previous year.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>This section provides information about the methods and quality assurance steps used to produce this experimental statistics publication.</p>

<h3>Purpose of the statistics</h3>

<p>These statistics provide a breakdown, by nationality, of all payrolled employments in the UK. A time series going back to July 2014, supported by monthly summary statistics up to June 2021, provide some insights into the non-UK national workforce in the UK for specific industries and geographical areas.</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>

<h4>Payrolled employment</h4>

<p>Payrolled employment counts are a measure of payrolled employee jobs, therefore a single employee might have multiple concurrent employments across different 2007 <abbr title="Standard Industry Classification">SIC</abbr> code groupings. Values for employee jobs are calculated based on the proportion of each month in which the employment was being worked (for example, if an employment started halfway through the month, then it would be counted as half an employment when aggregated up).</p>

<p>This approach aligns with the methodology used in the monthly earnings and employment estimates from <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> data. Occupational pensions and income from non-payrolled sources such as self-employment are not included.</p>

<h4>Pay As You Earn</h4>

<p>Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) is the system employers and pension providers use to take Income Tax and National Insurance contributions before they pay wages or pensions to employees and pensioners. It was introduced in 1944 and is now the way that most employees pay Income Tax in the UK. This publication relates to employments only, not employees or pensioners.</p>

<h4>Nationality</h4>

<p>For most residents in the UK (including foreign nationals), National Insurance numbers are automatically issued when an individual turns 15 years and 9 months old. This standard registration process does not collate information on nationality.</p>

<p>Individuals who are not allocated a National Insurance number through the standard registration process (for example, those who come from abroad after the age of 16) are required to apply for a National Insurance number through the Department for Work and Pensions’ (<abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) adult National Insurance number registration process. This process records nationality at the point of registration. Subsequent naturalisation (to UK citizenship), other changes in nationality and multiple nationalities are not recorded.</p>

<h4>Industry (Standard Industry Classification - <abbr title="Standard Industry Classification">SIC</abbr>)</h4>

<p>The industrial sectors in this bulletin are based on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://onsdigital.github.io/dp-classification-tools/standard-industrial-classification/ONS_SIC_hierarchy_view.html" rel="external">UK Standard Industrial Classification (<abbr title="Standard Industry Classification">SIC</abbr>) codes</a>, as defined by the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>. These codes have been determined from both the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/paidservices/interdepartmentalbusinessregisteridbr" rel="external">Inter-Departmental Business Register (<abbr title="Inter-Departmental Business Register">IDBR</abbr>)</a> and data from Companies House for each <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> enterprise.</p>

<p>For some payrolled employments, the high-level 2007 <abbr title="Standard Industry Classification">SIC</abbr> code groupings are unknown. These employments are grouped with the Household and Extraterritorial Organisations Industries.</p>

<h4>Region (Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics - <abbr title="Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics">NUTS</abbr>)</h4>

<p>Estimates in this publication are available for England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the nine English regions, in accordance with the <abbr title="Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics">NUTS</abbr> classification which came into force on 1 January 2015. The Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics (<abbr title="Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics">NUTS</abbr>) provides a single uniform breakdown to produce regional statistics.</p>

<p>Geographic location for employments is recorded based on where the corresponding individual lives, not where they work. Employments where the information is missing are assigned values based on proportions from historic trends.</p>

<h3>Data Sources</h3>

<h4>Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) for Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>)</h4>

<p>The data for this release comes from the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> system. It covers the whole population rather than a sample of people or companies and allows for more detailed estimates of the population.</p>

<p>As individuals who were furloughed as part of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme should still have their employments reported through this system, they should feature in these data and contribute toward the employment statistics for the relevant period.</p>

<h4>Migrant Worker Scan (<abbr title="Migrant Worker Scan">MWS</abbr>)</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="Migrant Worker Scan">MWS</abbr> is an extract or subset of data, compiled from the National Insurance and Pay as You Earn Service (<abbr title="National Insurance and Pay as You Earn Service">NPS</abbr>) database system. The <abbr title="National Insurance and Pay as You Earn Service">NPS</abbr> system is owned by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, with input from <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. The July 2021 extract of the <abbr title="Migrant Worker Scan">MWS</abbr> was used for this analysis.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> register post-16 National Insurance numbers through their adult registration process, which usually includes an interview to verify identity and right to residency in the UK. In some circumstances, <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will allocate National Insurance numbers following a successful application through the Home Office (HO) for a Biometric Residence Permit (<abbr title="Biometric Residence Permit">BRP</abbr>) or another ‘fast path’ application process.</p>

<p>In all the above scenarios, <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will allocate the National Insurance number and enter the information onto the <abbr title="National Insurance and Pay as You Earn Service">NPS</abbr> system, including details of their nationality at the point of application.</p>

<p>When Child Benefit is claimed on behalf of foreign national resident children, a National Insurance number is automatically allocated at the age of 15. These individuals will not appear on the <abbr title="Migrant Worker Scan">MWS</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>

<p>An <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/articles/newmethodsformonthlyearningsandemploymentestimatesfrompayasyouearnrealtimeinformationpayertidata/december2019" rel="external">accompanying article</a> contains more information on the calendarisation and imputation methodologies used in these statistics, alongside comparisons with other earnings and employment statistics.</p>

<p>Statistics in this release are based on people who are employed in at least one job paid through <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>, and monthly estimates reflect the average number of payrolled employments held by such individuals for each day of the calendar month. This aligns with the methodology used in the monthly <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> statistics.</p>

<p>A seasonal adjustment factor is not applied to these statistics, however the data is subject to seasonality. Drivers of seasonality in the statistics are likely to be linked to seasonality in employment and within certain industries, so care should be taken when comparing estimates on a monthly or quarterly basis.</p>

<h3>Coverage</h3>

<p>This publication covers all employments in the UK that are administered by employers through the <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> for <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> service. It does not cover self-employment income or income from other sources such as pensions, property rental and investments. Where individuals have multiple sources of income, only income from employers is included.</p>

<p>These statistics cover the period 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2021. Information for July 2021 onwards is subject to an underlying data issue affecting the recording of nationality onto the administrative systems. This is currently being investigated further, and once a solution is in place, we will look to extend the time series as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Limitations of the data</h3>

<p>References to nationality are based on the nationality reported by individuals when they registered for a National Insurance number through the adult National Insurance number registration process, no matter how long ago this took place. Subsequently, individuals may change citizenship to become British nationals. Current citizenship is not shown within these statistics.</p>

<p>The figures reflect adult overseas nationals allocated a National Insurance number through the adult registration process. In addition, there will be a small number of overseas nationals (aged 16 to 19 years) allocated a National Insurance number through the Juvenile Registration scheme. This occurs when the individual has previously been allocated a child registration number. These juvenile cases are not captured by the statistics.</p>

<p>Some individuals with the right to work in the UK will pay tax using a Temporary Reference Number (<abbr title="Temporary Reference Number">TRN</abbr>) rather than a National Insurance number. These are not identified in the <abbr title="Migrant Worker Scan">MWS</abbr> and so have been classified as UK nationals. It is possible that multiple TRNs correspond to the same employment, which could inflate counts for UK nationals.</p>

<h3>Experimental Statistics status</h3>

<p>This release is classed as experimental as the methodologies used to produce the statistics are still in their development phase. This does not mean that the statistics are of low quality, but it does signify that the statistics are new and still being developed. As the methodologies are refined and improved, there may be revisions to these statistics.</p>

<p>More information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/guidetoexperimentalstatistics" rel="external">Experimental Statistics</a>, including when they should be used and the differences between them and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/list-of-national-statistics/" rel="external">National Statistics</a>, is available.</p>

<h3>Pre-release data</h3>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> grants pre-release access to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/about-the-authority/uk-statistical-system/types-of-official-statistics/" rel="external">official statistics</a> publications, and in accordance with the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> policy, 24 hour pre-release access has been granted to a number of people to enable the preparation of a ministerial briefing. Further details, including a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hmrc-statistics-pre-release-access-list">list of those granted access</a>, can be found on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s website</a>.</p>

<h3>User engagement</h3>

<p>Rather than waiting until the development work has been completed, the statistics are being published now to involve potential users in developing the statistics further. We hope that this encourages users to provide us with their thoughts and suggestions of how useful the statistics are and what can be done to improve them. Comments can be sent by <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:rtistatistics.enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk">email</a>.</p>

<h3>Future publications</h3>

<p>The intention is that these new statistics will be updated on an annual basis.</p>

<h3>Comparability and related publications</h3>

<p>Care needs to be taken when comparing these statistics to other sources. It is important to consider the coverage of these statistics.</p>

<p>Payrolled employments cannot be directly compared with payrolled employees. As payrolled employees can have multiple payrolled employments, payrolled employment counts follow the same trend as payrolled employee counts, but counts will be higher.</p>

<p>Employments from the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> system cannot be compared with all jobs. These statistics only include employments from the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> system, they do not include employments from non-payrolled sources such as self-employment.</p>

<p>For example, any comparisons to estimates from the Labour Force Survey (<abbr title="Labour Force Survey">LFS</abbr>) should be treated with caution. Differences between the two sources are possible for reasons including, but not limited to, sampling variability in the <abbr title="Labour Force Survey">LFS</abbr>, as well as definitional differences in nationality and payrolled employments as outlined above.

<p>The <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> analysis released today (1 March) is based on the same source of <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> data and the same extract of the <abbr title="Migrant Worker Scan">MWS</abbr> but focuses on exploring changes in payrolled employments of non-British nationals in the context of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) and EU Exit periods.</p>

<p>Along with supplementary information from other data sources such as the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> Vacancy Survey and the Business Insights and Conditions Survey, the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> article explores changing trends over this time for a few industries of note. These include accommodation and food services; agriculture forestry and fishing; construction; and transportation and storage.</p>

<p>The joint <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> release includes counts of payrolled employees at a UK level, on both a Seasonally Adjusted (<abbr title="Seasonally Adjusted">SA</abbr>) and Non-Seasonally Adjusted (<abbr title="Non-Seasonally Adjusted">NSA</abbr>) basis. This release also includes breakdowns by industry and region. As a payrolled employee might have multiple concurrent payrolled employments, total employee counts are lower than the corresponding employment counts.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="#fig-15">chart</a> below shows the difference between the joint <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> release and this release. On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, payrolled employments are at a higher level but follow the same trend as the number of payrolled employees.</p>
