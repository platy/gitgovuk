<p>These statistics show the latest number of personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) items which have been distributed for use by health and social care services in England.</p>

<p>In publishing this data, we aim to provide a regular summary for ministers, policy makers and external stakeholders on <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items distributed. The Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) intends to release these statistics weekly while they remain relevant to the government’s response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>

<h2>Main points</h2>

<p>In the 7 days to 14 March 2021, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> distributed over 236 million <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items for use by health and social care services in England through the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> Dedicated Supply Channel, NHS Supply Chain and other routes<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Since 25 February 2020 <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has distributed over 9.3 billion items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, predominantly for use by health and social care services in England. This figure also includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>over 337 million items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> authorised for release to designated wholesalers<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="govuk-link">[footnote 2]</a></sup> for onward sale to GPs (40 million), adult social care providers (258 million), community pharmacies (1.2 million) and dentists (38 million). This data has been reported by the date of delivery to the wholesaler</li>
  <li>over 282 million items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to local resilience forums (<abbr title="local resilience forums">LRFs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>over 104 million items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to local authorities that have taken over the role of <abbr title="local resilience forums">LRFs</abbr>, in areas where <abbr title="local resilience forums">LRFs</abbr> have stood down from 14 September 2020</li>
  <li>over 31 million items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to public services overseen by other government departments and organisations. This includes <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> distributed to Public Health England, MOD Medical Service, Maritime and Coastguard Agency and Ministry of Justice<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3">[footnote 3]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>over 13 million items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> provided to the devolved administrations between April and June 2020<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4">[footnote 4]</a></sup>. This data has been ratified by the devolved administrations</li>
  <li>a small proportion of items distributed to Crown Dependencies</li>
</ul>

<p>Organisations may procure additional <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> independently of these routes. Any additional <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is not included in this data.</p>

<p>This compares with approximately 2.43 billion items distributed between 1 January and 31 December 2019 to all NHS trusts and some social care organisations. This figure is a partial snapshot of the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> used in the system before the COVID-19 pandemic. The NHS Supply Chain has since been expanded to 58,000 different settings, including care homes, hospices and community care organisations.</p>

<p>The current reporting system has been in place since 25 February 2020. It is estimated that between 1 January and 24 February 2020, approximately 326 million items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> were distributed. This data was collected before the current reporting system was in place, so data quality is uncertain. For further detail see <a href="#table-2" class="govuk-link">Table 2</a>.</p>

<p>The data reported in Table 1 includes all types of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, items that are critical for infection control<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="govuk-link">[footnote 7]</a></sup> and a small number of other fast-moving items<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8">[footnote 8]</a></sup>. These items were made available through NHS Supply Chain during the COVID-19 pandemic because there was a significant increase in usage. Some of these items were not available through NHS Supply Chain in 2019.</p>

<p>Unless specified, all items are counted individually<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="govuk-link">[footnote 9]</a></sup>. For example, gloves are not counted as pairs and are delivered in boxes of 200 as single items. Clinical procedures may use 1, 2 or 4 gloves at a time. Hand hygiene products are counted per bottle (or similar) and include hand wash and alcohol-based hand sanitiser.</p>

<h2>Measuring the data</h2>

<h3>How the data was collected</h3>

<p>The data was collected from management information provided by Supply Chain Coordination Limited (NHS Supply Chain) since 25 February 2020. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> receives this data daily from NHS Supply Chain which since April 2020 have been compiled by Clipper.</p>

<p>Since April 2020 all products are distributed by Clipper and stored in a central warehouse in Daventry before delivery. Prior to April 2020 some items were distributed from the NHS Supply Chain Regional Distribution Centres.</p>

<p>Data is reported by the date of delivery, which covers all <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items delivered within a 24-hour window from 2am on the date in question to 2am the next day. Some organisations subsequently further distribute the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. For these organisations, the date used is the date of delivery from <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> to the organisation and not the date of subsequent delivery to the end user. Items are sometimes recalled, such as when they are faulty or do not meet set criteria. The figures presented are a combination of the number of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items distributed minus those recalled and credits for stock that was processed through the system but unfulfilled.</p>

<p>Consequently, some days have negative delivery of items. Some items which have been recalled may still feature in the data as they are yet to be removed.</p>

<p>The data is not a measure of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> use as some items may not be used, while reusable items may be used multiple times.</p>

<p>The figures in this bulletin may differ from those previously quoted due to differences in start date and inclusion of items in the definition of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Coverage</h3>

<p>The data covers <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> distributed predominantly for use by health and social care services in England.</p>

<p>The data includes deliveries from the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> Dedicated Supply Channel to organisations such as NHS trusts, National Supply Distribution Response, <abbr title="local resilience forums">LRFs</abbr>, local authorities and wholesalers for onward distribution and use by health and social care providers. These organisations may also procure <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> through other routes, so these data does not constitute all <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> available to NHS trusts, social care and primary care providers.</p>

<h3>Quality</h3>

<p>These statistics have been put together by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> with advice from NHS Supply Chain and the Office for National Statistics on this approach.</p>

<p>More information on quality and how this publication adheres to the Code of Practice for Statistics is available in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ppe-delivery-statistics-statement-of-compliance-with-the-code-of-practice-for-statistics" class="govuk-link">statement of compliance</a>.</p>

<h3>Future development</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> intends to release these statistics weekly while they remain relevant to the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
