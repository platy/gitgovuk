<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>There is great demand for data on coronavirus (COVID-19) cases, hospitalisations and deaths by ethnic group. However, ethnicity data is not collected at death registration and, in addition, there are gaps in the ethnicity data available for confirmed COVID-19 cases.  A process was therefore needed to assign ethnicity from <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/hospital-episode-statistics" rel="external" class="govuk-link">NHS Digital Hospital Episodes Statistics (<abbr title="Hospital Episode Statistics">HES</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>This document details how <abbr title="COVID-19 Health Inequalities Monitoring in England">CHIME</abbr> assigns ethnicity to records of deaths, hospital admissions and confirmed COVID-19 cases, and the methods used.</p>

<p>As different ethnicities may be recorded in different treatment episodes, the method selected a single ethnic group from a patient’s <abbr title="Hospital Episode Statistics">HES</abbr> records and linked it with the COVID-19 case or death record. This method was used to provide data by ethnic group in the report on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-review-of-disparities-in-risks-and-outcomes" class="govuk-link">Disparities in the risks and outcomes of COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>During the pandemic, it became evident that this original method of assigning ethnicity had some limitations – in particular, that it overestimated the number of people in the ‘Other’ ethnic group.</p>

<p>Alternative methods of assigning ethnicity from <abbr title="Hospital Episode Statistics">HES</abbr> were therefore investigated and were discussed with stakeholders in the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (<abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>) (formerly Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> at the point of consultation), as well as external stakeholders from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the Race Disparity Unit, NHS Digital, the King’s Fund and the Institute of Health Equity.</p>

<p>A difference method was agreed and used for the data provided by ethnic group in the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://analytics.phe.gov.uk/apps/chime/">COVID-19 Health Inequalities Monitoring for England (<abbr title="COVID-19 Health Inequalities Monitoring in England">CHIME</abbr>) tool</a>. This document details the method for assigning ethnicity as used by <abbr title="COVID-19 Health Inequalities Monitoring in England">CHIME</abbr>. It also notes the source of the population estimates used for calculating rates for hospital admissions, deaths and confirmed COVID-19 cases by ethnic group.</p>

<h2>The method for assigning ethnicity from Hospital Episode Statistics</h2>

<p>The original method used by <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> (formerly <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) assigned the most recent usable ethnic code for an individual available in <abbr title="Hospital Episode Statistics">HES</abbr> data.</p>

<p>The new method is based on the NHS Digital <abbr title="Hospital Episode Statistics">HES</abbr> ethnicity index with a few modifications. The new method is for deaths and hospital admissions indicators using <abbr title="Hospital Episode Statistics">HES</abbr>. With this method:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the most frequent ethnicity recorded across the 3 <abbr title="Hospital Episode Statistics">HES</abbr> data sets (<a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/hospital-admitted-patient-care-activity" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Admitted Patient Care (<abbr title="Admitted Patient Care">APC</abbr>)</a> from 2003 to 2004 onwards, <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/hospital-accident--emergency-activity" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Accident and Emergency (<abbr title="Accident and Emergency">AE</abbr>)</a> from 2007 to 2008 onwards and <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/hospital-outpatient-activity">Outpatients (<abbr title="Outpatients">OP</abbr>)</a> from 2003 to 2004 onwards), excluding any unknown values, is used. <abbr title="Outpatients">OP</abbr> data was not used between 2006 to 2007 and 2009 to 2010 as, due to a technical issue, no ethnic code entries were recorded in those years. <abbr title="Admitted Patient Care">APC</abbr> data is restricted to 2003 to 2004 onwards as the quality and completeness of admitted patient care data was lower before then</li>
  <li>if there are multiple ethnicities in the data sets with the same frequency, the most recent is chosen</li>
  <li>if there are multiple ethnicities with the same frequency and latest date, precedence is given to the most recent value from the <abbr title="Admitted Patient Care">APC</abbr> data set as it is considered more robust, followed by the <abbr title="Accident and Emergency">AE</abbr> data set, followed by the <abbr title="Outpatients">OP</abbr> data set. Checks completed by NHS Digital indicate completeness in the <abbr title="Accident and Emergency">AE</abbr> data set is better than the <abbr title="Outpatients">OP</abbr> data set</li>
  <li>if there are multiple ethnicities with the same frequency, latest date and source of data, the ethnicity that occurs more frequently in the general population of England and Wales, according to the <a rel="external" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011census" class="govuk-link">2011 Census</a> (see Appendix A), is selected. Incidences of this are very small, and this step was introduced in order to automate the process and to receive the exact same result each time the analysis is completed</li>
  <li>a value of ‘Ethnicity unknown’ will only be present if there are no known ethnicities in any of the <abbr title="Hospital Episode Statistics">HES</abbr> data sets</li>
  <li>to take into the account the overrepresentation of the ‘Other’ ethnic group, if the most common ethnic group assigned by the method above is ‘Other’ then the second-most common usable ethnic group is assigned instead. A person will only be assigned to the Other ethnic group if there are no other usable ethnic groups</li>
</ul>

<p>To note, it is perfectly valid for patients to decide to not state their ethnicity when this information is collected in hospital data. People may also decide to state their ethnicity on some occasions but not others. The original and new methods used for assigning ethnicity do not select ‘Not stated’ records if there are alternative ethnic codes available. Only those who do not have a usable ethnic code and have repeatedly not stated their ethnicity will have the ethnicity ‘Not stated’ recorded.</p>

<h2>Impact of the change in method</h2>

<p>The biggest impact of the change in method (for indicators of death and hospitalisations) has been on the ‘Other’ ethnic group. In the report on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-review-of-disparities-in-risks-and-outcomes">disparities in the risks and outcomes of COVID-19</a>, the highest mortality rates for deaths involving COVID-19 in the first wave of the pandemic were, by some margin, in the ‘Other’ group (see Appendix B).
That is not the case for the mortality rates presented in the <abbr title="COVID-19 Health Inequalities Monitoring in England">CHIME</abbr> tool. Across the pandemic period to date, the cumulative mortality rates (and hospital admission rates) using the new method of ethnicity assignment were highest for the Black and Asian groups.</p>

<h2>Method for assigning ethnicity – confirmed COVID-19 cases</h2>

<p>Indicators looking at confirmed COVID-19 cases within the <abbr title="COVID-19 Health Inequalities Monitoring in England">CHIME</abbr> tool primarily use the ethnicity recorded during pillar 2 testing (swab testing for the wider population as part of the UK government testing programme). If the ethnicity collected is a usable ethnic code, this will be the ethnicity used for the <abbr title="COVID-19 Health Inequalities Monitoring in England">CHIME</abbr> indicators.</p>

<p>However, for any confirmed cases that do not have a usable ethnic code (such as ‘Prefer not to say’ or ‘NULL’)  and for all pillar 1 cases (swab testing in <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> (now <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>) labs and NHS hospitals for those with a clinical need, and health and care workers), the ethnicity used will be determined for the individual through the use of the new method for assigning ethnicity from <abbr title="Hospital Episode Statistics">HES</abbr> detailed above.</p>

<p>As with deaths and hospital admissions, the biggest impact of adopting this method of assigning ethnicity to confirmed cases has been a reduction in the percentage of cases assigned to the ‘Other’ ethnic group.</p>

<p>Appendix C shows how ethnicity coding in pillar 2 cases has improved throughout the pandemic.</p>

<h2>Broad ethnic groups</h2>

<p>Because of small populations for some ethnic groups in some regions, rates for hospital admissions, deaths and confirmed cases are only presented for detailed ethnic groups within England as a whole in the <abbr title="COVID-19 Health Inequalities Monitoring in England">CHIME</abbr> tool.</p>

<p>Rates are also presented for broad ethnic groups within England and within regions (but the rates for regions are cumulative and are not presented by month).</p>

<p>The broad ‘Black or Black British’ ethnic group is made up of the detailed groups: ‘Black African’, ‘Black Caribbean’ and any other ‘Black’ background.</p>

<p>The broad ‘Asian or Asian British’ ethnic group is made up of the detailed groups: ‘Bangladeshi’, ‘Chinese’, ‘Indian’, ‘Pakistani’ and any other ‘Asian’ background.</p>

<h2>Population estimates for ethnic groups</h2>

<p>In the report <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-review-of-disparities-in-risks-and-outcomes">disparities in the risks and outcomes of COVID-19</a>, the populations for ethnic groups were from <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/adhocs/008780populationdenominatorsbyethnicgroupregionsandcountriesenglandandwales2011to2017">population estimates from the ONS</a>.</p>

<p>These estimates were based on population data from the 2011 Census that were ‘aged-on’ to create annual estimates for years up to 2018.</p>

<p>These estimates, however, had some limitations, including the fact that they did not take into account the effect of international migration since 2011 on the ethnic distribution of the population. ONS noted that this was likely to lead to some underestimate of the population in some ethnic groups, particularly, the ‘Asian’ and ‘Other’ groups, which would increase over time.</p>

<p>In the <abbr title="COVID-19 Health Inequalities Monitoring in England">CHIME</abbr> tool, an alternative set of populations has therefore been used for the rates of hospital admissions, deaths and confirmed cases by ethnic group.</p>

<p>These are estimates from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/852508/" rel="external">ETHPOP projections</a>, which were produced for <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> (now <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>) by Philip Rees and Paul Norman in the School of Geography, University of Leeds<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The estimates used were for 2019. Estimates for 2020 and 2021 are planned, and it will be possible to revise the rates presented in the <abbr title="COVID-19 Health Inequalities Monitoring in England">CHIME</abbr> tool once they are available. The 2019 estimates themselves are also expected to be modified, but these changes are unlikely to significantly alter the rates presented.</p>

<p>These populations are modelled rather than being counts of individuals. They are thus presented in the <abbr title="COVID-19 Health Inequalities Monitoring in England">CHIME</abbr> tool at one decimal place, rather than as whole numbers.</p>
