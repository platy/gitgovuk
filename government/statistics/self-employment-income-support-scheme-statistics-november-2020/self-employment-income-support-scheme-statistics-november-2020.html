<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Main findings</h2>

<p>The main findings from these statistics are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>around 5 million individuals reported self-employment income for the tax year 2018 to 2019, and had their data assessed for potential <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> eligibility. In order to be assessed, a self-employed individual needed to have traded in the tax year 2018 to 2019 and submitted a Self Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>via this process, 3.4 million self-employed individuals were identified as potentially eligible for the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> scheme. This means that they met the criteria for the scheme based on Self Assessment returns from the tax year 2018 to 19 and earlier years. However, some of the potentially eligible businesses will not have been adversely affected by Coronavirus or have ceased trading since the tax year 2018 to 19 so will not have been eligible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by 31 October 2.3 million (69%) of the potentially eligible population had claimed a second <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant with the value of these claims totalling £5.9 billion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>compared with the end of September, an additional 89,000 people had claimed the grant by 31 October.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the average value per <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> 2 claim was £2,500.</p>
  </li>
  <li>around two-thirds of the potentially eligible population are male (2.3 million).
    <ul>
      <li>the average claim for females is also lower at £2,000 compared to the average claim for males of £2,700.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>around 91% of claimants are aged between 25 and 64 and take-up of the grant in those age groups is at or above 67%.  No one age group dominates and claims are evenly spread.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the sector with the highest number of potentially eligible individuals and the highest proportion of claims is the construction industry. By 31 October, construction workers had made 800,000 claims for <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> totalling £2.4bn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the 2 regions with the highest number of claims are London (465,000) and the South East (338,000), reflecting their relative sizes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of the 1.6 million that did not meet the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> criteria, 1.4 million (87%) had trading profits less than non-trading profits (e.g. income from employment or investment income), 0.5 million (33%) had trading profits of £0 or made a loss and 0.2 million (11%) had trading profits over £50,000. (N.B. Individuals may be counted more than once if they have trading profits which meet more than one of these criteria which explains why the figures sum to more than 1.6 million).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by 31 October, 2.7 million individuals had claimed for either the first or second <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant. Of these 2.3 million individuals (86%) claimed both grants, 319,000 (12%) claimed only the first grant and 61,000 (2%) only claimed the second grant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>claims for only the first grant totalled £951 million and claims for only the second grant totalled £129 million.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>About this release</h2>

<p>The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (<abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>) provides support for self-employed individuals whose business has been adversely affected by Coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>On 17 August 2020 applications for the second grant of <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> opened. This is a grant worth 70% of their average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering 3 months’ worth of profits, and capped at £6,570 in total. The eligibility criteria for <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> 2 is the same as for <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> 1.</p>

<p>The data used in this release cover claims for the second grant in the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> up to 31 October 2020. This data has been matched with other <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> data to present breakdowns of claims by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>age and gender</li>
  <li>sector of the economy</li>
  <li>geography</li>
</ul>

<p>The first grant, for which applications closed on 13 July 2020, was based on 80% of your trading profits and capped at £7,500 in total. Official statistics on the first <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant are presented in an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/self-employment-income-support-scheme-statistics-august-2020" class="govuk-link">earlier publication</a> covering data up until 31 July 2020.</p>

<p>Official statistics for the first grant are not repeated here but Section 12 does provide a comparison of claimants of the first and second grants.</p>

<span class="number">4. </span>
<abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> second grant claims and eligibility</h2>

<p>Around 5 million individuals who reported income from self-employment were assessed for <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>: 3.4 million of these were found to be potentially eligible and 1.6 million were found to be ineligible.</p>

<p>Between 17 August and 31 October 2020, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> received 2.3 million claims for the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> from a total potentially eligible population of 3.4 million. These claims totalled £5.9 billion with an average award of £2,500 per claimant.</p>

<p>Eligibility for <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> required an individual to have levels of income which met specific tests on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their 2018 to 2019 tax year income, or</li>
  <li>the combination of income for consecutive tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, and 2018 to 2019 where available.</li>
</ul>

<p>Figures below represent all criteria that apply to each individual from both sets of tests. Additionally, within each element individuals can be ineligible for multiple reasons and, as a result, there is a high level of overlap between the categories presented below.</p>

<p>Of the 1.6 million individuals who were assessed to be ineligible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>87% (1,436,000) had a trading profit that was less than their non-trading income;</li>
  <li>33% (543,000) had a trading profit £0 or less;</li>
  <li>11% (186,000) had trading profit exceeding £50,000 per year;</li>
  <li>3% (45,000) were ineligible for other reasons,</li>
</ul>

<p>Figure 1 shows the number of <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> claims for the second grant and the potentially eligible population by gender. Table 1 also shows claim values by gender.</p>

<p>Of 5.0 million individuals who were assessed for potential eligibility, men make up around two-thirds (65%), and also make up a slightly higher proportion (68%) of the potentially eligible population.</p>

<p>By 31 October <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> had received 1,663,000 claims from men totalling £4.6 billion compared to 684,000 claims from women for £1.4 billion. Males have a higher take-up rate than females (72% compared to 64%) and their average grant value (£2,700) is higher than the average for females (£2,000).</p>

<p>Around 89% of individuals who were assessed for potential eligibility were between the ages of 25 and 64, with over 91% of claimants coming from this age group. Take-up of the grant in these age-groups is at or above 71%, with the exception that those between 55 to 64 have a take up rate of 67%. No one age group dominates and claims are evenly spread.</p>

<p>The take up rate is noticeably lower for those who are aged 65 and over (52% have claimed), although they have the highest average claim value at £2,900. The youngest age group have lowest average claim value at £1,800.</p>

<abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> second grant by industry sector</h2>
<p>(see Table 3 in the accompanying tables for further details)</p>

<p>Self-employed individuals are asked to provide a description of their business activity on their self-assessment returns. These activities have been mapped across to the Standard Industrial Classification (<abbr title="Standard Industrial Classification">SIC</abbr>) 2007 to enable analysis to be carried out by industry sector. Where an individual has multiple sources of self-employed income the activity with the highest income has been used for the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> analysis.</p>

<p>Figures 3 and 4 show the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> populations and number of claims for the second grant made by industry sector.</p>

<p>The construction industry has the largest population of individuals who were assessed for potential eligibility with over 1.2 million and just under 1.1 million of these were potentially eligible to apply. By 31 October construction workers had made 800,000 claims for <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> totalling £2.4 billion; an average of £3,100 per claimant.</p>

<p>Self-employed individuals in the transportation and storage sector make up 8% of the potentially eligible population and made 217,000 claims totalling £410 million. Administrative and support services also make up 8% of the potentially eligible population and have made 171,000 claims totalling £304 million.</p>

<p>The highest rates of being assessed as potentially eligible for <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> were from individuals working in the construction industry (86%) and the transportation and storage sector (82%).</p>

<p>Lower rates of being assessed as potentially eligible for <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> were found for individuals working in real estate activities (29%), financial and insurance activities (41%) and agriculture, forestry and fishing (45%).</p>

<abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> second grant claims by industry sector and geography</h2>
<p>(see Table 6 in the accompanying tables for further details)</p>

<p>Sections 9 to 11 consider the breakdown of the number of claims received in each country and region by different demographics (industry, gender and age).  Comparable information relating to the value of claims, the potentially eligible population and take-up rates can be found in tables 6 and 7 in the accompanying tables.</p>

<p>Figure 8 shows the breakdown of claims in each region and country by industry sector.  Construction, transport and administrative services have the largest number of claims overall and are shown as separate categories on the chart. Agriculture, forestry and fishing is also large for some areas and is shown separately. Other smaller industries have been combined.</p>

<p>The industry profile of <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> claimants does not vary greatly between countries and regions. The main exceptions are seen in the construction industry and agriculture, forestry and fishing.</p>

<p>Individuals working in the construction industry account for the highest proportion of claims in every country and region of the UK. London has the highest proportion, with 40% of claims being from those working in construction and Scotland has the lowest with 26%.</p>

<p>Individuals working in agriculture, forestry and fishing account for 12% of all claims made by individuals in Northern Ireland, 7% in Wales, 4% in Scotland and only 1% in England.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The allocation to industry represents an individual’s highest earning self-employment.</li>
  <li>473,000 cases of the potentially eligible population are included as ‘Unknown and other’ and almost all of these (99%) could not be allocated to a <abbr title="Standard Industrial Classification">SIC</abbr> code.</li>

<abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> second grant claims by gender and geography</h2>
<p>(see Table 7 in the accompanying tables for further details)</p>

<p>The area with the highest proportion of males in the potentially eligible population is Northern Ireland (73%) and the lowest areas are Scotland and the South West (65% each). A similar pattern is seen in the number of claims received by 31 October with male claimants accounting for 75% of claims in Northern Ireland and 66% of claims in Scotland.</p>

<p>Since the average claim amount is higher for males than females, men account for an even higher proportion of total claim values. In the West Midlands, Northern Ireland and London 79% of total claim values are from men. The lowest male share is in Scotland where 73% of the total amount claimed is claimed by men.</p>

<p>This section provides a comparison to show how many individuals have claimed both the first and second <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grants, only the first <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant or only the second <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant. It also provides a comparison of the age/gender, geography and industry sector of claimants of only the first <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant compared to only the second <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant.</p>

<p>By 31 October 2020, 2.7 million individuals had claimed for either the first or second <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant or both. Of these, 2.3 million individuals (86%) claimed both grants, 319,000 (12%) claimed only the first grant and 61,000 (2%) only claimed the second grant.</p>

<p>Claims for the first grant totalled £7.6 billion and claims for the second grant totalled £5.9 billion, giving a combined total of £13.5 billion for both grants.</p>

<p>The average claim for the first <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant for those claiming both grants (£2,900) is slightly lower than for those only claiming the first grant (£3,000). In contrast, the average claim for the second <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant for those claiming both grants (£2,500) is higher than for those only claiming the second grant (£2,100).</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Average for all claimants of <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> 1 excludes the 61,000 who have not claimed the first grant and the average for all claimants of <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> 2 excludes the 319,000 who have not not claimed the second grant.</li>
</ol>

<p>The accompanying tables (8a-8c) provide further comparisons of the claimants of both schemes, only the first and only the second <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grants by age and gender, geography and industry sector.</p>

<p>Key points from the tables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>there is a higher proportion of total claimants (8.3 percentage point difference) under 45 that claimed for both schemes than those that claimed just for <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> 1. This suggests there is an older demographic only claiming <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> 1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a higher proportion of females (3.9 percentage point difference) claimed just for <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> 2 than claimed for both schemes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>regional differences between the 3 populations are generally consistent apart from London. A greater proportion of total claimants (5.3 percentage point difference) claimed just for <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> 2 than did for both schemes whereas a lower proportion of total claimants (4.5 percentage point difference) claimed just for <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> 1 compared to both schemes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the proportion of total claimants in the transport and storage sector that claimed for both schemes is higher than those that claimed only <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> 1 (5.5 percentage point difference) and only <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> 2 (3.0 percentage point difference). This suggests that more claimants in this sector have claimed both grants relative to claimants in other sectors.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>Background to the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>
</h2>

<p><abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> was announced on 26 March 2020 as part of the UK government’s support package for businesses and self-employed people during the coronavirus outbreak in early 2020. The scheme was open to self-employed individuals and members of a partnership who met the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>traded in the tax year 2018 to 2019 and submitted their Self Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year</li>
  <li>traded in the tax year 2019 to 2020</li>
  <li>intended to continue to trade in the tax year 2020 to 2021</li>
  <li>carried on a trade which had been adversely affected by coronavirus</li>
</ul>

<p>A business could be adversely affected by coronavirus if, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they were unable to work because they:
    <ul>
      <li>were shielding</li>
      <li>were self-isolating</li>
      <li>were on sick leave because of coronavirus</li>
      <li>had caring responsibilities because of coronavirus</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>they have had to scale down or temporarily stop trading because:
    <ul>
      <li>their supply chain has been interrupted</li>
      <li>they have fewer or no customers or clients</li>
      <li>their staff are unable to come in to work</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The grant is not open to limited companies or those operating a trade through a trust.</p>

<p>To work out eligibility, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> first look at the 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return. Trading profits must be between £0 and £50,000 and at least equal to your non-trading income. If an individual is not eligible based on the 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will then look at the tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, and 2018 to 2019.</p>

<p>The scheme allows an eligible individual to claim a taxable grant worth 80% of their average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering 3 months’ worth of profits, and capped at £7,500 in total. The first <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant closed for claims on 13 July 2020.</p>

<p>On the 17 August 2020 applications for the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> second opened. This will be a taxable grant worth 70% of their average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering 3 months’ worth of profits, and capped at £6,570 in total.</p>

<p>On 5 November 2020 details of a third <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant were announced with the claim window opening on 30 November 2020. This will be a taxable grant worth 80% of an individual’s average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering 3 months’ worth of profits, and capped at £7,500 in total.</p>

<p>The statistics presented in this release mainly cover claims for the second grant in the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> scheme up to 31 October 2020. However, Tables 8 and 8a-8c provide a comparison of the individuals claiming each grant.</p>

<span class="number">14. </span>Glossary</h2>

<p>The assessed for potential eligibility population are those self-employed individuals who <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> identified as having traded in the tax year 2018 to 2019 and submitted their Self Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> potentially eligible population are those who <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> identified as being potentially eligible for a <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant based on the information held from their Self Assessment returns relating to the tax years; 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018 and 2018 to 2019. This is the group who have been invited to claim for a <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant.</p>

<p>This does not attempt to assess if a business was affected by coronavirus or whether they continued trading after the tax year 2018 to 2019.  So it is the potentially eligible population based only on the information in the Self Assessment forms and not all will apply for the grant.</p>

<p>The assessed to be ineligible population are those self-employed individuals who <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> identified as having traded in the tax year 2018 to 2019 and submitted their Self Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year, but were found not to be eligible after being assessed against the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> criteria.  Trading profits must be between £0 and £50,000 and at least equal to your non-trading income.</p>

<p>For an individual to be found ineligible based on the income criteria they need to be found ineligible based on the 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return and the combination of the relevant fields for consecutive tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, and 2018 to 2019.</p>

<p>Individuals are also included in the ineligible figures in this publication if an individual’s grant calculation resulted in an amount of £0 or less and if they are recorded as having ceased trading on the Self Assessment systems.</p>

<p>The number of claims is defined as the total number of individuals who had submitted a claim for a <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant by 18.46pm on 31 October 2020 that had been either paid, sent for payment or had been received and were awaiting various checks. Only non-rejected claims are included with the majority of these having been paid or sent for payment. However, a small number of claims were still being processed and could be rejected.</p>

<p>The definitions above apply in the vast majority of cases but there are some other circumstances that are considered when including individuals for assessment and which also may affect potential eligibility to <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>. However, some of these are only applicable from when the second and final <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant opens to claims on 17 August and are therefore not included in the statistics in this publication.

<span class="number">15. </span>Methodology and data sources</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.1 </span>Coverage</h3>

<p>This publication covers all self-employed individuals assessed for potential eligibility for the second <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant as at 31 October 2020. Generally, this includes individuals that <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> identified as having traded in the tax year 2018 to 2019 and submitted their Self-Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year.</p>

<p>Although this covers the vast majority of cases, there are some other circumstances that are considered when including individuals for assessment and which also may affect potential eligibility to <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>. You can read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-different-circumstances-affect-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme" class="govuk-link">how different circumstances affect <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr></a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Small changes in the numbers of eligible and ineligible individuals between publications may be observed as <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> continue to review and monitor <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> data systems to identify all potentially eligible individuals and to ensure that only genuine <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> customers are invited to claim.</p>

<p>The claim information covers individuals who had submitted a claim for the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant by 18.46pm on 31 October 2020 which had not rejected or failed certain compliance checks.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.2 </span>Data sources used in this release</h3>

<p>The data for this release come from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s system for administering <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>. It covers the whole population rather than a sample of people or companies.</p>

<p>Additional data from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Self Assessment system and other <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> administrative systems has been matched with <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> data to produce the data released here.</p>

<p>The age, gender and postcode of residential address has been collected from the Self Assessment account for each individual. The industry information has been collected from the Self Assessment return for the tax year 2018 to 2019, and relates to the self-employment business description provided on that return.</p>

<p>To produce the geographic breakdowns, the claimants’ residential postcode has been matched to Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>) data that links UK post codes to geographic areas. The geographic areas that have been presented in this release are country and English region, Local Authority and Parliamentary constituency.</p>

<p>The Self Assessment system is a live operational dataset and, as such, details such as residential address may be updated at any point.  The allocation of geography and industry in these statistics is based on the latest reported information.  As a result, it is possible for an individual claimant’s characteristics to change between the first publication of these statistics on 11 June and subsequent publications.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.3 </span>Ineligible population compared against <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> eligibility criteria</h3>

<p>Analysis of the assessed ineligible population against the eligibility criteria is as a result of additional analysis of the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> data in order to provide a description of this group of individuals. An individual can be outside of the criteria for multiple reasons for both the 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return and the tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, and 2018 to 2019. Additionally, it is possible for the same individual to be ineligible due to different criteria across these 2 stages. For the purposes of the figures presented here, ineligible individuals are recorded against all of the categories that apply to that individual. As a result, individuals can be ineligible in multiple ways and there is a high level of overlap between the categories presented.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span>Strengths and limitations</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.1 </span>Experimental Statistics status</h3>

<p>This release is classed as Experimental Statistics as the methodologies used to produce the statistics are still in their development phase. This does not mean that the statistics are of low quality, but it does signify that the statistics are new and still being developed. As the methodologies are refined and improved, there may be revisions to these statistics.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.2 </span>Differences compared with the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> Management Information</h3>

<p>Management information (<abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr>) on the number and value of <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> claims received has been published by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> at various dates since the scheme was launched on 13th May 2020.</p>

<p>The published <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> report for 18 October 2020 showed 2.3 million claims for the second <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant totalling £5.9 billion. This is the latest <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> report following the scheme closing to claims for the first grant on 13th July.</p>

<p>A new <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> report is being published on the same day as these statistics. This is likely to show a similar number and value of claims.</p>

<p>A significant difference between the figures is that the <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> includes all claims received and their associated value even though some of these are eventually rejected after compliance checks. The statistics in this release exclude claims which have been rejected.</p>

<p>There is also likely to be a smaller difference caused by the timing of claims flowing through the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> system. The <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> measures claims at the ‘front end’ of the system and the statistical publication is based on data made available from the “back end” of the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> system once claims have been checked.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.3 </span>Differences compared to Survey of Personal Incomes</h3>

<p>In the Survey of Personal Incomes individuals are considered as Self-Employed if <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> received or expects to receive Self Assessment forms covering income from self-employment in their 2017 to 2018 Self Assessment tax return.</p>

<p>The population assessed for <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> eligibility includes only those individuals who submitted 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment returns by 23 April 2020 and included data on self-employment in that return.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.4 </span>Differences compared to other sources</h3>

<p>Other organisations such as the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> and Institute for Fiscal Studies (<abbr title="Institute for Fiscal Studies">IFS</abbr>) have published information about <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> either from surveys or estimates derived from previously published data.  We believe these <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> statistics provide a more reliable picture as they are based on administrative data from the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> claim and Self-Assessment systems.</p>
