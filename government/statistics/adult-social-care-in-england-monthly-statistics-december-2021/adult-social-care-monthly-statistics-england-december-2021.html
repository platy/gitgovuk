<h2>Main points</h2>

<h3>COVID-19 and flu vaccination in social care settings</h3>

<p>As of 23 November 2021, the proportions who had received a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>70.8% of total residents and 29.4% of total staff of older adult care homes</li>
  <li>52.5% total residents of younger adult care homes</li>
  <li>24.8% total staff of younger adult care homes and 15.3% total staff of domiciliary care staff</li>
</ul>

<p>As of 23 November 2021, the proportions who had received their flu vaccination for the 2021 to 2022 season were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>70.7% of total residents and 18.9% of total staff of older adult care homes</li>
  <li>54.9% of residents of total younger adult care homes</li>
  <li>16.8% of total staff of younger adult care homes and 9.5% of total domiciliary care staff</li>
</ul>

<h3>Infection control measures in care homes</h3>

<p>In the week ending 23 November 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>93.0% of care homes in England were able to accommodate residents receiving visitors – this has remained broadly consistent since late July 2021</li>
  <li>82.6% of care homes who had staff required to self-isolate paid those staff their full wages while self-isolating – this proportion has remained consistent since mid-December 2020</li>
  <li>70.6% of care homes had no staff members working in another health or social care setting – this proportion has continued to gradually decline from 78.2% at the end of April 2021</li>
</ul>

<h3>COVID-19 testing in care homes</h3>

<p>ln the week ending 23 November 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for both care home staff and residents, there has been an overall decrease in the number of positive tests returned from <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> kits throughout November, in contrast to the increase seen throughout October</li>
  <li>there has continued to be a gradual decline in the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted in care home staff since the end of July. While the number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted in care home staff continues to be lower than July levels, the number has remained relatively stable since October 2021</li>
  <li>the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted in residents has remained at broadly consistent levels since late July but there has been a decrease in the number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests throughout November compared to October</li>
</ul>

<h2>COVID-19 vaccination in adult social care settings</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>How the data can be used</h3>

<p>This data can be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>comparing vaccination rates across local authorities and regions in England as self-reported by care providers for the:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>first, second and booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccine</li>
      <li>flu vaccinations for the 2021 to 2022 season</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>monitoring vaccination rates over time for the:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>first, second and booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccine</li>
      <li>flu vaccinations for the 2021 to 2022 season</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This data cannot be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>estimating the number of social care staff or residents who have not been vaccinated</li>
  <li>estimating the number of social care staff or residents who have been vaccinated abroad</li>
  <li>comparing with vaccination rates in other countries of the UK</li>
  <li>directly comparing vaccination take up rates between different types of care home staff (directly employed and agency staff)</li>
  <li>estimating the number of vaccinations delivered each day</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Data is now available for the proportion of social care staff and residents who have received a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. These rates do not distinguish between those who are eligible for a booster, given the recommended gap between second and booster doses.</p>

<p>The total number of staff and residents for each social care setting as well as the number reported to be vaccinated for COVID-19 and flu are self-reported by the care provider and local authorities. As a result, the rates in this publication refer to the percentage of staff and residents reported to be vaccinated by care providers. This means that the number of individuals who have not received the vaccine cannot be directly derived from data published in these statistics as there is a number of individuals for whom the vaccination status is unknown to the care provider.</p>

<p>The dates in this section refer to the dates vaccinations were reported by care providers as opposed to the date vaccinations were administered.</p>

<p>Some care providers have reported the total number of staff or residents but not the numbers vaccinated. As a result of this, vaccination rates are affected by response rates. This is particularly prominent for vaccination rates for second doses in staff employed in other settings and boosters and flu for all staff and resident groups. This is because these groups have a lower response rate and as a result, second dose vaccination rates may be underestimated.</p>

<p>For data relating to 9 November 2021 and before, response rates may have been underestimated, particularly for boosters and flu vaccination. This is because the default value in the underlying data is set to zero, so any zero values submitted will appear to be non-responses. From 9 November 2021 onwards, care providers are required to select that they have reviewed their responses to confirm the data submitted is accurate, therefore increasing the accuracy of response rates.</p>

<p>Among care home staff, there is a substantial difference in reported vaccination rates for COVID-19 and flu vaccinations between staff directly employed by care homes and staff employed by agencies operating within care homes. This could be due to, for example but not exclusively, different uptake rates, vaccination status not being known to the care provider or the nature of employment and information available to the care homes.</p>

<p>For data relating to 31 August 2021 onwards, a small number of social care staff who had their vaccination outside of the UK are excluded from the numbers vaccinated.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 vaccinations</h3>

<h4>Adult social care groups covered in this publication by <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> priority group for COVID-19 vaccination</h4>

<p>This is a summary of the priority groups for different social care staff and residents.</p>

<p><abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> priority group 1:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>residents in older adult care homes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>staff directly employed by older adult care homes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>agency staff working in older adult care homes</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> priority group 2:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>staff directly employed by younger adult care homes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>agency staff working in younger adult care homes</p>
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>social care staff working in other settings (including non-registered providers and local authority employed)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Not in a specific <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> priority group:</p>

<ul>
  <li>residents of younger adult care homes</li>
</ul>

<p>The NHS started administering vaccinations for COVID-19 in England on 8 December 2020. Social care staff and residents of care homes were prioritised for the vaccine according to the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>) recommendation. For more information see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/priority-groups-for-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccination-advice-from-the-jcvi-30-december-2020" class="govuk-link">Priority groups for coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination: advice from the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>From 11 November 2021, all people working or volunteering in care homes are required to have received 2 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine as a condition of their deployment in a care home, unless exempt. This report contains data relating up to 23 November 2021. The final date for staff to receive their first dose of the vaccination so they were fully vaccinated in time for the regulation to come into force was 16 September 2021, based on the assumption of  an 8-week interval between first and second doses. More details can be found on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vaccination-of-people-working-or-deployed-in-care-homes-operational-guidance">Vaccination of people working or deployed in care homes: operational guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Adult social care staff and residents are now eligible for a COVID-19 booster vaccination after receiving their second dose. More details can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccination-booster-dose-resources/covid-19-vaccination-a-guide-to-booster-vaccination">COVID-19 vaccination: a guide to booster vaccination</a>.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 vaccinations in <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> priority group 1</h3>

<p>96.7% older care homes have provided data on the number of staff and residents who received a COVID-19 booster dose, as of 23 November 2021. This means the first and second dose rates and the number of staff and residents receiving a booster dose may be underestimated compared to the true value. For full response rates please see the accompanying ‘COVID-19 vaccination response rates, December 2021: data tables’.</p>

<p>The figures used in this report differ to the reported 81.7% of eligible residents reported on 5 November 2021 in the news article <a rel="external" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2021/11/nhs-offers-residents-in-every-eligible-care-home-a-covid-booster-jab-2/" class="govuk-link">NHS offers residents in every eligible care home a COVID booster jab,</a> as a different methodology was used.</p>

<p>Going forward we recommend users use the rates in this report and the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-vaccinations/">weekly <abbr title="NHS England and Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> weekly COVID-19 vaccination statistics</a>, which use the total number of residents for consistency purposes. Please note it does not distinguish those who are eligible for a booster dose. Please see the accompanying background quality and methodology document for more details.</p>

<h4>Residents of older care homes</h4>

<p>As of 23 November 2021, in older adult care homes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>96.3% of residents have been reported to have received their first dose</li>
  <li>95.1% of residents have been reported to have received their second dose</li>
  <li>70.8% of residents have been reported to have received their booster dose</li>
</ul>

<p>The reported first dose vaccination rate rapidly increased between January and February 2021 for residents and has since continued to increase but at a much slower pace as more of the population receive the first dose.</p>

<p>For second doses the reported rate increased steeply between April and June 2021 and has continued to increase but at a slower rate since then.</p>

<p>There is little regional variation in the reported second dose vaccination rate among residents in older adult care homes. London continues to show the lowest uptake, with 93.1% of residents reported to have received both doses.</p>

<p>There is large variation in booster doses administered regionally, with the North East region having the largest uptake with 75.0% of residents vaccinated, compared to the lowest uptake in the East Midlands with 63.5%.</p>

<h4>Staff of older adult care homes</h4>

<p>As of 23 November 2021, in older adult care homes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>95.7% of staff have been reported to have received their first dose</li>
  <li>93.8% of staff have been reported to have received their second dose</li>
  <li>29.4% of staff have been reported to have received their booster dose</li>
</ul>

<p>The reported first dose vaccination rate rapidly increased between January and February 2021 for staff and has continued to increase each week.</p>

<p>Similarly, for second doses the reported rate increased steeply between April and June 2021 and has continued to steadily increase since July 2021.</p>

<p>There is little variation between regions among staff of older adult care homes who have been reported to have received their second dose.Out of all regions, London has shown the quickest increase in second dose vaccination since the end of August 2021, increasing from 78.2% to 94.9% in the week ending 23 November 2021. The West Midlands currently has the highest second dose take up rate, reporting 95.1% as of 23 November 2021.</p>

<p>For booster doses, there is large regional variation, with the North East region having the highest uptake with 34.5%, and London having the lowest at 20.7%.</p>

  <li>based on date of reporting rather than date of vaccination</li>
</ul>

<h3>COVID-19 vaccinations in <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> priority group 2</h3>

<p>Data for staff working in other settings (including non-registered providers and local authority employed) is not available for dates after 17 August 2021 for national, South East region, and Surrey local authority. This is due to a data quality issue that is being investigated. As a result, data in this report refers to the week ending 17 August 2021 rather than 23 November 2021.</p>

<p>The following proportions of social care staff in JVCI priority group 2 have been reported to have received their COVID-19 vaccination doses:</p>

<p>In younger adult care homes as of 23 November 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>94.5% of staff have been reported to have received their first dose</li>
  <li>91.8% of staff have been reported to have received their second dose</li>
  <li>24.8% of staff have been reported to have received their booster dose</li>
</ul>

<p>For domiciliary care staff as of 23 November 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>84.6% of staff have been reported to have received their first dose</li>
  <li>76.8% of staff have been reported to have received their second dose</li>
  <li>15.3% of staff have been reported to have received their booster dose</li>
</ul>

<p>Among staff working in other settings as of 17 August 2021:</p>

<h3>COVID-19 vaccinations for residents of younger adult care homes</h3>

<p>Residents of younger adult care homes are not part of a single priority group for the COVID-19 vaccine. However, the conditions for which they reside in care homes are likely to make them more vulnerable to COVID-19 and they are therefore likely to be part of priority groups 3 to 9.</p>

<p>As of 23 November 2021, in younger adult care homes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>93.7% of residents have reported to have received their first dose</li>
  <li>91.3% of residents have reported to have received their second dose</li>
  <li>52.5% of residents have reported to have received their booster dose</li>
</ul>

<h3>Flu vaccination in adult social care settings</h3>

<p>The national influenza (flu) immunisation programme aims to provide direct protection to those who are at higher risk of influenza associated morbidity and mortality. Groups eligible for NHS influenza vaccination are based on the advice of the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>. More details can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-flu-immunisation-programme-plan/national-flu-immunisation-programme-2021-to-2022-letter" class="govuk-link">National flu immunisation programme 2021 to 2022 letter</a>.</p>

<p>This report covers cumulative flu vaccination rates for the 2021 to 2022 season in the below adult social care groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>residents in older adult care homes</li>
  <li>staff directly employed by older adult care homes</li>
  <li>agency staff working in older adult care homes</li>
  <li>staff directly employed by younger adult care homes</li>
  <li>agency staff working in younger adult care homes</li>
  <li>domiciliary care staff registered to independent <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> providers</li>
  <li>social care staff working in other settings (including non-registered providers and local authority employed)</li>
  <li>residents of younger adult care homes</li>
</ul>

<p>Guidance on flu vaccination for social care workers was updated on 9 September 2021. For more information, please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-in-england-statistics-england-methodology/adult-social-care-monthly-statistics-england-methodology">background quality and methodology note</a>.</p>

<p>Data is self-reported by care providers and local authorities, who may submit their resident and staff numbers but not the number receiving the flu vaccination, resulting in a lower reported percentage vaccinated. An overview of response rates for the numbers vaccinated is in the table below.</p>

<p>For full response rates please see the accompanying ‘COVID-19 vaccination response rates, November 2021: data tables’.</p>

<h3>Older adult care homes</h3>

<p>As of 23 November 2021, the proportions of those who have received a flu vaccination in older adult care homes were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>70.7% of residents</li>
  <li>18.9% of all staff</li>
</ul>

<h3>Younger adult care homes</h3>

<p>As of 23 November 2021, the proportions of those who have received a flu vaccination in younger adult care homes were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>54.9% of residents</li>
  <li>16.8% of all staff</li>
</ul>

<h3>Domiciliary care staff and staff working in other settings</h3>

<p>As of 23 November 2021, the proportions of staff who work in domiciliary care and other settings who have received a flu vaccination were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>9.5% of domiciliary care staff</li>
  <li>0.8% of staff working in other settings</li>
</ul>

<h4>Figure 4: percentage of social care staff and residents who have received the flu vaccination, cumulative rate, 23 November 2021, England</h4>

<p>The reported flu vaccination rates are highest among older adult care home residents.</p>

This report covers care homes that are accommodating visitation in line with this guidance. This could cover visitation in the care homes premises, either indoors or outdoors, or also visits off premises, either for the day or overnight.</p>

<p>In the week ending 23 November 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>93.0% of care homes in England were able to accommodate residents receiving visitors within care homes in all circumstances. This proportion has remained broadly consistent since late July 2021</li>
  <li>a further 3.5% were able to accommodate visits in exceptional circumstances. Exceptional circumstances are individually defined by each care home but are generally thought to be considered when residents are palliative</li>
  <li>there is regional variation with 94.6% of care homes accommodating visitors in the South East in comparison to 89.7% in the South West</li>
</ul>

<h3>Payment of care home directly employed staff while self-isolating due to COVID-19</h3>

<p>The infection control funds can be used to ensure staff who are self-isolating along with government guidance are paid their full wages. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>staff isolating while waiting for a test</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>isolating after having tested positive or after a positive test in their household</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>staff required to quarantine prior to receiving certain NHS procedures</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For more information see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">stay at home: guidance for households with possible or confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) infection</a>.</p>

<p>Employers who do not pay their staff their full wages while self-isolating must pay their staff at least Statutory Sick Pay (<abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr>) when the employee meets the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/employment-status/employee" class="govuk-link">classed as an employee</a> and has done some work for their employer</li>
  <li>earns an average of at least £120 per week</li>
  <li>has been ill or is self-isolating for at least 4 days in a row (including non-working days)</li>
</ul>

<p>Care home staff who do not meet the criteria may not be eligible and as a result not paid to self-isolate. For more information, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay">guidance on Statutory Sick Pay</a>.</p>

<p>The figures in this report refer to care homes which had staff required to self-isolate in the relevant week. This means care homes who had no staff needing to self-isolate will be excluded from the rates for the relevant week. There may be several care providers who may use a combination of payment options for staff wages. In these situations, providers should report the option they use for the majority of their staff.</p>

<p>In the week ending 23 November 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>82.6% of care homes who had directly employed staff needing to self-isolate paid staff their full wages. This proportion has remained consistent since mid-December</li>
  <li>there is substantial regional variation with 87.9% of providers in the North West paying their staff full wages compared to 76.4% in the East Midlands</li>
</ul>

<h4>Figure 6: percentage of care homes with staff self-isolating by wages paid, week ending 23 November  2021, England</h4>

<p>More than 8 in 10 care homes were reporting to pay their staff full wages when self-isolating.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/137541/Figure_6_December_2021.png"></div></figure>

<p>This data can be found in table 2 of the accompanying ‘Infection control,  <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and staffing level statistics’ tables in addition to data by region and local authority.</p>

<h3>Limiting staff movement between care settings</h3>

<p>Infection control funding can be used to reduce the need for staff movement between social care settings to limit the spread of infection, for example they can be used to recruit additional staff to enable staff to only work across one care home.</p>

<p>In the week ending 23 November 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>70.6% of care homes had no staff members working in another social care setting, this proportion has been steadily declining since late April 2021 when this proportion was 78.2%</li>
  <li>7.5% of care homes had some staff additionally working in another health or social care setting</li>
  <li>a further 22.0% of care homes had some staff additionally working in another health or social care setting due to exceptional circumstances. This number has been increasing steadily since mid-May. Exceptional circumstances are defined as the care home having exhausted all other reasonable steps to ensure there are sufficient staffing levels</li>
  <li>there is substantial regional variation with 80.8% of providers in the North East having no staff working in another health or social care setting in the week ending 23 November 2021, in comparison to 65.9% in both the South East and South West</li>
</ul>

<h4>Figure 7: percentage of care homes by staff working across additional health or social care settings, week ending 23 November 2021, England</h4>

<p>Seven in 10 care homes reported having no staff working across another health or social care setting.</p>

<h2>Care home staffing levels</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>How the data can be used</h3>

<p>This data can be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>estimating the number and proportion of care homes that indicate they are operating within their agreed staffing ratios</li>
  <li>monitoring trends over time</li>
  <li>comparisons across local authorities and regions in England</li>
</ul>

<p>This data cannot be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifying the reasons for care home staff shortages and absences</li>
  <li>linking staff shortages and the number of positive cases among care home staff</li>
  <li>comparing with other countries of the UK</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>In order to measure the workforce pressures on providers during the pandemic, each provider is asked to assess their workforce pressures based on their agreed staffing ratios More details on how staffing ratios are agreed can be found within the <a rel="external" href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/guidance-providers/regulations-enforcement/regulation-18-staffing#guidance" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> guidance on staffing</a>.</p>

<p>In the week ending 23 November 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>0.4% of providers flagged that their agreed staffing ratios had been breached</li>
  <li>4.6% flagged that they were operating within the agreed staffing ratios but there is a significant risk of escalation in the coming days</li>
  <li>95.0% were operating within their agreed staffing ratios. This has remained broadly consistent since mid-December 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>If a care home’s staffing ratio has been breached, then business continuity measures may be put in place.</p>

<h4>Figure 8: percentage of care homes operating within agreed staffing ratios, week ending 23 November 2021, England</h4>

<p>More than 9 in 10 care homes report operating within their agreed staffing ratios.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p>All care homes and domiciliary care providers are responsible for ensuring safe systems of work and have duties concerning the provision and use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in the workplace.</p>

<p>This publication covers the availability of the following 5 items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<h3>In care homes</h3>

<p>Guidance on what <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be used in various circumstances is available from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes/personal-protective-equipment-ppe-resource-for-care-workers-working-in-care-homes-during-sustained-covid-19-transmission-in-england">personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>): resource for care workers working in care homes during sustained COVID-19 transmission in England</a>. Despite most legal restrictions being lifted on 19 July 2021, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and other infection prevention and control measures are expected to continue to be practised in care homes.</p>

<p>In the week ending 23 November 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>0.3% of care homes in England had either no supply or were expecting to experience a shortage in the next 48 hours of at least one item of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>this gradually decreased from late September 2020 when 1.1% of care homes were experiencing a shortage and has remained relatively unchanged since March 2021</li>
</ul>

<h3>In domiciliary care</h3>

<p>Data on <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> availability in domiciliary care has not been updated for the London region for dates after 29 June 2021 due to a data quality issue which is being investigated. National figures for England are also not presented due to the effects of this issue on the national rate. Data for other regions and local authorities outside of London are available in the accompanying data tables.</p>

<h2>COVID-19 testing in adult care homes</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>How the data can be used</h3>

<p>This data can be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>estimating the number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests taken and positive results returned in care homes, and comparing across local authorities and regions in England</li>
  <li>estimating trends in prevalence and positivity rates for COVID-19 in care homes based on trends in positive tests</li>
</ul>

<p>This data cannot be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>calculating positivity rates for COVID-19 in care homes due to routine and repeat testing of individuals</li>
  <li>linking positivity rates in care homes to lower vaccination rates in care homes</li>
  <li>estimating the number of people tested and positive cases in care homes as people can take more than one test</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>For more information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the rollout of the testing programme in care homes, please see ‘About this data’ section below.</li>
  <li>testing kits used, please see the ‘Terminology’ section below</li>
</ul>

<p>Given that anyone who tests positive with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test is exempt from regular testing for 90 days, the number of tests conducted with both <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> kits can fluctuate slightly in relation to COVID-19 prevalence.</p>

<h3>Number of tests conducted and positive tests returned in adult care homes</h3>

<p>The number of positive tests returned in care home staff and residents decreased in November compared to October where an upward trend was seen throughout the month.</p>

<p>Previously the number of positive tests had been increasing between mid-September 2021 and mid-October 2021. The trend in positive tests has fluctuated since late July 2021 for staff and late August 2021 for residents. Prior to that positive tests had been increasing from mid-June 2021 to July 2021 but the number of positive tests remained substantially lower than levels seen in January 2021.</p>

<p>Throughout October, the number of tests conducted has slightly decreased for care home staff compared to levels seen in September but have remained broadly consistent in care home residents.</p>

<h3>Care home staff</h3>

<h4>
<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests</h4>

<p>In the week ending 23 November 2021 there were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2,061 positive tests returned from <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> kits in care home staff</li>
  <li>19% fewer positive tests compared to the week ending 26 October 2021 and 42% fewer compared to the week ending 20 July 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>The number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted in care home staff has broadly decreased between the end of July and the end of November.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests</h4>

<p>In the week ending 23 November 2021 there were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>818 positive tests returned from <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> kits in care home staff</li>
  <li>12% fewer positive tests compared to the week ending 26 October 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>There has also been a gradual decline in the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted in care home staff since late July.</p>

<h3>Care home residents</h3>

<p>The testing regime for staff is more frequent than for residents. As a result, the total number of staff tests is higher than the total number of resident tests. For more information please see the ‘About this data’ section below.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests</h4>

<p>In the week ending 23 November 2021 there were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>515 positive tests returned from <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> kits in care home residents</li>
  <li>44% fewer positive tests compared to the week ending 26 October 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>The number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted among care home residents has been broadly consistent between August 2021 and the end of November 2021. Previously the number of tests had gradually increased between mid-May and the beginning of August.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests</h4>

<p>In the week ending 23 November 2021 there were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>46 positive tests returned from <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> kits in care home residents</li>
  <li>the number of positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests has decreased throughout November with 73% fewer the number of positive tests in the week ending 23 November compared to the week ending 26 October 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>There has been a decline in the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted in the week ending 23 November 2021 compared to the end of October 2021.</p>

<h4>Figure 9: number of tests conducted in care home staff and residents, 15 December 2020 to 23 November 2021, England</h4>

<p>The number of tests conducted in care home staff has declined compared to late July.</p>

<p>This data can be found in tables 1 and 2 of the accompanying ‘COVID-19 testing’ tables in addition to data by region and local authority.</p>

<p>Staff and residents have different testing regimes as outlined in the ‘About this data’ section below. As a result, the number of positive test results returned are expected to be of a different scale between staff and residents.</p>

<h4>Visitors</h4>

<p>The number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted among visitors to care homes has been broadly consistent since the end of June with 94,810 tests conducted in the week ending 23 November.</p>

<p>Following the change in guidance for residents receiving visitors in early March, <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted among visitors to residents of care homes increased substantially throughout the month, then continued to gradually increase until the end of June 2021.</p>

<p>Additionally, there were 8,050 <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted among visiting professionals to care homes in the week ending 23 November 2021. This declined steadily since mid-June up until the end of August but has since remained fairly stable with an average of around 8,160 tests per week from beginning of September to the end of November 2021.</p>

<p>In the week ending 23 November 2021 there were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>50 positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests returned in care home visitors and 74 <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> positive results</li>
  <li>6 positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests returned among visiting professionals to care homes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Terminology</h2>

<p>Care home: facilities providing residential care. The data in this bulletin refers to Care Quality Commission (<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>) registered care homes.</p>

<p>Older adult care homes: care homes serving any older people (aged 65 and over) as identified from the latest <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> data on care homes in the ‘older people service’ user band. A small number of residents within care homes serving older people may be aged under 65.</p>

<p>Younger adult care homes: care homes not serving any older people (aged 65 and over) as identified from the latest <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> data on care homes in the ‘older people service’ user band.</p>

<p>Domiciliary care: services providing personal care for people living in their own homes. The data in this bulletin refers to domiciliary staff employed by independent <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> registered providers.</p>

<p>Staff: unless specified, staff can refer to staff directly employed by a provider and/or through an agency.</p>

<p>Staff employed by other settings: this includes non-registered providers and local authority employed: all other eligible frontline social care staff working in close and personal contact with people clinically vulnerable to COVID-19 (as defined by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>) priority groups) who need care and support irrespective of where they work or who they are employed by, for example, local government, NHS, private sector or third sector.</p>

<p>Agreed staffing ratios: the agreed number of residents for any given member of staff. This is determined by individual providers to ensure there is safe levels of staffing for care to be delivered. This can be subject to inspection by the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/guidance-providers/regulations-enforcement/regulation-18-staffing#guidance" rel="external">Regulation of staffing</a> for more information.</p>

<p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> (polymerase chain reaction) tests: <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests check for the genetic material of the coronavirus in the sample, which is taken using a swab and is processed in a lab via a polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>). These are predominantly used in care homes for people who experience symptoms, and for routine asymptomatic testing for staff and residents.</p>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> (lateral flow device): often referred to as ‘rapid tests’, these test for the presence of proteins called ‘antigens’ which are produced by the virus. They are swab tests that give results in 30 minutes or less, without the need for processing in a laboratory. These tests are primarily used in care homes for routine asymptomatic testing for staff, residents and visitors.</p>

<p><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> (personal protective equipment): equipment worn by staff, visitors or essential care-givers in care homes to reduce transmission of COVID-19. This publication refers to supplies of aprons, eye protection, gloves, hand sanitiser and face masks in care homes.</p>

<h2>About this data</h2>

<p>These statistics are being published as a part of a wider landscape of statistics on adult social care. The Government Statistical Service (GSS) compiles a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/dashboard/tools/adult-social-care-statistics/database.html" rel="external">UK adult social care database</a> of official statistics on adult social care across the 4 nations of the UK. This is updated on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>The UK Statistics Authority (UKSA) conducted a review of <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/report-on-adult-social-care-statistics-in-england/">adult social care statistics in England</a> which called for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>better leadership and collaboration across different organisations publishing official statistics. This publication has been produced in collaboration with other statistics providers of COVID-19 adult social care data and <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will endeavour to work with various stakeholders as more data is published through this publication</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>addressing of gaps in available data, particularly in privately funded care. This bulletin aims to plug some of that gap by including data on residents privately funding their care in addition to those funded by local authorities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>improving existing official statistics. These statistics are being badged as experimental statistics and more data will be added iteratively based on user needs</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Other sources of adult social care COVID-19 data</h3>

<h4>COVID-19 vaccinations</h4>

<p>NHS England and Improvement (<abbr title="NHS England and Improvement">NHSEI</abbr>) also publish data on vaccinations in adult social care settings as part of their broader <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-vaccinations/">statistical release on COVID-19 vaccination</a>, using the same methodology and the same data source as this publication but there are differences in the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>reporting period; data in this publication reports data collected up to 11:59pm on a Tuesday whereas <abbr title="NHS England and Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> use data collected up to 11:59pm on a Sunday</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a small amount of data may be collected after the respective reporting periods</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>regional breakdowns; data in this publication uses the administrative regions of England and <abbr title="NHS England and Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> use NHS regions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>COVID-19 testing</h4>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> also publishes care home testing data in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-weekly-reports" class="govuk-link">weekly NHS Test and Trace statistics (England)</a> at national level. This publication uses the same data source but has a different methodology for presenting testing in care homes and differences in the figures will occur due to the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>differences in which tests from different routes are included. Both methodologies include the number of tests registered from kits sent directly to care homes, but this publication additionally includes care home staff or residents tested via other routes such as regional or local test sites. As a result, figures in this report will be substantially higher for <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted in care home staff due to the current guidance recommending staff with symptoms to be tested outside of the care home (see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-in-adult-care-homes" class="govuk-link">coronavirus (COVID-19) testing in adult care homes</a> for more information)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>different reporting periods. This publication uses the start time of the test in comparison to the Test and Trace statistics which use the date on which the test result was received by the individual taking the test</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>different times of extracting the data</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Data sources</h3>

<h4>COVID-19 vaccination, infection prevention control (<abbr title="infection prevention control">IPC</abbr>), <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> availability and staffing levels</h4>

<p>Data in this publication is taken from self-reported data submitted by care providers in England through a data collection and insight tool called <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.necsu.nhs.uk/capacity-tracker/" rel="external">Capacity Tracker</a>.</p>

<p>Care providers are expected to submit data on <abbr title="infection prevention control">IPC</abbr> compliance on a weekly basis whilst data on vaccinations, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> availability and staffing levels is expected to be updated on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Infection control data for each reporting week refers to data up to 2pm on the date stated as the ‘week ending’ and the 7 days prior. For <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and staffing-levels data relates up to 11:59pm on the date stated as the ‘week ending’. The reporting week usually ends on a Tuesday but occasionally no data is available for this date, in these situations the ‘week ending’ date will be the nearest available date.</p>

<p>This bulletin presents the proportion of staff and residents vaccinated out of the total number of staff and residents as self-reported by care providers. Only individuals who have not tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 28 days are eligible to receive the vaccine. Data on the number of staff and residents of older adult care homes eligible for the vaccination over time can be found in the accompanying COVID-19 vaccination tables.</p>

<h3>Data coverage and quality</h3>

<p>All data in this publication refers to adult social care settings in England only.</p>

<p>Data submitted by providers reflects the current priorities to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic in social care settings. Data collection could be subject to change based on changes to the priorities and therefore the reporting in this publication will be adapted accordingly.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="infection prevention control">IPC</abbr>, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> availability and staffing levels</h4>

<p>Providers are expected to submit data on <abbr title="infection prevention control">IPC</abbr> measures on a weekly basis while staffing levels and <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> availability data are expected to be submitted on a daily basis. Any providers who have not submitted data within the last 7 days are excluded from the relevant analysis for the associated time period where no response was received. The full response rates for all data points are available in the accompanying tables.</p>

<h4>COVID-19 vaccinations</h4>

<p>Data on total number of staff and residents as well as those vaccinated is self-reported by care providers and local authorities. Providers are expected to update their vaccination data on a daily basis. There may be a time lag between individuals receiving the vaccine and the week they are reported in the statistics depending on when providers have updated their vaccination data.</p>

<h4>COVID-19 testing</h4>

<p>This report includes the number of tests conducted on care homes residents, staff and visitors who were tested by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> kits sent directly to the care home for regular testing, which were registered through the National Testing Programme digital infrastructure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> kits conducted at another testing site such as a regional or local test site or a mobile testing unit or tests that were registered</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The figures in this report are only deduplicated to report on the number of individual tests taken, not the number of people tested. Because people can have more than one test, the data should not be compared with prevalence rates or case positivity rates.</p>

<p>This report does not contain data on those tested through pillar 1.</p>

<p>Data for each reporting period relates to the day an individual took their test.</p>

<p>The rollout of the testing program in care homes is summarised in the table 6 below.</p>

<p>*Close contact visits with <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing began on 2 December 2020 but ceased on 6 January 2021 because of the national lockdown. Throughout the period of national restrictions, visits were limited to outdoors, in visiting pods, or with a substantial screen; as well as those in exceptional circumstances such as end of life.</p>

<p>The figures in this report are only deduplicated to report on the number of individual tests taken, not the number of people tested. Because people can have more than one test, the data should not be compared with prevalence rates or case positivity rates.</p>
