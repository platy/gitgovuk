<p>For each day, the Department for Transport produces statistics on the following, published every Wednesday at 9.30am:</p>

<ol>
  <li>road traffic in Great Britain</li>
  <li>rail passenger journeys in Great Britain</li>
  <li>Transport for London (TfL) tube and bus routes</li>
  <li>bus travel in Great Britain (excluding London)</li>
  <li>cycling in England</li>
</ol>

<p>The data is as near to real time as possible. This document sets out information on the data sources and methodology used to generate each of these headline measures. For the latest data included in the coronavirus press conferences, please see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/slides-and-datasets-to-accompany-coronavirus-press-conferences" class="govuk-link">accompany slides and datasets</a>.</p>

<p>These statistics have been produced quickly in response to developing world events. The Office for Statistics Regulation, on behalf of the UK Statistics Authority, has reviewed them against several key aspects of the <a href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/code-of-practice/the-code/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Code of Practice for Statistics</a> and regards them as consistent with the Code’s pillars of Trustworthiness, Quality and Value.</p>

<p>The release include statistics on domestic transport. For international travel, please see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>statistics on the number of flights to and from the UK, as well as other countries, are published by <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/Economics/DailyTrafficVariation-States.html">Eurocontrol</a> on a daily basis. This data is inclusive of all types of flight traffic under IFR flight rules.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>UK airports data is also collected by the Civil Aviation Authority and published monthly on their <a href="https://www.caa.co.uk/Data-and-analysis/UK-aviation-market/Airports/Datasets/UK-airport-data/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">website</a>. This data largely relates to commercial flight operations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>statistics on ship arrivals for a selection of ports are published by the Office for National Statistics in their <a rel="external" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/datasets/weeklyshippingindicators" class="govuk-link">weekly shipping indicators</a> based on Automated Identification System (AIS) data.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Reminder on days of the week differences</h3>
<p>Although daily data is being reported, direct comparisons of change should not be made between weekdays and weekends/bank holidays. For public transport there are typically different levels of service/timetable in place on weekends and bank holidays than on weekdays; and for road traffic, there is a different profile on weekend days compared to weekdays.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Road traffic</h2>

<h3>Coverage</h3>
<p>The National Road traffic estimates include change in traffic on all road types in Great Britain at GB level. These estimates are provided split into selected vehicle types (cars, light commercial vehicles, heavy goods vehicles) and a total for all motor vehicles.</p>

<table>

    <tr>
      <th scope="col">All motor vehicles</th>
      <th scope="col">All vehicles except pedal cycles</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Cars and taxis</td>
      <td>Includes passenger vehicles with nine or fewer seats, three-wheeled cars and four-wheel-drive ‘sports utility vehicles’ (SUVs). Cars towing caravans or trailers are counted as one vehicle.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Light commercial vehicles (LCV) (also: light goods vehicles)</td>
      <td>Goods vehicles not exceeding 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight. Includes all car-based vans and those of the next largest carrying capacity such as transit vans. Also included are ambulances, pickups and milk floats.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Heavy goods vehicles (HGV)</td>
      <td>Includes all rigid and articulated goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Data source</h3>
<p>The analysis is based on around 275 automatic traffic count sites across Great Britain. These sites are used for DfT’s Quarterly Road Traffic National Statistics series to estimate traffic change and as such the samples of automatic traffic counters are stratified by area, road classification, and road management and have been designed to be representative of national traffic.</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>The daily road traffic estimates are suitable as an indication of traffic change rather than actual traffic volumes. The data provided is indexed to the first week of February and the comparison is to the same day of the week, i.e., 100 would mean that traffic is the same as the equivalent day in the first week of February. Over the course of the year, normal traffic can vary by +/– 20%.</p>

<h3>Quality</h3>
<p>In order to achieve a daily estimate of traffic change, lower levels of validation have been applied compared to normal statistical outputs. However, the data series is being verified against other sources and similar trends have been seen.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Rail passenger journeys</h2>

<h3>Coverage</h3>
<p>Passenger journeys across the rail network of Great Britain.</p>

<h3>Data source</h3>
<p>Information on journeys comes from the Latest Earnings Networked Nationally Overnight (LENNON) data source. LENNON is the revenue settlement service for the train operating companies for GB passenger rail ticket sales and is the main source of data for GB rail fares revenue. The system processes information from the majority of GB train ticket sales, it then allocates daily revenue to each of the train operators within 24 hours of the ticket being purchased.</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>Data labelled ‘National Rail’ is calculated by summing the number of journeys for the week-to-date for 2020 and expressing this as a percentage of the equivalent week in 2019.</p>

<p>The number of journeys is calculated from LENNON by taking the number of ticket sales on that day and uplifting each sale by the number of likely journeys that would be taken with that ticket. For example, the purchase of an annual season ticket would be counted as 480 journeys, and an advance return would be counted as two journeys.</p>

<p>Journeys reported for the most recent week in 2020 are adjusted to account for a data delay in LENNON (see the ‘Quality’ section). For example, on 21 August, reported journeys in the week to 20 August were 26% of the equivalent week in 2019. A week later, the number of journeys in the week to 20 August had been revised to 34% of the equivalent week in 2019 (+8 percentage points) as the journeys data had become more complete.</p>

<p>Each week the DfT reviews data for a selection of dates where the LENNON journeys data should be about 95% complete. A comparison is made of the week-to-date journeys as a percentage of the equivalent week in 2019, as reported the next day, against the figures reported 7 days later. During August, this upward adjustment has ranged between 6 to 8 percentage points.</p>

<p>Data for the most recent week will remain provisional. The adjustments should bring the latest week’s data closer to the final figure about a week later, so any further revisions to reflect the complete data set should be smaller.</p>

<h3>Quality</h3>
<p>Whilst fit for purpose for monitoring overall change in usage trends, there are a number of quality issues with the LENNON journey data when using it for this purpose that should be borne in mind. These are mitigated to some extent by reporting the 2020 data as a percentage of 2019 rather than reporting journey numbers themselves:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data delay: The latest daily data covers ticket sales received up to the previous day, and generally includes 75–90% of the eventual sales receipts that will be included for that day. Whilst the most recent week of data is adjusted in the published series based on an assessment of recent levels of missing data, updates may subsequently be made to previous days’ data from the start of each month. After 7 days the data is about 95% complete for a given date. Therefore, we recommend looking at trends rather than interpreting the exact figures.</li>
  <li>Journeys using annual season tickets are allocated an uplift of around 480 journeys (the estimated use over the course of the ticket’s validity, i.e. 240 return journeys) while a weekly ticket’s weighting is 10 journeys (5 return journeys). This could be an over or underestimate of usage, especially in the current climate</li>
  <li>Journeys in LENNON are estimated based on the date of ticket sale, rather than the date of intended travel. This includes journeys made with season tickets, which would all be recorded as being made on the date of the ticket purchase. There is therefore a risk of overestimating the number of journeys for season tickets and advanced tickets on a given day (and conversely underestimating them at other times)</li>
  <li>LENNON does not cover some Passenger Transport Executives, local government bodies responsible for public transport in their areas</li>
  <li>LENNON daily passenger journey estimates and ticket sales are sensitive to occasional lump sum adjustments. For example, TfL issue zonal season tickets which allow travel on National Rail. Earnings from these journeys are passed between TfL and train operating companies via LENNON. When these earnings are reported and dropped into LENNON, this could look like a considerable change in journeys or sales on a given day. Again, this supports looking at rolling weekly totals and comparing to the equivalent week in 2019</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Transport for London (TfL) tube and bus routes</h2>

<h3>Coverage</h3>
<p>Transport for London bus and tube usage, including the number of tube entries during the peak 15-minute period for the previous day.</p>

<h3>Data source</h3>
<p>Operational data from Transport for London. TfL tube reductions compared to the equivalent day last year. Bus journey data is based off tap ins on the bus – there is a gap in the data series during the period where tap in was not being done.</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>Usage is measured by entry/exit data from tube stations and bus boarding taps. This is then compared to equivalent data from 1 year ago and to other trends to gauge the extent to which travel has been reduced. Where a bank holiday occurs, this year or last year, then the comparison is to the nearest similar day (so a bank holiday is not compared to a non bank holiday)</p>

<h3>Quality</h3>
<p>This is operational data, based on contactless card use, considered fit for purpose for reporting changes in trends in usage. Tube and bus data is deemed to be of high quality. Due to middle door bus boarding policy earlier in the pandemic, there is a period for which we did not receive the same high quality data.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Bus travel in Great Britain (excluding London)</h2>

<h3>Coverage</h3>
<p>Passenger boardings around half of bus services in Great Britain outside London.</p>

<h3>Data source</h3>
<p>This data has been provided by Ticketer, based on operators which were using Ticketer in the January reference week (3rd week of January). Data from other sources (including non-Ticketer operators) has been used to validate these figures and is generally consistent with the trends presented.</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>A figure of 100 means the same level as that seen on the same day in the third week of January. A figure higher than 100 shows an increase. A figure less than 100 shows a decrease.</p>

<p>Passenger boardings will include physical ticket sales, where money changes hands, as well as smart cards (commercial or concessionary), QR tickets, and where the driver counts passengers (such as school runs).</p>

<p>As a measure of comparability to “business as usual”, data for Easter and other bank holidays has been adjusted to compare against typical usage for those dates. This is because it is known that operators offer a different service level for those dates when compared with the typical service levels for those days of the week. Data has been omitted for the bank holiday on Friday 8th May as a suitable comparative adjustment could not be identified.</p>

<h3>Quality</h3>
<p>This is operational data considered fit for purpose for reporting changes in trends in usage. It is not necessarily equivalent to existing National Statistics on buses. Its precise comparability will only be truly known once National Statistics for the period have also been collected and validated. Figures below national level are more volatile as the proportion of services run by operators using Ticketer is variable at regional level and so should be treated with caution.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Cycling</h2>

<h3>Coverage</h3>

<p>Estimated change in cycling usage in England</p>

<h3>Data source</h3>

<p>This is an estimated percentage change in cycling derived from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>telecommunications data – anonymised and aggregated data from O2, as a measure of total trip numbers</li>
  <li>National Travel Survey (NTS) results, as a pre-COVID-19 baseline modal split</li>
  <li>DfT Roads automatic traffic count (ATC) index data, as an indication of changes to road users</li>
  <li>LENNON rail data, as an indication of changes to rail users</li>
  <li>sources of cycling use data including automatic cycling counters and camera-based estimates</li>
</ul>

<h3>Methodology</h3>

<p>Overall active travel (cycling and walking combined) is estimated as a proportion of total trips seen in telecommunications data. In this, a trip indicates when an individual moves from one cell tower to another and is then stationary for at least 30 minutes. Short trips of less than 1km in urban areas and 5km in rural areas will be excluded. This disproportionately affects walking trips, as a greater proportion of walking trips will be missed compared to other modes.</p>

<p>Using the 2018 National Travel Survey (NTS) results, we estimated the breakdown in total trips by mode (road, rail and active) for a pre-COVID-19 baseline and added road freight (which is not included in the NTS). We applied this baseline split to the total trips in the telecommunications data for the first week of March. By calculating percentage changes in road and rail users relative to the same week, we have then been able to adjust this number of trips by mode over time.</p>

<p>We then have the total trips for each day (from telecommunications data) and the total trips for road and rail users (calculated). The difference between these two gives an estimate of the number of active travel trips.</p>

<p>Using the active travel estimate, we then apply the same NTS baseline for cycling to the total trips. We then follow the same process as above by calculating percentage changes in observed cycle counts from ATC data relative to the same week, which allows us to adjust this number of trips over time. As per the quality note below, we sense check this result against other sources such as estimates from certain camera sites across the country which estimate cycle usage. Walking is therefore a residual of a residual, and as we know that the telecommunications data does not capture short walks, we do not think the walking estimate in isolation is a useful indicator.</p>

<h3>Quality</h3>

<p>This is a best-efforts estimate of national cycling utilising multiple data sources and is considered fit for purpose for reporting large changes in trends in usage. The methodology will be updated if or when additional information becomes available.</p>

<p>Analysis applies to England only due to the available geographies in the individual data sets.
Daily data is volatile based on both the relationship cycling has with the weather, but also volatility in the underlying data sources and methodology. Some of the increases noted will also reflect the seasonal pattern of cycling as comparisons are to a base week in March 2020.</p>

<p>As we consider further sources, we may update the methodology and therefore revise the results.</p>

<p>As of September, the timeliness of the source data has moved to a lag of 3 days rather than 1 reflecting the collection and processing of the mobile telecoms data.</p>
