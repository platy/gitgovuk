<p>These statistics show the latest number of personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) items which have been distributed by the government, for use by health and social care services in England.</p>

<p>In publishing this data, we aim to provide a regular summary for ministers, policy makers, external stakeholders and the public on <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items distributed. The Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) intends to release these statistics regularly while they remain relevant to the government’s response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>

<p>Future updates will be issued monthly on the second Tuesday of each month.</p>

<h2>Main points</h2>

<p>From 25 February 2020 to 30 November 2021, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has distributed over 16.5 billion items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, predominantly for use by health and social care services in England.</p>

<p>In the first full year of operations (from 25 February 2020 to 24 February 2021), over 8.7 billion items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> were distributed predominantly for use by health and social care services in England.</p>

<p>This compares with approximately 2.43 billion items distributed between 1 January and 31 December 2019 to all NHS trusts and some social care organisations. This figure is a partial snapshot of the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> used in the system before the COVID-19 pandemic. The NHS Supply Chain has since been expanded to 58,000 different settings, including care homes, hospices and community care organisations, many of which use the e-Portal to order <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<p>In the latest month between 1 November to 30 November 2021, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> distributed over 722 million <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items for use by health and social care services in England. These are distributed through the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> Dedicated Supply Channel, NHS Supply Chain and other routes (see Table 1 for more details).</p>

<p><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> was first ordered through the e-Portal on 9 April 2020. From 9 April 2020 to 30 November 2021, over 5.4 billion <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items have been ordered through the e-Portal.</p>

<p>In the latest month between 1 November to 30 November 2021, over 353 million <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items have been ordered through the e-Portal.</p>

<p>Organisations may procure additional <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> independently of the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> programme. Any additional <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is not included in this data.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> distribution updates</h2>

<p>In the tables below all items are counted individually unless specified. In particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>gloves are counted singly, not as pairs, and are delivered as boxes of 200 items. Clinical procedures may use 1, 2 or 4 gloves at a time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hand hygiene products are counted per bottle (or similar) regardless of capacity, so that a 100ml bottle counts the same as a 1 litre bottle. Hand hygiene products include hand wash and alcohol-based hand sanitiser</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>paper towels are counted in sleeves of 250 single sheets</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Tables 1 reports the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> distribution for the latest calendar month and the total since the start of the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> programme. The cumulative total is reported as a total for the first year of operation (25 February 2020 to 24 February 2021) and a total for the whole period since 25 February 2020.</p>

<p>The data reported in table 1 includes all types of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, items that are critical for infection control<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">[footnote 1]</a></sup>,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">[footnote 2]</a></sup> and a small number of other fast-moving items<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>. These items were made available through NHS Supply Chain during the COVID-19 pandemic because there was a significant increase in usage. Some of these items were not available through NHS Supply Chain in 2019.</p>

<p>All numbers in table 1 are rounded to the nearest thousand, unless they are less than one thousand in which case they are rounded to the nearest hundred. Due to rounding, the table totals may not equal the sum of the columns.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> distributed by distribution channel</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> programme distributes some <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> directly, such as to NHS hospitals. Alternative distribution channels are available for other sectors in health and social care, particularly when <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> requirements are smaller. The total statistics reported include <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> delivered using all these channels, which include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>local resilience forums (<abbr title="local resilience forums">LRFs</abbr>). These enabled the local distribution of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. They are still active in many areas but have been replaced by local authorities in some parts of England</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>local authorities. In areas where the <abbr title="local resilience forums">LRFs</abbr> stood down on 14 September 2020, the LA has taken responsibility for distribution of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>designated wholesalers. These were able to source <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> from the programme for onward distribution. Each wholesaler typically supports a given group of care providers such as GPs, social care providers, community pharmacies, or dentists. Data about wholesalers has been reported by the date of delivery to the wholesaler. <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> has not been distributed to wholesalers since 24 January 2021 by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the e-Portal. This is an on-line ordering system which is a part of the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> programme, described in greater detail below</p>

<p>The total amount of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> which is provided through the e-Portal will be influenced by both the number of accounts registered and the amount which each account orders.</p>

<p>Registration is voluntary: on 30 November 2021, there were 54,330 providers registered on the e-Portal, out of 61,942 invited to register.</p>

<p>Registration on the e-Portal includes information about each account holder. Table 4 reports the sector of the account holder for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items ordered on the e-Portal in the latest calendar month, and the total since the first order on the e-Portal, on 9 April 2020.</p>

<p>All numbers in Table 4 are rounded to the nearest thousand. Due to rounding, the table totals may not equal the sum of the columns.</p>

<p>Umbrella organisations are predominantly adult domiciliary care, or adult residential care. The category ‘Other’ includes orders where the sector of the account holder is not noted. We are working to improve these classifications where possible.</p>

<p>The e-Portal makes available a selection of different types of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. The total orders of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> by sector and by item type are included in the accompanying tables. The distribution of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> via the e-Portal will not represent the total <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> provided to a sector through the lifetime of the programme. Organisations which join the e-Portal are likely to have previously procured <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> using other distribution channels. Organisations may also procure <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> independently of the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> programme. Any additional <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is not included in this data, which shows only the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> ordered using the e-Portal.</p>

<h3>Distribution to other sectors</h3>

<p><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> has been supplied predominantly for use by health and social care services in England. A small amount has been made available to other sectors, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>over 45 million items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to public services overseen by other government departments and organisations. This includes <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> distributed to Public Health England, Ministry of Defence Medical Service, Maritime and Coastguard Agency and Ministry of Justice</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>over 13 million items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> provided to the devolved administrations between April and June 2020<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>. This data has been ratified by the devolved administrations</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a small proportion of items distributed to Crown Dependencies</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Measuring the data</h3>

<h3>How the data was collected</h3>

<p>The data was collected from management information provided by Supply Chain Coordination Limited (NHS Supply Chain) since 25 February 2020. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> receives this data daily from NHS Supply Chain which, since April 2020, has been compiled by Clipper Logistics, who have distributed all <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> since April 2020.</p>

<p>Prior to April 2020 some items were distributed from the NHS Supply Chain Regional Distribution Centres. Since April 2020 all products are distributed by Clipper and pass through a central warehouse in Daventry before delivery.</p>

<p>Data for the whole programme is reported by the date of delivery, which covers all <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items delivered within a 24-hour window from 2am on the date in question up to 2am the next day. Some organisations subsequently further distribute the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. For these organisations, the date used is the date of delivery from <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> to the organisation and not the date of subsequent delivery to the end user.</p>

<p>Items are sometimes recalled, such as when they are faulty or do not meet set criteria. The figures presented are a combination of the number of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items distributed minus those recalled and credits for stock that was processed through the system but unfulfilled. Consequently, some days have negative delivery of items. Some items which have been recalled may still feature in the data as they are yet to be removed.</p>

<p>The data is not a measure of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> use as some items may not be used, while reusable items may be used multiple times.</p>

<p>Clipper Logistics deliver <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> from the main <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> warehouses to the e-Portal warehouses, from which the e-Portal team process the e-Portal orders before delivery. The total delivery data from Clipper reports items by the date of delivery to the e-Portal warehouses. In contrast, the e-Portal data uses the calendar date the order was placed on the e-Portal. Care should be taken when interpreting the relative dates of Clipper delivery and e-Portal orders.</p>

<p>The figures in this bulletin may differ from those previously quoted due to differences in start date and inclusion of items in the definition of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Coverage</h3>

<p>The data covers <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> distributed predominantly for use by health and social care services in England.</p>

<p>The data includes deliveries from the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> Dedicated Supply Channel to organisations such as NHS trusts, National Supply Distribution Response, local resilience forums, local authorities and wholesalers for onward distribution and use by health and social care providers and other users of the e-Portal. These organisations may also procure <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> through other routes, so this data does not constitute all <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> available to NHS trusts, social care and primary care providers.</p>

<h3>Quality</h3>

<p>These statistics have been put together by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> with advice from NHS Supply Chain and the Office for National Statistics on this approach.</p>

<p>More information on quality and how this publication adheres to the Code of Practice for Statistics is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ppe-delivery-statistics-statement-of-compliance-with-the-code-of-practice-for-statistics">statement of compliance</a>.</p>

<h3>Future development</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> intends to release these statistics regularly while they remain relevant to the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Future updates will be issued monthly on the second Tuesday of each month.</p>

<p>The timeline below provides an indication of key developments in <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s understanding of this data.</p>

<h3>Experimental statistics</h3>

<p>Given the commitment of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> to be open and transparent with the public it serves, this data is being released as experimental statistics. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has received requests for data on the distribution of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, such as Parliamentary Questions, Freedom of Information Requests and other queries.</p>

<p>These experimental statistics are undergoing continual evaluation and development. These figures have not been used for statistical purposes before.</p>
