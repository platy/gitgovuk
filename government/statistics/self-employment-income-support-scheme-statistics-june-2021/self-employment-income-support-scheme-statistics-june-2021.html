<span class="number">1.2 </span>Next release</h3>

<p>This next release is scheduled for 1 July 2021.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Main findings</h2>

<p>The main findings from these statistics are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To date £24.5bn has been paid in <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grants in total (up to 9 May). Across the four schemes 2.8m individuals have received a grant and 8.8m total grants have been claimed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government announced a significant change in access to the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>, basing the fourth and fifth grants on 2019-20 Self-Assessment tax returns. Around 5.0 million individuals reported self-employment income for the tax year 2019 to 2020, and had their data assessed for potential <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> eligibility. In order to be assessed, a self-employed individual needed to have traded in the tax year 2019 to 2020 and submitted a Self-Assessment tax return on or before 2 March 2021 for that year</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Via this process, 3.4 million self-employed individuals were identified as potentially eligible for the fourth <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant. This means that they met the criteria for the scheme based on Self-Assessment returns from 2019 to 2020 and earlier years. However, some of the potentially eligible businesses will not have been affected by Coronavirus or have ceased trading since 2019 to 2020 so will not have been eligible</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not all cases will claim the grant. By 9 May, 1.7 million (50%) of the potentially eligible population have claimed the fourth <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant with the value of these claims totalling £4.7 billion. The claims window closed on 1 June 2021. The 1 July statistical release will cover the claims period for the fourth grant</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Around 500,000 people are brought into scope who either became self-employed in 2019-20; or were ineligible for previous grants, but now may be eligible for the fourth grant based on submitting their 2019-20 tax return</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 90,000 (5%) claims by individuals that were not previously assessed for eligibility for the third grant of <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> in 2019/20. 51,000 (3%) claims are by individuals that were assessed for the third <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant and found ineligible but are now eligible to claim <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> based on their 2019/20 returns</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the fourth <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant the average value per claim was £2,800</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Around two-thirds of the potentially eligible population are male (2.3m). The average claim for females is lower at £2,200 compared to the average claim for males of £3,100</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Around 91% of claimants are aged between 25 and 64 and take-up of the grant in those age groups is at or above 47%. No single age group dominates take-up of the fourth <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant, although take-up is notably lower among the over 65s at 35%</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sector with the highest number of potentially eligible individuals and the highest proportion of claims is the construction industry. By 9 May, construction workers had made 555,000 claims for the fourth <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant, totalling £1.9 billion</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The two regions with the highest number of claims of the fourth <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant are London (349,000) and the South East (238,000), reflecting their relative sizes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the 1.6 million that did not meet one or more of the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> criteria, 1.4 million (84%) had trading profits less than non-trading profits (e.g. income from employment, investment or other income sources), 0.5 million (32%) had trading profits of £0 or made a loss and 0.2 million (11%) had trading profits over £50,000 (N.B. Individuals may be counted more than once). This represents a slight decline on the 1.7 million individuals who were assessed as ineligible for the third <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant in our February statistics</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>About this release</h2>

<p>The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (<abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>) provides support for self-employed individuals whose business has been affected by Coronavirus (COVID-19). On the 22 April 2021 applications for the fourth grant of <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> opened. To make a claim for the fourth grant businesses must have had a new or continuing impact from coronavirus between 1 February 2021 and 30 April 2021. This is a grant worth 80% of their average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering 3 months’ worth of profits, and capped at £7,500 in total.</p>

<p>To be eligible for the fourth <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant an individual must have traded in both tax years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2019 to 2020 and submitted their tax return on or before 2 March 2021</li>
  <li>2020 to 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>They must either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be currently activiely trading but impacted by reduced demand due to coronavirus</li>

</ul>

<p>They must also declare that they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>intend to continue to trade</li>
  <li>reasonably believe that there will be a significant reduction in trading profits</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Self-Employment Income Support Scheme fourth grant claims and eligibility</h2>

<p>Around 5 million individuals who reported income from self-employment were assessed for <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>: 3.4 million of these were found to be potentially eligible and 1.6 million were found to be ineligible.</p>

<p>By 9 May 2021, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> received 1.7 million claims for the fourth grant of the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (<abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>) from a total potentially eligible population of 3.4 million. This represents a take-up rate of 50%. These claims totalled £4.7 billion with an average award of £2,800 per claimant.</p>

<p>Eligibility for Self-Employment Income Support Scheme required an individual to have levels of income which met specific tests on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their 2019 to 2020 tax year income, or</li>
  <li>the combination of income for consecutive tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, 2018 to 2019, and 2019 to 2020 where available</li>
</ul>

<p>With 2019 to 2020 tax year income assessed for the first time, some individuals could claim a <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant that were previously unable to do so. These individuals are now described as either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not previously assessed, meaning they were not assessed for eligibility for the third <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant, for example because they did not submit a Self-Assessment return for 2018/19</li>
  <li>previously ineligible, meaning they were assessed for the third <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant, but did not meet the criteria for eligibility, for example because their trading profit was less than their non-trading income</li>
</ul>

<p>Around 500,000 people are brought into scope who either became self-employed in 2019-20; or were ineligible for previous grants, but now may be eligible for the fourth grant on the basis of submitting their 2019-20 tax return.</p>

<p>Figures below represent all criteria that apply to each individual from both sets of tests. Additionally, within each element individuals can be ineligible for multiple reasons and, as a result, there is a high level of overlap between the categories presented below.</p>

<p>Of the 1.6 million individuals who were assessed to be ineligible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>84% (1,388,000) had a trading profit that was less than their non-trading income;</li>
  <li>32% (532,000) had a trading profit £0 or less;</li>
  <li>11% (181,000) had trading profit exceeding £50,000 per year;</li>

<p>Of 5.0 million individuals who were assessed for <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>, men make up around two-thirds (65%), and also make up a slightly higher proportion (68%) of the potentially eligible population.</p>

<p>By 9 May, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> had received 1,189,000 claims from men totalling £3.6 billion compared to 491,000 claims from women for £1.1 billion.

<p>Figure 2 and Table 5 show the assessed for potential eligibility population, the potentially eligible population and volumes of claims made for fourth grant by age group. Table 5 also shows claim values by age.</p>

<p>Around 89% of individuals who were assessed as potentially eligible were between the ages of 25 and 64, with 91% of claimants coming from this age group. Take-up of the grant in these age-groups is at or above 47%. No single age group dominates, and claims are evenly spread.</p>

<p>The take up rate is noticeably lower for those who are aged 65 and over (35% have claimed), although they have the highest average claim value at £3,100. The youngest age group have the lowest average claim value at £2,200.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Self-Employment Income Support Scheme fourth grant by industry sector</h2>
<p>(see Table 3 in the accompanying tables for further details)</p>

<p>Self-employed individuals are asked to provide a description of their business activity on their self-assessment returns. These activities have been mapped across to the Standard Industrial Classification (<abbr title="Standard Industrial Classification">SIC</abbr>) 2007 to enable analysis to be carried out by industry sector. Where an individual has multiple sources of self-employed income the activity with the highest income has been used for the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> analysis.</p>

<p>Figures 3 and 4 show the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> populations and number of claims for the fourth grant made by industry sector.</p>

<p>The construction industry has the largest population of individuals who were assessed for potential eligibility with over 1.2 million and over 1 million of these were potentially eligible to apply. By 9 May construction workers had made 555,000 claims totalling £1.9 billion; an average of £3,500 per claimant.</p>

<p>Self-employed individuals in the transportation and storage sector make up 8% of the potentially eligible population and made 182,000 claims totalling £395 million. Administrative and support services also make up 8% of the potentially eligible population and have made 116,000 claims totalling £234m.</p>

<p>The highest rates of being assessed as potentially eligible were from individuals working in the construction industry (85%) and the transportation and storage sector (82%).</p>

<p>Lower rates of being assessed as potentially eligible for <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> were found for individuals working in real estate activities (29%), financial and insurance activities (41%), agriculture, forestry and fishing (45%) and professional, scientific and technical activities (46%).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Self-Employment Income Support Scheme fourth grant by geography</h2>
<p>(see Table 2 in the accompanying tables for further details)</p>

<p>Using the claimant’s Self-Assessment address, <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> claims can be mapped to countries of the UK, English regions and lower geographies.</p>

<p>Figure 6 shows the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> population and number of claims made by country and region.</p>

<p>London has the largest number of individuals that were assessed for eligibility (905,000), the largest potentially eligible population (633,000) and the largest number of claims (349,000) totalling £1.017 billion.</p>

<p>England had the highest proportion of assessed individuals that were found to be eligible (68%), followed by Wales (65%), Scotland (64%) and Northern Ireland (63%).</p>

<p>Take-up rate is very even across the UK with most nations and regions having a take-up rate close to 50%. London has the highest take-up rate (55%) while the take-up rate in the South West is the lowest (44%).</p>

<p>Self-employed individuals in Scotland have made 105,000 claims totalling £294m; in Wales 66,000 claims for £173m have been made and in Northern Ireland 43,000 claims for £118m have been submitted.</p>

<span class="number">10. </span>Self-Employment Income Support Scheme fourth grant claims by industry sector and geography</h2>
<p>(see Table 6 in the accompanying tables for further details)</p>

<p>Sections 10-12 of this bulletin consider the breakdown of the number of claims received in each country and region by different demographics (industry, gender and age).  Comparable information relating to the value of claims, the potentially eligible population and take-up rates can be found in tables 6 and 7 in the accompanying tables.</p>

<p>Figure 8 shows the breakdown of claims in each region and country by industry sector.  Construction, transport and administrative services have the largest number of claims overall and are shown as separate categories on the chart. Agriculture, forestry and fishing is also large for some areas and is shown separately. Other smaller industries have been combined.</p>

<p>The industry profile of <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> claimants does not vary greatly between countries and regions. The main exceptions are seen in the construction industry and agriculture, forestry and fishing.</p>

<p>Individuals working in the construction industry account for the highest proportion of claims in every country and region of the UK. London has the highest proportion, with 40% of claims being from those working in construction and Scotland has the lowest with 26%.</p>

<p>Individuals working in agriculture, forestry and fishing account for 5% of all claims made by individuals in Northern Ireland, 3% in Wales, 2% in Scotland and only 1% in England.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The allocation to industry represents an individual’s highest earning self-employment.</li>
  <li>496,000 cases of the potentially eligible population are included as “Unknown and other” and almost all of these (99%) could not be allocated to a <abbr title="Standard Industrial Classification">SIC</abbr> code.</li>

<span class="number">11. </span>Self-Employment Income Support Scheme fourth grant claims by gender and geography</h2>
<p>(see Table 7 in the accompanying tables for further details)</p>

<p>The area with the highest proportion of males in the potentially eligible population is Northern Ireland (73%) and the lowest areas are Scotland and the South West (64% each). A similar pattern is seen in the number of claims received by 9 May with male claimants accounting for 74% of claims in Northern Ireland, 75% of claims in London and 65% of claims in South West.</p>

<p>Since the average claim amount is higher for males than females as well, men account for an even higher proportion of total claim values. In the West Midlands, (79%) and London (81%) of total claim values are from men. The lowest male share is in Scotland and the South West where 72% of the total amount claimed is claimed by men.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>Background to the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme</h2>

<p>The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (<abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>) was announced on 26th March 2020 as part of the UK government’s support package for businesses and self-employed people during the coronavirus outbreak in early 2020.</p>

<p>The scheme was open to self-employed individuals and members of a partnership who met the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>traded in the tax year 2018 to 2019 and submitted their Self-Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year</li>
  <li>traded in the tax year 2019 to 2020</li>
  <li>intended to continue to trade in the tax year 2020 to 2021</li>
  <li>carried on a trade which had been adversely affected by coronavirus</li>
</ul>

<p>A business could be adversely affected by coronavirus if, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they were unable to work because they:
    <ul>
      <li>were shielding</li>
      <li>were self-isolating</li>
      <li>were on sick leave because of coronavirus</li>
      <li>had caring responsibilities because of coronavirus</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>they have had to scale down or temporarily stop trading because:
    <ul>
      <li>their supply chain has been interrupted</li>
      <li>they have fewer or no customers or clients</li>
      <li>their staff are unable to come in to work</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The grant is not open to limited companies or those operating a trade through a trust.</p>

<p>To work out eligibility, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> first look at the 2018 to 2019 Self-Assessment tax return. Trading profits must be between £0 and £50,000 and at least equal to your non-trading income. If an individual is not eligible based on the 2018 to 2019 Self-Assessment tax return, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will then look at the tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, and 2018 to 2019.</p>

<p>The scheme allows an eligible individual to claim a taxable grant worth 80% of their average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering 3 months’ worth of profits, and capped at £7,500 in total. The first Self-Employment Income Support Scheme grant closed for claims on 13 July 2020.</p>

<p>On the 17 August 2020 applications for the second Self-Employment Income Support Scheme grant opened. This was a taxable grant worth 70% of their average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering three months’ worth of profits, and capped at £6,570 in total.</p>

<p>On 30 November 2020 applications for the third Self-Employment Income Support Scheme grant opened. On 30 November 2020 applications for the third Self-Employment Income Support Scheme grant opened. This was a taxable grant worth 80% of an individual’s average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering 3 months’ worth of profits, and capped at £7,500 in total.</p>

<p>The eligibility rules changed slightly for the third grant. To be eligible for Self-Employment Income Support Scheme 3 an individual must have been eligible for Self-Employment Income Support Scheme 1 and 2 and also declare that they intend to continue to trade and either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>are currently actively trading but are impacted by reduced demand due to coronavirus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>were previously trading but are temporarily unable to do so due to coronavirus.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Government announced at Budget 2021 that the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (<abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>) will continue until September, with a fourth and a final fifth grant.</p>

<p>On 22 April 2021 applications for the fourth <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant opened. Eligibility for the fourth grant required an individual to have levels of income which met specific tests on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their 2019 to 2020 tax year income, or</li>
  <li>the combination of income for consecutive tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, 2018 to 2019, and 2019 to 2020 where available.</li>
</ul>

<p>With 2019 to 2020 tax year income assessed for the first time, some individuals could claim a <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant that were previously unable to do so. These individuals are now described as either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not previously assessed, meaning they were not assessed for eligibility for the third <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant, for example because they did not submit a Self-Assessment return for 2018/19 but did submit a return in 2019/20.</li>
  <li>previously ineligible, meaning they were assessed for the third <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant, but did not meet the criteria for eligibility, for example because their trading profit was less than their non-trading income.</li>
</ul>

<p>The statistics presented in this release mainly cover claims for the fourth grant in the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> scheme up to 9 May 2021.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>Glossary</h2>

<p>The assessed for potential eligibility population are those self-employed individuals who <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> identified as having traded in the tax year 2019 to 2020 and submitted their Self-Assessment tax return on or before 2 March 2021 for that year.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> potentially eligible population are those who <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> identified as being potentially eligible for a <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant based on the information held from their Self-Assessment tax returns relating to the tax years; 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, 2018 to 2019, and 2019 to 2020. This is the group who have been invited to claim for a <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant. This does not attempt to assess if a business was affected by coronavirus or whether they continued trading after 2019 to 2020.  So, it is the potentially eligible population based only on the information in the self-assessment returns and not all will apply for the grant.</p>

<p>The assessed to be ineligible population are those self-employed individuals who <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> identified as having traded in the tax year 2019 to 2020 and submitted their Self-Assessment tax return on or before 2 March 2021 for that year but were found not to be eligible after being assessed against the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> criteria. Trading profits must be between £0 and £50,000 and at least equal to their non-trading income. For an individual to be found ineligible based on the income criteria they need to be found ineligible based on the 2019 to 2020 Self-Assessment tax return and the combination of the relevant fields for consecutive tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, 2018 to 2019, and 2019 to 2020. Individuals are also included in the ineligible figures in this publication if an individual’s grant calculation resulted in an amount of £0 or less and if they are recorded as having ceased trading on the self-assessment systems.</p>

<p>The number of claims is defined as the total number of individuals who had submitted a claim for a <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant by on 9 May 2021 that had been either paid, sent for payment or had been received and were awaiting various checks. Only non-rejected claims are included with the majority of these having been paid or sent for payment. However, a small number of claims were still being processed and could be rejected.</p>

<p>The definitions above apply in the vast majority of cases but there are some other circumstances that are considered when including individuals for assessment and which also may affect potential eligibility to <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>. More details of this can be found here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-different-circumstances-affect-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme" class="govuk-link">How different circumstances affect the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme - GOV.UK</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.1 </span>Coverage</h3>

<p>This publication covers all self-employed individuals assessed for potential eligibility for the fourth <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant as at 9 May 2021. Generally, this includes individuals that <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> identified as having traded in the tax year 2019 to 2020 and submitted their Self-Assessment tax return on or before 2 March 2021 for that year.</p>

<p>Although this covers the vast majority of cases, there are some other circumstances that are considered when including individuals for assessment and which also may affect potential eligibility to Self-Employment Income Support Scheme. You can read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-different-circumstances-affect-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme">how different circumstances affect Self-Employment Income Support Scheme</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Small changes in the numbers of eligible and ineligible individuals between publications may be observed as <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> continue to review and monitor <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> data systems to identify all potentially eligible individuals and to ensure that only genuine <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> customers are invited to claim.</p>

<p>The claim information covers individuals who had submitted a claim for the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant by 9 May 2021 which had not rejected or failed certain compliance checks.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.2 </span>Data sources used in this release</h3>

<p>The data for this release come from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s system for administering Self-Employment Income Support Scheme. It covers the whole population rather than a sample of people or companies.</p>

<p>Additional data from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Self-Assessment system and other <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> administrative systems has been matched with Self-Employment Income Support Scheme data to produce the data released here.</p>

<p>The age, gender and postcode of residential address has been collected from the self-assessment account for each individual. The industry information has been collected from the Self-Assessment tax return for the tax year ending 5 April 2020 and relates to the self-employment business description provided on that return.</p>

<p>To produce the geographic breakdowns, the claimants’ residential postcode has been matched to Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>) data that links UK post codes to geographic areas. The geographic areas that have been presented in this release are country and English region, Local Authority and Parliamentary constituency.</p>

<p>The Self-Assessment system is a live operational dataset and, as such, details such as residential address may be updated at any point.  The allocation of geography and industry in these statistics is based on the latest reported information.  As a result, it is possible for an individual claimant’s characteristics to change between the first publication of these statistics on 11 June and subsequent publications.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.3 </span>Ineligible population compared against Self-Employment Income Support Scheme eligibility criteria</h3>

<p>Analysis of the assessed ineligible population against the eligibility criteria is as a result of additional analysis of the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> data in order to provide a description of this group of individuals. An individual can be outside of the criteria for multiple reasons for both the 2019 to 2020 Self-Assessment tax return and the tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, 2018 to 2019, and 2019 to 2020. Additionally, it is possible for the same individual to be ineligible due to different criteria across these two stages. For the purposes of the figures presented here, ineligible individuals are recorded against all the categories that apply to that individual. As a result, individuals can be ineligible in multiple ways and there is a high level of overlap between the categories presented.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.1 </span>Experimental Statistics status</h3>

<p>This release is classed as Experimental Statistics as the methodologies used to produce the statistics are still in their development phase. This does not mean that the statistics are of low quality, but it does signify that the statistics are new and still being developed. As the methodologies are refined and improved, there may be revisions to these statistics.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.2 </span>
<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Self-Employment Income Support Scheme Management Information</h3>

<p>Management information (<abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr>) on the number and value of Self-Employment Income Support Scheme claims received had been published by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> at various dates since the scheme was launched on 13 May 2020.</p>

<p>This <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> report will no longer be published and instead the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Coronavirus statistics page will point towards these statistics.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.3 </span>Differences compared to Survey of Personal Incomes</h3>

<p>In the Survey of Personal Incomes individuals are considered as Self-Employed if <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> received or expects to receive Self-Assessment forms covering income from self-employment in their 2017 to 2018 Self-Assessment tax return.</p>

<p>The?population assessed for <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> eligibility here includes?only those individuals?who submitted?2019 to 2020 Self-Assessment tax returns?by 2 March 2021 and included data on self-employment in that return.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.4 </span>Differences compared to other sources</h3>

<p>Other organisations such as the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> and Institute for Fiscal Studies (<abbr title="Institute for Fiscal Studies">IFS</abbr>) have published information about Self-Employment Income Support Scheme either from surveys or estimates derived from previously published data.  We believe these <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> statistics provide a more reliable picture as they are based on administrative data from the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme claim and Self-Assessment systems.</p>
