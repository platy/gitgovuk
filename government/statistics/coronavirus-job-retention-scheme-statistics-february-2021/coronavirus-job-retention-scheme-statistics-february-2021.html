<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This is the ninth release of Official Statistics on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (<abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>). This release provides analysis of claims for periods up to 31 January 2021. The data used includes claims submitted to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> by 15 February 2021.</p>

<p>The data for January is not yet fully complete as while claims relating to January should have been filed by 15 February 2021, employers could file claims later with the agreement of <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> if they had a reasonable excuse. Claims for January can also be amended until 1 March 2021. Together these factors are likely to have a small effect on the statistics: it is estimated that the number of claims reported for January could increase by around 3%. The January figures should therefore be considered as provisional and will be revised in a future release.</p>

<p>This release also presents the cumulative number of jobs furloughed since the start of the scheme in March 2020 up to 15 February 2021. It also includes figures for the cumulative number of <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes that have claimed under the Job Retention Scheme and the total amount claimed. This replaces the previously published management information figures.</p>

<p>We will continue to publish statistics on the Job Retention Scheme and the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension in future months. These statistics are Experimental Statistics and are subject to revisions. Further information is provided later in this publication.</p>

<p>The government announced the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (<abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>) on 20 March 2020. <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> supports employers in paying their employees. Employers have been able to claim <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> support for employees furloughed from 1 March 2020. Up to 30 June 2020, <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> provided employers with financial support of up to 80% of their employees’ salaries. This support is capped at £2,500 per month per employee. Employers were also able to claim Employer National Insurance and minimum automatic enrolment pension contributions.</p>

<p>For the period 1 July 2020 to 31 October 2020, except in certain exceptional circumstances, staff who had not already been furloughed under the scheme could not be included in claims for support. Changes to the scheme from the start of August, September and October – as described later in this bulletin – gradually reduced the total level of support available for each furloughed employee up to the end of October.</p>

<p>An extension to the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> began on 1 November 2020 to provide further support to individuals and businesses impacted by disruption caused by coronavirus (COVID-19). At this time, it again became possible to claim support for furloughing jobs that had not been previously furloughed.</p>

<p>The figures for eligible employments in these statistics for periods from 1 November have been amended from those included in previous releases to reflect the updated eligibility criteria for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension. More details on this can be found in the methodology section of this release.</p>

<h2>Main points</h2>

<p>The key points from this release covering the period to 31 January 2021 are below. Figures for January 2021 are provisional and subject to revision as additional claims for the period are received.</p>

<ul>
  <li>following on from the last release which covered the period to 31 December, the data shows that furloughing of staff across all sectors increased up to 31 January, corresponding to the introduction of tighter restrictions on business opening that were introduced on 6 January</li>
  <li>the number of employments furloughed at 30 November was 3.9 million, this increased to 4.0 million at 31 December. Provisional estimates show a further increase in January to 4.7 million employments furloughed at 31 January</li>
  <li>cumulatively,11.2 million jobs have been supported by the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> since the start of the scheme</li>
  <li>the accommodation and food services sector had the highest take-up rate on 31 December at 65% of employers, provisional estimates show this increased to 68% of employers on 31 January. 1.12 million employments were furloughed in this sector on 31 December. Provisional estimates show the number of employments furloughed increased to 1.15 million on 31 January, the highest of all sectors</li>
  <li>furloughing of staff in the wholesale and retail sector peaked on 24 April at 1.85 million employments furloughed. This dropped to 356,400 employments furloughed at 31 October. The number of employments furloughed increased in November and December to 714,400 at 31 December. Provisional figures show that at 31 January, furloughing in this sector had increased to 938,500 employments furloughed</li>
  <li>at 30 November, 1.22 employments were furloughed by large employers with 250 or more employees. This increased to 1.24 million employments furloughed at 31 December. Provisional estimates show that the number of employments furloughed by large employers increased to 1.49 million at 31 January</li>
  <li>across the UK, where it was possible to link the data, 1.92 million females were furloughed at 31 December compared with 1.88 million males. Provisional estimates show the number of females furloughed increased to 2.32 million at 31 January and the number of males increased to 2.18 million</li>
  <li>at 31 December, 36% of employers had staff furloughed. Provisional estimates show that this increased to 41% at 31 January. At 31 December 13% of employments eligible for furlough were furloughed, provisional estimates show this increased to 16% at 31 January</li>
  <li>there was broad consistency in furlough rates across the nations and regions of the UK at the end of December with London having the highest take-up rate of 16% against the UK average of 13%. Provisional estimates show that this was also true at the end of January with London having the highest take-up rate of 17% against and increased UK average of 16%</li>
  <li>at 31 December, the 18 to 24 age band had the highest number of claimants for both females and males, 357,000 and 294,000 respectively. Provisional estimates show that this was still true at 31 January with 409,700 females and 333,000 males furloughed</li>
  <li>the under 18 age band had the highest take up rate for both females and males at 31 December, 33% and 24% respectively. Provisional estimates for 31 January show that the under 18 age band continued to have the highest take-up rates at 39% for females and 29% for males</li>
  <li>1.48 million employments were on partial furlough at 31 December, 37% of the total employments furloughed. Provisional estimates show this decreased to 1.33 million employments furloughed at 31 January, 28% of the total employments furloughed. This lower proportion of partial furloughing in January is consistent with greater restrictions on business activity in January.</li>
</ul>

<p>These statistics have been produced using data from both the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> and <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) system. They have been developed taking into account user feedback and requests. We would welcome any further feedback from users. This should be sent to <a href="mailto:CJRS.Statistics.Enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>.Statistics.Enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk</a>. Responses will then be taken into consideration when developing future releases.</p>

<p>For these statistics, an ‘employer’ is defined as a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme, and ‘employments’ are defined according to the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> criteria. Further details are within the <a href="#background" class="govuk-link">background</a> section.</p>

<p>An individual with employments with more than one employer is counted once for each employment furloughed.</p>

<p>As with previous releases, where we have been unable to match the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims with other <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> data, we have denoted this as ‘unknown’ in the tables within this release.</p>

<p>This release reports a <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> take-up rate for both employers and employments, where appropriate. The take-up rate has been calculated using <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> data, to estimate the eligible population of both employers and employments.</p>

<p>When the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension was introduced on 1 November 2020, it again became possible to claim support for furloughing jobs that had not been previously furloughed. The criteria for eligibility for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> were amended for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension.</p>

<p>For furloughing from November 2020 onwards, the numbers of jobs presented as ‘eligible employments’ and used to calculate take-up figures reflect the criteria for eligibility for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension. They are based on a list of employees employed on 30 October 2020 and included in <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Real Time Information submissions for 20 March 2020 to 30 October 2020.</p>

<p>The figures for eligible employments in these statistics have been amended from previous releases to reflect the changes Previously figures for the numbers of employers and employments eligible were based on the criteria at the initial introduction of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>.</p>

<p>The figures for January 2021 are based on claims received to the deadline of 15 February 2021. In some circumstances, late claims can be made with a reasonable excuse and in agreement with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. Claims may also be amended until 01 March 2021. Therefore, the data for January 2021 is incomplete and should be considered to be provisional. It is estimated that the overall total number of employments furloughed in January will be in the region of 3% higher once all claims are submitted and revisions applied.</p>

<p>Except for the figures in the next section (titled: Cumulative claims and jobs furloughed since the start of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>), the data in this release shows the total number of employments furloughed each day from March 2020 to January 2021. The first three releases of these statistics, published in June, July and August 2020, reported estimates of the total number of jobs that had been furloughed at any time over the March to June period, based on the latest data available at the time of those releases.</p>

<p>With the introduction of flexible furlough on 1 July, this statistical release series began reporting estimates of the number of jobs furloughed each day, with additional breakdowns for the last day in each month.</p>

<p>The data presented in this release comes from combining detail about furlough periods from the job level data supplied with larger claims (claims with 100 or more furloughed jobs) and the total number of furloughed staff included in each claim.</p>

<p>Rounding has been applied to the figures in the tables accompanying this release, with counts rounded to the nearest 100 and amounts to the nearest million.</p>

<h2>Cumulative claims and jobs furloughed since the start of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>
</h2>

<p>This section of the release presents the cumulative number of jobs furloughed since the start of the scheme in March 2020 up to 15 February 2021. It also includes figures for the cumulative number of <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes that have claimed under the Job Retention Scheme and the total amount claimed.</p>

<p>Similar figures were previously released weekly at the start of the scheme and then alongside these statistics on the main gov.uk page for <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> COVID-19 statistics. The most recent figures published showed the position at midnight 13 December.</p>

<p>Table 1 shows that there have been 11.2 million unique jobs supported by the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> since its inception. This is a cumulative figure and covers all jobs furloughed at any time since the start of the scheme.</p>

<p>As described in detail in the methodology section of this release, the methodology used to calculate this figure has been improved and now uses job-level data rather than totals from claim forms submitted by employers. As a result, the figure is not directly comparable with the previously published management information figures.</p>

<p>This methodology change does not affect published figures on the number of jobs furloughed at the end of each month, or the more detailed statistics on the number of jobs furloughed each day.</p>

<p>The figures in table 1 are based on claims received up to 15 February 2021, the deadline for claims relating to January 2021. As well as claims made for January and earlier, these figures include claims for employments furloughed after January 2021 where the claim was received by 15 February 2021.</p>

<p>Table 1 also includes the total number of employer <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes that had claimed support up to 15 February 2021 and the value of claims submitted. All these figures together with the figures previously published as management information on the main <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> COVID-19 statistics page can be found in table 1 of the spreadsheet that accompanies this release.</p>

<h2>Employments furloughed over time</h2>

<p>This section of the release presents the number of employments furloughed each day from the scheme’s start up to 31 January 2021.</p>

<p>The chart in figure 1 shows the number of jobs furloughed under claims for support to the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>. Key points to note from figure 1 are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>initially the number of employments furloughed increased quickly following the announcement of the scheme on 20 March, reaching 4.8 million on 23 March and 6.8 million by the end of March</li>
  <li>following further strong growth at the start of April, the number of employments furloughed increased gradually and peaked at 8.9 million on 8 May 2020. After the early May peak, the number of employments furloughed decreased slowly, before a fall of around 670,000 employments between the end of May and the start of June</li>
  <li>the number of employments that were furloughed then continued to reduce until the end of October, falling from 6.8 million at 30 June to 2.4 million at 31 October</li>
  <li>the number of employments furloughed increased on 1 November to 3.7 million, this figure continued to rise throughout November to 3.9 million on 30 November, corresponding to the introduction of the second national lockdown in England which was introduced on 5 November</li>
  <li>latest figures show that the number of employments furloughed continued to increase through December to 4.0 million at 31 December. Provisional estimates for January show an increase of around 800,000 employments furloughed on 1 January to 4.8 million followed by a slight decrease to 4.7 million employments furloughed at 31 January</li>
</ul>

<h2>Employments furloughed over time by industry</h2>

<p>This section breaks down the overall time series included above by the employer’s industrial sector. Figure 2 is a set of charts, one for each of 15 industrial sectors experiencing higher numbers of jobs furloughed. The underlying data for this figure and 6 other sector categories not shown in the chart can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/964215/CJRS_Statistics_February_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx" class="govuk-link">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>The key points to note from <a class="govuk-link" href="#fig-2">figure 2</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>following on from the last release which covered the period to 31 December, the data shows that furloughing of staff across all sectors increased up to 31 January</li>
  <li>furloughing of staff in the wholesale and retail sector peaked on 24 April at 1.85 million employments furloughed. This dropped to 356,400 employments furloughed at 31 October. The number of employments furloughed increased in November and December to 714,400 at 31 December. Provisional figures show that at 31 January, furloughing in this sector had increased to 938,500 employments furloughed</li>
  <li>accommodation and food services peaked at 1.65 million employments furloughed on 10 April, this fell to 1.12 million employments furloughed at 31 December. Provisional figures show that the number of employments furloughed increased through January to 1.15 million at 31 January</li>
  <li>the manufacturing sector had a peak of 911,000 employments furloughed on 17 April. This declined to 188,200 at 31 October. Through November and December, the number of employments furloughed increased to 274,500 at 31 December. Provisional estimates show that this figure had risen to 312,800 at 31 January</li>
  <li>in construction, furloughing peaked on 14 April with 723,600 employments furloughed, this fell to 169,700 at 30 November. This figure increased to 195,100 employments furloughed at 31 December and provisional estimates show that at the end of January the number of employments furloughed had risen further to 244,100</li>
  <li>furloughing in the arts and entertainment sector peaked later than other sectors on 15 May 2020 with 455,100 employments furloughed on that date. By 31 October this had dropped to 159,600 employments furloughed. Through November and December, this figure increased to 284,400 employments furloughed at 31 December. Provisional figures show that this figure increased further to 315,100 employments furloughed at 31 January</li>

<h2>Employments furloughed over time by employer size</h2>

<p>In addition to the sectoral breakdown we also provide a breakdown of the number of employments furloughed per day by employer size. The employer size has been calculated based on an estimate of the number of employments eligible to be furloughed. We assume a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme to be the equivalent of an employer.</p>

<p>Presented in figure 3 is a set of charts, one for each employer size band. The underlying data for these charts can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/964215/CJRS_Statistics_February_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx" class="govuk-link">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>The key points to note from <a href="#fig-3" class="govuk-link">figure 3</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>across all employer sizes, the number of employments furloughed increased between 30 November and 31 January</li>
  <li>at 30 November, 1.22 employments were furloughed by large employers with 250 or more employees. This increased to 1.24 million employments furloughed at 31 December. Provisional estimates show that the number of employments furloughed increased to 1.49 million at 31 January</li>
  <li>employers with 20 to 49 employments had 519,100 employments furloughed on 30 November. This figure increased to 559,800 employments furloughed at 31 December. Provisional estimates show that the number of employments furloughed continued to increase to 652,000 at 31 January</li>
  <li>employers with one employment had 174,800 employments furloughed at 30 November. This decreased slightly by 2,800 to 172,000 employments furloughed at 31 December. Provisional figures show that this figure dropped to 194,400 at 31 January</li>

<h2>Employments furloughed over time by country and region</h2>

<p>This section provides a geographic breakdown of the number of employments furloughed each day from 1 July 2020 up to 31 January 2021. This is based on the residential address information that <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> holds for employees. This does not directly translate to the employee’s usual place of work, or employer’s centre of operations which may be in a different region.</p>

<p>For example, an employee who lives in Wales and normally commutes daily to work in Bristol would be included within the count for Wales, rather than for South West England. At present these statistics are only available for 1 July onwards (see methodology section for more information). Figures for January should be considered to be provisional.</p>

<p>Presented in figure 4 is a set of charts, one for each region. The underlying data for these charts can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/964215/CJRS_Statistics_February_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>The key points to note from <a href="#fig-4" class="govuk-link">figure 4</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>across all English regions, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the number of employments furloughed increased from 30 November to 31 January</li>
  <li>1.90 million employments were furloughed in England at 31 October. This figure increased through November to 3.21 million at 30 November before dropping to 3.19 million at 31 December. Provisional estimates show that the number of employments furlough increased in December to 3.77 million at 31 January</li>
  <li>in London – the English region with the most furloughed staff from July 2020 to January 2021, there were 644,400 employments furloughed at 30 November. This increased to 654,100 employments furloughed at 31 December. Provisional estimates show a further increase in January to 712,200 employments furloughed at 31 January</li>
  <li>the number of employments furloughed in Scotland on 30 November was 228,300. This figure increased to 288,900 employments furloughed at 31 December. Provisional figures show an increase in the number of employments furloughed to 362,300 at 31 January</li>
  <li>the number of employments furloughed in Wales was 125,000 at 30 November. This increased to 158,700 employments furloughed at 31 December. Provisional estimates show the number of employments furloughed increased by 21,300 to 178,000 at 31 January</li>
  <li>on 30 November, the number of furloughed employments in Northern Ireland was 79,300. This increased to 96,500 employments furloughed at 31 December. Provisional figures show that the number of employments furloughed continued to increase through January to 106,200 at 31 January</li>

<h2>Employments furloughed over time by gender</h2>

<p>This section provides analysis showing the number of employments furloughed each day from 1 July 2020 up to 31 January 2021, broken down by the claimants’ gender.  The underlying data for figure 5 can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/964215/CJRS_Statistics_February_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.

<p>The key points to note from <a href="#fig-5" class="govuk-link">figure 5</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>since 1 July, more employments have been furloughed with female job holders than where the employee was male</li>
  <li>for employments where the employee was female, there were 1.19 million employments furloughed at 31 October. This increased to 1.92 million employments furloughed at 31 December. Provisional figures show that this number increased throughout January to 2.32 million at 31 January</li>
  <li>for employments where the employee was male, there were 1.14 million at 31 October. At 30 November this had increased to 1.79 million and continued to increase through December to 1.88 million employments furloughed at 31 December. Provisional figures show that this increased to 2.18 million employments furloughed at 31 January</li>

<h2>Employments furloughed over time by age</h2>

<p>This section provides analysis for the number of employments furloughed each day from 1 July 2020 up to 31 January 2021, broken down by age band. The claimant’s age is calculated at 1 March 2020 for employments furloughed up to 31 October, and at 1 November 2020 for employments furloughed from 1 November onwards.</p>

<p>Figure 6 is a set of charts, one for each age band.

At present these statistics are only available for 1 July onwards (see methodology section for more information).</p>

<p>The key points to note from <a class="govuk-link" href="#fig-6">figure 6</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>across all age bands the number of employments furloughed increased between 30 November and 31 January</li>
  <li>for employments where the employee was aged 25 to 34, the number of employments was 526,000 on 31 October, the highest across all age bands. This increased to 865,800 at 30 November and 887,900 at 31 December. Provisional figures show that this figure continued to rise to 1,029,200 at 31 January</li>
  <li>the number of employments furloughed with employees in the 18 to 24 age band was 325,300 on 31 October. This increased to 641,300 on 30 November and 651,000 on 31 December. At 31 January, provisional figures show that 742,700 employments were furloughed in the 18-24 age band</li>
  <li>where the employee was 65 or over, the number of employments furloughed was 111,900 at 31 October. At 30 November, the number of employments furloughed had risen to 156,200 before a small decline to 153,200 at 31 December. Provisional estimates show that the number of employments increased in January to 181,600 at 31 January</li>

<h2>Employments furloughed over time by furlough type</h2>

<p>This section provides a breakdown of the overall time series by employments furloughed fully and partially. On 1 July, the option was introduced for employers to furlough their employees for part of their usual hours, with the employee free to work the remainder. Therefore, the time series shown in figure 7 starts at 1 July.</p>

<p>The underlying data for figure 7 can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/964215/CJRS_Statistics_February_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>The key points to note in <a href="#fig-7" class="govuk-link">figure 7</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of employments furloughed on a full-time basis decreased month on month from July to 31 October, where it stood at 1.36 million. The number of employments fully furloughed then increased through November to 2.36 million at 30 November before a slight decline to 2.33 million employments furloughed at 31 December. Provisional figures show that the number of employments fully furloughed increased to 3.18 million at 31 January</li>
  <li>the number of employments claimed for while the employee was working some of their usual hours has remained steady between when this was made possible on 1 July and October. At 31 October there were 977,200 employments flexibly furloughed. This increased to 1.37 million at 30 November and 1.48 million at 31 December. Provisional figures show that the number of employments flexibly furloughed decreased in January to 1.33 million at 31 January</li>
  <li>this means that a lower proportion of jobs were partially furloughed in January than in November and December, which is consistent with the greater restrictions on business activity in place during January.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Furloughing by employer size at 31 December and provisional figures for 31 January</h2>

<p>Where it has been possible to match <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> data to Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>), we have estimated the size of each employer in terms of number of employees potentially eligible for <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> support.</p>

<p>When the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension was introduced on 1 November 2020, it again became possible to claim support for furloughing jobs that had not been previously furloughed. The figures for eligible employments in these statistics have been amended from previous releases to reflect the changes. More information can be found in the methodology section</p>

<p>For this data, we have assumed that <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme is the equivalent to an employer. For some employers, this is not an exact one-to-one equivalent. For example, some organisations operate multiple payrolls for different groups of employees and in other situations, a group of companies may pool their payrolls together under one <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme. However, in our view <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes provides a reasonable proxy for employers for the purposes of this release.</p>

<p>The employer size has been calculated based on an estimate of the number of employments eligible to be furloughed.</p>

<p>The key points to note from tables <a class="govuk-link" href="#tab-2a">2a</a> and <a href="#tab-2b" class="govuk-link">2b</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at 31 December, 36% of employers had staff furloughed. Provisional estimates show that this increased to 41% at 31 January.</li>
  <li>as at 31 December, employers with 20-49 employees were most likely to have claimed under <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> to support the furloughing of staff, with 52% of employers of this size having at least 1 employee furloughed. Provisional estimates show this was still true at 31 January with 61% of these employers having staff furloughed.</li>
  <li>the figures for the value of claims do not take account of voluntary repayments</li>

<h2>Furloughing by countries and regions at 31 December and provisional figures for 31 January, including gender breakdown</h2>

<p>We also provide a geographic breakdown of <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims based on the residential address information that <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> holds for employees. This does not directly translate to the employee’s usual place of work, or employer’s centre of operations which may be in a different region. For example, an employee who lives in Wales and normally commutes daily to work in Bristol would be included within the count for Wales, rather than for South West England.</p>

<p>Figures 8a and 8b show the number of furloughed employments by each of the English regions, and the totals for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. For some employments it has not been possible so far to link the employment to the employees’ area of residence and these are included in the unknown category.</p>

<p>The key points from figures <a href="#fig-8a" class="govuk-link">8a</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#fig-8b">8b</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>London and the South East accounted for 1.19 million of the furloughed employments at 31 December. Provisional estimates show this increased to 1.35 million at 31 January</li>
  <li>the East Midlands and West Midlands had a total of 556,700 employments furloughed at 31 December, increasing to 665,200 at 31 January</li>
  <li>at 31 December, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland combined had 544,100 employments claimed for under <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>. Provisional estimates for 31 January show an increase of 102,400 to 646,500 employments furloughed</li>
  <li>overall, where it was possible to link the data, across the UK, 1.92 million females were furloughed at 31 December compared with 1.88 million males. Provisional estimates for 31 January show that these figures increased to 2.32 million females furloughed and 2.18 million males</li>

<h2>Full and partial furlough use by sector at 31 December and provisional figures for 31 January</h2>

<p>The spreadsheet file accompanying this release presents analysis of the number of employments fully and partially furloughed by each employer’s industrial sector.</p>

<p>Table 15 in the accompanying spreadsheet provides the number of employments fully and partially furloughed at 31 December and provisional estimates at 31 January. The key points to note are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>239,800 employers had at least one employment on partial furlough at 31 December. Provisional estimates for 31 January show this figure increased to 241,900</li>
  <li>1.48 million employments were on partial furlough at 31 December, 37% of the total employments furloughed. Provisional estimates show this figure decreased to 1.33 million employments furloughed at 31 January, 28% of the total employments furloughed</li>
  <li>2.33 million employments were fully furloughed at 31 December, 59% of the total employments furloughed. Provisional estimates for 31 January show this figure increased to 3.18 million, 68% of the total employments furloughed</li>
  <li>at 53%, the manufacturing sector had the highest proportion of employments furloughed partially on 31 December. The sector with the highest proportion of employments fully furloughed was energy production and supply, at 80%. Provisional estimates show these sectors still had the highest proportions fully and partially furloughed at 31 January</li>
  <li>missing information on some furloughed employments – for example incomplete or not fully processed spreadsheet-type returns for employers furloughing 100 or more staff – means that whether an employee has been partially furloughed is not known in 4% of cases</li>
</ul>

<h2>Full and partial furlough use by Region and sector at 31 December and provisional figures for 31 January</h2>

<p>Tables 17 and 18 in the accompanying spreadsheet show the number of employments furloughed by region and sector at 31 December and provisional estimates at 31 January.</p>

<p>The key points to note are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at 31 December, across all countries and regions, the accommodation and food services sector had the highest number of employments furloughed, this was followed by the wholesale and retail sector. Provisional estimates for 31 January show this was still true in all countries and regions bar Northern Ireland where the wholesale and retail sector overtook the accommodation and food services sector</li>
  <li>in London, 27% of the employments furloughed were in the accommodation and food services sector on 31 December. Provisional estimates show this decreased to 26% at 31 January</li>
  <li>Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland combined had 152,500 employments furloughed in the accommodation and food services sector at 31 December. Provisional estimates show this increased to 161,900 at 31 January</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The government introduced the Coronavirus Job Retentions Scheme (<abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>) to support employers through the COVID-19 period, this has commonly been referred to as the furlough scheme. It works by providing grants to employers of up to a maximum 80% of salary to a maximum value of £2,500 per employee (until the end of August). Up to the end of July, the scheme also met some of the cost of employer pension contributions and the employer National Insurance Contributions.</p>

<p>The scheme is based around <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) system. For an employer to qualify for the scheme they need to have created a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme by 19 March 2020. In these statistics, an employer is defined as a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme.</p>

<p>The rules for an employment to qualify to be covered by the scheme are set out in guidance, and two of the key rules are that the furloughed employee must have been employed on 19 March 2020 and the employer must have submitted a Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) submission to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> for the employee by this date. Further information on the qualifying criteria is available <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-for-wage-costs-through-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme">online</a>.</p>

<p>The scheme closed to new entrants from 30 June 2020. After this date, employers have only been able to furlough employees they furloughed for a full three-week period prior to 30 June 2020.</p>

<p>As a consequence of the closure of the scheme to additional employees and the minimum three-week furlough period that applied until the end of June, the final date that an employer could have furloughed an employee for the first time was 10 June 2020.</p>

<p>Employers had until 31 July 2020 to make any claims in respect of the period to 30 June 2020. A small number of claims have been made since this date. These claims relate to exceptions as set out in the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> guidance (for example, for employees being furloughed who have been absent from work and who had been paid Statutory Maternity Pay).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> scheme was extended from 1 November 2020. The rules for an employment to qualify to be covered by the extended scheme are set out in guidance. The two key rules are that the furloughed employee must have been employed on 30 October 2020, and the employer must have submitted a Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) submission to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> for the employee between 20 March 2020 and 30 October 2020, notifying a payment of earnings for that employee.</p>

<p>This may differ where they have made employees redundant, or they stopped working for the employer on or after 23 September 2020 and have subsequently been re-employed.</p>

<h3>Changes to the scheme from 1 July 2020</h3>

<p>From 1 July 2020, employers have the flexibility to bring furloughed employees back to work part time. Additionally, employers have the flexibility to decide the hours and shift patterns of their employees – with the government continuing to pay 80% of salaries for the hours they do not work.</p>

<p>From 1 September 2020, the scheme supported 70% of salaries for hours not worked, reducing to 60% from 1 October 2020.</p>

<p>When claiming the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> grant for furloughed hours, employers need to report and claim for a minimum period of a week. Employers had until 30 November 2020 to submit claims for support from the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Changes to the scheme from 1 November 2020</h3>

<p>An extension of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> scheme began on 1 November 2020 to further support individuals and businesses who are impacted by disruption caused by coronavirus (COVID-19). The <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension will remain open until 30 April 2021. For claim periods from 1 November to 30 April 2021, employers with a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme will be able to claim 80% of an employee’s usual hours worked, up to a maximum of £2,500 per month. The £2,500 cap is proportional to the hours not worked.</p>

<h2>Glossary</h2>

<p>An employer is defined within this release as a Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) Scheme. In some circumstances this does not map directly to what is commonly understood to be an employer. For example, some organisations operate multiple payrolls, and in other situations, a group of companies may pool their payrolls together under one <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme. However, in our view <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes provides a reasonable proxy for employers for the purposes of this release.</p>

<p>An employment is defined within this release as anyone who meets the scheme criteria set out within the published guidance. We have applied this definition in order to keep the presentation simple and the difficulty in separating out Office Holders (such as directors) from what are generally considered employees. Further information on the eligibility criteria is set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#background">background section</a> above.</p>

<h2>Measuring the data</h2>

<h3>Data source and collection</h3>

<p>The data for this release comes from HM Revenue and Customs’ <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims. It covers the whole population rather than a sample of people or companies, and it will allow for more detailed estimates of the population.</p>

<p>The release is classed as Experimental Statistics as the methodologies used to produce the statistics are still in their development phase. As a result, the series are subject to revisions. Information about what the term Experimental Statistics means is published by the <a rel="external" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/guidetoexperimentalstatistics" class="govuk-link">Office for National Statistics</a>.</p>

<p>Additional data from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Real Time Information system has been matched with <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> data in order to produce the statistics released here.</p>

<h3>Coverage</h3>

<p>This publication covers all <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims made by employers from the start of the scheme up to 15 February 2021 for support for the wages of furloughed staff up to 31 January 2021. The data for January is incomplete as claims relating to January may still be filed; thus, the figures for January should therefore be considered provisional results and will be revised in future releases.</p>

<h3>Methodology (except table 1)</h3>

<p>This section provides notes on the methodology and implications for interpreting the figures.</p>

<p>The statistics in this release count employments. Therefore (for example), an employee with jobs at two employers will be counted twice if both jobs are furloughed.</p>

<p>The numbers of jobs presented as ‘eligible employments’ and used to calculate take-up figures reflect the criteria for eligibility for the extension to the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> scheme. They are based on a list of employees employed on 30 October 2020 and included in <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Real Time Information submissions for 20 March 2020 to 30 October 2020. Only employments in <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> submissions received by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> by 30 October are counted.</p>

<p>Following the criteria for qualifying for the scheme, this is supplemented by a list of people who were employed on 23 September 2020 but who left their job before 30 October and who were later re-employed by the same employer.</p>

<p>The criteria for eligibility for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> were amended for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension. The figures for eligible employments in these statistics have been amended from previous releases to reflect the changes.</p>

<p>In this release employers are described as eligible to claim the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> if they employed staff for which the criteria to be eligible for furlough were met. Employers are grouped into size bands in some tables according to the number of employees they had who were eligible to be furloughed under the extension to <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>.</p>

<p>In some circumstances <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> holds incomplete information about employments, for example where a leaving date had not been submitted by employer. In this situation, an estimate of the probability that an individual was employed on the qualifying dates has been used.</p>

<p>The assessment of whether a person was employed on the qualifying dates is based on the methodology used for the joint <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>/ONS statistics release, <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/earningsandemploymentfrompayasyouearnrealtimeinformationuk/february2021" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Earnings and employment from Pay As You Earn Real Time Information</a></p>

<p>Employers making claims for 100 or more employees at a time are required to submit the details of the employees furloughed in a spreadsheet-type file. While these claims have been processed from a customer service perspective, the processing of this information for these statistics has been complex and the processing of data on some employments has not been completed. This is a factor behind the unknown category in the tables.</p>

<p>The completeness of this data has gradually improved since the first release, and we expect some further (smaller) improvements.</p>

<p>The geographic and flexible furlough breakdowns of employments include all employees that employers have furloughed where it has been possible to link claim data on furloughed employments to classifying information (such as the employee’s gender and address). The linking has been performed using employees’ National Insurance numbers to data held within <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) system. When the employer-submitted National Insurance numbers are not of sufficient quality to be matched with other <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> data, the employments have been categorised as ‘unknown’.</p>

<p>The geographic breakdowns in the tables and maps use a postcode lookup file from Office for National Statistics (ONS) data to link UK postcodes to geographic areas.</p>

<p>Industrial sector information is based on the Interdepartmental Business Register (IDBR) produced by the ONS. Where <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes are absent from the IDBR, we have used sector information from Companies House, linking on employer name where possible. This provides Standard Industrial Classification codes (<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialclassificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007" rel="external" class="govuk-link">UK SIC 2007</a>) for employers that have made a claim. Where we have been unable to determine SIC codes, we have reported the sector as ‘unknown’.</p>

<p>The time series in this bulletin show figures for the number of employments furloughed each day, using all claims submitted to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> by 15 February 2021.</p>

<p>In producing the time series statistics some challenges had to be tackled. These included dealing with data on amendments to claims and claims for overlapping periods. In addition, claims for 100 or more furloughed staff may include staff furloughed for varying periods. These factors combined with some incomplete data (as mentioned above) make counting the number of employees furloughed over time complex.</p>

<p>The method employed is designed to generally prevent overcounting employments and may in certain circumstances very slightly undercount. Consequently, for the period to the end of June, the time series presented in this bulletin may typically slightly undercount the number of furloughed employments.</p>

<h3>Methodology (cumulative figures - table 1)</h3>

<p>The methodology used for the figure for the cumulative number of jobs ever furloughed since the start of the scheme (table 1 above) has been improved. Previously the method used was based on the figures for the total number of jobs furloughed on each claim. This choice had to be made because at the time the job-level information available for statistical purposes was incomplete for larger claims.</p>

<p>Over time – and particularly with the introduction of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension – the previous method had started to undercount the total number of jobs furloughed.</p>

<p>The original method took the total number of jobs furloughed from all the claims made by each <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme. It then found the maximum number of jobs furloughed for each employer across all their claims. Finally, it summed these values for all <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes to arrive at a total number of employees furloughed.</p>

<p>The new approach uses job-level data. For this, we calculate the number of unique National Insurance numbers in the claims made by each employer, and then sum these. This information is supplemented by the employee’s name and payroll number in a small number of cases.</p>

<p>The cumulative number of employers making <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims is calculated as the number of distinct <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes that have submitted a claim since the start of the scheme. The cumulative value of claims made is calculated as the sum of the amount claimed for each submitted claim.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of flexible furlough employers have been able to cancel claims made on the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims portal within 72 hours of making a claim. From the figures dated 15 February 2021 onwards, claims cancelled in this way have been excluded.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> separately publishes figures for the value of claims paid to employers, in its monthly publication on tax receipts. Those figures are on a cash basis and reflect the time that the payments were made rather than the date that claims were received, so are slightly different to the figures included in this release.</p>

<h3>User questions and feedback</h3>

<p>We welcome questions and feedback. Our email address is: <a href="mailto:cjrs.statistics.enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">cjrs.statistics.enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Strengths and limitations</h2>

<p>HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) grants pre-release access to <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/about-the-authority/what-we-do/uk-statistical-system/types-of-official-statistics/">Official Statistics</a> publications, and in accordance with the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> policy, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hmrc-statistics-pre-release-access-list" class="govuk-link">pre-release access has been granted to a number of people</a> to enable the preparation of a ministerial briefing.</p>

<h3>Experimental Statistics status</h3>

<p>The release is classed as Experimental Statistics as the methodologies used to produce the statistics are still in their development phase. This does not mean that the statistics are of low quality, but it does signify that the statistics are new and still being developed. As the methodologies are refined and improved, there may be revisions to these statistics.</p>

<p>Rather than waiting until the development work has been completed, the statistics are being published now to involve potential users in developing the statistics. We hope that this encourages users to provide us with their thoughts and suggestions of how useful the statistics are and what can be done to improve them. Comments can be sent by email to <a href="mailto:CJRS.Statistics.Enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>.Statistics.Enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>More information about what it means for Official Statistics to be classified as Experimental Statistics is available from the <a href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/experimental-statistics-official-statistics-in-development" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Office for Statistics Regulation</a>.</p>

<h3>Office for Statistics regulation review</h3>

<p>These statistics have been produced quickly in response to developing world events. The Office for Statistics Regulation, on behalf of the UK Statistics Authority, has reviewed them against several key aspects of the Code of Practice for Statistics and regards them as consistent with the Code’s pillars of Trustworthiness, Quality and Value.</p>

<h3>Strengths of the data</h3>

<p>The data used in this release includes all claims made by employers up until 15 February 2021 for support for the wages of furloughed staff up to 31 January 2021, rather than a sample. We have linked <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> data to Pay As You Earn Real Time Information data (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) to provide the additional information presented in this release.</p>

<h3>Revisions</h3>

<p>In future iterations of this statistics release there may be some further revisions reflecting improvements to the data processing and methodology.</p>

<p>The figures in this release incorporate data on claims received by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> up to 15 February 2021 and cover employments furloughed up to 31 January 2021. The data for January is incomplete as late claims for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension may still be filed with reasonable excuse and <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> agreement. Amendments to January claims may be made until 1 March 2021.</p>

<p>Together it is expected that these factors will result in an increase in the level of furloughed jobs reported for January of about 3%. Thus, the figures for January should therefore be considered provisional results and are likely to be revised slightly upwards in a future release.</p>
