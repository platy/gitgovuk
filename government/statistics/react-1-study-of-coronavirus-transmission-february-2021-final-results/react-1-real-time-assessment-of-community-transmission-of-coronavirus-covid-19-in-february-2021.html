<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>A representative cross-section of volunteers tested themselves with swabs from 4 February to 13 February inclusive. Swabs were analysed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Swab results reported for the period 4 February to 13 February are referred to as round 9a. Swab results reported for the period 6 January to 22 January are referred to as round 8.</p>

<p>Over the 10 days of the partially completed round of testing, out of 85,473 swab results, 378 were positive, giving an overall weighted prevalence of 0.51% (95% CI, 0.45%, 0.59%) or 51 people per 10,000 infected. This represents a fall of more than two thirds since the previous (round 8 final) report where 1.57%, or 157 per 10,000 people were infected. Prevalence fell in the last half of the previous round, and this decline has continued into this current round.</p>

<p>Across the results for the latter half of round 8 (16 January to 22 January) and round 9a, a halving time of 14.6 (12.7, 17.1) days has been estimated, corresponding to R of 0.72 (0.69, 0.76)</p>

<p>Regional prevalence fell in all areas compared to the previous report in January. It was highest in the North West [1.38% to 0.91%] and North East (1.22% to 0.82%).There were substantial falls in prevalence compared to the last report in January in London (2.83% to 0.54%), West Midlands (1.66% to 0.33%), East of England (1.78% to 0.54%), South East (1.61% to 0.30%), East Midlands (1.16% to 0.51%). There was smaller fall in Yorkshire and 
The Humber (0.80% to 0.61%). Falls in regional prevalence are reflected in the regional R numbers, which are robustly below 1 in all regions other than the North East, North West and Yorkshire and The Humber.</p>

<p>There have been substantial falls in prevalence across all age groups between rounds 8 and 9a. The results now indicate that highest weighted prevalence is currently among 18 to 24 year olds at 0.89% (0.47%, 1.67%) and ages 5 to 12 years at 0.86% (0.60%, 1.24%). Lowest prevalence is among those 65 years and older at 0.30% (0.22%, 0.41%).</p>

<p>Large household size, living in a deprived neighbourhood and Asian ethnicity continue to be associated with increased prevalence, as do working in healthcare or care homes.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>During the period 4 February to 13 February, SARS-CoV-2 virus was circulating with a lower prevalence than between 6 January to 22 January with 51 in 10,000 infected. There was strong evidence for a decline in prevalence averaged across the period 16 January to 22 January and 4 February to 13 February, with the most marked drop in regional prevalence evidenced in London.</p>

<p>Subsequent rounds of REACT-1 will allow further accurate assessment of trends in prevalence and transmission.</p>
