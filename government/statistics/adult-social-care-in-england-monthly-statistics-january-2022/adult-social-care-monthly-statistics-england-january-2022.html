<h2>Main points</h2>

<h3>COVID-19 testing in care homes</h3>

<p>ln the week ending 21 December 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there were more than 3 times as many positive tests among staff (2,699 LFDs and 8,296 PCRs) and residents (248 LFDs and 2,176 PCRs) than in the week ending 23 November 2021</li>
  <li>for both care home staff and residents, the number of positive tests returned in care homes was higher than levels seen in summer 2021, but still substantially lower than the peak seen at the start of 2021</li>
  <li>there was a substantial increase in the number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted in care home staff and residents</li>
</ul>

<h3>COVID-19 and flu vaccination in social care settings</h3>

<p>As of 20 December 2021, the proportions who had received a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>82.9% of total residents and 38.4% of total staff of older adult care homes</li>
  <li>70.1% total residents of younger adult care homes</li>
  <li>34.6% total staff of younger adult care homes and 25.6% total staff of domiciliary care staff</li>
</ul>

<p>As of 20 December 2021, the proportions who had received their flu vaccination for the 2021 to 2022 season were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>80.8% of total residents and 23.2% of total staff of older adult care homes</li>
  <li>67.9% of residents of total younger adult care homes</li>
  <li>22.1% of total staff of younger adult care homes and 14.2% of total domiciliary care staff</li>
</ul>

<h3>Infection control measures in care homes</h3>

<p>In the week ending 21 December 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>92.9% of care homes in England were able to accommodate residents receiving visitors – this has remained broadly consistent since late July 2021</li>
  <li>81.8% of care homes who had staff required to self-isolate paid those staff their full wages while self-isolating – this proportion has remained consistent since mid December 2020</li>
  <li>69.8% of care homes had no staff members working in another health or social care setting – this proportion has continued to gradually decline from 78.2% at the end of April 2021</li>
</ul>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a monthly publication by the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) of statistics on adult social care in England. This statistical bulletin provides an overview on a range of information on social care settings, with a focus on the impact of COVID-19.</p>

<p>This report provides newly published information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>selected infection prevention control (<abbr title="infection prevention control">IPC</abbr>) measures in care homes at national, regional and local authority level</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>staffing levels in care homes at national, regional and local authority level</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) availability in care homes and domiciliary care at national, regional and local authority level</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>testing for COVID-19 in care homes at national, regional and local authority level</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>flu vaccination for the 2021 to 2022 flu season in adult social care settings at national, regional and local authority level</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This report also includes previously published statistics on uptake of first, second and booster doses uptake of COVID-19 vaccinations in adult social care settings.</p>

<p>For more information and links to other published sources of adult social care data please see the ‘About this data’ section below.</p>

<h2>Publication updates</h2>

<p>An additional report providing more information on the pressures faced by the adult social care workforce, received through an ad hoc survey, was published as part of this collection on 17 December 2021. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/adult-social-care-workforce-survey-december-2021" class="govuk-link">adult social care workforce survey</a> was a voluntary survey completed by Care Quality Commission (<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>) registered care homes and domiciliary care providers. It ran for a month from 13 September 2021 to 14 October 2021 and aimed to gain insight into the scale of workforce challenges faced by providers and specific areas of concern.</p>

<p>The next publication will be published on 10 February 2022. Dates for future publications will be pre-announced on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/search/research-and-statistics?content_store_document_type=upcoming_statistics" class="govuk-link">GOV.UK publication release calendar</a>.</p>

<h2>COVID-19 and flu vaccination in adult social care settings</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>How the data can be used</h3>

<p>This data can be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>comparing vaccination rates across local authorities and regions in England as self-reported by care providers for the:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>first, second and booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccine</li>
      <li>flu vaccinations for the 2021 to 2022 season</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>monitoring vaccination rates over time for the:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>first, second and booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccine</li>
      <li>flu vaccinations for the 2021 to 2022 season</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This data cannot be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>estimating the number of social care staff or residents who have not been vaccinated</li>
  <li>estimating the number of social care staff or residents who have been vaccinated abroad</li>
  <li>comparing with vaccination rates in other countries of the UK</li>
  <li>directly comparing vaccination take up rates between different types of care home staff (directly employed and agency staff)</li>
  <li>estimating the number of vaccinations delivered each day</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Booster rates do not distinguish between those who are eligible for a booster, given the recommended gap between second and booster doses.</p>

<p>The total number of staff and residents for each social care setting as well as the number reported to be vaccinated for COVID-19 and flu are self-reported by the care provider and local authorities. As a result, the rates in this publication refer to the percentage of staff and residents reported to be vaccinated by care providers. This means that the number of individuals who have not received the vaccine cannot be directly derived from data published in these statistics as there is a number of individuals for whom the vaccination status is unknown to the care provider.</p>

<p>The dates in this section refer to the dates vaccinations were reported by care providers as opposed to the date vaccinations were administered.</p>

<p>Some care providers have reported the total number of staff or residents but not the numbers vaccinated. As a result of this, vaccination rates are affected by response rates. This is particularly prominent for vaccination rates for second doses in staff employed in other settings and boosters and flu for all staff and resident groups. This is because these groups have a lower response rate and as a result, second dose vaccination rates may be underestimated.</p>

<p>For data relating to 9 November 2021 and before, response rates may have been underestimated, particularly for boosters and flu vaccination. This is because the default value in the underlying data is set to zero, so any zero values submitted will appear to be non-responses. From 9 November 2021 onwards, care providers are required to select that they have reviewed their responses to confirm the data submitted is accurate, therefore increasing the accuracy of response rates.</p>

<p>Among care home staff, there is a substantial difference in reported vaccination rates for COVID-19 and flu vaccinations between staff directly employed by care homes and staff employed by agencies operating within care homes. This could be due to, for example but not exclusively, different uptake rates, vaccination status not being known to the care provider or the nature of employment and information available to the care homes.</p>

<p>For data relating to 31 August 2021 onwards, a small number of social care staff who had their vaccination outside of the UK are excluded from the numbers vaccinated.</p>

<p>For more information, please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-in-england-statistics-england-methodology">background quality and methodology note</a>.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 vaccinations</h3>

<p>The NHS started administering vaccinations for COVID-19 in England on 8 December 2020. Social care staff and residents of care homes were prioritised for the vaccine according to the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>) recommendation. For more information see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/priority-groups-for-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccination-advice-from-the-jcvi-30-december-2020" class="govuk-link">Priority groups for coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination: advice from the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>From 11 November 2021, all people working or volunteering in care homes are required to have received 2 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine as a condition of their deployment in a care home, unless exempt. The final date for staff to receive their first dose of the vaccination so they were fully vaccinated in time for the regulation to come into force was 16 September 2021, based on the assumption of  an 8-week interval between first and second doses. More details can be found on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vaccination-of-people-working-or-deployed-in-care-homes-operational-guidance" class="govuk-link">Vaccination of people working or deployed in care homes: operational guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Adult social care staff and residents are now eligible for a COVID-19 booster vaccination after receiving their second dose. More details can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccination-booster-dose-resources/covid-19-vaccination-a-guide-to-booster-vaccination">COVID-19 vaccination: a guide to booster vaccination</a>.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 vaccinations in older adult care homes</h3>

<p>98.7% of older care homes have provided data on the number of staff and residents who received a COVID-19 booster dose, as of 20 December 2021. This means the first and second dose rates and the number of staff and residents receiving a booster dose may be underestimated compared to the true value.</p>

<p>For full response rates please see the accompanying ‘COVID-19 vaccination response rates, January 2022: data tables’.</p>

<h4>Residents of older care homes</h4>

<p>As of 20 December 2021, in older adult care homes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>95.7% of residents have been reported to have received 2 doses</li>
  <li>82.9% of residents have been reported to have received their booster dose</li>
</ul>

<p>Reported booster vaccination rates continued to steeply increase across all regions throughout December. Despite this, there is large variation in reported booster doses administered regionally, with the North East region having the largest uptake with 85.7% of residents vaccinated, compared to the lowest uptake in the East Midlands with 78.1%.</p>

<h4>Staff of older adult care homes</h4>

<p>As of 20 December 2021, in older adult care homes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>94.7% of staff have been reported to have received 2 doses</li>
  <li>38.4% of staff have been reported to have received their booster dose</li>
</ul>

<p>Reported booster vaccination rates continued to steeply increase across all regions throughout December. Despite this, there is large regional variation in rates, with the North East region having the highest uptake with 45.7%, and London having the lowest at 28.9%.</p>

<p>Data from figures 1 and 2 can be found in tables 1 and 2 of the accompanying ‘COVID-19 vaccination statistics, January 2022: data tables’ in addition to data by region and local authority.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>data is reported by care providers</li>
  <li>data is based on date of reporting rather than date of vaccination</li>
</ul>

<h3>COVID-19 vaccinations in staff working in domiciliary care, younger adult care homes and other settings</h3>

<p>Data for staff working in other settings (including non-registered providers and local authority employed) is now available for dates after 17 August 2021 for national and the South East region. These figures had been removed in previous publications due to data quality issues. These figures do not include Surrey as this data is no longer collected by the local authority.</p>

<p>The following proportions of social care staff have been reported to have received their COVID-19 vaccination doses:</p>

<p>In younger adult care homes as of 20 December 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>93.5% of staff have been reported to have received 2 doses</li>
  <li>34.6% of staff have been reported to have received their booster dose</li>
</ul>

<p>For domiciliary care staff as of 20 December 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>79.6% of staff have been reported to have received 2 doses</li>
  <li>25.6% of staff have been reported to have received their booster dose</li>
</ul>

<p>Among staff working in other settings as of 21 December 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>34.3% of staff have been reported to have received 2 doses</li>
  <li>3.1% of staff have been reported to have received their booster dose</li>
</ul>

<p>As data is self-reported by care providers, COVID-19 vaccination rates are affected by response rates. An overview of response rates is in the table below.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 vaccinations for residents of younger adult care homes</h3>

<p>Residents of younger adult care homes are not part of a single priority group for the COVID-19 vaccine. However, the conditions for which they reside in care homes are likely to make them more vulnerable to COVID-19 and they are therefore likely to be part of priority groups 3 to 9.</p>

<p>As of 20 December 2021, in younger adult care homes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>91.9% of residents have been reported to have received 2 doses</li>
  <li>70.1% of residents have been reported to have received their booster dose</li>
</ul>

<h3>Flu vaccination in adult social care settings</h3>

<p>The national influenza (flu) immunisation programme aims to provide direct protection to those who are at higher risk of influenza associated morbidity and mortality. Groups eligible for NHS influenza vaccination are based on the advice of the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>. More details can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-flu-immunisation-programme-plan/national-flu-immunisation-programme-2021-to-2022-letter">National flu immunisation programme 2021 to 2022 letter</a>.</p>

<p>This report covers cumulative flu vaccination rates for the 2021 to 2022 season in the below adult social care groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>residents in older adult care homes</li>
  <li>staff directly employed by older adult care homes</li>
  <li>agency staff working in older adult care homes</li>
  <li>staff directly employed by younger adult care homes</li>
  <li>agency staff working in younger adult care homes</li>
  <li>domiciliary care staff registered to independent <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> providers</li>
  <li>social care staff working in other settings (including non-registered providers and local authority employed)</li>
  <li>residents of younger adult care homes</li>
</ul>

<p>Guidance on flu vaccination for social care workers was updated on 9 September 2021. For more information, please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-in-england-statistics-england-methodology/adult-social-care-monthly-statistics-england-methodology">background quality and methodology note</a>.</p>

<p>Data is self-reported by care providers and local authorities, who may submit their resident and staff numbers but not the number receiving the flu vaccination, resulting in a lower reported percentage vaccinated. An overview of response rates for the numbers vaccinated is in the table below.</p>

<p>Note: rates for staff working in other settings refer to data up to 21 December 2021 whereas rates for older adult care homes, younger adult care home and domiciliary care staff refer to data up to 20 December 2021.</p>

<h3>Older adult care homes</h3>

<p>As of 20 December 2021, the proportions of those who had received a flu vaccination in older adult care homes were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>80.8% of residents</li>
  <li>23.2% of all staff</li>
</ul>

<h3>Younger adult care homes</h3>

<p>As of 20 December 2021, the proportions of those who had received a flu vaccination in younger adult care homes were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>67.9% of residents</li>
  <li>22.1% of all staff</li>
</ul>

<h3>Domiciliary care staff and staff working in other settings</h3>

<p>As of 20 December 2021, the proportions of staff who work in domiciliary care and other settings who had received a flu vaccination were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>14.2% of domiciliary care staff</li>
  <li>1.4% of staff working in other settings</li>
</ul>

<h4>Figure 4: percentage of social care staff and residents who have received the flu vaccination, cumulative rate, 28 September 2021 to 21 December 2021, England</h4>

<p>The reported flu vaccination rates are highest among older adult care home residents.</p>

<h2>Infection prevention control measures</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>How the data can be used</h3>
<p>This data can be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>estimating the number and proportion of care homes that indicate they:
    <ul>
      <li>are accommodating COVID-safe visits within the care homes in line with government guidance</li>
      <li>are paying full wages to the majority of their self-isolating staff</li>
      <li>restrict staff movement across settings</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>monitoring trends over time</li>
  <li>comparisons across local authorities and regions in England</li>

This report covers care homes that are accommodating visitation in line with this guidance. This could cover visitation in the care homes premises, either indoors or outdoors, or also visits off premises, either for the day or overnight.</p>

<p>In the week ending 21 December 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>92.9% of care homes in England were able to accommodate residents receiving visitors within care homes in all circumstances. This proportion has remained broadly consistent since late July 2021</li>
  <li>a further 3.7% were able to accommodate visits in exceptional circumstances. Exceptional circumstances are individually defined by each care home but are generally thought to be considered when residents are palliative</li>
  <li>there is regional variation with 95.4% of care homes accommodating visitors in Yorkshire and The Humber in comparison to 89.4% in the South West</li>
</ul>

<h3>Payment of care home directly employed staff while self-isolating due to COVID-19</h3>

<p>The infection control funds can be used to ensure staff who are self-isolating along with government guidance are paid their full wages. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>staff isolating while waiting for a test</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>isolating after having tested positive or after a positive test in their household</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>staff required to quarantine prior to receiving certain NHS procedures</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For more information see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">stay at home: guidance for households with possible or confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) infection</a>.</p>

<p>Employers who do not pay their staff their full wages while self-isolating must pay their staff at least Statutory Sick Pay (<abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr>) when the employee meets the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employment-status/employee">classed as an employee</a> and has done some work for their employer</li>
  <li>earns an average of at least £120 per week</li>
  <li>has been ill or is self-isolating for at least 4 days in a row (including non-working days)</li>
</ul>

<p>Care home staff who do not meet the criteria may not be eligible and as a result not paid to self-isolate. For more information, please see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay" class="govuk-link">guidance on Statutory Sick Pay</a>.</p>

<p>The figures in this report refer to care homes which had staff required to self-isolate in the relevant week. This means care homes who had no staff needing to self-isolate will be excluded from the rates for the relevant week. There may be several care providers who may use a combination of payment options for staff wages. In these situations, providers should report the option they use for the majority of their staff.</p>

<p>In the week ending 21 December 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>81.8% of care homes who had directly employed staff needing to self-isolate paid staff their full wages. This proportion has remained consistent since mid December 2020</li>
  <li>there is substantial regional variation with 87.8% of providers in the North West paying their staff full wages compared to 75.7% in the East Midlands</li>
</ul>

<h4>Figure 6: percentage of care homes with staff self-isolating by wages paid, week ending 21 December 2021, England</h4>

<p>More than 8 in 10 care homes were reporting to pay their staff full wages when self-isolating.</p>

<h3>Limiting staff movement between care settings</h3>

<p>Infection control funding can be used to reduce the need for staff movement between health or social care settings to limit the spread of infection, for example they can be used to recruit additional staff to enable staff to only work across one care home.</p>

<p>In the week ending 21 December 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>69.8% of care homes had no staff members working in another health or social care setting, this proportion has been steadily declining since late April 2021 but this figure has remained broadly consistent throughout December</li>
  <li>7.7% of care homes had some staff additionally working in another health or social care setting</li>
  <li>a further 22.4% of care homes had some staff additionally working in another health or social care setting due to exceptional circumstances. This number has been increasing steadily since mid May. Exceptional circumstances are defined as the care home having exhausted all other reasonable steps to ensure there are sufficient staffing levels</li>
  <li>there is substantial regional variation with 80.4% of providers in the North East having no staff working in another health or social care setting in the week ending 21 December 2021, in comparison to 64.8% in the South East</li>
</ul>

<h4>Figure 7: percentage of care homes by staff working across additional health or social care settings, 15 December 2020 to 21 December 2021, England</h4>

<p>The proportion of care homes reporting having no staff working in another setting  has gradually decreased since May 2021 but has remained broadly similar throughout December.</p>

<h2>Care home staffing levels</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>How the data can be used</h3>

<p>This data can be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>estimating the number and proportion of care homes that indicate they are operating within their agreed staffing ratios</li>
  <li>monitoring trends over time</li>
  <li>comparisons across local authorities and regions in England</li>
</ul>

<p>This data cannot be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifying the reasons for care home staff shortages and absences</li>
  <li>linking staff shortages and the number of positive cases among care home staff</li>
  <li>comparing with other countries of the UK</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>In order to measure the workforce pressures on providers during the pandemic, each provider is asked to assess their workforce pressures based on their agreed staffing ratios More details on how staffing ratios are agreed can be found within the <a rel="external" href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/guidance-providers/regulations-enforcement/regulation-18-staffing#guidance" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> guidance on staffing</a>.</p>

<p>An additional <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/adult-social-care-workforce-survey-december-2021">adult social care workforce report</a> providing more information on the pressures faced by the adult social care workforce, received through an ad hoc survey, was published as part of this collection on 17 December 2021. The survey covers more detailed insight into current workforce pressures faced compared to 6 months previously. This includes issues relating to recruitment, retention, staff morale and use of agency staff.</p>

<p>This survey complements the regular collection by providing the opportunity to have a deeper exploration of workforce issues which is possible in an ad hoc survey but would be too burdensome for the regular collection.</p>

<p>Responses were collected between September and October 2021 and providers were asked to assess the assess pressures compared to April 2021. The key findings of the survey were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>70.3% of respondents reported that retaining staff was more challenging than in April 2021. 25.0% reported that it was about the same and 4.5% reported this was less challenging than April 2021</li>
  <li>81.9% of respondents reported that recruiting staff was more challenging than April 2021; 15.1% reported that it was about the same; and 2.5% reported this was less challenging than April 2021</li>
</ul>

  <li>0.4% of providers flagged that their agreed staffing ratios had been breached</li>
  <li>4.9% flagged that they were operating within the agreed staffing ratios but there is a significant risk of escalation in the coming days</li>
  <li>94.8% were operating within their agreed staffing ratios. This has remained broadly consistent since mid December 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>If a care home’s staffing ratio has been breached, then business continuity measures may be put in place.</p>

<h4>Figure 8: percentage of care homes operating within agreed staffing ratios, week ending 20 December 2021, England</h4>

<p>More than 9 in 10 care homes report operating within their agreed staffing ratios.</p>

<h3>In care homes</h3>

<p>Guidance on what <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be used in various circumstances is available from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes/personal-protective-equipment-ppe-resource-for-care-workers-working-in-care-homes-during-sustained-covid-19-transmission-in-england">personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>): resource for care workers working in care homes during sustained COVID-19 transmission in England</a>. Despite most legal restrictions being lifted on 19 July 2021, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and other infection prevention and control measures are expected to continue to be practised in care homes.</p>

<p>In the week ending 20 December 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>0.2% of care homes in England had either no supply or were expecting to experience a shortage in the next 48 hours of at least one item of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>this gradually decreased from late September 2020 when 1.1% of care homes were experiencing a shortage and has remained relatively unchanged since March 2021</li>
</ul>

<h3>In domiciliary care</h3>

<p>Data on <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> availability in domiciliary care has not been updated for the London region for dates after 29 June 2021 due to a data quality issue which is being investigated. National figures for England are also not presented due to the effects of this issue on the national rate. Data for other regions and local authorities outside of London are available in the accompanying data tables.</p>

<h2>COVID-19 testing in adult care homes</h2>

</ul>

<h3>Number of tests conducted and positive tests returned in adult care homes</h3>

<p>The number of positive tests returned in care home staff and residents increased throughout December 2021, exceeding levels seen in summer 2021.</p>

<p>The number of positive tests returned in care home remains substantially lower than levels seen at in early 2021.</p>

<p>To see the latest testing regime guidance for care homes see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-in-adult-care-homes" class="govuk-link">coronavirus (COVID-19) testing in adult care homes</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visiting-care-homes-during-coronavirus" class="govuk-link">visiting arrangements in care homes</a>. Note that the guidance was updated on 15 December 2021 for staff to increase testing with <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests to 3 times a week, up from 2 times a week.</p>

<p>Guidance for the wider population for testing using LFDs was also updated between December 2021 and January 2022 to remove the need for a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test after a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test in certain situations and the use of LFDs to reduce the self-isolation period after a positive test. This is likely to have influenced the upward trend in the number of tests in care homes.</p>

<p>These changes are likely to have influenced the upward trend in <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted in care homes.</p>

<h3>Care home staff</h3>

<h4>
<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests</h4>

<p>In the week ending 21 December 2021, there were 8,296 positive tests returned from <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> kits in care home staff. This number has substantially increased since the week ending 23 November 2021 and has now reached double the number seen mid July 2021, when there were 3,579 positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests. The number of positive tests seen at the end of December 2021 is still less than half seen in mid January 2021, when there were 18,297 positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests.</p>

<p>The number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted, including positive, negative and void tests, in care home staff decreased between the end of July 2021 and the end of November 2021, before increasing again at the start of December 2021. The number of tests in the week ending December 2021 returned to similar levels seen around January 2021.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests</h4>

<p>In the week ending 21 December 2021, there were 2,699 positive tests returned from <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> kits in care home staff. This number has substantially increased since the week ending 23 November 2021 and has now reached double the number seen at mid July 2021, when there were 1,379 positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests. The number of positive tests seen at the end of December 2021 is still 14% less than the mid-January 2021 peak, when there were 3,137 positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests.</p>

<p>There was a gradual decline in the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted, which includes positive, negative and void tests, in care home staff between late July 2021 and the start of December 2021. Since the start of December 2021, this rapidly increased with a record number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests being conducted in the week ending 21 December 2021 with 648,856 <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted.</p>

<h3>Care home residents</h3>

<p>The testing regime for staff is more frequent than for residents. As a result, the total number of staff tests is higher than the total number of resident tests. For more information please see ‘About this data’.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests</h4>

<p>In the week ending 21 December 2021, there were 2,176 positive tests returned from <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> kits in care home residents. This number has recently substantially increased throughout December and has reached 4 times the number seen in the week ending 23 November 2021. The number of positive tests seen at the end of December 2021 is still less than a quarter of the mid-January 2021 peak, when there were 9,414 positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests.</p>

<p>The number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted among care home residents was broadly consistent between August 2021 and the end of November 2021. At the end of November 2021, the number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted in care home residents increased and reached a record number in the week ending 21 December 2021 with 141,556 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests</h4>

<p>In the week ending 21 December 2021, there were 248 positive tests returned from <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> kits in care home residents. This number has recently substantially increased and has reached over 5 times the number seen in the week ending 23 November 2021. The number of positive tests seen at the end of December 2021 is still less than a quarter of the mid-January 2021 peak, when there were 1,047 positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests.</p>

<p>The number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted among care home residents had been broadly consistent between August 2021 and mid December 2021. It then increased sharply in the week ending 21 December 2021, to almost double the previous week’s total.</p>

<p>This data can be found in tables 1 and 2 of the accompanying ‘COVID-19 testing’ tables in addition to data by region and local authority.</p>

<p>Staff and residents have different testing regimes as outlined in the ‘About this data’ section below. As a result, the number of positive test results returned are expected to be of a different scale between staff and residents.</p>

<h4>Visitors</h4>

<p>The number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted among visitors to care homes has been broadly consistent since the end of June with 94,831 tests conducted in the week ending 23 November. Testing rapidly increased in December with 104,596 conducted in the week ending 21 December.</p>

<p>Additionally, there were 9,615 <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted among visiting professionals to care homes in the week ending 21 December 2021, which was an increase compared to the week ending 23 November 2021. Previously, testing remained fairly stable from the beginning of September to the end of November 2021.</p>

<p>In the week ending 21 December 2021 there were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>121 positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests and 125 positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests returned in care home visitors</li>
  <li>5 positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests and 21 positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests returned among visiting professionals to care homes</li>

<h2>Terminology</h2>

<p>Care home: facilities providing residential care. The data in this bulletin refers to Care Quality Commission (<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>) registered care homes.</p>

<p>Older adult care homes: care homes serving any older people (aged 65 and over) as identified from the latest <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> data on care homes in the ‘older people service’ user band. A small number of residents within care homes serving older people may be aged under 65.</p>

<p>Younger adult care homes: care homes not serving any older people (aged 65 and over) as identified from the latest <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> data on care homes in the ‘older people service’ user band.</p>

<p>Domiciliary care: services providing personal care for people living in their own homes. The data in this bulletin refers to domiciliary staff employed by independent <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> registered providers.</p>

<p>Staff: unless specified, staff can refer to staff directly employed by a provider and/or through an agency.</p>

<p>Staff employed by other settings: this includes non-registered providers and local authority employed: all other eligible frontline social care staff working in close and personal contact with people clinically vulnerable to COVID-19 (as defined by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>) priority groups) who need care and support irrespective of where they work or who they are employed by, for example, local government, NHS, private sector or third sector.</p>

<p>Agreed staffing ratios: the agreed number of residents for any given member of staff. This is determined by individual providers to ensure there is safe levels of staffing for care to be delivered. This can be subject to inspection by the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>. See <a rel="external" href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/guidance-providers/regulations-enforcement/regulation-18-staffing#guidance" class="govuk-link">Regulation of staffing</a> for more information.</p>

<p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> (polymerase chain reaction) tests: <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests check for the genetic material of the coronavirus in the sample, which is taken using a swab and is processed in a lab via a polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>). These are predominantly used in care homes for people who experience symptoms, and for routine asymptomatic testing for staff and residents.</p>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> (lateral flow device): often referred to as ‘rapid tests’, these test for the presence of proteins called ‘antigens’ which are produced by the virus. They are swab tests that give results in 30 minutes or less, without the need for processing in a laboratory. These tests are primarily used in care homes for routine asymptomatic testing for staff, residents and visitors.</p>

<p><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> (personal protective equipment): equipment worn by staff, visitors or essential care-givers in care homes to reduce transmission of COVID-19. This publication refers to supplies of aprons, eye protection, gloves, hand sanitiser and face masks in care homes.</p>

<h2>About this data</h2>

<p>These statistics are being published as a part of a wider landscape of statistics on adult social care. The Government Statistical Service (GSS) compiles a <a href="https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/dashboard/tools/adult-social-care-statistics/database.html" rel="external" class="govuk-link">UK adult social care database</a> of official statistics on adult social care across the 4 nations of the UK. This is updated on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>The UK Statistics Authority (UKSA) conducted a review of <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/report-on-adult-social-care-statistics-in-england/">adult social care statistics in England</a> which called for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>better leadership and collaboration across different organisations publishing official statistics. This publication has been produced in collaboration with other statistics providers of COVID-19 adult social care data and <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will endeavour to work with various stakeholders as more data is published through this publication</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>addressing of gaps in available data, particularly in privately funded care. This bulletin aims to plug some of that gap by including data on residents privately funding their care in addition to those funded by local authorities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>improving existing official statistics. These statistics are being badged as experimental statistics and more data will be added iteratively based on user needs</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Other sources of adult social care COVID-19 data</h3>

<h4>COVID-19 vaccinations</h4>

<p>NHS England and Improvement (<abbr title="NHS England and Improvement">NHSEI</abbr>) also publish data on vaccinations in adult social care settings as part of their broader <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-vaccinations/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">statistical release on COVID-19 vaccination</a>, using the same methodology and the same data source as this publication but there are differences in the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>reporting period; data in this publication reports data collected up to 11:59pm on a Tuesday whereas <abbr title="NHS England and Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> use data collected up to 11:59pm on a Sunday</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a small amount of data may be collected after the respective reporting periods</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>regional breakdowns; data in this publication uses the administrative regions of England and <abbr title="NHS England and Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> use NHS regions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>COVID-19 testing</h4>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> also publishes care home testing data in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-weekly-reports" class="govuk-link">weekly NHS Test and Trace statistics (England)</a> at national level. This publication uses the same data source but has a different methodology for presenting testing in care homes and differences in the figures will occur due to the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>differences in which tests from different routes are included. Both methodologies include the number of tests registered from kits sent directly to care homes, but this publication additionally includes care home staff or residents tested via other routes such as regional or local test sites. As a result, figures in this report will be substantially higher for <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted in care home staff due to the current guidance recommending staff with symptoms to be tested outside of the care home (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-in-adult-care-homes">coronavirus (COVID-19) testing in adult care homes</a> for more information)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>different reporting periods. This publication uses the start time of the test in comparison to the Test and Trace statistics which use the date on which the test result was received by the individual taking the test</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>different times of extracting the data</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For more details on the NHS Test and Trace programme and the statistics please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology">NHS Test and Trace methodology document</a>.</p>

<h4>Adult social care staffing levels</h4>

<p>In December 2021, an additional workforce report providing more information on the pressures faced by the adult social care workforce has been published as part of this data collection. This information was received through an ad hoc survey, and has been published as part of this collection as a one-time event. Please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/adult-social-care-workforce-survey-december-2021">adult social care workforce survey: December 2021 report</a>.</p>

<p>The workforce survey complements the regular collection by providing the opportunity to have a deeper exploration of workforce issues which is possible in an ad hoc survey but would be too burdensome for the regular collection.</p>

<h3>Data sources</h3>

<h4>COVID-19 vaccination, infection prevention control (<abbr title="infection prevention control">IPC</abbr>), <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> availability and staffing levels</h4>

<p>Data in this publication is taken from self-reported data submitted by care providers in England through a data collection and insight tool called <a rel="external" href="https://www.necsu.nhs.uk/capacity-tracker/" class="govuk-link">Capacity Tracker</a>.</p>

<p>Care providers are expected to submit data on <abbr title="infection prevention control">IPC</abbr> compliance on a weekly basis whilst data on vaccinations, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> availability and staffing levels is expected to be updated on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Infection control data for each reporting week refers to data up to 2pm on the date stated as the ‘week ending’ and the 7 days prior. For <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and staffing-levels data relates up to 11:59pm on the date stated as the ‘week ending’. The reporting week usually ends on a Tuesday but occasionally no data is available for this date, in these situations the ‘week ending’ date will be the nearest available date.</p>

<p>This bulletin presents the proportion of staff and residents vaccinated out of the total number of staff and residents as self-reported by care providers. Only individuals who have not tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 28 days are eligible to receive the vaccine. Data on the number of staff and residents of older adult care homes eligible for the vaccination over time can be found in the accompanying COVID-19 vaccination tables.</p>

<p>For more information, please see the ‘Data Sources’ section of the accompanying <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-in-england-statistics-england-methodology" class="govuk-link">background quality and methodology note</a>.</p>

<h4>COVID-19 testing data</h4>

<p>Testing data is collected from management information generated during the operation of the NHS Test and Trace service.</p>

<p>For more information, please see the ‘Data Sources’ section of the accompanying <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-in-england-statistics-england-methodology" class="govuk-link">background quality and methodology note</a>.</p>

<h3>Data coverage and quality</h3>

<p>All data in this publication refers to adult social care settings in England only.</p>

<p>Data submitted by providers reflects the current priorities to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic in social care settings. Data collection could be subject to change based on changes to the priorities and therefore the reporting in this publication will be adapted accordingly.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="infection prevention control">IPC</abbr>, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> availability and staffing levels</h4>

<p>Providers are expected to submit data on <abbr title="infection prevention control">IPC</abbr> measures on a weekly basis while staffing levels and <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> availability data are expected to be submitted on a daily basis. Any providers who have not submitted data within the last 7 days are excluded from the relevant analysis for the associated time period where no response was received. The full response rates for all data points are available in the accompanying tables.</p>

<h4>COVID-19 vaccinations</h4>

<p>Data on total number of staff and residents as well as those vaccinated is self-reported by care providers and local authorities. Providers are expected to update their vaccination data on a daily basis. There may be a time lag between individuals receiving the vaccine and the week they are reported in the statistics depending on when providers have updated their vaccination data.</p>

<h4>COVID-19 testing</h4>

<p>This report includes the number of tests conducted on care homes residents, staff and visitors who were tested by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> kits sent directly to the care home for regular testing, which were registered through the National Testing Programme digital infrastructure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> kits conducted at another testing site such as a regional or local test site or a mobile testing unit or tests that were registered</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The figures in this report are only deduplicated to report on the number of individual tests taken, not the number of people tested. Because people can have more than one test, the data should not be compared with prevalence rates or case positivity rates.</p>

<p>This report does not contain data on those tested through pillar 1.</p>

<p>Data for each reporting period relates to the day an individual took their test.</p>

<p>To see the latest testing regime guidance for care homes please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-in-adult-care-homes">coronavirus (COVID-19) testing in adult care homes</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visiting-care-homes-during-coronavirus" class="govuk-link">visiting arrangements in care homes</a>. The guidance was updated on 15 December for staff to increase testing with <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests to 3 times a week, up from 2 times a week.</p>

<p>The current regular testing regime as of 13 January 2022 is as follows.</p>

<p>Care home staff test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>weekly, using <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits, on the same day each week</li>
  <li>3 times a week using rapid lateral flow tests – one on the same day as the weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, and an additional rapid lateral flow test every 2 to 3 days</li>
  <li>immediately before a shift, with a rapid lateral flow test, where they are working in multiple locations, and have worked somewhere else since their last shift in the home</li>
  <li>before the start of their shift on the first day back to work, after a period of leave resulting in them missing their weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>, with a rapid lateral flow test (that is, after annual leave or sick leave on entry back into the care home)</li>
</ul>

<p>Care home residents test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>monthly, using <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits</li>
  <li>as soon as they join a care home, if they are new, with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</li>
  <li>immediately if they develop symptoms, with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</li>
</ul>

<p>Further testing may be required for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visiting-care-homes-during-coronavirus.">visits in and out of the care home</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes" class="govuk-link">on admission</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings" class="govuk-link">if the resident is exposed to COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>Care home visitors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>visitors should receive a negative lateral flow test result and report it on the day of their visit, either by conducting the test at home or when they arrive at the care home</li>
  <li>essential care givers will need to be supported to follow the same testing arrangements as care home staff</li>
</ul>

<p>Visiting professionals to care homes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NHS professionals should provide proof of a negative test taken 72 hours in advance of the visit</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> inspectors regularly take weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests but should additionally take rapid lateral flow test on the day of visiting a care home</li>

<p>Different testing regimes apply when there is an outbreak of COVID-19 in a care home. See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-in-adult-care-homes/covid-19-testing-schedule-for-a-suspected-or-confirmed-outbreak-in-a-care-home" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 testing schedule for a suspected or confirmed outbreak in a care home</a> for more details.</p>

<p>The figures in this report are only deduplicated to report on the number of individual tests taken, not the number of people tested. Because people can have more than one test, the data should not be compared with prevalence rates or case positivity rates.</p>
