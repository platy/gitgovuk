<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (<abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>) was announced on 20 March 2020 and has supported employers in paying their employees during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>

<p>This is the twelfth release of Official Statistics on the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>. This release provides analysis of claims for periods up to 30 April 2021. The data used includes claims submitted to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> by 14 May 2021.</p>

<p>The data for April 2021 is not yet fully complete as while claims relating to April 2021 should have been filed by 14 May 2021, employers could file claims later with the agreement of <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> if they had a reasonable excuse. Claims for April 2021 can also be amended until 28 May 2021. Together these factors are likely to have a small effect on the statistics.</p>

<p>Based on figures for March, which have been revised since the previous release, it is estimated that the number of employments on furlough reported for April 2021 could increase by around 3%. The April 2021 figures should therefore be considered as provisional and will be revised in a future release.</p>

<p>We will continue to publish statistics on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension in future months. These statistics are Experimental Statistics and are subject to revisions. Further information on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, the compilation of these statistics and the meaning of the term Experimental Statistics is provided later in this publication.</p>

<h3>Next release</h3>

<p>The next release will be published on 1 July 2021.</p>

<h2>Main points</h2>

<p>The key points from this release covering the period to 30 April 2021 are below. Figures for April 2021 are provisional and subject to revision as additional claims for the period are received.</p>

<ul>
  <li>provisional figures show the number of employments on furlough has decreased by 900,000 from 31 March to 3.4 million employments on furlough at 30 April 2021. Numbers on <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> last peaked at 5.1 million in January and have fallen since</li>
  <li>since the start of the scheme a cumulative total of 11.5 million jobs have been supported by the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> at various times. This is across all claims submitted to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> by 14 May 2021</li>
  <li>the levels of furlough seen in these figures reflect the easing of restrictions on business activity seen throughout the UK in March and April with the reopening of businesses such as non-essential retail, and partial re-opening of restaurants and pubs in England, Wales and Scotland. There was also some easing of restrictions in Northern Ireland in April</li>
  <li>at 31 March 2021, 39% of employers had staff on furlough. Provisional estimates show that this decreased to 35% of employers at 30 April 2021. On 31 March, 15% of employments eligible for furlough were on furlough, provisional estimates show this had decreased to 12% at 30 April 2021</li>
  <li>the ten industry groups with the highest employment take-up rates at 30 April 2021 were beverage serving activities (70%), hotels and similar accommodation (65%), passenger air transport (55%), photographic activities (51%), travel agency and tour operator activities (49%), amusement and recreation activities (46%), sports activities (45%), creative; arts and entertainment activities (44%), renting and leasing of personal and household goods (43%) and manufacture of wearing apparel (41%)</li>
  <li>across sectors, the retail sale of other goods in specialised stores saw the largest reduction in the number of employments on furlough, with a decrease of 109,100 employments on furlough between 31 March and 30 April 2021. This was followed by the beverage serving activities group which saw a reduction of 72,500 employments on furlough</li>
  <li>the take-up in industry groups such as travel agency and tour operator activities, creative arts and entertainment activities, photographic activities, and renting and leasing of personal and household goods has decreased at a slower rate than other industry groups also with high take-up rates</li>
  <li>across  all employer sizes, the number of employments on furlough has decreased throughout February, March and April 2021. The largest reduction is for employers with 250 or more employees where the number of employments on furlough decreased by 414,800 from 1.40 million employments at 31 March 2021 to a provisional estimate of 985,400 at 30 April 2021</li>
  <li>across the UK, where it was possible to link the data, 2.17 million females were on furlough at 31 March 2021 compared with 1.99 million males. Provisional estimates show a decrease with 1.68 million females on furlough at 30 April 2021 and 1.64 million males</li>
  <li>the ten local authorities with the highest take-up rates at 30 April are South Lakeland (19%) and Eden (16%) in Cumbria, Scarborough (16%), Crawley (16%) and the London authorities of Newham (18%), Brent (17%), Haringey (17%), Hounslow (17%), Barnet (16%), and Waltham Forest (16%)</li>
  <li>the under 18 age band had the highest take-up rate for both female and males at 31 March 2021, 39% and 28% respectively. Provisional estimates for 30 April 2021 show that the under 18 age band continued to have the highest take-up rates at 29% for females and 22% for males</li>
  <li>the proportion of employments on partial furlough increased from 29% at 31 March to 41% at 30  April 2021. The number of employments on partial furlough increased to 1.4 million at 30 April from 1.3 million at 31 March 2021 . Some employments which were previously on full furlough may have moved to partial furlough as businesses reopened restrictions eased. This is consistent with the easing of restrictions on business activity in Spring 2021</li>
</ul>

<h3>About the data in this release</h3>

<p>The data used in this release comprises the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims made up to 14 May 2021. Where possible, this data has been matched with other HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) data to enable additional analysis to be presented. Where we have been unable to match the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims with other <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> data we have denoted this as ‘unknown’.</p>

<p>This release presents the total number of employments on furlough each day from March 2020 to April 2021, as well as figures for use at of <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension at 31 March and 30 April 2021. This release also presents the cumulative number of <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes claiming and number of employments on furlough since the start of the scheme up to14 May 2021, also broken down by local authority and Parliamentary constituency.</p>

<p>The data presented in this release comes from combining details about furlough from the job level data and the total number of staff on furlough included in each claim.</p>

<p>These statistics have been developed taking into account user feedback and requests. We would welcome any further feedback from users. This should be sent to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:CJRS.Statistics.Enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk"><abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>.Statistics.Enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.  Responses will then be taken into consideration when developing future releases.</p>

<p>For these statistics, an ‘employer’ is defined as a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme, and ‘employments’ are defined according to the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> criteria. Further details are within the <a class="govuk-link" href="#background">background</a> section.</p>

<p>The first three releases of these statistics, published in June, July and August 2020, reported estimates of the total number of jobs that had been on furlough at any time over the March to June period, based on the latest data available at the time of those releases. With the introduction of flexible furlough on 1 July, this statistical release series began reporting estimates of the number of jobs on furlough each day, with additional breakdowns for the last day in each month.</p>

<p>The ONS BICs statistics are based on fortnightly survey statistics and are more timely. The <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> statistics  are based on administrative data for the whole population of employers that use the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>. The <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> statistics provide more detailed breakdowns of the characteristics of the employers using the scheme and the employees that have been on furlough, and how the use of the furlough scheme has changed over time.</p>

<h3>Key limitations and revisions</h3>

<p>The figures for April 2021 are based on claims received to the deadline of 14 May 2021. In some circumstances, late claims can be made with a reasonable excuse and in agreement with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. Claims may also be amended until 28 May 2021. Therefore, the data for April 2021 is incomplete and should be considered to be provisional. It is estimated that the overall total number of employments on furlough in April 2021 will be in the region of 3% (around 0.1 million) higher once all claims are submitted and revisions applied.</p>

<p>Where an employer makes a claim for up to 99 jobs, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> collects the start and end date of the claim but does not collect specific separate furlough start and end dates for each job covered by the claim. For these jobs, we use the claim period to estimate when the jobs were on furlough. This works well for jobs on furlough for the whole period of affected claims. However, if a job was on furlough for 1 April to 11 April only, for example, due to this data limitation, it would appear to be on furlough for the full month in these statistics. During periods when the number of jobs on furlough is decreasing over time, this will lead to the number of jobs on furlough at the end of the month being somewhat overstated.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/coronavirus-job-retention-scheme-statistics-6-may-2021" class="govuk-link">statistics published on 6 May 2021</a> contained a downward revision to the number of employments eligible for <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension. This is due to a refinement in the methodology and results in a small increase in our estimates of the employer and employment take-up rates.</p>

<p>In the next <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> statistics release, which will cover claims received by 14 June, we will publish final figures for the number of people on furlough each month of <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension (to end-April). This will include take-up rates using the refined methodology for the eligible population. We will also publish revised figures for the eligible population for the original scheme with a future release of these statistics.</p>

<h2>Cumulative totals</h2>

<p>This section of the release presents the cumulative number of jobs on furlough since the start of the scheme in March 2020 up to 14 May 2021. It also includes figures for the cumulative number of <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes that have claimed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and the total amount claimed.</p>

<p>Table 1 shows that there have been 11.5 million unique jobs supported by the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> since its inception. This is a cumulative figure and covers all jobs on furlough at any time since the start of the scheme.</p>

<p>As described in detail in the methodology section of this release, the methodology used to calculate the number of jobs on furlough since the start of the scheme was improved for the February release of these statistics. Since February, these figures are now based on job-level data instead of the totals from each claim form submitted by employers. As a result, the figures in table 1 are not directly comparable with the management information published before the February release.</p>

<p>This methodology change does not affect published figures on the number of jobs on furlough at the end of each month, or the more detailed statistics on the number of jobs on furlough each day.</p>

<p>An individual employed by more than one employer is counted once for each employment from which they have been put on furlough. Two individuals who have been employed in the same role with an employer at different times are counted as two separate employments. In this release the terms ‘employments’ and ‘jobs’ are used interchangeably.</p>

<p>The most recent figures in table 1 are based on claims received up to 14 May 2021, the deadline for claims relating to April 2021. As well as claims for furlough during April 2021 and earlier, these latest figures also include employments on furlough after April 2021 where the claim was received by 14 May 2021.</p>

<p>Table 1 also includes the total number of employer <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes that had claimed support up to 14 May 2021 and the value of claims submitted. The figures for the number and value of claims do not take account of voluntary repayments nor remove claims not paid for compliance reasons. Claims cancelled by employers within 72 hours of making the claim are excluded.</p>

<p>All these figures together with the figures previously published as management information on the main <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> COVID-19 statistics page can be found in table 1 of the spreadsheet that accompanies this release. In addition, figures on the cumulative number of jobs put on furlough broken down by local authority and Parliamentary constituency can also be found in tables 1a and 1b of the spreadsheet that accompanies this release.</p>

<h2>Employments on furlough over time</h2>

<p>This section of the release presents the number of employments on furlough each day from the scheme’s start up to 30 April 2021.</p>

<p>Where an employer makes a claim for up to 99 jobs, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> collects the start and end date of the claim but does not collect specific separate furlough start and end dates for each job covered by the claim. For these jobs, we use the claim period to estimate when the jobs were on furlough. This works well for jobs on furlough for the whole period of affected claims. However, if a job was on furlough for 1 April to 11 April only, for example, due to this data limitation, it would appear to be on furlough for the full month in these statistics. During periods when the number of jobs on furlough is decreasing over time, this will lead to the number of jobs on furlough at the end of the month being somewhat overstated.</p>

<p>The chart in figure 1 shows the number of jobs on furlough under claims for support to the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>. The underlying data for this figure can be found in the <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/990753/CJRS_Statistics_June_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx" class="govuk-link">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>Key points to note from <a class="govuk-link" href="#fig-1">figure 1</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provisional figures show that the number of employments on furlough has decreased by 900,000 from 31 March to 3.4 million on furlough at 30 April 2021, down from 4.3 million on 31 March. Numbers on <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> last peaked at 5.1 million in January and have fallen since</li>
  <li>before this, the number of employments on furlough peaked at 8.9 million on 8 May 2020. This figure fell to 2.4 million at 31 October and then rose again to 4.9 million employments on furlough at 31 January 2021</li>
  <li>the levels of furlough seen in these figures reflect the changes to restrictions on individuals, households and businesses across the UK since the autumn</li>
</ul>

<h2>Employments on furlough over time by industry</h2>

<p>This section breaks down the overall time series included above by the employer’s industrial sector. Figure 2 is a set of charts, one for each of 15 industrial sectors experiencing higher numbers of jobs on furlough. The underlying data for this figure and 6 other sector categories not shown in the chart can be found in the <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/990753/CJRS_Statistics_June_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx" class="govuk-link">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>The key points to note from <a href="#fig-2" class="govuk-link">figure 2</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provisional figures show that all sectors saw a reduction in levels of furlough between 31 March and 30 April 2021. The largest reduction in jobs on furlough was the wholesale and retail sector (234,500 fewer jobs on furlough). At the end of April, 14% of eligible employments in this sector were on furlough. There were large reductions in the accommodation and food services, and arts and entertainment although take-up rates still remain high across these sectors</li>
  <li>furlough peaked in the wholesale and retail sector on 24 April 2020 at 1.85 million employments on furlough. This decreased to 837,300 at 31 March 2021. Provisional figures show this declined again with 602,800 employments on furlough at 30 April 2021</li>
  <li>accommodation and food services peaked at 1.65 million employments on furlough on 10 April 2020. Latest figures show 1.11 million employments on furlough at 31 March 2021, decreasing to a provisional estimate of 932,600 at 30 April 2021</li>
  <li>the manufacturing sector had a peak of 911,000 employments on furlough on 17 April 2020. This decreased to 276,800 employments on furlough at 31 March 2021. Provisional estimates show that this figure dropped to 246,300 at 30 April 2021</li>
  <li>in construction, furlough peaked on 14 April 2020 with 723,600 employments on furlough and at 31 March 2021 this figure was at 198,300. Provisional estimates show that at the end of April 2021 the number of employments on furlough had decreased to 166,600</li>
  <li>furlough in the arts and entertainment sector peaked later than other sectors on 15 May 2020 with 455,100 employments on furlough on that date. This figure decreased to 299,300 employments on furlough at 31 March 2021. Provisional figures show that this decreased in April with 230,200 employments on furlough at 30 April 2021</li>
</ul>

<h2>Employments on furlough over time by employer size</h2>

<p>In addition to the sectoral breakdown we also provide a breakdown of the number of employments on furlough per day by employer size. The employer size has been calculated based on an estimate of the number of employments eligible to be on furlough. We assume a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme to be the equivalent of an employer.</p>

<p>Presented in figure 3 is a set of charts, one for each employer size band. The underlying data for these charts can be found in the <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/990753/CJRS_Statistics_June_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx" class="govuk-link">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>The key points to note from <a href="#fig-3" class="govuk-link">figure 3</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>across all employer sizes, the number of employments on furlough has decreased throughout February, March and April 2021</li>
  <li>the largest reduction is for employers with 250 or more employees where the number of employments on furlough decreased by 414,800 from 1.40 million employments at 31 March 2021 to a provisional estimate of 985,400 at 30 April 2021</li>
  <li>employers with 20 to 49 employments had 572,200 employments on furlough at 31 March 2021. Provisional estimates show that the number of employments on furlough decreased through April to 474,300 at 30 April 2021</li>
  <li>employers with one employment had 182,700 employments on furlough at 31 March 2021. Provisional figures show that this decreased in April to 160,200 employments on furlough at 30 April 2021</li>

<h2>Employments on furlough over time by country and region</h2>

<p>This section provides a geographic breakdown of the number of employments on furlough each day from 1 July 2020 up to 30 April 2021. This is based on the residential address information that <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> holds for employees. This does not directly translate to the employee’s usual place of work, or employer’s centre of operations which may be in a different region.</p>

<p>For example, an employee who lives in Wales and normally commutes daily to work in Bristol would be included within the count for Wales, rather than for South West England. At present these statistics are only available for 1 July onwards (see methodology section for more information).</p>

<p>Presented in figure 4 is a set of charts, one for each region. The underlying data for these charts can be found in the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/990753/CJRS_Statistics_June_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>The key points to note from <a href="#fig-4" class="govuk-link">figure 4</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>across all English regions, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland provisional figures show that the number of employments on furlough decreased significantly in April 2021 after slight reductions from February to March 2021. Reductions were less marked in Northern Ireland than the rest of the UK due to the later easing of restrictions</li>
  <li>3.48 million employments were on furlough in England at 31 March 2021. Provisional estimates show that the number of employments on furlough decreased in April to 2.76 million at 30 April 2021</li>
  <li>in London – the English region with the most staff on furlough from July 2020 to April 2021, there were 670,700 employments on furlough at 31 March 2021. Provisional estimates show levels of furlough decreased in April with 551,300 employments on furlough at 30 April 2021</li>
  <li>the number of employments on furlough in Scotland on 31 March 2021 was 333,400. Provisional figures show a decrease in the number of employments on furlough to 269,800 at 30 April 2021</li>
  <li>the number of employments on furlough in Wales was 163,400 at 31 March 2021. Provisional estimates show the number of employments on furlough decreased in April to 131,900 at 30 April 2021</li>
  <li>on 31 March 2021, the number of employments on furlough in Northern Ireland was 102,200. Provisional figures show that the number of employments on furlough decreased to 90,000 at 30 April 2021</li>

<h2>Employments on furlough over time by gender</h2>

<p>This section provides analysis showing the number of employments on furlough each day from 1 July 2020 up to 30 April 2021, broken down by the claimants’ gender. The underlying data for figure 5 can be found in the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/990753/CJRS_Statistics_June_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx">accompanying spreadsheet</a>. At present these statistics are only available for 1 July onwards (see the <a href="#methodology" class="govuk-link">methodology section</a> for more information).</p>

<p>The key points to note from <a class="govuk-link" href="#fig-5">figure 5</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>since 1 July, more employments have been put on furlough with female job holders than where the employee was male. The gap narrowed in April as more female employees returned to work in sectors such as accommodation and food</li>
  <li>for employments where the employee was female, there were 2.17 million employments on furlough at 31 March 2021. Provisional figures show that this decreased throughout April to 1.69 million at 30 April 2021</li>
  <li>for employments where the employee was male, there were 1.99 million employments on furlough at 31 March 2021. Provisional figures show the number of employments on furlough decreased to 1.64 million at 30 April 2021</li>

<h2>Employments on furlough over time by age</h2>

<p>This section provides analysis for the number of employments on furlough each day from 1 July 2020 up to 30 April 2021, broken down by age band. The claimant’s age is calculated at 1 March 2020 for employments on furlough up to 31 October, and at 1 November 2020 for employments on furlough from 1 November onwards.</p>

<p>Figure 6 is a set of charts, one for each age band. The underlying data for figure 6 can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/990753/CJRS_Statistics_June_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx">accompanying spreadsheet</a>. At present these statistics are only available for 1 July onwards (see methodology section for more information).</p>

<p>The key points to note from <a href="#fig-6" class="govuk-link">figure 6</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>across all age bands the number of employments on furlough decreased throughout February, March and April 2021. The largest reductions have been for younger employees in the under 18 and 18 to 24 age bands</li>
  <li>for employments where the employee was aged 25 to 34, the number of employments on furlough was 943,400 at 31 March 2021. Provisional figures show that this figure dropped to 751,000 at 30 April 2021</li>
  <li>the number of employments on furlough with employees in the 18 to 24 age band was 684,700 at 31 March 2021. At 30 April 2021, provisional figures show that 514,400 employments were on furlough in the 18-24 age band</li>
  <li>where the employee was 65 or over, the number of employments on furlough was 172,600 at 31 March 2021. Provisional estimates show that the number of employments on furlough decreased in April to 144,000 at 30 April 2021</li>

<h2>Employments on furlough over time by type of furlough</h2>

<p>This section provides a breakdown of the overall time series by employments on full and partial furlough. On 1 July, the option was introduced for employers to furlough their employees for part of their usual hours, with the employee free to work the remainder. Therefore, the time series shown in figure 7 starts at 1 July.</p>

<p>The underlying data for figure 7 can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/990753/CJRS_Statistics_June_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>The key points to note in <a href="#fig-7" class="govuk-link">figure 7</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of employments on furlough on a full-time basis was 2.92 million at 31 March 2021. Provisional figures show this decreased in April to 1.95 million employments on full furlough at 30 April 2021</li>
  <li>at 31 March 2021 there were 1.27 million employments on partial furlough at 31 March 2021. Provisional figures show this increased at the beginning of April and fell slightly towards the end of the month to 1.39 million employments on partial furlough at 30 April 2021</li>
  <li>this means that a higher proportion of jobs were on partial furlough in April 2021 than January, February and March. Some employments which were previously on full furlough may have moved to partial furlough as restrictions eased. This is consistent with the easing of restrictions on business activity in Spring 2021</li>

<h2>Employer size at 30 April 2021</h2>

<p>Where it has been possible to match <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> data to Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>), we have estimated the size of each employer in terms of number of employees potentially eligible for <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> support.</p>

<p>For this data, we have assumed that <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme is the equivalent to an employer. For some employers, this is not an exact one-to-one equivalent. For example, some organisations operate multiple payrolls for different groups of employees and in other situations, a group of companies may pool their payrolls together under one <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme. However, in our view <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes provides a reasonable proxy for employers for the purposes of this release.</p>

<p>The employer size has been calculated based on an estimate of the number of employments eligible to be on furlough.</p>

<p>The key points to note from tables <a class="govuk-link" href="#tab-2a">2a</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#tab-2b">2b</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at 31 March 2021, 39% of employers had put staff on furlough. Provisional estimates show that this decreased to 35% of employers at 30 April 2021</li>
  <li>at 31 March 2021, employers with 20-49 employees were most likely to have claimed under <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> to support the furlough of staff, with 59% of employers of this size having at least 1 employee on furlough. Provisional estimates show this was still true at 30 April 2021 with 51% of these employers having staff on furlough</li>
  <li>the figures for the number and value of claims do not take account of voluntary repayments nor remove claims not paid for compliance reasons. Claims cancelled by employers within 72 hours of making the claim are excluded</li>

<h2>Countries and Regions and gender at 30 April 2021</h2>

<p>We also provide a geographic breakdown of <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims based on the residential address information that <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> holds for employees. This does not directly translate to the employee’s usual place of work, or employer’s centre of operations which may be in a different region. For example, an employee who lives in Wales and normally commutes daily to work in Bristol would be included within the count for Wales, rather than for South West England.</p>

<p>Figures 8a and 8b show the number of employments on furlough by each of the English regions, and the totals for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. For some employments it has not been possible to link the employment to the employees’ area of residence and these are included in the unknown category.</p>

<p>The key points from figures <a class="govuk-link" href="#fig-8a">8a</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#fig-8b">8b</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>London and the South East accounted for 1.25 million of the employments on furlough at 31 March 2021. Provisional estimates show this decreased in April when they accounted for 1.00 million of the employments on furlough at 30 April 2021</li>
  <li>the East Midlands and West Midlands had a total of 607,800 employments on furlough at 31 March 2021, decreasing in April with 485,800 at 30 April 2021</li>
  <li>at 31 March 2021, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland combined had 598,900 employments claimed for under <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>. Provisional estimates for 30 April 2021 show a decrease of 107,300 to 491,600 employments on furlough</li>

<h2>Region and sector at 30 April 2021</h2>

<p>Tables 17 and 18 in the accompanying spreadsheet show the number of employments on furlough by local authority and region by sector at 31 March and provisional estimates at 30 April 2021</p>

<p>The key points to note are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at 31 March 2021, across all countries and regions except for Northern Ireland, the accommodation and food services sector had the highest number of employments on furlough, followed by the wholesale and retail sector. In Northern Ireland the wholesale and retail sector had the highest number of employments on furlough 31 March, followed by accommodation and food services</li>
  <li>provisional estimates show that this remained true on 30 April 2021 except for Northern Ireland where the accommodation and food services sector now has the most employments on furlough</li>
  <li>in London, 26% of the employments on furlough were in the accommodation and food services sector on 31 March 2021. Provisional estimates show this was similar in April at 27% at 30 April 2021</li>
  <li>Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland combined had 155,290 employments on furlough in the accommodation and food services sector at 31 March 2021. Provisional estimates show this decreased to 138,490 at 30 April 2021</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The government announced the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (<abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>) on 20 March 2020. It was introduced to support employers through the COVID-19 period, this has commonly been referred to as the furlough scheme. It works by providing grants to employers of up to a maximum 80% of salary to a maximum value of £2,500 per employee (until the end of August).</p>

<p>Up to the end of July, the scheme also met some of the cost of employer pension contributions and employer National Insurance Contributions.</p>

<p>The scheme is based around <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) system. For an employer to qualify for the scheme they need to have created a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme by 19 March 2020. In these statistics, an employer is defined as a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme.</p>

<p>The rules for an employment to qualify to be covered by the scheme are set out in guidance, and two of the key rules are that the employee must have been employed on 19 March 2020 and the employer must have submitted a Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) submission to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> for the employee by this date.</p>

<p>Up to date information about the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme can be found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-for-wage-costs-through-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme" class="govuk-link">online</a>. The pages on applying for support, for example, include further details of the eligibility criteria. Older versions of the guidance can be found in the National Archive by following the links from the guidance pages.</p>

<h3>Changes to the scheme from 1 July 2020</h3>

<p>The scheme closed to new entrants from 30 June 2020. After this date, employers have only been able to furlough employees that were on furlough for a full three-week period prior to 30 June 2020.</p>

<p>As a consequence of the closure of the scheme to additional employees and the minimum three-week furlough period that applied until the end of June, the final date that an employer could have put an employee on furlough for the first time was 10 June 2020.</p>

<p>Employers had until 31 July 2020 to make any claims in respect of the period to 30 June 2020. A small number of claims have been made since this date. These claims relate to exceptions as set out in the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> guidance (for example, for employees being put on furlough who have been absent from work and who had been paid Statutory Maternity Pay).</p>

<p>From 1 July 2020, employers have had the flexibility to bring employees who are on furlough back to work part time. Additionally, employers have the flexibility to decide the hours and shift patterns of their employees – with the government continuing to pay 80% of salaries for the hours they do not work.</p>

<p>From 1 September 2020, the scheme supported 70% of salaries for hours not worked, reducing to 60% from 1 October 2020.</p>

<p>When claiming the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> grant for hours where the employee is on furlough, employers need to report and claim for a minimum period of a week. Employers had until 30 November 2020 to submit claims for support from the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Changes to the scheme from 1 November 2020</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> scheme was extended from 1 November 2020. The rules for an employment to qualify to be covered by the extended scheme are set out in guidance.</p>

<p>The two key rules are that the employee must have been employed on 30 October 2020, and the employer must have submitted a Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) submission to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> for the employee between 20 March 2020 and 30 October 2020, notifying a payment of earnings for that employee. This may differ where they have made employees redundant, or they stopped working for the employer on or after 23 September 2020 and have subsequently been re-employed.</p>

<p>For claim periods from 1 November to 30 April 2021, employers with a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme can claim 80% of an employee’s usual hours worked, up to a maximum of £2,500 per month. The £2,500 cap is proportional to the hours not worked.</p>

<h3>Changes to the scheme from 1 May 2021</h3>

<p>It was announced on 3 March 2021 that the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> would be extended further, beyond 30 April 2021 to 30 September 2021. To be eligible for furlough from the 1 May 2021 onwards, the employee must have been employed on 2 March 2021 and the employer must have submitted a Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) submission to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> for the employer between 20 March 2020 and 2 March 2021, notifying a payment of earnings for that employee.</p>

<p>For claim periods from 1 May to 30 June 2021, employers with a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme will be able to claim 80% of an employee’s usual hours worked, up to a maximum of £2,500 per month. The £2,500 cap is proportional to the hours not worked.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2021, the scheme supports 70% of salaries for hours not worked, reducing to 60% from 1 August 2021.</p>

<h2>Glossary</h2>

<p>An employer is defined within this release as a Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) Scheme. In some circumstances this does not map directly to what is commonly understood to be an employer. For example, some organisations operate multiple payrolls, and in other situations, a group of companies may pool their payrolls together under one <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme. However, in our view <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes provides a reasonable proxy for employers for the purposes of this release.</p>

<p>An employment is defined within this release as anyone who meets the scheme criteria set out within the published guidance. We have applied this definition in order to keep the presentation simple and the difficulty in separating out Office Holders (such as directors) from what are generally considered employees. Further information on the eligibility criteria is set out in the 
 <a href="#background" class="govuk-link">background section</a> section above.</p>

<h2>Measuring the data</h2>

<h3>Data source and collection</h3>

<p>The data for this release comes from HM Revenue and Customs’ <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims. It covers the whole population rather than a sample of people or companies, and it will allow for more detailed estimates of the population.</p>

<p>These statistics are classed as <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/guidetoexperimentalstatistics">Experimental Statistics</a> as they are still in development.</p>

<p>Additional data from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Real Time Information system has been matched with <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> data in order to produce the statistics released here.</p>

<h3>Coverage</h3>

<p>This publication covers all <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims made by employers from the start of the scheme up to 14 May 2021 for support for the wages of staff on furlough up to 30 April 2021. The data for April 2021 is incomplete as claims relating to April 2021 may still be filed and amended; thus, the figures for April 2021 should therefore be considered provisional results and will be revised in future releases.</p>

<h3>Methodology (except table 1)</h3>

<p>This section provides notes on the methodology and implications for interpreting the figures.</p>

<p>The statistics in this release count employments. Therefore (for example), an employee with jobs at two employers will be counted twice if both jobs are put on furlough.</p>

<p>The criteria for eligibility for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> were amended for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension.</p>

<p>For furlough from November 2020 onwards, the numbers of jobs presented as ‘eligible employments’ and used to calculate take-up figures reflect the criteria for eligibility for the extension to the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> scheme. They are based on a list of employees employed on 30 October 2020 and included in <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Real Time Information submissions for 20 March 2020 to 30 October 2020. Only employments in <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> submissions received by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> by 30 October are counted.</p>

<p>Following the criteria for qualifying for the scheme, this is supplemented by a list of people who were employed on 23 September 2020 but who left their job before 30 October and who were later re-employed by the same employer.</p>

<p>In this release employers are described as eligible to claim the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> if they employed staff for which the criteria to be eligible for furlough were met. Employers are grouped into size bands in some tables according to the number of employees they had who were eligible to be put on furlough under the extension to <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>.</p>

<p>In some circumstances <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> holds incomplete information about employments, for example where a leaving date had not been submitted by employer. In this situation, an estimate of the probability that an individual was employed on the qualifying dates has been used.</p>

<p>The statistic published on 6 May 2021 contained a downward revision to the number of employments eligible for <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension. This is due to a refinement in the methodology and results in a small increase in our estimates of the employer and employment take-up rates.</p>

<p>In the next <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> statistics release, which will cover claims received by 14 June, we will publish final figures for the number of people on furlough each month of <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension (to end-April). This will include take-up rates using the refined methodology for the eligible population. We will also publish revised figures for the eligible population for the original scheme with a future release of these statistics.</p>

<p>The assessment of whether a person was employed on the qualifying dates is based on the methodology used for the joint <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>/ONS statistics release, <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/earningsandemploymentfrompayasyouearnrealtimeinformationuk/may2021">Earnings and employment from Pay As You Earn Real Time Information</a>.</p>

<p>Employers making claims for 100 or more employees at a time are required to submit the details of the employees on furlough in a spreadsheet-type file. While these claims have been processed from a customer service perspective, the processing of this information for these statistics has been complex and the processing of data on some employments has not been completed. This is a factor behind the unknown category in the tables.</p>

<p>The completeness of this data has gradually improved since the first release, and we expect some further (smaller) improvements.</p>

<p>The geographic and flexible furlough breakdowns of employments include all employees that employers have put on furlough where it has been possible to link claim data on employments on furlough to classifying information (such as the employee’s gender and address). The linking has been performed using employees’ National Insurance numbers to data held within <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) system. When the employer-submitted National Insurance numbers are not of sufficient quality to be matched with other <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> data, the employments have been categorised as ‘unknown’.</p>

<p>The geographic breakdowns in the tables and maps use a postcode lookup file from Office for National Statistics (ONS) data to link UK postcodes to geographic areas.</p>

<p>Industrial sector information is based on the Interdepartmental Business Register (IDBR) produced by the ONS. Where <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes are absent from the IDBR, we have used sector information from Companies House, linking on employer name where possible. This provides Standard Industrial Classification codes (<a rel="external" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialclassificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007" class="govuk-link">UK <abbr title="Standard Industrial Classification">SIC 2007</abbr></a>) for employers that have made a claim. Where we have been unable to determine SIC codes, we have reported the sector as ‘unknown’.</p>

<p>The time series in this bulletin show figures for the number of employments on furlough each day, using all claims submitted to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> by 14 May 2021.</p>

<p>In producing the time series statistics some challenges had to be tackled. These included dealing with data on amendments to claims and claims for overlapping periods. In addition, claims where 100 or more staff are being put on furlough may include staff on furlough for varying periods. These factors combined with some incomplete data (as mentioned above) make counting the number of employees on furlough over time complex.</p>

<p>The method employed is designed to generally prevent overcounting employments and may in certain circumstances very slightly undercount. Consequently, for the period to the end of June, the time series presented in this bulletin may typically slightly undercount the number of employments on furlough.</p>

<p>Where an employer makes a claim for up to 99 jobs, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> collects the start and end date of the claim but does not collect specific separate furlough start and end dates for each job covered by the claim. For these jobs, we use the claim period to estimate when the jobs were on furlough. This works well for jobs on furlough for the whole period of affected claims. However, if a job was on furlough for 1 April to 11 April only, for example, due to this data limitation, it would appear to be on furlough for the full month in these statistics. During periods when the number of jobs on furlough is decreasing over time, this will lead to the number of jobs on furlough at the end of the month being somewhat overstated.</p>

<p>The figures for the number and value of claims do not take account of voluntary repayments nor remove claims not paid for compliance reasons. Claims cancelled by employers within 72 hours of making the claim are excluded.</p>

<h3>Methodology (cumulative figures - table 1)</h3>

<p>The methodology used for the figure for the cumulative number of jobs ever on furlough since the start of the scheme (table 1 above and tables 1, 1a, 1b in the spreadsheet accompanying this release) has been improved. For figures up to 13 December 2020, the method used was based on the figures for the total number of jobs on furlough on each claim. This choice had to be made because at the time the job-level information available for statistical purposes was incomplete for larger claims.</p>

<p>Over time – and particularly with the introduction of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension – the previous method had started to undercount the total number of jobs put on furlough.</p>

<p>The original method took the total number of jobs on furlough from all the claims made by each <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme. It then found the maximum number of jobs put on furlough for each employer across all their claims. Finally, it summed these values for all <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes to arrive at a total number of employees ever on furlough.</p>

<p>The new approach uses job-level data. For this, we calculate the number of unique National Insurance numbers in the claims made by each employer, and then sum these. This information is supplemented by the employee’s name and payroll number in a small number of cases.</p>

<p>The cumulative number of employers making <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims is calculated as the number of distinct <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes that have submitted a claim since the start of the scheme. The cumulative value of claims made is calculated as the sum of the amount claimed for each submitted claim.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of flexible furlough employers have been able to cancel claims made on the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims portal within 72 hours of making a claim. From the figures dated 15 February 2021 onwards, claims cancelled in this way have been excluded.</p>

<p>The figures for the number and value of claims do not take account of voluntary repayments nor remove claims not paid for compliance reasons. Claims cancelled by employers within 72 hours of making the claim are excluded.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> separately publishes figures for the value of claims paid to employers, in its monthly publication on tax receipts. Those figures are on a cash basis and reflect the time that the payments were made rather than the date that claims were received, so are slightly different to the figures included in this release.</p>

<h3>Rounding of figures in the tables accompanying this release</h3>

<p>Rounding has been applied to the figures in the tables accompanying this release, with counts rounded to the nearest 10 for Tables 17 and 18 Local Authority by sector, and to the nearest 100 for all other tables, amounts are rounded to the nearest million.</p>

<h2>Strengths and limitations</h2>

<p>HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) grants pre-release access to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/about-the-authority/what-we-do/uk-statistical-system/types-of-official-statistics/" rel="external">Official Statistics</a> publications, and in accordance with the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> policy, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hmrc-statistics-pre-release-access-list" class="govuk-link">pre-release access has been granted to a number of people</a> to enable the preparation of a ministerial briefing.

<h3>Experimental Statistics status</h3>

<p>The release is classed as Experimental Statistics as the methodologies used to produce the statistics are still in their development phase. This does not mean that the statistics are of low quality, but it does signify that the statistics are new and still being developed. As the methodologies are refined and improved, there may be revisions to these statistics.</p>

<p>Rather than waiting until the development work has been completed, the statistics are being published now to involve potential users in developing the statistics. We hope that this encourages users to provide us with their thoughts and suggestions of how useful the statistics are and what can be done to improve them. Comments can be sent by email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:CJRS.Statistics.Enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk"><abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>.Statistics.Enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>More information about what it means for Official Statistics to be classified as Experimental Statistics is available from the <a rel="external" href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/experimental-statistics-official-statistics-in-development" class="govuk-link">Office for Statistics Regulation</a>.</p>

<h3>Office for Statistics regulation review</h3>

<p>These statistics have been produced quickly in response to developing world events. The Office for Statistics Regulation, on behalf of the UK Statistics Authority, has reviewed them against several key aspects of the Code of Practice for Statistics and regards them as consistent with the Code’s pillars of Trustworthiness, Quality and Value.</p>

<h3>Strengths of the data</h3>

<p>The data used in this release includes all claims made by employers up until 14 May 2021 for support for the wages of staff on furlough up to 30 April 2021, rather than a sample. We have linked <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> data to Pay As You Earn Real Time Information data (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) to provide the additional information presented in this release.</p>

<h3>Revisions</h3>

<p>In future iterations of this statistics release there may be some further revisions reflecting improvements to the data processing and methodology.</p>

<p>The figures in this release incorporate data on claims received by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> up to 14 May 2021 and cover employments on furlough up to 30 April 2021. The data for April 2021 is incomplete as late claims for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension may still be filed with reasonable excuse and <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> agreement. Amendments to April 2021 claims may be made until 28 May 2021.</p>

<p>Based on figures for March it is expected that these factors will result in an increase in the level of jobs on furlough reported for April 2021 of about 3%. Thus, the figures for April 2021 should therefore be considered provisional results and are likely to be revised slightly upwards in a future release.</p>
