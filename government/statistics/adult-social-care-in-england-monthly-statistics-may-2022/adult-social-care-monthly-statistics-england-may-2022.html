<h2>Main points</h2>

<h3>COVID-19 testing in care homes</h3>

<p>ln the week ending 26 April 2022:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there were 7,136 positive lateral flow test results among staff which is substantially lower than the number of positive tests recorded at the end of March (20,189)</li>
  <li>there were 1,610 positive test results among residents, which is substantially lower than the number recorded in the first week of April 2022 (3,907)</li>
</ul>

<p>The number of positive tests returned from both lateral flow devices and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests decreased for both staff and residents during April 2022, following a period of increase in March 2022. The overall number of tests conducted also decreased since the last week of March 2022.These trends are influenced by the changes to testing guidance in care homes which came into place on 4 April 2022.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 vaccination in social care settings</h3>

<p>As of week ending 26 April 2022, the proportions who had received a first booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>90.2% of total residents and 53.9% of total staff of older adult care homes</li>
  <li>81.5% of total residents of younger adult care homes</li>
  <li>50.3% of total staff of younger adult care homes and 46.2% of total domiciliary care staff</li>
</ul>

<h3>Visiting in care homes</h3>

<p>In the week ending 27 April 2022:</p>

<ul>
  <li>91.6% of care homes in England were able to accommodate residents receiving visitors. This figure has broadly increased since the end of January 2022, despite a slight decrease at the end of March 2022</li>
</ul>

<h3>Staff absences due to COVID-19</h3>

<p>In the week ending 26 April 2022:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1.1% of care homes staff and 1.5% of domiciliary care staff were absent due to COVID-19 related reasons</li>
</ul>

<p>These proportions have been increasing since early April 2022, following a period of increase throughout March 2022.</p>

<h2>Publication updates</h2>

<h3>Updates on this month’s report</h3>

<p>On 31 March 2022, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> published new infection prevention and control guidance on managing specific infections and a guidance supplement that sets out how to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in adult social care settings in England, effective from 4 April 2022.</p>

<p>In light of this new guidance and the end of the Adult Social Care Infection Control and Testing Fund (<abbr title="Infection Control and Testing Fund">ICTF</abbr>) on 31 March 2022, the department is reviewing the data items collected from providers by Capacity Tracker.</p>

<p>The Adult Social Care <abbr title="Infection Control and Testing Fund">ICTF</abbr> was first introduced in May 2020, to support adult social care providers in England to reduce the rate of COVID-19 transmission.  It was extended in September 2021 until the end of March 2022. During this period, providers received funds to spend on infection prevention and control measures such as, for example, ensuring that staff who are isolating receive their normal wages and limiting staff movement between settings.</p>

<p>Since 31 March 2022, the government no longer provides funding for COVID-19 positive social care staff to stay away from work and the staff movement restrictions were lifted, allowing pressure on the workforce to be alleviated. As a result, the data collection on staff pay and staff movement ceased on 4 April 2022, and the commentary in this bulletin no longer covers these 2 metrics.  However, the full timeseries (up to 29 March 2022) is presented in Tables 2 and 3 of the accompanying tables ‘Infection control, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and workforce statistics, May 2022: data tables’ on the ASC monthly statistics page. These 2 tables will be removed from June 2022 onwards, but historical data will still be available in prior editions of this publication.</p>

<p>The bulletin structure has been adapted to reflect these changes. Section 5 on Infection prevention control measures now covers visiting in care homes and <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and Section 6 on Adult Social Care Workforce covers staffing levels and staff absences.</p>

<p>In addition, as the seasonal flu vaccination campaign ended, the data collection on flu vaccination ceased on 4 April 2022. Flu vaccination statistics are no longer covered in the commentary of this bulletin but the full timeseries (up to 29 March 2022) is presented in the accompanying ‘Flu vaccination statistics, May 2022: data tables’ on the ASC monthly statistics page. These tables will be removed from June 2022 onwards, but historical data will still be available in prior editions of this publication.</p>

<h3>Updates on future reports</h3>

<p>The next publication will be published on 9 June 2022. Dates for future publications will be pre-announced on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/search/research-and-statistics?content_store_document_type=upcoming_statistics">GOV.UK publication release calendar</a>.</p>

<p>Since 4 April 2022, providers are asked to record spring booster vaccinations in Capacity Tracker. Data on spring booster uptake will be published in future reports.</p>

<p>From June 2022 onwards, this publication will no longer present data on staff pay, staff movement and flu vaccination, but historical data will still be available in prior editions of this publication.</p>

<p>The Capacity Tracker review is still underway, therefore further changes to this publication are likely in future reports.</p>

<p>More information on the adult social care COVID-19 data collection tool can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-in-england-statistics-england-methodology">background quality and methodology note</a>.</p>

<h2>COVID-19 vaccination in adult social care settings</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>How the data can be used</h3>

<p>These data can be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>comparing vaccination rates across local authorities and regions in England as self-reported by care providers for the first, second and booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccine</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>monitoring vaccination rates over time for the first, second and booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccine</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These data cannot be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>estimating the number of social care staff or residents who have not been vaccinated</li>
  <li>estimating the number of social care staff or residents who have been vaccinated abroad</li>
  <li>comparing with vaccination rates in other countries of the UK</li>
  <li>directly comparing vaccination take up rates between different types of care home staff (directly employed and agency staff)</li>
  <li>estimating the number of vaccinations delivered each day</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Restrictions on data collection do not allow us to identify eligibility for a booster based on the recommended gap between second dose and first booster dose.  Hence booster rates are not adjusted by eligibility.</p>

<p>The total number of staff and residents for each social care setting as well as the number reported to be vaccinated for COVID-19 are self-reported by the care provider and local authorities. As a result, the rates in this publication refer to the percentage of staff and residents reported to be vaccinated by care providers. This means that the number of individuals who have not received the vaccine cannot be directly derived from the data published in these statistics as the vaccination status of some individuals may be unknown to the care provider.</p>

<p>The dates in this section refer to the dates on which vaccinations were reported by care providers rather than the dates on which vaccinations were administered.</p>

<p>Some care providers have reported the total number of staff or residents but not the numbers vaccinated. As a result of this, vaccination rates are affected by response rates. This is particularly prominent for vaccination rates for second doses in staff employed in other settings and first boosters for all staff and resident groups. This is because these groups have a lower response rate and as a result, second dose vaccination rates may be underestimated.</p>

<p>For data relating to 9 November 2021 and before, response rates may have been underestimated, particularly for first boosters vaccination. This is because the default value in the underlying data is set to zero, so any zero values submitted will appear to be non-responses. From 9 November 2021 onwards, care providers are required to select that they have reviewed their responses to confirm the data submitted is accurate, therefore increasing the accuracy of response rates.</p>

<p>Among care home staff, there is a substantial difference in reported vaccination rates for COVID-19 vaccinations between staff directly employed by care homes and staff employed by agencies operating within care homes. This could be due to, for example but not exclusively, different uptake rates, vaccination status not being known to the care provider, or the nature of employment and information available to the care homes.</p>

<p>For data relating to 31 August 2021 onwards, a small number of social care staff who had their vaccination outside of the UK are excluded from the numbers vaccinated.</p>

<p>For more information, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-in-england-statistics-england-methodology">background quality and methodology note</a>.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 vaccinations</h3>

<p>The NHS started administering vaccinations for COVID-19 in England on 8 December 2020. Social care staff and residents of care homes were prioritised for the vaccine according to the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>) recommendation. For more information see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/priority-groups-for-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccination-advice-from-the-jcvi-30-december-2020">Priority groups for coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination: advice from the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>From 11 November 2021, all people working or volunteering in care homes were required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, unless exempt. As Omicron, which is intrinsically less severe, replaced Delta as the dominant variant, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> consulted on revoking this requirement. Over 90,000 responses were received and 90% supported the removal of vaccination as a condition of deployment. Following the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/revoking-vaccination-as-a-condition-of-deployment-across-all-health-and-social-care">publication of this consultation</a>, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care announced in a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2022-03-01/hcws654" rel="external">written ministerial statement</a> the revocation of the legislation to take effect from 15 March 2022.</p>

<p>Although it is no longer a legal requirement for staff in adult social care to be vaccinated to be deployed, adult social care staff and residents are still encouraged to get their COVID-19 booster vaccination after receiving their second dose.</p>

<p>More details can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccination-booster-dose-resources/covid-19-vaccination-a-guide-to-booster-vaccination">COVID-19 vaccination: a guide to booster vaccination</a>.</p>

<p>On 21 February 2022, the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> issued advice on an additional COVID-19 spring booster dose, around 6 months after the last vaccine dose, for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>adults aged 75 years and over</li>
  <li>residents in a care home for older adults</li>
  <li>individuals aged 12 years and over who are immunosuppressed, as defined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-the-green-book-chapter-14a">COVID 19 healthcare guidance Green Book</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The spring booster programme began on Monday 21 March 2022. Invitations are being sent to eligible people and visits offered to older adult care homes by local NHS teams.</p>

<p>Since 4 April 2022, providers are asked to record spring booster vaccinations in the Capacity Tracker. Data on spring boosters will be published in future reports. This report only presents data on first booster doses, which were introduced in autumn 2021.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 vaccinations in older adult care homes</h3>

<p>99.4% of older adult care homes have provided data on the number of staff and residents who received a first COVID-19 booster dose, as of week ending 26 April 2022. This means the first and second dose rates, and the number of staff and residents receiving a first booster dose may be underestimated compared with the true value.</p>

<p>For full response rates, see the accompanying ‘COVID-19 vaccination response rates, May 2022: data tables’ on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/adult-social-care-in-england-monthly-statistics-May-2022">ASC monthly statistics page</a>.</p>

<h4>Residents of older adult care homes</h4>

<p>As of week ending 26 April 2022, in older adult care homes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>95.3% of residents have been reported to have received 2 doses</li>
  <li>90.2% of residents have been reported to have received their first booster dose</li>
</ul>

<p>First booster vaccination rates increased steeply between mid-October 2021 and January 2022 and have stabilised since the end of January 2022.</p>

<p>There is some variation in reported first booster doses administered regionally, with the East of England region having the largest uptake with 91.9% of residents vaccinated, compared with the lowest uptake in London with 87.5%.</p>

<h4>Staff of older adult care homes</h4>

<p>As of week ending 26 April 2022, in older adult care homes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>94.6% of staff have been reported to have received 2 doses</li>
  <li>53.9% of staff have been reported to have received their first booster dose</li>
</ul>

<p>Reported booster vaccination rates have stabilised in April following a continued period of increase between January and March. There is large regional variation in rates, with the North East having the highest uptake with 60.2%, and London having the lowest at 43.0%.</p>

<p>Vaccination as a condition of deployment (VCOD) required individuals to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 with a primary course (2 doses). Boosters were not required in order to comply with the regulations, but all staff were and continue to be encouraged to take up their offer of a booster dose.</p>

<p>Data from figures 1 and 2 can be found in tables 1 and 2 of the accompanying ‘COVID-19 vaccination statistics, May 2022: data tables’ on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/adult-social-care-in-england-monthly-statistics-May-2022">ASC monthly statistics page</a>, in addition to data by region and local authority.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>data is reported by care providers</li>
  <li>data is based on date of reporting rather than date of vaccination</li>
</ul>

<h3>COVID-19 vaccinations in staff working in domiciliary care, younger adult care homes and other settings</h3>

<p>Data for staff working in other settings (including non-registered providers and local authority employed) after August 2021 does not include Surrey as this data is no longer collected by the local authority.</p>

<p>The following proportions of social care staff have been reported to have received their COVID-19 vaccination doses:</p>

<p>In younger adult care homes as of week ending 26 April 2022:</p>

<ul>
  <li>94.2% of staff have been reported to have received 2 doses</li>
  <li>50.3% of staff have been reported to have received their first booster dose</li>
</ul>

<p>For domiciliary care staff as of week ending 26 April 2022:</p>

<ul>
  <li>85.1% of staff have been reported to have received 2 doses</li>
  <li>46.2% of staff have been reported to have received their first booster dose</li>
</ul>

<p>Among staff working in other settings as of week ending 27 April 2022:</p>

<ul>
  <li>34.7% of staff have been reported to have received 2 doses</li>
  <li>4.9% of staff have been reported to have received their first booster dose</li>
</ul>

<p>As data is self-reported by care providers, COVID-19 vaccination rates are affected by response rates. An overview of response rates is in the table below.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 vaccinations for residents of younger adult care homes</h3>

<p>Residents of younger adult care homes were not part of a single priority group for the COVID-19 vaccine. However, the conditions for which they reside in care homes are likely to make them more vulnerable to COVID-19 and they were therefore likely to be part of priority groups 3 to 9. First booster dose roll out, however, is dependent on the recommended time gap between second dose and booster dose rather than specific priority groups.</p>

<p>As of week ending 26 April 2022, in younger adult care homes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>92.3% of residents have been reported to have received 2 doses</li>
  <li>81.5% of residents have been reported to have received their first booster dose</li>
</ul>

<h2>Infection prevention control measures</h2>

<p>Until 31 March 2022, the Adult Social Care Infection Control and Testing Fund provided funding from local authorities to ensure that infection prevention control (<abbr title="infection prevention control">IPC</abbr>) measures were in place to curb the spread of COVID-19, including limitation of staff movement across different social care settings, payment of full wages when care home staff were isolating due to COVID-19 and accommodating COVID-19 safe visitation in care homes in line with government guidance.</p>

<p>On 31 March 2022, the Adult Social Care Infection Control Fund reached the end of its extension period. The end of the fund means that since 4 April 2022, among other implications, the government no longer provides funding for COVID-positive social care staff to stay away from work and staff movement restrictions have been lifted, allowing pressure on workforce to be alleviated. Restrictions on care home visiting have also been lifted.</p>

<p>As a result, among other data collected about infection prevention control measures, the data on staff pay and staff movement ceased to be collected since 4 April 2022 and therefore the last data point in the timeseries for these 2 metrics is 29 March 2022. This bulletin no longer covers these 2 metrics, however,  the end of the timeseries is presented in table 2 and 3 of the accompanying ‘Infection control, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and workforce statistics, May 2022: data tables’ on the ASC monthly statistics page. These tables will be removed from June 2022 onwards, but historical data will still be available to users.</p>

<p>The question on COVID-safe visitation in care homes is still included in the data collection and in this publication, but might be modified in upcoming weeks, as part of the data collection tool review.</p>

<p>More details on the data collection, coverage and quality of this data can be found in the ‘About this data’ section below.</p>

<h3>Accommodating COVID-safe visitation in care homes</h3>

<h4>Background information</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>How the data can be used</h4>

<p>This data can be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>estimating the number and proportion of care homes that indicate they are accommodating COVID-safe visits within the care homes in line with government guidance</li>
  <li>monitoring trends over time</li>
  <li>comparisons across local authorities and regions in England</li>
</ul>

<p>This data cannot be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>estimating the number of visitors in care homes and their infection or vaccination status</li>
  <li>comparing with other countries of the UK</li>
  <li>linking staff movement across settings to positivity rates</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h4>Visiting guidance and data trends</h4>

<p>There are currently no restrictions on visiting in care homes under normal circumstances. However, during periods of outbreak or when a resident is COVID-positive, visits inside a care home should be limited to one named visitor only. From 4 April 2022, visitors are no longer required to test before the visit, unless they are providing personal care.</p>

<p>The guidance on allowing care home residents to have visitors has changed since December 2020 and is summarised in the table below.</p>

<p>In the week ending 27 April 2022:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>91.6% of care homes in England were able to accommodate residents receiving visitors within care homes in all circumstances. This proportion has broadly increased since the end of January 2022. It decreased slightly, temporarily, in March 2022, before increasing again throughout April 2022</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a further 4.3% were able to accommodate visits in exceptional circumstances, which is a decrease compared to the week ending 6 April 2022. This figure has broadly declined since mid-January 2022, with the exception of a slight increase at the end of March 2022. Exceptional circumstances are individually defined by each care home but are generally thought to be considered when residents are palliative</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is some variation across regions, with 93.9% of care homes accommodated visiting in the South East compared to 87.2% in the East Midlands in the week ending 27 April 2022</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> availability in care settings</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>How the data can be used</h4>

<p>This data can be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>estimating the number and proportion of care homes and domiciliary care providers who are experiencing PPE shortages in the next 48 hours, and comparing across local authorities and regions in England</li>
  <li>monitoring trends over time</li>
</ul>

<p>This data cannot be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>predicting PPE shortages in the coming weeks</li>
  <li>comparing with other countries of the UK</li>
  <li>linking PPE shortage to positivity rates</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>All care homes and domiciliary care providers are responsible for ensuring safe systems of work and have duties concerning the provision and use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in the workplace.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infection-prevention-and-control-in-adult-social-care-covid-19-supplement">COVID-19 supplement</a>, which accompanies the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infection-prevention-and-control-in-adult-social-care-settings">Infection prevention and control in adult social care settings</a>, sets out the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> recommendations for adult social care services in England. The government will continue to provide free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to the adult social care sector until the end of March 2023, or until guidance is withdrawn or substantially amended.</p>

<p>This publication covers the availability of the following 5 items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>aprons</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>eye protection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>gloves</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hand sanitiser</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>face masks</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>In care homes</h4>

<p>In the week ending 26 April 2022, 0.2% of care homes in England had either no supply or were expecting to experience a shortage in the next 48 hours of at least one item of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. This gradually decreased from late September 2020 when 1.1% of care homes were experiencing a shortage and has remained relatively unchanged since March 2021.</p>

<h4>In domiciliary care</h4>

<p>In the week ending 26 April 2022, 1.0% of domiciliary care providers in England, excluding London, reported having no supply or were expecting to experience a shortage in the next 48 hours of at least one item of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. This proportion has gradually decreased since July 2021.</p>

<p>This figure does not include figures from local authorities in the London region and therefore is not a complete picture of the national situation. This is due to incomparable data across London and other regions. For a number of providers in London, responses are collected via the London Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (<abbr title="Association of Directors of Adult Social Services">ADASS</abbr>) before being uploaded to Capacity Tracker in bulk. Due to differences in the interpretation of the wording of the questions asked by <abbr title="Association of Directors of Adult Social Services">ADASS</abbr> about specific items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> stock, the data collected via this channel is not comparable to the data collected directly via Capacity Tracker. Work is currently being done to harmonise the data across regions.</p>

<p>Local figures for the London region and London local authorities have therefore been suppressed from the data tables. Data for other regions and local authorities outside of London can be found in table 8 of the accompanying ‘Infection control, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and workforce statistics, May 2022: data tables’ on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/adult-social-care-in-england-monthly-statistics-may-2022">ASC monthly statistics page</a>.</p>

<p>This publication only presents figures from the week ending 6 July 2021, when the wording of the question in the collection tool was changed, which resulted in the incomparability of the data between London and other regions. Data prior to July 2021 can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/monthly-statistics-for-adult-social-care-england">previous editions of the publication</a>. The last edition to present data prior to July 2021 is the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/adult-social-care-in-england-monthly-statistics-march-2022">Adult social care in England, monthly statistics: March 2022</a>.</p>

<h2>Adult social care workforce</h2>

<h3>Care home staffing levels</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>How the data can be used</h3>

<p>This data can be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>estimating the number and proportion of care homes that indicate they are operating within their agreed staffing ratios</li>
  <li>monitoring trends over time</li>
  <li>comparisons across local authorities and regions in England</li>
</ul>

<p>This data cannot be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifying the reasons for care home staff shortages and absences</li>
  <li>linking staff shortages and the number of positive cases among care home staff</li>
  <li>comparing with other countries of the UK</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>In order to measure the workforce pressures on providers during the pandemic, each provider is asked to assess their workforce pressures based on their agreed staffing ratios. More details on how staffing ratios are agreed can be found within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/guidance-providers/regulations-enforcement/regulation-18-staffing#guidance" rel="external"><abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> guidance on staffing</a>.</p>

<p>An additional <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/adult-social-care-workforce-survey-december-2021">adult social care workforce report</a> providing more information on the pressures faced by the adult social care workforce, received through an ad hoc survey, was published as part of this collection on 17 December 2021. The survey covers more detailed insight into current workforce pressures faced compared to 6 months previously. This includes issues relating to recruitment, retention, staff morale and use of agency staff.</p>

<p>This survey complements the regular collection by providing the opportunity to have a deeper exploration of workforce issues which is possible in an ad hoc survey but would be too burdensome for the regular collection.</p>

<p>In the week ending 26 April 2022:</p>

<ul>
  <li>0.5% of providers flagged that their agreed staffing ratios had been breached. This has decreased slightly since the week ending 29 March 2022, when it reached 0.7%. Since January 2022, when it reached a peak of 0.8%, this proportion has fluctuated between 0.7% and 0.5%.  The proportion of providers flagging a breach of their staffing ratios has consistently remained lower than 1% since the start of the timeseries in December 2020</li>
  <li>5.3% flagged that they were operating within the agreed staffing ratios but there is a significant risk of escalation in the coming days. This proportion has been decreasing throughout April 2022, following a period of increase in March 2022. This figure reached a peak of 6.7% in the week ending 11 January 2022 but has remained below this level since.</li>
  <li>94.2% were operating within their agreed staffing ratios, which is an increase compared the start of April 2022. This proportion had reached its lowest point of 92.5% in the week ending 11 January 2022</li>
</ul>

<p>If a care home’s staffing ratio has been breached, then business continuity measures may be put in place.</p>

<h4>Figure 5: percentage of care homes operating within agreed staffing ratios, week ending 26 April 2022, England</h4>

<p>More than 9 in 10 care homes report operating within their agreed staffing ratios.</p>

<h3>Staff absence rates</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>How the data can be used</h3>

<p>This data can be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>estimating the number and percentage of staff absent because of COVID-19 related reasons</li>
  <li>monitoring trends over time</li>
  <li>comparisons across local authorities and regions in England</li>
</ul>

<p>This data cannot be used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>as a sole indicator of all workforce pressures faced by the social care sector, since they only cover COVID-19 related absence</li>
  <li>to directly compare absence rates related to COVID-19 between domiciliary care and care home staff</li>
  <li>for comparing with other countries of the UK</li>
  <li>for linking COVID-19 related absence rates with test positivity rates</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Absence rates related to COVID-19 are calculated using the reported number of staff employed and the reported number of staff out of work that day because of COVID-19 related reasons. Both the number of total staff employed, and the number of staff absent might be affected by provider response rates as only numbers reported by providers in the last 7 days are included in the total counts.</p>

<p>Absence data started to be reported by care providers in Capacity Tracker from December 2020. However, low response rates in the first few months of collection mean that the workforce data is incomplete, which affects the accuracy of the absence data during that period.</p>

<p>Providers who are the least likely to respond are likely to be those experiencing the most pressures on delivery due to high levels of staff absence. For this reason, data from December 2020 to the start of February 2021 for care homes, and from December 2020 to the start of March 2021 for domiciliary care providers, are not presented in this publication.</p>

<p>COVID-19 related absences cannot be directly linked to staff test positivity rates. This is because absences related to COVID-19 can cover a wide range of reasons, including but not restricted to staff:</p>

<ul>
  <li>testing positive to COVID-19</li>
  <li>self-isolating</li>
  <li>caring for someone who has tested positive to COVID-19</li>
  <li>suffering from illness related to COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-in-england-statistics-england-methodology/adult-social-care-monthly-statistics-england-methodology">background quality and methodology note</a>.</p>

<p>Absence rate statistics presented in this section were added for the first time in February 2022, following growing general interest in workforce pressures from various sources. They complement the statistics on staffing ratios presented in the previous section.</p>

<p>The staffing ratios statistics have not presented substantial variation over the past year, with the exception of the last few months. In the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/adult-social-care-workforce-survey-december-2021">adult social care workforce survey published in December 2021</a>, however, care providers have reported facing pressures on staffing levels. This suggests that the staffing ratio statistics may not accurately illustrate these workforce pressures.</p>

<p>COVID-19 related absence rate statistics alone are still not sufficient to give a full picture of workforce pressures faced by the sector, however they may provide more insight on some of the challenges. Additional statistics, such as general absences, retention or recruitment could provide a more complete picture.</p>

<h4>In care homes</h4>

<p>Data on care home staff absences related to COVID-19 is available from 9 February 2021.</p>

<p>In the week ending 26 April 2022, 1.1% of care home staff were absent because of COVID-19 related reasons. Absence rates decreased throughout April 2022, following a period of increase in March 2022. Care home staff absences related to COVID-19 reached a peak of 2.9% in the week ending 11 January 2022, and has remained below this level since.</p>

<p>Variation across regions increased throughout March 2022 but decreased again in April 2022. In the week ending 26 April, 1.3% of staff were absent because of COVID-19 related reasons in the South West, compared with 1.0% in the South East, East of England and East Midlands. Since January 2022, care home staff COVID-19 related absence rates in London have remained consistently and substantially lower than in other regions. In the week ending 26 April 2022, 0.4% of care home staff were absent because of COVID-19 related reasons in London.</p>

<p>The data suggests that the size of the care home workforce has been gradually declining since April 2021. This may however be partly driven by a change in response rates over the period. A reduction in the care home workforce size is another indication of pressures faced by the sector to deliver care.</p>

<p>Data on workforce counts and response rates can be found in tables 5 and 10, respectively, of the accompanying ‘Infection control, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and workforce statistics, May 2022: data tables’ on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/adult-social-care-in-england-monthly-statistics-may-2022">ASC monthly statistics page</a>,</p>

<p>More information about other sources of adult social care workforce data can be found in ‘Other sources of adult social care COVID-19 data’ (in the ‘About this data’ section below).</p>

<h4>In domiciliary care</h4>

<p>Data on domiciliary care staff COVID-19 related absences is available from 2 March 2021. Absence rates in domiciliary care settings are not directly comparable with those in residential care homes.</p>

<p>Domiciliary staff COVID-19 absence rates have decreased since late March 2022, reaching 1.5% in the week ending 26 April 2022. This follows a short period of increase throughout March 2022. This figure reached a peak of 4.8% in week ending 4 January 2022, which was the highest level seen since the start of the timeseries in March 2021 but has remained below that level since. Domiciliary care staff COVID-19 related rates are now reaching towards levels seen before the January 2022 peak.</p>

<p>There has been some variation across regions, throughout the timeseries, especially during periods of high absences. Variation across regions increased in March 2022, before decreasing again throughout April 2022. In the week ending 26 April 2022, 1.5% of domiciliary care staff were absent due to COVID-19 related reasons in the North East, compared with 1.1% in the North West and in the East Midlands.</p>

<p>London has consistently been an outlier and shown substantially higher COVID-19 related absence rates compared with other regions. This could however partly be explained by consistently and substantially lower response rates in the London region, compared to other regions.</p>

<p>Similarly to care homes, the data suggests that the domiciliary care workforce size has been gradually declining during the last year. This may however be partly driven by a change in response rates over the period.</p>

<p>Data on workforce counts and response rates can be found in tables 6 and 12 of the accompanying ‘Infection control, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and workforce statistics, May 2022: data tables’ on the ASC monthly statistics page.</p>

<p>More information about other sources of adult social care workforce data can be found in ‘Other sources of adult social care COVID-19 data’ (in the ‘About this data’ section below).</p>

<h3>How the data can be used</h3>

<p>This data can be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>estimating the number of PCR and rapid lateral flow tests taken and positive results returned in care homes, and comparing across local authorities and regions in England</li>
  <li>estimating trends in prevalence and positivity rates for COVID-19 in care homes based on trends in positive tests</li>
</ul>

<p>This data cannot be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>calculating positivity rates for COVID-19 in care homes due to routine and repeat testing of individuals</li>
  <li>linking positivity rates in care homes to lower vaccination rates in care homes</li>
  <li>estimating the number of people tested and positive cases in care homes as people can take more than one test</li>

</ul>

<h3>Number of tests conducted and positive tests returned in adult care homes</h3>
<p>The number of positive rapid lateral flow tests returned for both care home residents and staff decreased throughout April 2022. This decrease follows a previous period of increase seen throughout March 2022. The number of positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests also decreased this month, for both residents and staff.</p>

<p>The overall number of tests conducted in care homes decreased throughout April. Recent changes to testing guidance in care homes have affected the number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and rapid lateral flow tests conducted among staff and residents. An overview of the changes to the testing guidance in care homes since June 2022 is presented in table 4 below.</p>

<p>From 4 April 2022 the requirement of care home staff to complete pre-shift rapid lateral flow tests is replaced by twice weekly rapid lateral flow tests, and asymptomatic testing for residents is removed. Additionally, symptomatic testing is now done with rapid lateral flow tests instead of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infection-prevention-and-control-in-adult-social-care-covid-19-supplement/summary-of-changes-to-covid-19-guidance-for-adult-social-care-providers">summary of changes to testing and other <abbr title="infection prevention control">IPC</abbr> measures</a>.

<h3>Care home staff</h3>

<h4>Rapid lateral flow tests</h4>

<p>In the week ending 26 April 2022, there were 7,136 positive tests returned from rapid lateral flow test kits in care home staff. This number decreased throughout April 2022 following a period of rapid increase seen throughout March 2022.</p>

<p>The number of rapid lateral flow tests conducted in care home staff, which includes positive, negative and void tests, decreased throughout April 2022 with 465,938 in the week ending 26 April 2022, compared to 692,388 at the start of the month. This decrease follows a period of slight increase between early and mid-March 2022.</p>

<p>The decrease in the overall number of tests completed throughout April 2022 was influenced by the change in testing guidance which came into place on 4 April 2022 and reduced the number of occurrences when staff are required to take an asymptomatic test. From 4 April 2022, care home staff are required to complete rapid lateral flow tests twice a week, instead of one before each shift.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests</h4>

<p>The overall number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted – including positive, negative and void tests – in care home staff decreased throughout April 2022. This decrease is in line with the implementation of new testing guidance on 4 April 2022 which requires symptomatic staff to take rapid lateral flow tests instead of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests. Since this guidance change, the number of tests conducted almost halved, with 42,095 tests conducted in the week ending 26 April 2022. The lowest number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test conducted since the timeseries began was recorded in the week ending 19 April 2022, with 41,415 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted during that week.</p>

<p>Despite this general decrease, there was a slight increase in the number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted among care home staff in the last week.</p>

<p>Due to the recent changes in testing guidance for care home staff, <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test results are now less relevant than rapid lateral flow test results in measuring COVID-19 prevalence in care homes.</p>

<h3>Care home residents</h3>

<p>The testing regime for staff is more frequent than for residents. As a result, the total number of staff tests is higher than the total number of resident tests. For more information, see the ‘About this data’ section.</p>

<h4>Rapid lateral flow tests</h4>

<p>In the week ending 26 April 2022, there were 1,610 positive tests returned from rapid lateral flow test kits in care home residents. The number of positive rapid lateral flow tests returned during April 2022 decreased substantially, with figures less than half those recorded at the start of the month. This recent decrease follows a previous period of increase seen throughout March 2022.</p>

<p>The overall number of rapid lateral flow tests conducted in care home residents, which includes positive, negative and void tests, also decreased throughout April 2022 following a period of increase in March. In the week ending 26 April 2022 there were 18,212 tests conducted, which is almost half those recorded at the start of the month.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests</h4>

<p>The number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted – including positive, negative and void tests – in care home residents also decreased throughout April 2022, following a period of increase in March 2022.</p>

<p>On 4 April 2022, asymptomatic testing for care home residents was removed. This means residents are only required to take <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests in the event of an outbreak, prior to discharge from hospital or on new admissions to a care home. This change in guidance has impacted the figures in this publication, contributing to the decrease in the number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted throughout April 2022.</p>

<h4>Figure 7: number of tests conducted in care home staff and residents, 2 September 2020 to 26 April 2022, England</h4>

<p>The number of tests conducted among staff and residents has decreased throughout April 2022 for both rapid lateral flows and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests, following a change in guidance at the start of April 2022.</p>

<p>Note: the dotted lines in this chart represent the implementation of the 4 most recent changes in care home testing guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A: from 15 December 2021, staff are required to take weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and 3 rapid lateral flow tests per week</li>
  <li>B: from 11 January 2022, for staff and residents, confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test following a positive rapid lateral flow test are no longer required</li>
  <li>C: from 16 February 2022, staff are required to take pre-shift rapid lateral flow tests</li>
  <li>D: from 4 April 2022, staff are required to take 2 rapid lateral flow tests per week, instead of pre-shift tests, and resident asymptomatic testing is removed</li>
</ul>

<p>Staff and residents have different testing regimes as outlined in the ‘About this data’ section below. As a result, the number of positive test results returned are expected to be of a different scale between staff and residents.</p>

<h4>Visitors</h4>

<p>The number of positive tests returned in both care home visitors and visiting professionals has decreased in April 2022.</p>

<p>In the week ending 26 April 2022 there were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>220 positive rapid lateral flow tests returned in care home visitors</li>
  <li>50 positive rapid lateral flow tests returned among visiting professionals to care homes</li>
</ul>

<p>The number of rapid lateral flow tests conducted – including positive, negative and void tests – among visitors continued to decrease in April 2022. In the week ending 26 April 2022, there were 46,822 rapid lateral flow tests conducted among visitors compared to 90,825 at the end of March 2022. This follows a period of increase from mid-January to mid-February, which coincided with the relaxation of visiting restrictions allowing more visitors per resident in care homes.</p>

<p>Additionally, there were 6,305 rapid lateral flow tests conducted among visiting professionals to care homes in the week ending 26 April 2022. The number of tests conducted started to decrease in April after remaining broadly consistent since early January 2022.</p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>

<p>Care home: facilities providing residential care. The data in this bulletin refers to Care Quality Commission (<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>) registered care homes.</p>

<p>Older adult care homes: care homes serving any older people (aged 65 and over) as identified from the latest <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> data on care homes in the ‘older people service’ user band. A small number of residents within care homes serving older people may be aged under 65.</p>

<p>Younger adult care homes: care homes not serving any older people (aged 65 and over) as identified from the latest <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> data on care homes in the ‘older people service’ user band.</p>

<p>Domiciliary care: services providing personal care for people living in their own homes. The data in this bulletin refers to domiciliary staff employed by independent <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> registered providers.</p>

<p>Staff: unless specified, staff can refer to staff directly employed by a provider and/or through an agency.</p>

<p>Staff employed by other settings: this includes non-registered providers and local authority employed: all other eligible frontline social care staff working in close and personal contact with people clinically vulnerable to COVID-19 (as defined by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>) priority groups) who need care and support irrespective of where they work or who they are employed by, for example, local government, NHS, private sector or third sector.</p>

<p>Agreed staffing ratios: the agreed number of residents for any given member of staff. This is determined by individual providers to ensure there is safe levels of staffing for care to be delivered. This can be subject to inspection by the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/guidance-providers/regulations-enforcement/regulation-18-staffing#guidance" rel="external">Regulation of staffing</a> for more information.</p>

<p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> (polymerase chain reaction) tests: <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests check for the genetic material of the coronavirus in the sample, which is taken using a swab and is processed in a lab via a polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>). These are predominantly used in care homes for people who experience symptoms, and for routine asymptomatic testing for staff and residents.</p>

<p>Rapid lateral flow tests: often referred to as ‘rapid tests’, or lateral flow device, these test for the presence of proteins called ‘antigens’ which are produced by the virus. They are swab tests that give results in 30 minutes or less, without the need for processing in a laboratory. These tests are primarily used in care homes for routine asymptomatic testing for staff, residents and visitors.</p>

<p><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> (personal protective equipment): equipment worn by staff or visitors in care homes to reduce transmission of COVID-19. This publication refers to supplies of aprons, eye protection, gloves, hand sanitiser and face masks in care homes.</p>

<h2>About this data</h2>

<p>These statistics are being published as a part of a wider landscape of statistics on adult social care. The Government Statistical Service (GSS) compiles a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/dashboard/tools/adult-social-care-statistics/database.html" rel="external">UK adult social care database</a> of official statistics on adult social care across the 4 nations of the UK. This is updated on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>The UK Statistics Authority (UKSA) conducted a review of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/report-on-adult-social-care-statistics-in-england/" rel="external">adult social care statistics in England</a> which called for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>better leadership and collaboration across different organisations publishing official statistics. This publication has been produced in collaboration with other statistics providers of COVID-19 adult social care data and <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will endeavour to work with various stakeholders as more data is published through this publication</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>addressing of gaps in available data, particularly in privately funded care. This bulletin aims to plug some of that gap by including data on residents privately funding their care in addition to those funded by local authorities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>improving existing official statistics. These statistics are being badged as experimental statistics and more data will be added iteratively based on user needs</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Other sources of adult social care COVID-19 data</h3>

<h4>COVID-19 vaccinations</h4>

<p>NHS England and Improvement (<abbr title="NHS England and Improvement">NHSEI</abbr>) also publish data on vaccinations in adult social care settings as part of their broader <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-vaccinations/" rel="external">statistical release on COVID-19 vaccination</a>, using the same methodology and the same data source as this publication but there are differences in the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>reporting period; data in this publication reports data collected up to 11:59pm on a Tuesday whereas <abbr title="NHS England and Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> use data collected up to 11:59pm on a Sunday</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a small amount of data may be collected after the respective reporting periods</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>regional breakdowns; data in this publication uses the administrative regions of England and <abbr title="NHS England and Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> use NHS regions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>COVID-19 testing</h4>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> also publishes care home testing data in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-weekly-reports">weekly NHS Test and Trace statistics (England)</a> at national level. This publication uses the same data source but has a different methodology for presenting testing in care homes and differences in the figures will occur due to the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>differences in which tests from different routes are included. Both methodologies include the number of tests registered from kits sent directly to care homes, but this publication additionally includes care home staff or residents tested via other routes such as regional or local test sites. As a result, figures in this report will be substantially higher for <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted in care home staff due to the current guidance recommending staff with symptoms to be tested outside of the care home (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-in-adult-care-homes">coronavirus (COVID-19) testing in adult care homes</a> for more information). This also means that changes in the guidance for the wider population might affect the trends differently across both publications</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>different reporting periods. This publication uses the start time of the test in comparison to the Test and Trace statistics which use the date on which the test result was received by the individual taking the test</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>different times of extracting the data</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For more details on the NHS Test and Trace programme and the statistics see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology">NHS Test and Trace methodology document</a>.</p>

<h4>Adult social care workforce size and absence statistics</h4>

<p>Skills for Care publishes <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/adult-social-care-workforce-data/Workforce-intelligence/publications/Topics/COVID-19/Staffing-and-occupancy-monthly-tracking.aspx" rel="external">yearly and monthly estimates of the number of adult social care filled posts as a measurement of the size of the adult social care workforce</a>. Differences in data sources and methodology mean that these statistics are not comparable with those published in this report.</p>

<p>Skills for Care’s monthly tracking data on staffing is based on the unweighted responses of a relatively small cohort of providers who have updated records in the Adult Social Care Workforce Data Set (ASC-WDS) in each respective month. This data may not be representative of the sector as a whole and therefore may only be indicative of general trends. Skills for Care use a wider definition of ‘domiciliary care’ than is used in Capacity Tracker and include other services delivered in the user’s own home, such as supported living and extra care housing.</p>

<p>Skills for Care also publishes <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/adult-social-care-workforce-data/Workforce-intelligence/publications/Topics/COVID-19/days-lost-due-to-sickness.aspx" rel="external">monthly estimates of the average number of days lost due to sickness</a>, which are not comparable with the absence rates published in this report. This is because of similar reasons explained above and due to the nature of Skills for Care’s estimate which is not specific to COVID-19 related absences.</p>

<p>In December 2021, an additional workforce report providing more information on the pressures faced by the adult social care workforce has been published as part of this data collection. This information was received through an ad hoc survey, and has been published as part of this collection as a one-time event. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/adult-social-care-workforce-survey-december-2021">adult social care workforce survey: December 2021 report</a>.</p>

<p>The workforce survey complements the regular collection by providing the opportunity to have a deeper exploration of workforce issues which is possible in an ad hoc survey but would be too burdensome for the regular collection.</p>

<h3>Data sources</h3>

<h4>COVID-19 vaccination, infection prevention control (<abbr title="infection prevention control">IPC</abbr>), <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> availability, absence rates and staffing levels</h4>

<p>Data in this publication is taken from self-reported data submitted by care providers in England through a data collection and insight tool called <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.necsu.nhs.uk/capacity-tracker/" rel="external">Capacity Tracker</a>.</p>

<p>Up until 4 April 2022, care providers were expected to submit data on <abbr title="infection prevention control">IPC</abbr> compliance on a weekly basis while data on vaccinations, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> availability, staff absences and staffing levels was expected to be updated on a daily basis. From 4 April 2022, all data fields are expected to be updated weekly, to reduce the burden on providers.</p>

<p>Care home visiting data for each reporting week refers to data up to 2pm on the date stated as the ‘week ending’ and the 7 days prior. For <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, absence rates and staffing-levels, data relates up to 11:59pm on the date stated as the ‘week ending’. The reporting week usually ends on a Tuesday but occasionally no data is available for this date, in these situations the ‘week ending’ date will be the nearest available date. From 4 April 2022, for care home visiting data and vaccination data for ‘other care settings’, the reporting week ends on a Wednesday instead of Tuesdays. This is due to a change in the timings at which these data are downloaded from the data portal.</p>

<p>This bulletin presents the proportion of staff and residents vaccinated out of the total number of staff and residents as self-reported by care providers. Only individuals who have not tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 28 days are eligible to receive the vaccine. Data on the number of staff and residents of older adult care homes eligible for the vaccination over time can be found in the accompanying COVID-19 vaccination tables on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/adult-social-care-in-england-monthly-statistics-march-2022">ASC monthly statistics page</a>.</p>

<h4>COVID-19 testing data</h4>

<p>Testing data is collected from management information generated during the operation of the NHS Test and Trace service.</p>

<p>For more information, see the ‘Data Sources’ section of the accompanying <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-in-england-statistics-england-methodology">background quality and methodology note</a>.</p>

<h3>Data coverage and quality</h3>

<p>All data in this publication refers to adult social care settings in England only.</p>

<p>Data submitted by providers reflects the current priorities to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic in social care settings. Data collection could be subject to change based on changes to the priorities and therefore the reporting in this publication will be adapted accordingly.</p>

<h4>Visiting, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> availability, absence rates and staffing levels</h4>

<p>Providers are expected to submit data on care home visiting, staffing levels and <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> availability on a weekly basis. Any providers who have not submitted data within the last 7 days are excluded from the relevant analysis for the associated time period where no response was received. The full response rates for all data points are available in tables 9 to 12 of the accompanying ‘Infection control, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and workforce statistics data tables’ on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/adult-social-care-in-england-monthly-statistics-march-2022">ASC monthly statistics page</a>. Before 4 April 2022, the expectation for reporting data on staffing levels and <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> availability data was daily.</p>

<h4>COVID-19 vaccinations</h4>

<p>Data on total number of staff and residents as well as those vaccinated is self-reported by care providers and local authorities. From 4 April 2022, providers are expected to update their vaccination data on a weekly basis. Before 4 April 2022, the expectation was daily.</p>

<p>There may be a time lag between individuals receiving the vaccine and the week they are reported in the statistics depending on when providers have updated their vaccination data.</p>

<h4>COVID-19 testing</h4>

<p>This report includes the number of tests conducted on care homes residents, staff and visitors who were tested by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and rapid lateral flow test kits sent directly to the care home for regular testing, which were registered through the National Testing Programme digital infrastructure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and rapid lateral flow test kits conducted at another testing site such as a regional or local test site or a mobile testing unit or tests that were registered</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The figures in this report are only deduplicated to report on the number of individual tests taken, not the number of people tested. Because people can have more than one test, the data should not be compared with prevalence rates or case positivity rates.</p>

<p>This report does not contain data on those tested through pillar 1.</p>

<p>Data for each reporting period relates to the day an individual took their test.</p>

<p>To see the latest testing regime guidance for care homes see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-adult-social-care-settings/covid-19-testing-in-adult-social-care">COVID-19 testing in adult social care guidance</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infection-prevention-and-control-in-adult-social-care-settings">Infection prevention and control in adult social care settings</a> guidance.</p>

<p>From 4 April 2022, staff are expected to take rapid lateral flow tests twice a week, and asymptomatic testing for residents is removed. Additionally, symptomatic testing is now done with rapid lateral flow tests instead of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests. On 31 March 2022, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infection-prevention-and-control-in-adult-social-care-covid-19-supplement/summary-of-changes-to-covid-19-guidance-for-adult-social-care-providers">summary of changes to testing and other <abbr title="infection prevention control">IPC</abbr> measures</a>.</p>

<p>As of the week ending 26 April 2022, which is the latest data point included in this publication, the regular testing regime in place was as follows:</p>

<p>care home staff testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 rapid lateral flow tests a week</li>
  <li>if symptomatic, 2 rapid lateral flow tests taken 48 hours apart</li>
</ul>

<p>care home residents testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no asymptomatic testing</li>
  <li>if symptomatic, 2 rapid lateral flow tests taken 48 hours apart</li>
  <li>as soon as they join a care home, if they are new, with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</li>
</ul>

<p>care home visitors testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no testing is recommended, unless visitor providing personal care</li>
</ul>

<p>visiting professionals to care homes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NHS professionals should provide proof of a negative test taken 72 hours in advance of the visit</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> inspectors regularly take weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests but should additionally take rapid lateral flow test on the day of visiting a care home</li>
  <li>other professionals should be tested with a rapid lateral flow test on arrival</li>
</ul>

<p>Different testing regimes apply when there is an outbreak of COVID-19 in a care home. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-adult-social-care-settings/covid-19-testing-in-adult-social-care">COVID-19 testing in adult social care guidance</a> for more details.</p>
