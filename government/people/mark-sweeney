<p>Mark took up post as Director General for Justice and Courts Policy on 16 October 2017. JCPG is responsible for two of MOJ’s four strategic priorities: a modern courts and justice system; and promoting Global Britain and the rule of law. This includes leading cross-system reform of courts and tribunals; developing policy on civil, family justice and criminal justice; MOJ’s work on leaving the EU; relations with the Judiciary; and partnership with 14 arms-length bodies. Mark leads a team of around 300 staff with a budget of around £250m. As a member of the Ministry of Justice Executive Committee he also supports the Permanent Secretary in leading the department as whole.</p>

<p>Mark was previously Director, Government at Ofcom, the telecommunications and broadcasting regulator, responsible for relationships with Government and Parliament across Ofcom’s remit and overseeing its presence in the UK’s nations. He also led work on agreeing Ofcom’s new responsibilities for regulating the BBC. Before joining Ofcom, Mark was Constitution Director at the Cabinet Office responsible for policy on elections and referendums, the UK’s constitutional settlement and devolution; and was the SRO for rollout of a new system of individual electoral registration in Great Britain.
