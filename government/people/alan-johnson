<p>Non-executive directors provide an external perspective on DFID’s work, while knowing and understanding DFID as an organisation.</p>

<p>They use their experiences and skills from outside DFID to provide objective and constructive challenges on the decisions made by DFID’s committees and boards.</p>

<p>The Non-executive Director sits on the following committees and boards within DFID:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the Departmental Board</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Executive Management Committee</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Audit Committee (chair)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Non-executive directors form a network across government, led by the Government Lead Non-executive.</p>
