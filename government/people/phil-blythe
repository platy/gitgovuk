<p>Professor Phil Blythe is Professor of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) at Newcastle University.  Prior to joining the Department for Transport he was Director of the Transport Operations Research Group for 13 years.</p>

<p>Phil’s academic focus has been the development of ITS – the use of information, communications and computing technology applied to transport.  His research portfolio covers a wide range of areas where ITS has been applied to transport including: road to vehicle communications; road user charging systems; ITS for assistive mobility, smartcards and radio frequency identification (RFID), wireless / smartdust technologies, electromobility and future intelligent infrastructure.</p>

<p>His research is also forward-looking and attempts to bridge the technology-policy gap in terms of what technologies may evolve to meet future policy objectives or influence future policy thinking to meet the challenges.</p>

<p>Phil chairs the Institute of Engineering and Technology (<abbr title="Institute of Engineering and Technology">IET</abbr>)’s Transport Policy Panel, is a member of their Lectures Committee and supports the <abbr title="Institute of Engineering and Technology">IET</abbr> in the UK and abroad in areas such intelligent transport, connected and autonomous vehicles, electro-mobility and smart cities and on the Big Data / Internet of Things agendas.  In March 2012 Phil was awarded the Reece-Hills Medal for a lifetime personal contribution to ITS.</p>
