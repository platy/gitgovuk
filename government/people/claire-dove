<p>Claire wants to work collaboratively with VCSEs and wider civil society to draw on their knowledge and expertise. There are already multiple sources of support  for both commissioners and VCSEs linked on this page, plus a lot more planned for the months ahead.</p>

<p>Claire is also working closely with Emma Jones, Crown Representative for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises on the government’s aspiration to spend £1 in every £3 with SMEs (this includes VCSEs). The government is Open for Business to VCSE sector organisations of all shapes and sizes.</p>

<h4 id="social-value-act-information-and-resources">Social Value Act: information and resources</h4>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/3/enacted">The Public Services (Social Value) Act</a> came into force on 31 January 2013. It requires people who commission public services to think about how they can also secure wider social, economic and environmental benefits.</p>

<p>Before they start the procurement process, commissioners should think about whether the services they are going to buy, or the way they are going to buy them, could secure these benefits for their area or stakeholders.</p>

<p>The Act is a tool to help commissioners get more value for money out of procurement. It also encourages commissioners to talk to their local provider market or community to design better services, often finding new and innovative solutions to difficult problems.</p>

<p>You can find an introductory guide to the Public Services (Social Value Act) 2012 for commissioners and policymakers <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/social-value-act-introductory-guide">here</a> and case studies on social value implementation and measurement <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/social-value-implementation-and-measurement-project-case-studies">here</a>.</p>
