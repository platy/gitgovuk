<p>Tyson built his career completely in the Home Office. During that time he has had a wide range of experiences, working on policing, crime and safeguarding policy, being a private secretary to six ministers, and doing some international work, such as negotiating changes to the European Arrest Warrant. He also ran HM Passport Office for six months in 2014 to 2015.</p>

<p>He moved across to the immigration side of the Home Office in the autumn of 2015 and has spent the last two and a half years in UKVI, firstly leading on asylum operations and, since the beginning of 2017, on complex casework, as well as appeals and litigation.</p>
