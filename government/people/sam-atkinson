<p>The inspection, enforcement and standards division inspects manufacturers, wholesale dealers and importers of medicines to check they are meeting our standards. They also inspect clinical trials and toxicology labs.</p>

<p>They investigate when we receive reports of illegal advertising, production or sale of medicines for human use, which can result in legal action being taken. We also monitor the import of unlicensed medicines.</p>

<p>We are responsible for testing services in the agency, to determine whether or not materials and products are medicines, which would need to be regulated.</p>

<p>We are responsible for the British Pharmacopoeia (BP); an annually published book that makes an important contribution to protecting public health by providing authoritative quality standards for UK pharmaceutical substances and medicinal products.</p>
