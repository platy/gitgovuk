<p>The Advocate General for Scotland is one of the Law Officers of the Crown, who advise the government on Scots law.</p>

<p>Schedule 6 to the Scotland Act requires that the Advocate General be provided with notice of all ‘devolution issues’ raised before courts or tribunals in Scotland.

<p>The Advocate General can choose intervene, on behalf of the UK government, in proceedings in which devolution issues have been raised if he so decides.</p>

<p>The Office of the Advocate General considers all Scottish Parliament Bills as they progress, in consultation with interested UK government departments, to assess their legislative competency.  Under section 33 of the Scotland Act, the Advocate General has the power to refer Scottish Parliament Bills to the Supreme Court for decisions on their legislative competence.</p>
