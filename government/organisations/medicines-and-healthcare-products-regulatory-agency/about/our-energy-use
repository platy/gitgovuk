<p>We support the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-sustainable-development-a-part-of-all-government-policy-and-operations">UK strategy for sustainable development</a> in all of our working practices. We have the same targets for recycling, use of lower energy lighting, etc as the rest of the Department of Health.</p>

<h2 id="what-were-doing-to-reduce-our-energy-use">What we’re doing to reduce our energy use</h2>

<p>We’ve already changed some of our working practices (such as the move to electronic working via our database Sentinel) to reduce volumes of paperwork required and, as a consequence, transport emissions. We will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure that sustainable policies are built into our procurement processes</li>
  <li>seek to reduce our energy and other natural resource consumption</li>
  <li>seek to reduce carbon emissions from travel where possible</li>
  <li>recycle as much of our waste as possible</li>
  <li>encourage best practice amongst our staff by producing a ‘good practice’ guide</li>
  <li>consider what we can do to support the communities we work in</li>
  <li>continue to consider what more we can do as an organisation and set targets for future years</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="our-building-and-facilities">Our building and facilities</h2>

<p>There are difficulties in meeting our objective of using  ‘green’ electricity due to the main agency building being leased from a private landlord. Our proposed relocation will offer us greater opportunities to develop sustainable practices.</p>

<p>We now collect data on actual car mileage, which has enabled us to set baseline measurements. We aim to ensure that visits are planned in such a way as to be environmentally friendly.</p>

<h2 id="monitoring-and-checking-progress">Monitoring and checking progress</h2>

<p>We have a working group to collect data, set baseline measurements and consider achievable targets. These appear in our annual reports. The agency also contributes to the <a rel="external" href="http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/pages/sustainable-operations-on-the-government-estate-soge-assessment.html">Sustainable Operations on the Government Estate (SOGE) report</a>.</p>
