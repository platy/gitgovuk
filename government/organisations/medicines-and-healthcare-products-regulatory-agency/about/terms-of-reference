<h3 id="role">Role</h3>

<p>The Board is primarily responsible for advising on the strategic development of the Agency and ensuring that targets set out in our business plan and endorsed by ministers are met.</p>

<h3 id="membership">Membership</h3>

<p>The Board will consist of not more than 12 individuals and will be chaired by the Agency chairman. Non-Executive members will be appointed by the Secretary of State following open competition and do not represent any specific customer, sectoral or stakeholder interests.</p>

<p>Since 18 September 2015, when the Board adopted a unitary structure, the Chief Executive and the Chief Operating Officer now serve as executive members of the Board. Other executive directors may attend all Board meetings as observers.</p>

<p>A member of the Department of Health’s Legal Services usually attends to inform the Board on the Agency’s business.</p>

<p>Non-Executive members of the Board should have terms of appointment clearly setting out what is required of them, how their performance will be appraised and the duration of their appointments.</p>

<p>Members should pro-actively declare any potential conflicts of interest arising either from business on the agenda or from changes in their personal circumstances.  The Chair should determine an appropriate course of action, from exclusion for a particular item of business to cessation of membership.  Where the Chair has a conflict of interest, the other members present should determine the appropriate course of action.
