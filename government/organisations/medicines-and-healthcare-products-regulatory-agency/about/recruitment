<h2 id="work-life-balance">Work-life balance</h2>

<p>We realise the importance of a life outside work and promote a healthy work-life balance for all our staff.</p>

<p>In addition, we understand that many of our staff have young children or other dependents and we endeavor to provide flexible working in line with our policies wherever possible, while ensuring that the needs of the business are met.</p>

<p>In order to provide a flexible way of working for staff, some departments in <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> operate a flexi-time policy. Core hours vary across departments depending on the requirements of the business.</p>

<h2 id="learning-and-development">Learning and Development</h2>

<p>We are committed to providing learning and development for our staff. As part of this commitment, we provide access to a curriculum of courses that are available in-house or via the Civil Service Learning portal. In addition, staff are able to (with manager’s approval) take up external courses such as Degrees, Diplomas, or MSc courses.</p>

<p>To ensure staff are fully inducted into the Agency and are able to perform effectively in their role, there is a three-stage Induction programme with an overview of all teams and departments built in, as well as a chance to network with the Executive Team.</p>

<p>Our commitment is also evident in the Continued Professional Development programmes we facilitate each month to continuously boost skills and knowledge, and further develop talent in the Agency.</p>

<h2 id="team-building">Team building</h2>

<p>We are committed to improving internal working relationships and communication through all-staff meetings, briefings at divisional meetings and the use of our staff intranet. In addition to this, our open-plan offices encourage communication and interaction between staff.</p>

<p>There are opportunities to join the Staff network and have a say in how matters that affect staff are developed and dealt with.</p>

<p>Team development days/away days provide a good way for teams to bond whilst working out strategically how the team will meet its objectives. This is a way to celebrate success, spend some time together and support each other with further development.</p>
