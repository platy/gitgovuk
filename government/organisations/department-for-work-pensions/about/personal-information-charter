<p>The Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) processes lots of personal data, much of it sensitive. We take data protection very seriously and understand how important it is that you can trust us with your information.</p>

<p>This charter explains whose personal information we process, how we use it, why and what for.</p>

<p>If we process your personal information, we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure you know why we need it</li>
  <li>only process the personal information we need</li>
  <li>make sure nobody has access to it who should not</li>
  <li>keep it secure</li>
  <li>tell you through this charter or in other ways if we share it with other organisations</li>
  <li>ask you to agree to us sharing your information where you have a choice</li>
  <li>only keep it for as long as we need to</li>
  <li>not make it available for commercial use (such as marketing) without your permission</li>
</ul>

<p>If we ask you for personal information, you need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>give us accurate information</li>
  <li>tell us as soon as possible if there are any changes, such as a new address, when you start work or earn more</li>
</ul>

<p>This helps us to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep your information accurate and up to date</li>
  <li>pay you the right amount of benefit</li>
  <li>provide the best possible service</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not tell us about changes that affect any benefit that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is paying you, you may be prosecuted or other sanctions applied.</p>

<h2 id="data-protection-principles">Data protection principles</h2>

<p>We will always comply with data protection law. This says that the personal information we hold about you must be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>used lawfully, fairly and in a transparent way</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>collected only for valid purposes that we have clearly explained to you and not used in any way that is incompatible with those purposes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>relevant to the purposes we have told you about and limited only to those purposes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>accurate and kept up to date</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>kept only as long as necessary for the purposes we have told you about</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>kept securely</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-dwp-uses-personal-information-for">What <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> uses personal information for</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> collects information to deal with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>social security (this includes benefits, grants, loans, pensions and Housing Benefit)</li>
  <li>child maintenance</li>
  <li>the investigation or prosecution of offences relating to tax credits and benefits</li>
  <li>prevention and detection of fraud, and protecting public funds</li>
  <li>employment and training</li>
  <li>promoting financial planning for retirement</li>
  <li>policy relating to occupational and personal pension schemes</li>
  <li>research and analysis into matters listed above</li>
</ul>

<p>The information we collect about you depends on the reason for your business with us, but we may use the information for any of these purposes.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> uses your National Insurance number to help identify you when you use <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> services. Your National Insurance number is used by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and HM Revenue & Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue & Customs">HMRC</abbr>), and Department for Communities if you live in Northern Ireland, and the Scottish Government if you live in Scotland.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> provides some other services for government. These include services such as the Tell Us Once service. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> also manages the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme jointly with the Department of Health and Social Care, and also provides some other services to the Department of Health and Social Care. Information obtained for each of these services is kept separate from other <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> data, and is not used for anything else by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. Read more about how each of these services uses information:</p>

</ul>

<p>Most <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> offices use closed-circuit television (<abbr title="closed-circuit television">CCTV</abbr>) to help manage security and keep people safe. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is a tenant of the buildings that we use, and <abbr title="closed-circuit television">CCTV</abbr> services are usually provided by either the company we rent the office from, or by the company providing security services for the office. Signs in our offices say who manages the <abbr title="closed-circuit television">CCTV</abbr> and who you should contact with any queries about this.</p>

<p>Telephone calls to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> offices and about <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> services are recorded.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will not use your data to try and sell you things, or sell your data to anyone.</p>

<h2 id="the-types-of-data-that-dwp-use">The types of data that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> use</h2>

<p>The types of data that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> processes about people will depend on the contact that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has with them. An easy way to see what kind of information <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> processes for a particular benefit is to look at the claim form for that benefit. Many of these are available on GOV.<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>Types of data that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> processes include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>personal details</li>
  <li>family, lifestyle and social circumstances</li>
  <li>financial details</li>
  <li>employment and education details</li>
  <li>goods or services provided</li>
  <li>education and training details</li>
  <li>visual images</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> also processes sensitive information that may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>physical or mental health details</li>
  <li>racial or ethnic origin</li>
  <li>political, religious or other beliefs of a similar nature</li>
  <li>trade union membership</li>
  <li>sexual life</li>
  <li>genetic data</li>
  <li>biometric data</li>
  <li>offences including alleged offences</li>
  <li>criminal proceedings, outcomes and sentences</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="who-dwp-holds-information-about">Who <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> holds information about</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> processes data about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>members of the public</li>
  <li>customers and claimants</li>
  <li>people who live in the customer’s or claimant’s household</li>
  <li>suppliers and services providers</li>
  <li>advisers, consultants and other professional experts</li>
  <li>complainants and enquirers</li>
  <li>relatives, guardians and associates</li>
  <li>offenders and suspected offenders</li>
  <li>employees</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> holds basic information (such as your name, address, date of birth) about everyone who has been allocated a National Insurance number. This information is used by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="HM Revenue & Customs">HMRC</abbr>, and also by the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>This is used by <abbr title="HM Revenue & Customs">HMRC</abbr> to keep records of employment and National Insurance contributions, and by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to pay benefits, administer pensions. We will hold more detailed information if you have claimed a benefit or used other <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> services.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> sometimes needs information about people other than the person who has applied for a benefit or service to work out what that person is entitled to. For example, where a person makes a claim for Universal Credit, we need information about other people who live in the same household to work out how much the person will be paid.</p>

<h2 id="how-dwp-shares-information-about-you">How <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> shares information about you</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may share information with and get it from other organisations such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>other government departments</li>
  <li>local authorities</li>
  <li>social security organisations in other countries</li>
  <li>employers and potential employers</li>
  <li>social landlords</li>
  <li>private-sector bodies, such as banks and organisations that may lend you money</li>
  <li>charitable and welfare organisations</li>
</ul>

<p>We do this for a number of reasons, including to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check the accuracy of information</li>
  <li>help people with particular difficulties, such as troubled families</li>
  <li>help people get or stay in work</li>
  <li>child maintenance</li>
  <li>help people get education and training to improve their chances of getting work</li>
  <li>support people with independent living, including home help and respite care</li>
  <li>prevent or detect crime</li>
  <li>check payments for services</li>
  <li>protect public funds</li>
  <li>use for research or statistical purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>Some social security services are also delivered under devolution agreements, for example by the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland, the Scottish Government, and some local authorities. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> shares information when necessary for these services, as permitted by law.</p>

<p>We will only ever give information about you to someone outside <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> if the law allows us to.</p>

<h2 id="dwp-service-providers">
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> service providers</h2>

<p>Many <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> services are delivered with the help of other organisations, such as contractors, local authorities, charities and others. We sometimes need to share data with these organisations so they can provide <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> services properly.</p>

<p>In most cases our contracted service providers – for example companies delivering the Work Programme – are acting as <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s data processors. This means that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is responsible for ensuring they handle your data correctly.</p>

<p>If you have a problem or query about how a <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> service provider is handling your personal data, tell us and we will try to resolve this for you.</p>

<p><a href="#dpo">Read more about the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Data Protection Officer on this page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-long-dwp-keeps-your-data">How long <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> keeps your data</h2>

<p>We keep some basic information for as long as your National Insurance number exists, such as your name, date of birth and address.</p>

<p>Most benefit records (the detailed information you provide us with when you claim a benefit) and information provided for other <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> services are kept after the claim ends for the period necessary for any appeals, reviews and other activity to be completed. Payment records may be kept for longer, usually 6 years if they are relevant to the tax you pay.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> holds a lot of different kinds of information for a variety of different reasons, but we are committed to keep only what we need for no longer than is necessary.</p>

<p><a href="#retention">Read more on this page about when and how long <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> keeps data</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-legal-basis-for-processing-your-data">The legal basis for processing your data</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> processes personal data because we are required to by law, because it is the function of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to do so, or because it is in the public interest.  Where this is the case we do not need your consent.</p>

<p>We may sometimes ask for your permission or consent to do something, but only when you have a genuine choice about it. Most of the time – for example when you claim a benefit – you have to provide us with the information we need to see if you are entitled to it, and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is required to use that data.</p>

<p><a href="#legal-basis">Read more about the legal basis for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s processing on this page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="processing-data-offshore">Processing data offshore</h2>

<p>The data for most of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s own systems is processed within the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. Whenever any <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> data is processed outside of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, we always ensure that the data is just as safe as it would be if the processing was in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="keeping-your-information-safe">Keeping your information safe</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> treats the security of your information very seriously. We have strict security standards, and all our staff get regular training about how to keep information safe. Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dwp-procurement-security-policies-and-standards">main security policies</a>.</p>

<h2 id="automated-decision-making">Automated decision making</h2>

<p>The decisions <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> makes that have a substantial effect on you – for example whether or not you are entitled to a benefit – are made with meaningful input from staff.  Review or appeal options are built in to all <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefit processes, even where this is not specifically required by data protection laws.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is developing new digital services all the time.  If any new services involve automated decision-making, we will tell you about this when the decision is made.</p>

<h2 id="dwp-uses-of-profiling">
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> uses of profiling</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> uses profiling to help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>avoid asking for information or evidence that we do not need, and make sure we ask for it when necessary</li>
  <li>call handling and providing services – to ensure people speak to the right part of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, and are offered additional support to access <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> services if they need it</li>

<h2 id="data-controller-information">Data controller information</h2>

<p>The Department for Work and Pensions is the data controller.</p>

<p>Where <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> uses contractors to deliver services they are usually acting as <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s data processor, and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and our processors share responsibility for how your data is handled.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is the parent department for a number of arm’s length bodies – most of these are data controllers in their own right, and are responsible for any personal data that they process.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> also works closely with other government data controllers, especially where functions are linked or complement each other such as tax and benefits, or employment and health.</p>

<h2 id="your-rights-when-dwp-uses-your-information">Your rights when <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> uses your information</h2>

<p>You have various rights about how <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> uses your data. For example, you have the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/request-your-personal-information-from-the-department-for-work-and-pensions">right to access the data that we hold about you</a>. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> does not charge for this.</p>

<p>New data protection laws also provide you with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the right to be informed (which we do through these pages)</li>
  <li>the right to rectification</li>
  <li>the right to erasure</li>
  <li>the right to restrict processing</li>
  <li>the right to data portability</li>
  <li>the right to object</li>
  <li>the right to not be subject to automated decision-making, including profiling</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="right-to-rectification">Right to rectification</h3>

<p>You have the right to have inaccurate personal data corrected. Let us know if your circumstances change and we will ensure your data is updated. This can be information such as your address, when you start work or when you are earning more. To tell us about a change of information, contact the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> office or service you have been using.</p>

<h3 id="right-to-erasure">Right to erasure</h3>

<p>This is your right to have personal data erased when it is no longer needed. This is also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’. To find out how long <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> needs and keeps your information, see the section <a href="#retention">‘How long <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> keeps your data’ on this page</a>. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has to keep information about claims and services for a period after claims have ended, in case appeals or reviews are necessary, and to make sure we have finished any follow-up action.</p>

<h3 id="right-to-restrict-processing">Right to restrict processing</h3>

<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) gives you the right to request <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to restrict processing of your personal data in certain circumstances. This may be due to the accuracy of the personal data <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> hold, if the data has been unlawfully processed or <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> no longer needs the data but you would like us to keep it in order to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim. We can refuse to comply if your request is unfounded or excessive, or repetitive in nature but we will justify the decision to you and will inform you of any decision that has been made.</p>

<h3 id="right-to-data-portability">Right to data portability</h3>

<p>The right to data portability gives you the right to receive personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format. This right only applies when you have consented to the processing of the data in question.</p>

<h3 id="right-to-object">Right to object</h3>

<p>The right to object dictates that you have a right to object to the processing of your personal data, specifically if the data is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for direct marketing purposes</li>
  <li>a task carried out in the public interest</li>
  <li>the exercise of official authority or legitimate interest</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rights-related-to-automated-decision-making-including-profiling">Rights related to automated decision making including profiling</h3>

<p>Automated individual decision-making is a decision made without any human involvement. Profiling involves the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects such as a natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> can only carry out solely automated decision making if the decision is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>necessary for entering into or performance of a contract between you and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>authorised by law</li>
  <li>based on your explicit consent</li>
</ul>

<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s Data Protection Officer</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has appointed a Data Protection Officer. The role of the Data Protection Officer is to make sure <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is compliant with data protection laws and to act as a point of contact for data subjects.</p>

<p>The DWPs Data Protection Officer is Dominic Hartley. You can contact the Data Protection Officer by post at:</p>

<h2 id="retention">More about when and how long <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> keeps personal information</h2>

<p>The length of time <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> keeps your data will depend on the type of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> services you use, what kind of information it is, and whether it is information that is needed as evidence to support a benefit claim or other <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> service.</p>

<p>Read the main <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dwp-information-management-policies">instructions to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> staff on how to manage information</a>.</p>

<p>Often we will delete or destroy records in specific exercises through the year to do this more efficiently and save money. Rather than destroying every piece of information due for destruction on a particular day or week, we may do this on a monthly or quarterly basis and destroy all information of a particular type that has expired in the previous period.</p>

<h2 id="legal-basis">More about the legal basis for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s processing</h2>

<p>Data protection laws do not allow personal information to be used or processed unless some specific conditions are met.</p>

<p>For personal data, the condition that applies to most processing done by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is that it is necessary for “a function of a government department”, which is allowed by section 8 of the new Data Protection Act, and Article 6(1)(e) of the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>.</p>

<p>For sensitive personal information, such as information about health, most processing by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> meets the condition that it is “necessary for the purposes of … employment, social security and social protection”. This is allowed by section 10 of the new Data Protection Act and Article 9(2)(b) of the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>.</p>

<p>There may be some circumstances where <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> relies on other conditions to process personal information or sensitive personal information, but we will tell you separately if this happens.</p>

<h2 id="other-controllers">How <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> works with other data controllers</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> works closely with other parts of government to help deliver social security and other services. For most day-to-day <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> business, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is the data controller and is responsible for all aspects of how information is used. But for some of the areas where <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> works together with other organisations, we share responsibility for how your personal data is used. This section explains how this works.</p>

<h3 id="hmrc"><abbr title="HM Revenue & Customs">HMRC</abbr></h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="HM Revenue & Customs">HMRC</abbr> work very closely together, and share information often. This is because benefits and pensions are affected by how much you earn and the National Insurance contributions you have paid. Benefits, pensions and other payments you receive from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> affect how much tax you have to pay, or tax credits that <abbr title="HM Revenue & Customs">HMRC</abbr> pay you.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="HM Revenue & Customs">HMRC</abbr> can use the same reference number to identify people – your National Insurance number. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="HM Revenue & Customs">HMRC</abbr> are jointly responsible for deciding how National Insurance numbers can be used, who can use them, and the other personal information associated with them.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="HM Revenue & Customs">HMRC</abbr> both use the same computer system (the Customer Information System) to keep a record of which National Insurance number relates to which person, and to record basic information about everyone who has a National Insurance number.</p>

<p>Find out more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance">National Insurance numbers and what they are used for</a>.</p>

<h3 id="department-of-health-and-social-care">Department of Health and Social Care</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> provides some services for the Department of Health and Social Care, and is acting as their data processor when we do this. These services include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Vaccine Damage Payment Unit</li>
  <li>European Health Insurance Cards (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Cards">EHIC</abbr>) and recovering costs of healthcare provided to European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) nationals from other member states</li>
  <li>checking entitlement to free prescriptions and other healthcare services such as fares to hospital</li>
  <li>compensation recovery services</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ministry-of-defence">Ministry of Defence</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> makes payments to veterans for the Ministry of Defence.</p>

<h3 id="arms-length-bodies">Arm’s length bodies</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is the parent department for a number of arm’s length bodies. Some arm’s length bodies are data controllers in their own right, and responsible for all aspects of how they use personal data. These arm’s length bodies are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Health and Safety Executive</li>
  <li>The Pensions Advisory Service</li>
  <li>The Pensions Regulator</li>
  <li>National Employment Savings Trust (<abbr title="National Employment Savings Trust">NEST</abbr>) Corporation</li>
  <li>Disabled Peoples Employment Corporation</li>
  <li>Pensions Ombudsman</li>
  <li>Pensions Protection Fund Ombudsman</li>
  <li>Pension Protection Fund</li>
  <li>Office for Nuclear Regulation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="office-for-national-statistics-ons">Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> collect, analyse and publish statistics about the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s economy, population and society. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may supply personal information we hold about you to <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> to help them carry out this function.</p>

<p>Find out more about <a rel="external" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance"><abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> and how they manage personal data</a>.</p>

<h3 id="northern-ireland">Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>For people living in Northern Ireland, the <a rel="external" href="https://www.communities-ni.gov.uk/">Department for Communities</a> is responsible for many of the same services that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> provides in England, Wales and Scotland. The Department for Communities pays similar benefits to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and also uses the National Insurance number for similar purposes, so some IT and other services are shared between <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and the Department for Communities.</p>

<p>The Department for Communities is the data controller for information about benefits and services they provide in Northern Ireland, but some data controller responsibilities are shared where we use the same IT systems.</p>

<p>Northern Ireland departments also provide some services such as call centres and benefit processing to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. Where they do this they are acting as <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s data processor, and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> remains the data controller.</p>

<h3 id="scotland">Scotland</h3>

<p>Responsibility for some aspects of social security for people in Scotland have been devolved to the <a rel="external" href="https://www.socialsecurity.gov.scot/privacy-statement">Scottish Government</a>, and more will be devolved in the future. Current legislation allows <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to share information with Scottish ministers for functions which have been devolved.</p>

<p>As devolution continues, Scottish ministers will be responsible for more social security matters, including some benefits. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> shares information with Scottish ministers to support the services they are responsible for. Sometimes <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may also act as a data processor for Scottish ministers to help deliver their services. The letters and notifications for the services will tell you when <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is acting as a data processor for Scottish ministers.</p>
