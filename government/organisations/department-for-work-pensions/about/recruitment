<p>A typical application process will involve the following stages.</p>

<p>Our selection process is based on competencies. These are skills and experience you may have gained in any area of your life, such as at work, home, school, in leisure activities or voluntary work. Most applications will ask you to give examples of how you feel you have met and demonstrated these competencies. We will let you know what these competencies are so that you can understand how to apply them and what they mean. You can read more about writing competency statements for a job application in our guidance.</p>
