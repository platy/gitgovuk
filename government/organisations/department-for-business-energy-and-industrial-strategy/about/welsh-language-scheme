<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Under the Welsh Language Act 1993 (the Act) every public body providing services to the public in Wales has to prepare a scheme setting out how it will provide those services in Welsh.</p>

<h2 id="background-to-the-organisation">Background to the organisation</h2>

<p>The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>) was formed in July 2016, following the UK’s decision to leave the European Union and subsequent machinery of government changes. It brings together the business and science policy portfolios of the former Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr>) and the full policy portfolio of the former Department for Energy and Climate Change (<abbr title="Department for Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>). It aims to build links between industry, energy and climate change, and enable a united focus on markets, investors and consumers. As policy lead for more than 25 economic sectors, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> has one of the largest and most complex EU-exit portfolios, and EU-exit is relevant to all of its departmental objectives.</p>

<p>The department’s purpose is to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">…drive forward the changes which will build an economy that works for everyone, so that there are great places in every part of the United Kingdom for people to work and for businesses to invest, innovate and grow.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-beis-welsh-language-scheme">The <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> Welsh language scheme</h2>

<p>Prior to July 2016, both <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> operated their own individual Welsh language schemes (<abbr title="Welsh Language Schemes">WLS</abbr>). The Welsh Language Board (<abbr title="Welsh Language Board">WLB</abbr>) approved <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr>’ initial Welsh language scheme in August 2000. This was then revised in 2009 and approved by the then Welsh Language Board. The <abbr title="Department for Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> <abbr title="Welsh Language Schemes">WLS</abbr> was approved by the Welsh Language Board in March 2012.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> Welsh language scheme supersedes both of these <abbr title="Welsh Language Schemes">WLS</abbr>’ and describes how <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will give effect, so far as is both appropriate in the circumstances and reasonably practicable, to the principle established by the Welsh Language Act that, in the conduct of public business and the administration of justice in Wales, the Welsh and English languages should be treated on a basis of equality. The scheme covers the services that we provide to the public in Wales.</p>

<p>In this scheme, the term public means individuals. It includes the public as a whole, or a section of the public who are acting in a private capacity. It does not, however, include persons who are acting in a capacity which is representative of the Crown, government or the state. Consequently, persons who fulfil official functions of a public nature, even though they are legal persons, do not come within the meaning of the word public when they are fulfilling those official functions.</p>

<p>This scheme was prepared under Section 21 of the Act - and in accordance with guidelines issued by the Welsh Language Commissioner under Section 9 of the Act. It came into effect on 9 November 2018, and replaces the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> scheme that was approved by the <abbr title="Welsh Language Board">WLB</abbr> in 2009 and the <abbr title="Department for Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> scheme that was approved by the <abbr title="Welsh Language Board">WLB</abbr> in 2012.</p>

<p>Further information about the scope and purpose of Welsh language schemes can be found in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.comisiynyddygymraeg.cymru/English/My%20rights/Pages/Welsh-language-schemes.aspx">Welsh Language Commissioners guidelines</a>.</p>

<h2 id="coverage-of-the-scheme">Coverage of the scheme</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> scheme applies to all <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> headquarters functions and the department works with the Welsh government and the Office of the Secretary of State for Wales on Welsh language matters as appropriate.</p>

<p>While the executive agencies operate within broad policy guidelines set by ministers, day to day operations, including the implementation of Welsh Language Act measures, are matters for the Chief Executive of each agency. Where <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations#department-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy"><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> agencies</a> do not have their own Welsh Language Schemes, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will make its scheme available to those agencies and encourage them to meet the needs of the Welsh-speaking public in line with the principles enshrined in the Welsh Language Act.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will use its influence to promote awareness of the needs of Welsh speakers and will encourage the adoption by relevant non-departmental public bodies of the principles of the Act.</p>

<h2 id="serving-planning-and-delivery">Serving planning and delivery</h2>

<h3 id="policies-legislation-and-initiatives">Policies, legislation and initiatives</h3>

<p>Our policies, initiatives and services will be consistent with this scheme. They will support the use of Welsh and will, whenever appropriate, help the public in Wales use Welsh as part of their day to day lives.</p>

<p>When we contribute to the development or delivery of policies, initiatives, services or new legislation led by other organisations, we will do so in a way which is consistent with this scheme. We will also ensure, whenever appropriate, that new primary and secondary legislation sponsored by the department will support the use of Welsh. We will be following <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-making-legislation">Cabinet Office impact assessment guidance</a> when evaluating the impact of new policies and initiatives on the Welsh language.</p>

<h3 id="delivering-services">Delivering services</h3>

<p>We will ensure that our services are available in Welsh and to let the public know when they are available. This will enable Welsh speakers to access our services.</p>

<h3 id="our-regulatory-functions--and-services-undertaken-on-our-behalf-by-third-parties">Our regulatory functions – and services undertaken on our behalf by third parties</h3>

<p>Any agreements or arrangements which we make with third parties will be consistent with the relevant parts of this scheme when those agreements or arrangements relate to the provision of services to the public in Wales. This will include services which are contracted out, granting licences and granting other permissions.</p>

<h3 id="standards-of-quality">Standards of quality</h3>

<p>Services provided in Welsh and English will be of equal quality and will be delivered within the same timescale.</p>

<h3 id="awarding-grants-and-loans">Awarding grants and loans</h3>

<p>When we award grants and loans for activities that affect the Welsh public we will where appropriate include conditions with regard to the use of Welsh. In doing this, we will have regard to the <a rel="external" href="http://www.comisiynyddygymraeg.cymru/hybu/en/guidelines/Pages/guidelines.aspx">Welsh Language Commissioner’s guidelines on awarding grants and loans</a>.</p>

<h2 id="dealing-with-the-welsh-speaking-public">Dealing with the Welsh speaking public</h2>

<h3 id="correspondence">Correspondence</h3>

<p>Our normal practice will be as follows:</p>

<p>When <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> Ministerial Correspondence Unit initiate correspondence with an individual, group or organisation based in Wales, we will do so bilingually unless we know that they would prefer to correspond in Welsh or English only. When a member of the public in Wales writes to us bilingually or in Welsh, we will issue a reply in Welsh (if a reply is required).</p>

<p>Our <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> Ministerial Correspondence Unit will keep a record of those who wish to correspond with us in Welsh. Our target time for replying will be the same as for replying to letters written in English, which is 15 days for ministerial correspondence and 20 working days for a Freedom of Information request.</p>

<p>If the Welsh and English versions of any correspondence have to be published separately, our normal practice will be to ensure that both versions are available at the same time. Enclosures sent with bilingual letters will be bilingual, where possible.</p>

<p>The above will apply to email correspondence as well as all hard-copy Welsh correspondence. Staff based in Wales will include a bilingual message on all external email signatures noting that <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> welcome correspondence in Welsh.</p>

<h3 id="decision-letters">Decision letters</h3>

<p>If a decision letter is intended to convey policy to a much wider audience than those directly involved with an inquiry, or other statutory procedure, we will consider whether it should be treated, under this scheme, as a publication.</p>

<h3 id="telephone-communications">Telephone communications</h3>

<p>We will ensure the public can speak to us in Welsh or English when contacting us by phone. If the caller wishes to speak Welsh but is not immediately speaking to a qualified Welsh speaker in the first instance, the caller will be given the choice, as appropriate, of having a Welsh speaker phone back as soon as possible, continuing the call in English, or submitting their query in Welsh by letter or email. As above, language preference will be recorded.</p>

<h3 id="public-meetings">Public meetings</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will ensure that members of the public attending public meetings, such as formal hearings, enquiries, legal proceedings and similar official events, are welcome and able to contribute in Welsh. Invitations and notices publicising an event in Wales will be bilingual and will normally invite those who wish to speak in Welsh to notify the arranger of the event in advance so that interpreting facilities can be arranged.</p>

<p>Our normal practice will be to provide papers and other information for these public meetings in Welsh and English – and for reports or papers produced following public meetings to be published in Welsh and English, in line with the publication commitments in this scheme.</p>

<h3 id="other-meetings-with-the-public">Other meetings with the public</h3>

<p>When we arrange or attend private meetings with the public, we will establish their language preference at the earliest opportunity and ensure that a suitable qualified Welsh speaking member of staff deals with those whose preferred language is Welsh.</p>

<p>If no suitable qualified Welsh speaker is available, we will offer the choice of continuing the meeting in English, or dealing with the subject by corresponding in Welsh. The above will also apply to meetings held using video conferencing and similar equipment.</p>

<h3 id="other-dealings-with-the-public-in-wales">Other dealings with the public in Wales</h3>

<p>When we undertake public surveys in Wales, our normal practice will be to ensure that all aspects of communication with the public will be bilingual. Whenever practicable, respondents will be asked if they wish to respond to the survey in Welsh or English.</p>

<p>When we arrange seminars, training courses or similar events for the public that are based in Wales, we will assess the need to provide them in Welsh.</p>

<p>Any audio-visual displays, audio tours or interactive media that we prepare for the Welsh public will be bilingual.</p>

<p>We recognise that engagement with the public increasingly occurs using social media. We will take a pragmatic approach and commit to tweet in both English and Welsh where content is targeted to a Welsh audience and responses will be provided in the same language as the comment or message which initiated the response.</p>

<h2 id="our-public-face">Our public face</h2>

<p>All our publicity, public information, exhibition and advertising material aimed at the Welsh public will be produced bilingually, or as separate Welsh and English versions. If the Welsh and English versions have to be published separately, both versions will be equal with regard to size, prominence and quality - and both versions will be available simultaneously and will be equally accessible.</p>

<p>Any advertisements placed in English language newspapers (or similar media) distributed mainly or wholly in Wales will be bilingual or will appear as separate Welsh and English versions (with both versions appearing simultaneously and will be equal with regard to size, prominence and quality).</p>

<p>Television, cinema and radio advertising targeting Wales specifically will be conducted in Welsh and English. Radio campaigns broadcast on Radio Cymru or during Welsh language programmes on commercial radio stations will be in Welsh. Our normal practice will be to avoid using Welsh language subtitles or dubbing adverts into Welsh.</p>

<p>Telephone response lines and other ways of responding to campaigns targeting Wales will be bilingual or will include a separate Welsh response service.</p>

<h3 id="publications">Publications</h3>

<p>Publications which are of interest to the general public will be made available in Welsh. Anything relating to Wales or an area of Wales will also be made available in Welsh. This will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>policy and consultation documents which relate to issues which are of interest to the general public</li>
  <li>pamphlets and leaflets targeting the general public</li>
  <li>forms and explanatory material aimed at the general public</li>
  <li>circulars and standard letters</li>
</ul>

<p>Where we produce material for the public bilingually, the Welsh and English versions will usually be published together and will be comparable. On occasions, both versions would be included in the same document where this was appropriate. Reasons for not including both versions in one document would be that it would be too lengthy or bulky or for practical or environmental considerations. Each version will note clearly that the material is available in the other language and be equally accessible.</p>

<p>If not available free of charge, the price of a bilingual document will not be greater than that of a single language publication - and the price of separate, Welsh and English versions will be the same.</p>

<p>The above will also apply to material made available electronically on our website.</p>

<h3 id="digital-services-and-information">Digital services and information</h3>

<p>All government department websites have been merged into GOV.UK. The GOV.UK website, run by the Government Digital Service (<abbr title="Government Digital Service">GDS</abbr>), collects together in a single place information and services from every UK government department, and hundreds of arms-length bodies. Our website will include pages in both Welsh and English and our normal practice will be to provide Welsh pages of interactive pages.</p>

<p>Whenever we post Welsh language versions of publications on the GOV.UK site, we will post them at the same time as English versions.</p>

<p>We will be working with the <abbr title="Government Digital Service">GDS</abbr> to provide translation of our web pages. We will ensure that the following appear on GOV.UK and intranet pages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>clear navigation to Welsh language pages</li>
  <li>Welsh language version of web pages provided by <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> Welsh Language Scheme (in Welsh and English) and Welsh language versions of published materials</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="forms-and-associated-explanatory-material">Forms and associated explanatory material</h3>

<p>Our normal practice will be to ensure that all forms and associated explanatory material for use by the public in Wales will be fully bilingual, with the Welsh and English versions together in one document. This will include interactive forms published on our website. If the Welsh and English versions have to be published separately, each version will note clearly that the material is available in the other language.</p>

<p>We will send bilingual forms to the public, where appropriate, unless we know that the recipients would prefer to receive the information in Welsh or English only. When other organisations distribute forms on our behalf, we will ensure that they do so in accordance with the above. Information input onto a Welsh version of the form will be input in Welsh.</p>

<h3 id="corporate-identity">Corporate identity</h3>

<p>Welsh headed letters will be produced for correspondence in Welsh.</p>

<p>Where documents are produced bilingually or in Welsh the name of <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>, Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, will remain to ensure the department’s brand identity but will have a descriptor in Welsh.</p>

<h3 id="official-notices-public-notices-and-staff-recruitment-notices">Official notices, public notices and staff recruitment notices</h3>

<p>Official notices public notices and staff recruitment notices placed in English language newspapers (or similar media) distributed mainly or wholly in Wales, will be bilingual, or appear as separate Welsh and English versions. Notices will be in Welsh in Welsh language publications.</p>

<p>The Welsh and English versions will be equal in terms of format, size, quality and prominence – whether produced as a single bilingual version, or as separate Welsh and English notices.</p>

<p>In the English language media, posts where the ability to speak Welsh is essential may be advertised in Welsh, with a brief description in English.</p>

<p>Recruitment notices placed in English language journals (and other publications) with a UK-wide distribution may be in English, unless the post is one where the ability to speak Welsh is essential, in which case the notice may be fully bilingual, or in Welsh with a brief explanation in English.</p>

<p>Any official notices, public notices or staff recruitment notices placed elsewhere in Wales will be bilingual.</p>

<h3 id="press-releases-and-contact-with-the-media">Press releases and contact with the media</h3>

<p>Press releases to the media in Wales will be issued in Welsh and English when the issue is of particular interest to the public in Wales. Where deadlines permit, the Welsh and English versions will also be issued at the same time.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-the-scheme">Implementing the scheme</h2>

<h3 id="staffing">Staffing</h3>

<p>We will seek information about the Welsh language skills of existing staff, and job applicants, where the job requires close contact with the Welsh speaking public.</p>

<h3 id="recruitment">Recruitment</h3>

<p>For any posts having extensive and regular contact with the public in Wales we will consider whether fluency in Welsh should be a desirable or essential skill – and this will be stated in job competencies and advertisements.</p>

<h3 id="language-training">Language training</h3>

<p>We will consider supporting and funding training for staff, who as part of their duties, have extensive and regular contact with the public in Wales – and who wish to learn, or improve their Welsh. We will allow staff to attend courses during work where necessary.</p>

<h3 id="vocational-training">Vocational training</h3>

<p>Whenever practicable, we will provide vocational training in Welsh to develop the ability of staff who, as part of their duties, have extensive and regular contact with the public in Wales.</p>

<h3 id="information-and-communications-technology">Information and Communications Technology</h3>

<p>The need to provide information and services in Welsh, and operate in accordance with this scheme, will be catered for as we develop, design and purchase information and communications technology products and services.</p>

<p>As we develop or procure <abbr title="Information and Communications Technology">ICT</abbr> systems we will take into account the Commissioner’s <abbr title="Information and Communications Technology">ICT</abbr> standards.</p>

<h3 id="partnership-working">Partnership working</h3>

<p>When we are the strategic and financial leader within a partnership, we will ensure that any public service aspects comply with this scheme except where the partner delivering the service has a Welsh language scheme. In these circumstances, our service will comply with the delivery partner’s scheme.</p>

<p>When we join a partnership which another organisation is leading, our input to the partnership will comply with this scheme and we will encourage the other partners to comply, unless the lead organisation has a Welsh Language scheme. In these circumstances, we will encourage the partnership to comply with the lead organisation’s scheme.</p>

<p>When we are a partner in a consortium, we will encourage the consortium to comply with this scheme. When acting in the name of the consortium, we will operate in accordance with this scheme. Where we act in consortium with other organisations that also have Welsh language schemes, we will encourage the consortium to decide to abide with one scheme in all its work.</p>

<p>The above refers only to partnerships dealing with services available to the public in Wales.</p>

<h3 id="internal-arrangements">Internal arrangements</h3>

<p>The measures in this scheme carry the full authority, support and approval of our organisation.
Managers will have the responsibility for implementing those aspects of the scheme relevant to their work. The Head of the Information Rights Unit will coordinate the work required to deliver, monitor and review this scheme.</p>

<p>A detailed action plan about how we will operate the scheme will be prepared and regularly updated. The action plan will come into effect on the date on which the scheme comes into effect. The plan will include targets, deadlines and a report on progress against each target.</p>

<p>The scheme will be publicised to our staff, and to the public in Wales. It will be published on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Existing guidance used by our staff will be amended to reflect the measures contained in this scheme.</p>

<p>We will arrange briefing and training sessions for staff whose work is significantly impacted by the revision of the scheme. This will increase awareness of this scheme and explain how it will affect their day to day work.</p>

<p>We will ensure that we use only qualified translators or interpreters to help with the delivery of this scheme via <abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> Services.</p>
