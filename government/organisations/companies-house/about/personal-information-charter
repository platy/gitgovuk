<h2 id="if-youre-an-officer-of-a-company-or-other-corporate-entity">If you’re an officer of a company or other corporate entity</h2>

<p>This section of the privacy notice sets out how the Registrar of Companies (“the registrar”) handles the personal data of officers of companies and other corporate entities, and sets out how the registrar ensures that the public register of companies (“the register”) complies with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>).</p>

<p>For further information on what it means to be a company officer, and further detail on how your personal data can be protected, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/your-personal-information-on-the-public-record-at-companies-house">please see this guide</a>.</p>

<h3 id="identity-of-controller-and-data-protection-officer-dpo"> Identity of controller and Data Protection Officer (<abbr title="data protection officer">DPO</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The registrar is the controller of your personal data. This means it’s the registrar who decides how and why your personal data is processed. The Companies Act 2006 requires the registrar to collect and publish information, including the personal data of officers of companies and other entities, on the register.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances (for instance if an individual or company is being investigated for a criminal offence) the controller may be Companies House’s sponsoring department, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy">Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy</a> (BEIS). Companies House is an Executive Agency of BEIS and as such many of the day to day controller responsibilities have been formally delegated to Companies House.</p>

<h3 id="purpose-for-processing"> Purpose for processing</h3>

<p>Personal data featuring on the public register of companies is processed for the purpose of making data available for public inspection under a statutory obligation. The registrar’s legal basis for processing is described in more detail below.</p>

<h3 id="lawful-basis-for-processing"> Lawful basis for processing</h3>

<p>The registrar is required by the Companies Act 2006 to make certain information, including personal data, publicly available. Part 35 of the Companies Act 2006 sets out the registrar’s obligations, including the requirement to make information, including personal data, available for public inspection. Part 35 of the Companies Act 2006 also sets out many of the requirements for handling personal data – including how it can be rectified in certain circumstances, and how inaccuracies can be amended.</p>

<p>While the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> is a European Regulation and therefore has direct effect, it does offer some flexibility to Member States. The Data Protection Act 2018 introduces some domestic exemptions for the UK. Paragraph 5 of Schedule 2 Part 1 of the DPA 2018 provides the following exemption from the “listed <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> provisions”:</p>

<p>“The listed <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> provisions do not apply to personal data consisting of information that the controller is obliged by an enactment to make available to the public, to the extent that the application of those provisions would prevent the controller from complying with that obligation.”</p>

<p>Since the registrar is required by the Companies Act to make information available to the public, they’re entitled to rely on this exemption. Therefore, they have an exemption from some elements of the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the requirement to provide ‘privacy notices’ to individuals</li>
  <li>the requirement to provide personal data in response to subject access requests</li>
  <li>the requirement to rectify personal data when it is inaccurate</li>
  <li>the requirement to comply with requests to be ‘forgotten’</li>
  <li>most of the principles of the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This means it’s unlikely the registrar will be required, or able, to comply with any exercise of these <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> rights in respect of personal data appearing on the public register. For example, the registrar will be unable to comply with any request for an individual to be ‘forgotten’ from the public register where they have a legal obligation under the Companies Act to continue to make this personal data available.</p>

<p>If you have any queries or concerns about this, please contact the <abbr title="data protection officer">DPO</abbr> at <a href="mailto:dpo@companieshouse.gov.uk">dpo@companieshouse.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3 id="presenters-details">Presenters’ details</h3>

<p>If you file a paper form, you have the option to include certain contact details for the presenter of the form. If you include these presenter details, they’ll be placed onto the public record in the same way as all other information contained within the filing.</p>

<h3 id="what-we-do-with-your-data"> What we do with your data</h3>

<p>Before becoming an officer of a company or other entity, it’s important that you’re familiar with the legal implications. As a company officer, we’re required by law to publish some of your personal data on the register. The register is publicly available and accessible by anyone.</p>

<p>Commercial organisations sometimes use data from the register to create their own online products. These organisations then become controllers of your personal data. These organisations must establish how they comply with the data protection law as set out in the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>. If you have any concerns about company data on third party products and websites, please contact the organisation directly. We’re not able to advise other organisations on <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> compliance, and we cannot advise you on whether other organisations are complying with the law.</p>

<h3 id="non-public-data"> Non public data</h3>

<p>Some of your personal data will not be made available to the public. This includes the address you provide as your usual residential address and the day of your date of birth. We must collect this information, but it will not be placed on the public register, as long as you do not provide it when asked to give a service address.</p>

<p>We may share your personal data with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>other government departments and enforcement agencies</li>
  <li>debt recovery agents and their appointed solicitors</li>
  <li>Legal Counsel (in rare complex cases)</li>
  <li>commercial printers (for instance when we need to print statutory notices)</li>
</ul>

<p>Sharing will only take place in certain circumstances, and only where permitted or required by law.</p>

<p>If you’re a director or PSC of a company, The Companies Act 2006 also allows the registrar to share information on your usual residential address and your full date of birth with credit reference agencies, unless you qualify for protection. This information is not placed onto the public register.</p>

<h3 id="data-processors"> Data processors</h3>

<p>Since the registrar is a controller for personal data appearing on the register, the registrar is not acting as a data processor (as defined by the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) when maintaining a public register. Individuals, companies, agents and other representatives provide personal data for the public register because they’re required to by law, and not for the registrar to process personal data on their behalf. Because of this, the registrar does not have to provide a ‘statement of <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> compliance’, or compliance with Article 28 of the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> as a data processor.</p>

<p>In some cases, we employ third-party organisations as data processors to carry out elements of processing. For example, an external company to shred paper filings which may contain personal data, or the use of third-party software solutions hosted in the cloud. In all cases, contracts with these companies have been reviewed for the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>, and we’ve had assurance from all third-party processors of their own <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> compliance.</p>

<p>The organisations we employ under contract as data processors are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cloud services in the UK or EU/EEA</li>
  <li>UK based contact centre</li>
  <li>UK based secure disposal</li>
  <li>adjudicators for appeals of late filing penalties</li>
  <li>UK based debt recovery</li>
  <li>mail delivery and printing</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="overseas-transfers"> Overseas transfers</h3>

<p>The register of companies is freely accessible and available to the public, including overseas. Article 49(1)(g) of the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> states that a transfer of personal data overseas can take place in the absence of specific safeguards where the transfer is made from a register intended to provide information to the public. This means we do not need to consider the adequacy of data protection regimes in all countries before making the public register freely available online.</p>

<h3 id="retention-of-personal-data"> Retention of personal data</h3>

<p>Companies House retains all records of companies as long as they’re active. Records of dissolved companies are retained for 20 years, before they’re transferred to the Public Records Office at The National Archives (<abbr title="The National Archives">TNA</abbr>). This includes all information relating to company directors or its officers.</p>

<p>In response to some concerns about data privacy, we stopped publishing dissolved company records over 6 years old on our free <a rel="external" href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/">Companies House Service</a>. This interim measure will continue while we review our retention policy on dissolved records. Any changes to the retention period will be subject to public consultation.</p>

<p>However, dissolved company records over 6 years old can still be accessed through <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house/about-our-services">our other search services</a>.</p>

<p>Companies House has an agreement with <abbr title="The National Archives">TNA</abbr> to transfer a selection of our records 20 years after a company is dissolved. This agreement, and the criteria for selection, is set out in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/osp25-regulation-of-companies-final.pdf">operational selection policy</a> which can be found on <abbr title="The National Archives">TNA</abbr>’s website.</p>

<p><abbr title="The National Archives">TNA</abbr> will direct us to destroy any records that are not transferred.</p>

<p>You can apply to remove your residential address if it’s publicly available in records of live and dissolved companies.</p>

<p>If you have a complaint about the way we’re managing your personal data, you can let us know in the first instance by writing to <a href="mailto:dpo@companieshouse.gov.uk">dpo@companieshouse.gov.uk</a>.</p>

Such as, if an individual or company is being investigated for a criminal offence.</p>

<h3 id="data-processors-1"> Data processors</h3>

<p>When you write to us or call us, your enquiry will usually be handled by our contact centre (unless you have an ongoing case with a specific team at Companies House).
