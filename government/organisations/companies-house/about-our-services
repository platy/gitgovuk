<ol>
  <li>A certificate of incorporation with certified facts</li>
  <li>A certified copy of a document held on the register</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="additional-facts-which-can-be-included-on-an-incorporation-certificate">Additional facts which can be included on an incorporation certificate</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Due to changes brought in by the Small Business Enterprise and Employment Act, you can’t order certificates with information on shareholders, shareholdings or statement of capital.</p>

  <li>Secretaries names</li>
  <li>Registered office address</li>
  <li>The company’s objects</li>

</ol>

<p>The good standing wording says that a company has been in continuous, unbroken existence since its incorporation and that no action is currently being taken to strike the company off the register.</p>

<p>We’ll only issue a good standing statement if the company is up to date with its filings. It also has to be a private limited company with at least one director who is a natural person or a public limited company with a secretary and at least 2 directors (one of which is a natural person).</p>

<p>Companies House isn’t responsible for any costs incurred after you’ve received your order (such as courier or legalisation costs).</p>

<h3 id="legalisation-of-a-document-or-certificate">Legalisation of a document or certificate</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">get a document legalised</a> with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office">Foreign and Commonwealth Office (<abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr>)</a>. In countries who have signed up to the Hague Convention of 1961, this gives the document the same authenticity it has in the UK.</p>

<p>To get a Companies House document legalised by the <abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr>, it must have the original signature of a British public official. To get a document signed in person by one of our officials, you’ll need to request a certified certificate or certified copy.</p>

<h2 id="dvd-dir">DVD directory</h2>
<p>Our DVD directory contains basic company details on all 3 million live companies registered in the UK, along with companies that have become dissolved in the last month.</p>

<p>The DVD has a built in search facility that allows up to 6 combinations of searches on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>company name</li>
  <li>company number</li>
  <li>registered office address lines</li>
  <li>postcode</li>
  <li>date of incorporation or range of dates</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Standard industrial classification">SIC</abbr> code(s) or description</li>
  <li>company type</li>
  <li>company status</li>
  <li>accounts type.</li>
</ul>

<p>The directory is produced monthly and a one off copy costs £30, or a year’s subscription for £300 - copies are available from our <a href="#info-centres">information centres</a> and <a href="#cc-info">contact centre</a> on (0)303 1234 500.</p>

<p>The DVD directory doesn’t show details of annual turnover, telephone numbers or directors’ details.</p>

<p>The data can’t be exported, but we do provide a one off version of the directory with exportable files at a cost of £1,000. The maximum number of results that can be exported at one time is 30,000.</p>

<p>The data on each DVD is available for six months from the date of purchase after which time it locks and you will be unable to access the data.</p>

<p>The product requires Internet Explorer to be set as the default browser and is not compatible with Apple Mac computers.</p>

<p>eg. company number 02050399 would be represented as:
<a rel="external" href="http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/02050399">http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/02050399</a></p>

You can also return other data formats including RDF, JSON, <abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>, <abbr title="Comma separated values">CSV</abbr> and YAML.</p>

<h2 id="protected-online-filing-proof">PROtected Online Filing (PROOF)</h2>

<p>Designed for users of our online filing or software filing service, the protected online filing (PROOF) scheme can help you prevent fraudulent changes to your company.</p>

<p>This free service lets you protect your company from unauthorised changes to your records. It prevents the filing of certain paper forms, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>changes to your registered office address</li>
  <li>changes to your officers details</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protect-your-company-from-corporate-identity-theft">More information on the PROOF service</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a rel="external" href="https://extractives.companieshouse.gov.uk">Start using the extractives service now</a></p>
</div>

<p>The extractives filing service is designed to help undertakings meet their obligations to deliver reports to the registrar as set out in <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2014/9780111122235/contents">The Reports on Payments to Governments Regulations 2014</a>.  Reports can only be delivered to the registrar electronically, under regulation 14(3) of the 2014 Regulations.  Reports cannot be delivered by paper.</p>

<p>Companies House requires that this is done through the preparation of an <abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> file using the <a rel="external" href="http://xmlgw.companieshouse.gov.uk/extractives.shtml">extractive reports schema</a> provided by Companies House.</p>

<p>Use the extractives service for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>filing your report</li>
  <li>searching company reports</li>
  <li>viewing a company’s filing history</li>
  <li>downloading company reports</li>
</ul>

<p>The service is available 24/7 for the submission and searching of information. Any submissions which require manual inspection will only be processed during <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house/about/access-and-opening">our normal working hours</a>.</p>

<p>You can only file extractives reports by using the <a rel="external" href="https://extractives.companieshouse.gov.uk">extractives service</a>.</p>

<p>The fee for filing an extractives report is £250.</p>

<h3 id="register-for-the-extractives-service">Register for the extractives service</h3>
<p>You’ll need to register a password and email address, then request an authentication code for your company - which is sent to your company’s registered office by post, so allow plenty of time for delivery.</p>

<h2 id="software-filing">Software filing</h2>

<p id="sw-info">Our software filing service enables the submission and acknowledgement of electronic company data between presenters and Companies House via our <abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> Gateway.</p>

<p>The service is open to everyone but will mostly benefit those who file frequently - on a daily or weekly basis. The more documents you file, the more appropriate software filing is likely to be.</p>

<p>Software filers can submit all the same <a href="#wf-forms">forms that can be filed using the WebFiling service</a>, plus additional types of company accounts and incorporations.</p>

<p>To use the software filing service you’ll need to <a href="#ef-acc">open an online filing account</a> and must either <a href="#buy-sw">purchase suitable software</a> or <a href="#dev-sw">develop your own</a>.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://resources.companieshouse.gov.uk/toolsToHelp/efilingfaq.shtml">More information about software filing</a>.</p>

<h4 id="buy-sw">If you want to purchase software</h4>

<h4 id="ef-acc">Opening an online filing account</h4>
<p>You will need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-a-companies-house-online-filing-presenter-account">open an online filing account</a> if you want to use software to file information. Once opened, the presenter information you need to use the service will be sent to you by post. If you open a credit account, any filing fees will be itemised on the monthly statement you receive.</p>

<p>You can choose to pay by variable direct debit. You can also sign up to use our online <a href="#ebill-info">eBilling service</a> to access your invoices quicker.</p>

<h4 id="dev-sw">Developing your own software</h4>
<p>To develop your own software, you will need to have expertise in eXtensible Markup Language (<abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>).</p>

<p>A technical interface specification giving detailed information for software developers is available via email <a href="mailto:xml@companieshouse.gov.uk">xml@companieshouse.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>The transaction types and submission processes are documented on our <a rel="external" href="http://xmlgw.companieshouse.gov.uk/SchemaStatus">schema page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="cost-recovery">Cost recovery principles</h3>

<p>As a <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1991/1795/contents/made">Trading Fund</a> Companies House must operate on the basis of cost recovery. It has a statutory duty to break even over time and to achieve an average annual return (surplus) of 3.5%.</p>

<p>Companies House fees are linked, as required by European Law and HM Treasury guidance, to the forecast cost of providing each service and the way in which customers access them. A number of things are considered when Companies House sets its fees.</p>

<p>Guidance on <a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130129110402/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/psr_mpm_index.htm">Managing Public Money</a> requires fees to be set to recover the full cost for each separate service allowing for a cost of capital of 3.5% - this prohibits cross-subsidy between different services.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/;ELX_SESSIONID=SDGTJwxJXbsXJJZLRxfjYjQF1lGZShS8hDJ1htmsRbDyrZvQ9Jh4!-722011569?uri=CELEX:31968L0151">The EC First Company Law Directive</a> requires copies of company records to be made available at the administrative cost of producing them.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31969L0335:EN:HTML">The EC Capital Taxes Directive</a> allows company registration costs to be met from fees, but prohibits charges that are effectively taxes. This means that prices cannot be set above costs for the relevant services.</p>

<p>Case law, such as <a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?isOldUri=true&uri=CELEX:61995CC0188">Fantask A/S e.a. v Industriministeriet Erhvervministeriet</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!CELEXnumdoc&lg=en&numdoc=61991J0071">Ponente Carni SpA and Cispandana Costruzioni SpA v Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato</a> provides further guidance on the costs that can and can’t be taken into account for setting fees.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/41/contents">Competition Act 1998</a> prohibits the abuse of a dominant position in a market.</p>
