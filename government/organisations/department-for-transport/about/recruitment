  <li>policy advice</li>
  <li>digital comms</li>
  <li>engineering</li>
  <li>economics</li>

  <li>human resources</li>
  <li>IT</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-skills-we-value">The skills we value</h2>

<p>You’ll find specific descriptions in the advertisements we post for jobs but the essential skills you will need are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>being able to work in a team - we don’t run transport services directly ourselves, we work with our delivery partners like train and bus companies, local authorities etc</li>
  <li>self-motivation</li>
  <li>excellent communication skills, so we can negotiate with, and influence, our partners effectively</li>
</ul>

<p>We also value people who can demonstrate excellent leadership and management skills.</p>

<p>Above all we are looking for people who are enthusiastic and motivated about improving transport.</p>

<h2 id="the-benefits-of-working-with-us">The benefits of working with us</h2>

<p>Many of our staff say it’s the interesting, varied and worthwhile work that’s the real benefit for working with us.</p>

<p>Our staff get:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>Transport is a very high profile area. Everyone relies on the transport network in one way or another, whether it is to get to work or school, visit friends and relatives or the movement of freight so there is food in the shops. Our staff know how important their work is and how they fit in.</p>

<h3 id="flexible-working-patterns">Flexible working patterns</h3>

<p>Our full time staff based both in and outside London work 37 hours a week, excluding lunch breaks.</p>
