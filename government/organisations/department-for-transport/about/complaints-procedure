<h3 id="step-1">Step 1</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>To make a complaint about our service, use the <a rel="external" href="https://forms.dft.gov.uk/make-a-complaint-about-the-department-for-transport">complaints form</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Or you can write to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Maladministration Complaints 
<br></br>Department for Transport 
<br></br>D/04, Ashdown House 
<br></br>Sedlescombe Road North 
<br></br>St Leonards on Sea 
<br></br>East Sussex 
<br></br>TN37 7GA 
<br></br>
</p></div></div>

<p>Telephone: 0300 330 3000</p>

<p>The responsible policy division will consider the complaint and respond in writing within 20 working days of the complaint being received in the department.</p>

<h4 id="data-protection">Data protection</h4>

<p>Each part of <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> has its own separate complaints handling process. The personal data and other information you provide will be passed to the relevant part of <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> or to the relevant <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> family delivery body (eg DVLA, DVSA or Highways England) so that your complaint can be investigated and responded to by the appropriate team or body. The personal data you provide will be used only in relation to the handling of your complaint. Where the complaint is for the central <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> to respond to, your data will be held for up to 4 years and then deleted. Where your complaint is for a <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> agency or other delivery body to respond to, your data will be held in accordance with that body’s retention policy for complaints.</p>

<p>Find out more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/dft/privacy-policy"><abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>’s privacy policy</a>.</p>

<h3 id="step-2">Step 2</h3>

<p>If you have been through step 1 and are not happy with the outcome, then you can ask that your complaint be passed to the head of the division you have been dealing with. You can ask that your complaint is passed onto their line manager if the complaint is about the head of division themselves or if the head of division considered your complaint at step 1.</p>

<p>You will receive an acknowledgment of your complaint within 5 working days and the department will aim to send you a full response within 20 working days. Please note that the central department is not able to consider complaints that relate to the Department for Transport’s agencies or other bodies. Each agency and public body has its own separate complaints procedure which you will need to follow.</p>

<h2 id="the-independent-complaints-assessor">The Independent Complaints Assessor</h2>

<p>If you feel your complaint is still unresolved after going through the above complaints procedure, and your complaint is about the quality of the service we have provided or a member of our staff, you can ask us to refer your complaint to a Department for Transport Independent Complaints Assessor (<abbr title="Independent Complaints Assessor">ICA</abbr>).</p>

<p>Details of how to ask for your complaint to be referred to an <abbr title="Independent Complaints Assessor">ICA</abbr> will be included with the step 2 complaint response.</p>

<p>Find out more information about what the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/independent-complaints-assessors-for-the-department-for-transport">ICAs cover and how to complain to them</a>.</p>

<h2 id="parliamentary--health-service-ombudsman">Parliamentary & Health Service Ombudsman</h2>

<p>There may be times when you’ve tried to resolve the complaint with us direct, including having received an independent review by the <abbr title="Independent Complaints Assessor">ICA</abbr>, and you’re still dissatisfied.</p>

<p>If so, you may want to ask a Member of Parliament to refer your complaint to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (<abbr title="Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman">PHSO</abbr>).</p>

<p>You can find out more on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.ombudsman.org.uk"><abbr title="Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman">PHSO</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>It’s important to follow the steps in the complaints process as set out above for the central department, or for the agency or other body that you’ve been dealing with. The <abbr title="Independent Complaints Assessor">ICA</abbr> and <abbr title="Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman">PHSO</abbr> will both expect you to have tried to resolve your complaint at the earlier stages of our complaints procedure before they look into it.</p>

<h2 id="complaints-about-legislation-or-government-policy">Complaints about legislation or government policy</h2>

<p>This page tells you how to complain if you’re unhappy with our service to you.</p>

<p>This complaints procedure does not cover complaints about government policies or laws. If you want to complain about a policy or a law you should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport">contact the department</a> or <a rel="external" href="https://findyourmp.parliament.uk">your local MP</a>.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-1">Step 1</h3>

<p>If you are unhappy with the way we have handled your request for information (ie an <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> request or a request handled under the Environmental Information Regulations), or with the decisions made in relation to your request, you may complain in writing to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

<abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> Team
<br></br>Zone D/04  
<br></br>Ashdown House  
<br></br>Sedlescombe Road North  
<br></br>Hastings  
<br></br>East Sussex TN37 7GA  
<br></br>
</p></div></div>

<p>Email: <a href="mailto:FOI-Advice-Team-DFT@dft.gov.uk"><abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr>-Advice-Team-DFT@dft.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>An independent <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> official who was not involved in making the original decision will then carry out an internal review of our department’s handling of your request. We aim to complete internal reviews within 20 working days, although in complex cases we may occasionally need longer. The independent reviewer will write to you setting out their decision.</p>

<p>You should also write to the same address if you have a complaint about our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport/about/publication-scheme">publication scheme</a>.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-1">Step 2</h3>

<p>If you are unhappy with the results of <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>’s internal review, you may appeal to the <a rel="external" href="https://www.ico.org.uk">Information Commissioner</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a question about the outcome of a Data Protection Act query please contact the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport/about/personal-information-charter#data-protection-contacts">Data Protection Officer</a>.</p>
