<h2 id="our-objectives">Our objectives</h2>

<p>Our 3 overarching equality, diversity and inclusion objectives are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an inclusive Workplace: ‘A workplace that is inclusive and flexible, and where everyone is treated fairly and with respect’</li>
  <li>a Diverse Workforce: ‘A workforce that is reflective of our diverse society at all grades’</li>
  <li>Fair and Accessible Services: ‘Fair treatment, fair outcomes and equal access for all our service users’</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-were-doing">What we’re doing</h2>

<p><abbr title="Ministry of Justice">MOJ</abbr> is working hard to achieve a more inclusive workplace where staff are encouraged to be themselves and deliver their best at work.</p>

<p>We are also determined to build a workforce that is more representative of the UK’s diverse communities and communities of interest.</p>

<p>We know that by achieving these two objectives, we will be best placed to support our third objective: the delivery 
of fair and accessible services to all those who use them, and to those who come into contact with the criminal justice system.</p>

<p>We protect all employees and members of the public accessing our services from discrimination in the workplace as set out in the Equality Act 2010.</p>

<p>But in addition, we create an inclusive culture where all staff and our service users are treated with respect for who they are and what they do regardless of their:</p>

<ul>
  <li>age</li>
  <li>disability or long-term illness</li>
  <li>gender, gender identity or expression</li>
  <li>race (including colour, ethnic origin, nationality or national origin)</li>
  <li>religion or belief or non-belief</li>
  <li>sexual orientation</li>
  <li>marriage and civil partnership status</li>
  <li>pregnancy and maternity status</li>
  <li>social or educational background</li>
  <li>any other irrelevant attribute</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="increasing-diversity-representation-at-all-levels-and-equality-of-opportunity-for-everyone">Increasing diversity representation at all levels and equality of opportunity for everyone</h3>

<p>We have a number of projects and programmes to address under-representation and ensure equality of opportunity for everyone , including:</p>

  <li>access to mentoring opportunities</li>
  <li>keeping our recruitment and performance management processes under review for disproportionate outcomes and developing interventions where necessary</li>
  <li>Positive Action Pathway to build skills and confidence, and realise the potential of under-represented employees who identity as <abbr title="black, Asian and minority ethnic">BAME</abbr>, disabled or LGBTQI </li>
  <li>Coaching Squared to provide peer-to-peer coaching for <abbr title="black, Asian and minority ethnic">BAME</abbr>, <abbr title="lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender">LGBT</abbr> and women employees</li>
  <li>helping women back into careers in technology by mentoring and hosting the Mums In Technology coding school</li>
</ul>
