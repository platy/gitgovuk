<p>The director of the Northern Ireland Office is responsible for overseeing the delivery of the our objectives as set out in our <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/northern-ireland-office-business-plan-2011-to-2015">business plan</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to policy teams covering the range of reserved matters, the office also has a ministerial private office, press office and a finance and administration section.</p>

<h2 id="audit-and-risk-committee">Audit and Risk Committee</h2>

<p>The Audit and Risk Committee is a sub-committee of our management board. It assists the accounting officer and the board in their responsibilities. The committee monitors the departmentâ€™s risk management and its internal controls on a quarterly basis during the financial year. The committee provides assurance to the board on systems of corporate governance, risk management and internal control within the department and its funded bodies.</p>

<p>At the point of devolution, the board concluded that a single non-executive director, supported by 2 independent members on the Audit and Risk Committee, was appropriate to the size of the restructured department and in line with similar bodies. However, following a recent review, the board is now considering whether it would be appropriate to appoint a second non-executive director.</p>
