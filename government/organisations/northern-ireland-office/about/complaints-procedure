<p>Our definition of a complaint is: any written or spoken expression of dissatisfaction with the service provided by a member of staff or the department.</p>

<p>This covers complaints made against staff (by telephone, or in writing by letter or e-mail) in the NIO about delays in replying to letters, not answering telephones, alleged rudeness, etc. Complaints may be made by other government departments, agencies, and non-departmental public bodies, as well as by members of the public.</p>

<p>It is our policy to respond to all enquiries promptly and courteously. Although we work hard to provide a good service, sometimes things go wrong. We aim to provide a procedure for handling complaints confidentially, fairly and speedily.</p>

<p>A complaint about the departmentâ€™s refusal to provide information will be dealt with under the provision of the Freedom of Information Act which came into force on 1 January 2005.</p>
