<p>The Data Protection Act 1998 regulates the management of personal
information.</p>

<p>This Information Charter sets out the standards you can expect from the
Northern Ireland Office when we request or hold information (“personal data”)
about you. “Personal data” is information that relates to identifiable living
individuals. It does not include information relating to dead people, groups of
people, organisations or businesses. The Data Protection Act 1998 regulates
the management of personal data.</p>

<p>We may need to handle personal information about you so that we can provide
better services for you. This is how we look after that information.</p>

<p>When we ask you for personal information, we promise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to make sure you know why we need it;</li>
  <li>to ask only for what we need, and not to collect too much or irrelevant
information;</li>
  <li>to protect it and make sure nobody has access to it who shouldn’t;</li>
  <li>to let you know if we share it with other organisations to give you better
public services – and if you can say no;</li>
  <li>to make sure we don’t keep it longer than necessary;</li>
  <li>not to make your personal information available for commercial use
without your permission.</li>
</ul>

<p>In return, we ask you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>give us accurate information;</li>
  <li>tell us as soon as possible if there are any changes, such as a new
address.</li>
</ul>

<p>This helps us to keep your information reliable and up to date.</p>

<p>You can get more details on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how to find out what information we hold about you and how to ask us to
correct any mistakes;</li>
  <li>agreements we have with other organisations for sharing information;</li>
  <li>circumstances where we can pass on your personal information without
telling you, for example, to prevent and detect crime or to produce
anonymised statistics;</li>
  <li>our instructions to staff on how to collect, use and delete your personal
information;</li>
  <li>how we check the information we hold is accurate and up to date;</li>
  <li>how to make a complaint.</li>
</ul>
