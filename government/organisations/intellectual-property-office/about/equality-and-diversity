<h2 id="equality-and-diversity">Equality and diversity</h2>

<p>We are committed to promoting equality and valuing diversity in the way we deliver our services and the way we manage our employees. We strive to be inclusive through respecting one another, promoting and achieving equality of opportunity, valuing diversity, and providing an accessible, responsive service to our customers.</p>

<p>Further information about the work we have been doing is included in our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ipo-diversity-and-inclusion-report-for-2017-2018">Diversity and inclusion report for 2017-2018</a>.</p>

<h2 id="our-people">Our people</h2>

<p>IPO is committed to making this a great place to work, where staff are offered flexibility and development, where everyone’s contribution is recognised and diversity is genuinely valued.</p>

<p>As an employer it is IPO policy to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>promote a working environment free from discrimination, harassment and victimisation</li>
  <li>ensure that all decisions relating to employment practices are objective, free from bias, and based solely on work criteria and individual merit, with due account taken of an individual’s personal circumstances and the needs of the business</li>
  <li>ensure that disabled employees or job applicants are not placed at a substantial disadvantage by a working practice or policy and to make reasonable adjustments when needed</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gender-pay-gap-at-the-ipo">Gender pay gap at the IPO</h2>

<p>The gender pay gap is measured to demonstrate due regard to equality and that the IPO’s pay system complies with the Equality Act 2010 by being fair and transparent.</p>

<p>The tables below show that we have calculated the pay gaps using both mean (<abbr title="Mean is the arithmetic mean is the most typically used measure of the ‘average’ of a set of values. This is calculated by dividing the sum of the values by the number of values">?</abbr>) averages and median (<abbr title="Median in comparison with mean, median is another way to find the ‘average’ of a set of values. This is calculated by ordering the values and taking the central value as the average">??</abbr>) averages. The dataset has been based on basic pay as at 01 August 2015, which includes the 2015/16 pay award. Allowances and other payments such as overtime have been excluded.</p>

<p>Percentage differences shown as less than 0 indicate that the pay gap favours women and where it is greater than 0, men have the lead.  Zero percentages indicate no difference.  Women made up 44% of the workforce in August 2015.</p>

<h2 id="outreach-activities">Outreach activities</h2>

<p>IPO works with ethnic business clubs, universities, Business Links, chambers of commerce and female innovators to increase awareness of the wealth-creating potential of intellectual property rights. Firms can attend IPO seminars or subscribe to the IPO E-newsletter. To date our <a rel="external" href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ip4b/ip4b-uk/iphealthcheck.htm">IP Health Check online tool</a> has been accessed over 22,000 times. IPO works in partnership with Aardman Animations to reach aspiring young innovators and entrepreneurs. The Wallace and Grommit Cracking Ideas online game about intellectual property has been played more than 4.5 million times.</p>

<h2 id="access-to-copyrighted-material">Access to copyrighted material</h2>

<p>The UN Convention on disability rights states that its parties must: ‘ensure that laws protecting intellectual property rights do not constitute an unreasonable or discriminatory barrier to access by persons with disabilities to cultural materials’.</p>

<p>UK copyright law allows accessible copies of copyright material to be made by, and on behalf of, people with visual impairment and for designated bodies to sub-title broadcasts. This means that it is possible to make a Braille book from a print book, for example, without infringing copyright.</p>

<p>The government is currently consulting on whether these existing laws need to be simplified and extended to cover a wider range of media and disabilities to ensure wider access.</p>

<p>The UK is also actively engaged in World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) negotiations to improve access to copyright works by visually impaired people around the world.</p>

<p>Access to the information we publish can be requested in alternative formats, including large print, audio cassette or Braille.</p>
