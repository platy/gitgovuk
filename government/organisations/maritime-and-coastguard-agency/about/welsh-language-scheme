<p>The Maritime and Coastguard Agency continues to operate in line with its ‘Statement of Undertaking’ implemented in 2012 in relation to the Welsh language.  The agency’s buildings in Wales have bilingual signage, regular and volunteer Coastguards and its marine surveyors wear working clothing with branding in both Welsh and English, and its official vehicles are similarly configured.  Any correspondence received in Welsh is replied to in that language. In the last financial year we have issued leaflets to the public about taking measures to ensure safety whilst walking on coastal paths and in the coming months the agency has plans to produce leaflets providing information about the new helicopter service ready for the base launches at Caernarfon and Cardiff.</p>
