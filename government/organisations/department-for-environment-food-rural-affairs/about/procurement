<h2 id="contract-opportunities">Contract opportunities</h2>

<p>We are keen to offer under-represented businesses such as <abbr title="small to medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> and voluntary and community sector organisations the same opportunities to compete for our contracts as other qualified suppliers. 
We widely publicise our procurements on the following websites:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk/web/login.shtml"><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s e-tendering site</a> – you can browse tendering opportunities and manage your tender activity (registration is required)</li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.ojec.com">Official Journal of the European Union (<abbr title="Official Journal of the European Union">OJEU</abbr>)</a> – relevant categories are also advertised in <a rel="external" href="http://www.tendersdirect.co.uk/Sector/TED/Default.aspx?gclid=COiXmqeI_7gCFU3LtAodi3AAOQ">Tenders Electronic Daily (TED)</a>, the supplement to the <abbr title="Official Journal of the European Union">OJEU</abbr> in line with the department’s obligation under the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Procurement Directives</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/contracts-finder">Contracts Finder</a> - is the main source of government contracting opportunities available to the open market, worth more than £10,000</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-become-a-supplier">How to become a supplier</h2>

<p>All of our contracts are awarded by competition between potential suppliers, unless there are compelling reasons why competition cannot be used.</p>

<p>You need to register on <a rel="external" href="https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk/web/login.shtml"><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s e-tendering site</a> to be able to enter one of <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s competitions.</p>

<p>Upon registering you are able to add selected categories of interest to your business and create automated email alerts for procurements that you may be interested in. If the category is preceded with ‘##’, this indicates that the category is not one of our approved categories, but it may still be used in some circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="guidelines-for-an-effective-tender">Guidelines for an effective tender</h2>

<p>How you prepare and present your tender proposal can be a crucial factor in securing a contract. You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read the invitation to tender (ITT) properly – understand fully what is being asked of you</li>
  <li>respond in the required format – follow the layout requested, keep to the order for documents if one is given, send it to the person named and get the address right</li>
  <li>give full answers – this is your only chance, so give solutions and answer the whole question, but be concise</li>
  <li>be upfront – our ITT will be as honest about the requirement as possible</li>
  <li>plan ahead to ensure you meet the deadline</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sustainable-procurement">Sustainable procurement</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> is committed to procuring sustainably in accordance with the following policy statements and commitments:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/defra-s-sustainable-procurement-policy-statement"><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s sustainable procurement policy statement</a></li>

  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greening-government-commitments">Greening government commitments</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To support its aims <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> seeks to minimise its own environmental impact. We aim to incorporate sustainable development into our thinking and our actions.</p>

<h3 id="government-sustainability-requirements">Government sustainability requirements</h3>

<p>Suppliers should consider social, economic and environmental aspects of sustainability with reference to the standards listed below.</p>

<p>The government’s commitments for 2010 to 2015 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce waste, reduce water usage and procure more sustainably are set out in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greening-government-commitments-operations-and-procurement">Greening Government Commitments: Operations and Procurement</a></p>

<p>The minimum level <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/sustainable-procurement-the-government-buying-standards-gbs">government buying standards</a> are mandatory in central government. There are also voluntary, higher level best practice and class leader standards:</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> is working to align the government buying standards with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>’s <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/gpp/index_en.htm">Green Public Procurement (<abbr title="Green Public Procurement">GPP</abbr>) standards</a> so that they are at least as good, if not better.</p>

<p>These budgets set the course for achieving the government’s 2050 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/reducing-the-uk-s-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-80-by-2050/supporting-pages/carbon-budgets">target of an 80% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050</a></p>

<p>This scheme operates a ‘cap and trade’ mechanism, providing a financial incentive to reduce energy use in large organisations by putting a price on carbon emissions. In <abbr title="Carbon Reduction Commitment">CRC</abbr>, organisations buy allowances equal to their annual emissions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/reducing-demand-for-energy-from-industry-businesses-and-the-public-sector--2/supporting-pages/crc-energy-efficiency-scheme"><abbr title="Carbon Reduction Commitment">CRC</abbr> Energy Efficiency Scheme</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>’s <a rel="external" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=LEGISSUM:l27042">Energy Performance of Buildings Directive</a> requires energy certificates for buildings on construction, sale and lease and large public sector buildings to display energy certificates to the public.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.breeam.com/">Building Research Establishment’s Environmental Assessment Method (<abbr title="Building Research Establishment’s Environmental Assessment Method">BREEAM</abbr>)</a> measures best practice in environmental design and management. Public sector bodies must achieve a rating of ‘excellent’ in new builds and at least ‘very good’ in major refurbishments.</p>

<h2 id="supporting-small-businesses">Supporting small businesses</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> recognises the important role of <abbr title="small to medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> in delivering UK economic growth and prosperity. In March 2016, the government set a new aspirational target to award 33.3% of spend with third-party suppliers to <abbr title="small to medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> by 2020.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> is committed to supporting this target. We encourage <abbr title="small to medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> to bid for departmental business and we monitor the level of business <abbr title="small to medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> receive from us directly (by winning contracts) or indirectly (by winning contracts with prime contractors or further down supply chains).</p>

<p>We want as many <abbr title="small to medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> as possible to compete for our contracts. If <abbr title="small to medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> want further information about how to do so, please contact <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> Procurement at <a href="mailto:network.procurement@defra.gsi.gov.uk">network.procurement@defra.gsi.gov.uk</a>.</p>
