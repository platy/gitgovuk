<p>We recognise that it may sometimes be necessary to complain about the way <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> or an individual has provided a service. These complaints are known as “service standards complaints” and <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> has a formal and transparent complaints process in place to handle them. Please note though that the service standards complaints process does not relate to internal complaint processes for staff nor objections about the department’s policies.</p>

<p>Before making a service standard complaint, please also consider whether it relates to <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>, or one its 36 agencies and other bodies. Many of these bodies will have their own complaints procedures and the principal agencies can be contacted via the following links:</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have a service standard complaint about the way we operate or the services we provide, you should first tell us by telephone, in writing or via email. We have a 3 stage process designed to deal with complaints quickly, effectively and fairly.</p>

<h3 id="stage-1">Stage 1</h3>

<p>In most cases it is possible to resolve your complaint immediately by informing the person you are dealing with that you are not satisfied. So please make our staff aware of your complaint as soon as possible and we will do all we can to resolve it to your satisfaction. The official will aim to respond to you in writing within 15 working days.</p>

<p>If you are unhappy with the response you receive at this stage, you can ask for your complaint to be passed to a senior manager.</p>

<h3 id="stage-2">Stage 2</h3>

<p>If a response from the relevant official does not resolve your complaint it should be escalated to the Deputy Director for that policy area. The Deputy Director will aim to respond to you in writing within 15 working days.</p>

<p>If you are unhappy with the response you receive at this stage, you can refer your complaint to the Service Standards Complaints Adjudicator.</p>

<h3 id="stage-3">Stage 3</h3>

<p>If you are still unhappy with the way your complaint has been handled, you should write to <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s Service Standards Complaints Adjudicator at:</p>
