<h2 id="our-staff">Our staff</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Foreign & Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> employs around 13,000 staff around the world. Roughly a third is made up of UK-based British Civil Servants whose careers typically include work in the UK and postings overseas; and around two thirds are employed locally by our British Diplomatic missions overseas (such as an Embassy, High Commission, or Consulate). Applicants for these roles should be based in that country and usually need to be able to work in the main local language. For information on our local staff vacancies, please visit the <a href="http://www.gov.uk/government/world">web page for the country you are interested in working in</a>.</p>

<h2 id="recruitment">Recruitment</h2>

<p>Recruitment into the <abbr title="Foreign & Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr>’s UK-based workforce is normally either as a generalist into the Diplomatic or Home Civil Service cadres where staff rotate between a variety of roles, including overseas, or as a specialist (taking up a specific role requiring specialist skills, such as research analysts, lawyers).</p>

<p>All appointments to the <abbr title="Foreign & Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> are made in strict accordance with the key recruitment principles of the <a rel="external" href="http://civilservicecommission.independent.gov.uk/civil-service-recruitment/">Civil Service Commission.</a></p>

<p>The Civil Service-wide recruitment freeze introduced in May 2010 limits new appointments to frontline and business-critical jobs only. This has generally restricted <abbr title="Foreign & Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> generalist recruitment permitted under the freeze to the <a rel="external" href="https://www.faststream.gov.uk/diplomatic-service/">Diplomatic Service Fast Stream</a>.

<p>Undertaking work experience or internship with us does not in any way guarantee future employment with the <abbr title="Foreign & Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> or offer any preferential treatment in the selection processes. Our recruitment for permanent employment is merit-based in strict accordance with the key recruitment principles of the Civil Service Commission.</p>
