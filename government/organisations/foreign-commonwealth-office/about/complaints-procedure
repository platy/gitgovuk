<p>The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is committed to providing a high quality consular service. To do this we welcome any comments you have about our service, to tell us when we get things wrong and when we get things right. We use this feedback to assess and improve our services.</p>

<p>If you want to make a complaint about a consular service you have received from the FCO or one of our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies">embassies, high commissions or consulates abroad</a>, we want to help you resolve it as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>If you would like to compliment us on our services, or if you have other comments about our services, we want to hear from you too.</p>

<h2 id="visas-and-passports">Visas and passports</h2>

<p>We are not able to respond to any queries or complaints about UK visas or British passports. You should contact <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-visas-and-immigration/about/complaints-procedure">UK Visas and Immigration</a> if your complaint is about UK visas or contact <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-passport-office/about/complaints-procedure">HM Passport Office</a> if your complaint is about British passports.</p>

<h2 id="making-a-complaint-about-a-consular-service">Making a complaint about a consular service</h2>

<p>We will investigate your complaint fully and do our best to give you a full reply within 20 working days. If we cannot give you a full reply within this time, we will tell you when we expect to do so. We will acknowledge your complaint and let you know when you should expect to receive our response</p>

<p>If you are making a complaint on behalf of another person, we are required to have written signed consent from that person allowing us to share their personal information with you before we can reply.  Please email us, providing a signed authority if this applies to you.</p>

<p>There are 2 stages to our complaints procedure:</p>

<h4 id="stage-1">Stage 1</h4>

<p>Please send details of your complaint either by email to <a href="mailto:feedback.consular.services@fco.gov.uk">feedback.consular.services@fco.gov.uk</a>, or in writing to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

<br></br>Consular Directorate 
<br></br>Room WH4.36
<br></br>Foreign and Commonwealth Office 
<br></br>King Charles Street 
<br></br>London 
<br></br>SW1A 2AH
<br></br>
</p></div></div>

<p>Alternatively, you can telephone us: 020 7008 1500. We may ask you to confirm your complaint in writing to us, if possible. We can only reply to complaints by either email or letter.</p>

<h4 id="stage-2">Stage 2</h4>

<p>If you are not happy with our initial response, you can escalate your complaint to the Director of Consular Services by email to <a href="mailto:feedback.consular.services@fco.gov.uk">feedback.consular.services@fco.gov.uk</a>, or in writing to:</p>

<br></br>King Charles Street

<br></br>SW1A 2AH
<br></br>

<p>The Director will see all complaints and will ask for an investigation to be carried out by a member of staff who is not directly connected to your case or to your complaint.</p>

<h3 id="next-steps">Next steps</h3>

<p>If you are not satisfied with the response from the Director, then you can write directly to your Member of Parliament (MP), asking them to raise your complaint with the Parliamentary and Health Services Ombudsman.</p>

<h3 id="the-parliamentary-and-health-services-ombudsman">The Parliamentary and Health Services Ombudsman</h3>

<p>The Ombudsman will normally only consider cases that have previously followed our process and relate to “maladministration” (a service failure including poor administration or applying the rules incorrectly). The Ombudsman will normally only accept complaints referred to them by an MP. There are more details about this in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.ombudsman.org.uk/">Parliamentary and Health Services Ombudsman’s website</a>.</p>
