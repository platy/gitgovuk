<h2 id="feedback-and-research-at-fco">Feedback and research at FCO</h2>

<p>The FCO promotes the United Kingdom’s interests overseas, supporting our citizens and businesses around the globe. We offer a wide range of services handling anything from a major crisis evacuation to the issue of emergency travel documents or verification of a document.</p>

<p>We aim to provide a high quality service and are keen to receive feedback, which we use to assess and improve the way our services are provided and work with a small number of partner research agencies to collect feedback about our services.</p>

<p>If you apply for a service online you will be offered an opportunity to provide consent at the time of application. You will be able to make an informed choice about whether or not you wish to share your personal data (name, email, telephone and service you received/reason why you contacted us) for the purposes of being contacted for feedback by our partner agency.</p>

<p>If you provide consent to share your data you will not automatically be selected for an interview; our partner agency randomly select customers to participate.</p>

<p>Your data will continue to remain protected at all times and processed in accordance with the applicable data protection legislation including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act (DPA).</p>

<p>If you are not an online customer but instead have sought consular assistance overseas and have provided your contact details as part of that service, you may be approached by us to ask you to take part in our feedback programme. We may do this via a number of channels; over the phone, via SMS text, email or face to face.</p>

<p>If you provide consent to share your data, you may later withdraw that consent at any stage, including after you have shared feedback. You can withdraw consent by emailing <a href="mailto:consular.research@fco.gov.uk">consular.research@fco.gov.uk</a>, stating “withdrawal of consent” in the subject line of the email and providing your full name, email address and the name of the service you received.</p>

<p>Please see the research privacy notice for more information.</p>

<p>If you wish to make a complaint, or provide any other feedback about consular services, please visit <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office/about/complaints-procedure">Complaints, compliments and feedback</a>.</p>
