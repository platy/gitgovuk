<h3 id="audit-and-risk-assurance-committee">Audit and Risk Assurance Committee</h3>

<p>The Audit and Risk Assurance Committee (ARAC) supports the Permanent Under-Secretary to ensure there are effective arrangements for governance, risk management and internal control. It has no executive responsibilities, but reviews the comprehensiveness, reliability and integrity of assurances provided to the Management Board; challenges the executive; and promotes best practice across the <abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr>. It meets quarterly, chaired by Non-executive Director Warren Tucker, and has 2 other non-executive members, Simon O’Regan and Ann Cormack.</p>

<h3 id="executive-committee">Executive Committee</h3>

<p>Executive members of the Management Board meet weekly as the Executive Committee.  The Committee also monitors the implementation of agreed policies and agrees proposals not requiring Management Board attention.</p>

<h3 id="investment-infrastructure-and-operations-committee">Investment, Infrastructure and Operations Committee</h3>

<p>The Investment, Infrastructure and Operations Committee provides oversight and assurance of the <abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr>’s Estates, IT and other investments. The Committee ensures decisions offer value for money and meet the business needs of the <abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> and One HMG overseas. The Committee provides the same level of oversight on <abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> programme spending with scrutiny focused on capacity, delivery model, financial requirements and fiduciary risk.  It is chaired by the Chief Operating Officer.</p>

<p>Read details of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-and-commonwealth-office-directors"><abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr>’s directors</a>, grouped by thematic and geographic responsibilities, as well as corporate and cross-cutting leaders.</p>

<h2 id="foreign-affairs-committee">Foreign Affairs Committee</h2>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/foreign-affairs-committee/">Foreign Affairs Committee</a> examines the expenditure, administration and policy of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (<abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr>), which includes the diplomatic service. The committee is appointed by the House of Commons. It comprises 11 backbench Members of Parliament from government and opposition parties.</p>

<p>The committee publishes Annual Reports which summarise its activities throughout the year. It also runs inquiries. Witnesses in a typical inquiry include ministers and officials from the <abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr>, together with a range of other witnesses depending on the nature of the inquiry. The usual culmination of a Foreign Affairs Committee inquiry is a report made to the House. The committee reaches conclusions and makes recommendations to the government in its reports. The <abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> gives a detailed response to the committee’s reports within 2 months of publication.</p>

<h2 id="the-house-of-lords-international-relations-committee">The House of Lords International Relations Committee</h2>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/international-relations-committee/role/">International Relations Committee</a> also scrutinises the work of the <abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr>. The Committee’s role is to consider the UK’s international relations by providing analysis of current and long-standing issues. The Committee undertakes inquiries which include taking evidence from ministers and other witnesses, and produces reports that make recommendations to the government. The <abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> provides detailed responses to these recommendations within 2 months.</p>

<h2 id="european-scrutiny-committee">European Scrutiny Committee</h2>

<p>Another committee which examines the <abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr>’s work in the European Union (EU) is the <a rel="external" href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/european-scrutiny-committee/">European Scrutiny Committee</a>.</p>

<p>This is the principal committee in the Commons for scrutinising the EU and the UK government’s interaction with it, and in particular it assesses the legal and/or political importance of each EU document and decides which should be debated by Parliament.</p>

<p>Its main purpose is to ensure that the House of Commons and other organisations and individuals have a chance to influence UK ministers on EU proposals and to hold UK ministers to account for their activities in the EU Council of Ministers.</p>

<h2 id="house-of-lords-european-union-committee">House of Lords European Union Committee</h2>

<p>The House of Lords <a rel="external" href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/eu-select-committee-/">European Union Committee</a> scrutinises and reports on proposed European legislation before it is agreed in the EU and starts its work at the earliest possible stage in the EU decision-making process. The Minister for Europe at the <abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> often appears before its enquiries.</p>
