<h3 id="how-purchasing-is-organised-in-hmrc">How purchasing is organised in <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The vast majority of <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> contracts of significant value or complexity are let by the Commercial Directorate. Commercial Directorate is responsible for providing support for specific procurement projects, as well as much of the procurement and contract management of goods and services in the department.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> also has specialist teams supported by Commercial Directorate to contract manage major IT and estates contracts, including those established under the private finance initiative. These teams are also responsible for some IT and estates related procurement activity.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is responsible, on behalf of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/crown-commercial-service">Crown Commercial Service</a> for the government-wide procurement of print and office solutions under the centralised category procurement (<abbr title="centralised category procurement">CCP</abbr>) programme.</p>

<h3 id="advice">Advice</h3>

<p>Although there are clear benefits from doing business with the government, it is important to be aware of the differences there might be in this market. In general, you should expect bidding procedures to be more exacting since, unlike the private sector, the aim is to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

<h3 id="how-hmrc-selects-suppliers">How <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> selects suppliers</h3>

<p>The first stage for selecting a supplier is to prepare and agree the specification for the goods and services required to see if these can be procured from an existing enabled contract or framework agreement. Where this is not possible, the following thresholds will determine the procurement approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>low value orders up to £10,000 – five written quotes</li>
  <li>£10,001 to £100,000 – mini-tender exercise advertised on Contracts Finder</li>
  <li>above £100,000 – full competitive tender exercise advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union (<abbr title="Official Journal of the European Union">OJEU</abbr>) and/or on Contacts Finder in accordance with the EU Procurement Directives</li>
</ul>

<p>The department does not hold an approved supplier list, so for low-value orders for goods and services, the following will be used to identify potential sources of supply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>suppliers’ catalogues</li>
  <li>trade information</li>
  <li>telephone directories</li>
  <li>national, local and trade press</li>
</ul>

<p>The EU threshold, above which a full <abbr title="Official Journal of the European Union">OJEU</abbr> tender exercise should be carried out, is currently £118,133, but our internal thresholds provide a safety net and encourage good practice.</p>

<p>More general information about tendering for public sector contracts can be found on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tendering-for-public-sector-contracts">Tendering for Public Sector Contracts website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="advertisements-and-invitations-to-tender-itts">Advertisements and Invitations to Tender (ITTs)</h3>

<p>All <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> <abbr title="invitation to tenders">ITT</abbr> opportunities are advertised on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contracts-finder">Contracts Finder</a>.  Additionally, for larger requirements, for goods and services or works contracts subject to the EU rules on procurement, an advertisement will also be placed in the <abbr title="Official Journal of the European Union">OJEU</abbr>.  Larger contracts may encompass the needs of other departments or agencies and will be enabled for them to use.</p>

<p>Advertisements and tender documents will always give a contact point from which to obtain further information. Where <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> uses a two-stage tender (restricted) procedure, it will issue a selection questionnaire (<abbr title="pre-qualification questionnaires">SQ</abbr>) to enable applicants to be selected to be invited to tender. However, in line with the government’s aim to reduce the burden on <abbr title="Small and Medium sized Enterprises">SMEs</abbr> and encourage them to bid for public sector work, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will use the one-stage tender ‘open procedure’ where appropriate, which removes the need for a separate <abbr title="pre-qualification questionnaires">SQ</abbr> stage.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> routinely uses an eSourcing tool called <a rel="external" href="http://hmrc.supplier-eu.ariba.com/ad/register/SSOActions?type=full">SAP</a> to manage its procurement exercises.</p>

<p>All ITTs will include the technical specifications and timescales, and will be the subject of the applicable <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> standard terms and conditions for goods and services.</p>

<h3 id="transparency">Transparency</h3>

<p>Suppliers and those organisations looking to bid for public sector contracts should be aware that if they are awarded a new government contract, the resulting contract between the supplier and the government will be published.  In some circumstances, limited redactions will be made to some contracts before they are published in order to comply with existing law and for the protection of national security.  For more information about the government’s commitment to transparency read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/letter-to-cabinet-ministers-on-transparency-and-open-data">Letter to Cabinet Ministers on transparency and open data (7 July 2011)</a></p>

<p>In line with this commitment, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is committed to publishing the following information relating to procurement and contracts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/spending-over-25-000"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>: spending over £25,000</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hmrc-government-procurement-card-gpc-departmental-spend-over-500"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Government Procurement Card (GPC) departmental spend over £500</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hmrc-exceptions-to-the-government-spending-moratorium"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> exceptions to the Government spending moratorium</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="terms-and-conditions">Terms and conditions</h2>

<p>The standard terms and conditions for goods and services reflect Cabinet Office terms and conditions and have been modified for use with the eSourcing tool.</p>

<h3 id="sustainable-procurement-at-hmrc">Sustainable Procurement at <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Sustainable purchasing (or procurement) is a process whereby organisations meet their needs for goods, services, works and utilities in a way that achieves value for money and generates benefits not only to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, but also to society and the economy too, while minimising damage to the environment.</p>

<p>Our goal is to become a national leader within government on sustainable procurement. More widely via the Procuring the Future: Sustainable Procurement National Action Plan for the UK, our ambition is to be amongst the leaders on sustainable procurement in the EU.</p>

<p>Further information relation to sustainable procurement in <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> can be found in the ‘<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Sustainable Procurement Strategy’ link below, containing detailed information on:</p>

<p>There are increasing opportunities for <abbr title="Small and Medium sized Enterprises">SMEs</abbr> to do business with government departments. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> tries to ensure that companies are invited to tender for work which is compatible with their capacity and capabilities, in line with government policy to encourage small firms. Where appropriate, requirements are divided into smaller lots to encourage participation by <abbr title="Small and Medium sized Enterprises">SMEs</abbr>.</p>

<p>The following information is designed to help <abbr title="Small and Medium sized Enterprises">SMEs</abbr> engage more easily with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and Government in general.</p>

You can use this to access and search for closed tender and contract documentation that has been published by government departments and agencies, as well as opportunities to bid for government work.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.fsb.org.uk/">Federation of Small Businesses</a> website gives small businesses information on dealing with government, research findings and information on any new initiatives.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www1.learndirect-business.com/business-courses/winning-the-contract/">Learn Direct</a> is a free online training course for <abbr title="Small and Medium sized Enterprises">SMEs</abbr> on how to win government contracts.

<h2 id="new-buying-and-invoicing-technology">New buying and invoicing technology</h2>

<p>If you are a supplier for <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, the Valuations Office Agency (VOA) or Revenue and Customs Digital Technology Services (<abbr title="Revenue and Customs Digital Technology Services">RCDTS</abbr>), you need to be aware of new buying and invoicing arrangements.</p>

<p>We will start to use SAP Ariba’s procure-to-pay technology platform in the autumn of 2019.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>We are asking suppliers to provide us with a point of contact for the new arrangements, and if you have not yet received an email from us, you will soon - please respond as soon as you can.</p>
</div>

<p>We will continue to support you throughout the transition process, and are happy to answer any queries you have about the new software. If you have any questions about the new process, please <a href="mailto:%20hmrc.aribasupplierenablement@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk">email us</a>.</p>

<p>The software is being introduced as part of a wider programme to make our administration more efficient and effective and we believe it will help you by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>giving you greater visibility of the end-to-end purchasing process</li>
  <li>enabling you to publish catalogue content from which our staff can order your goods and services</li>
  <li>enabling you to receive electronic purchase orders</li>
  <li>allowing you to submit electronic invoices</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prompt-payment-policy">Prompt Payment Policy</h2>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is committed to paying suppliers and organisations promptly.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has a mandatory purchase order policy – suppliers should always request a purchase order number to allow invoices to be paid promptly. Invoices without purchase orders will not be paid.</p>

<p>We:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consistently exceed the government’s target to pay 80% of undisputed invoices within 5 days. We aim to pay all compliant goods and services invoices as soon as they have been authorised by the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> official(s) responsible for the purchase order/contract</li>
  <li>adopt the principles of The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) <a rel="external" href="http://www.promptpaymentcode.org.uk/">prompt payment code</a>
</li>
  <li>pay suppliers in accordance with the terms of their contract, usually 30 days from receipt and verification of a valid invoice</li>
</ul>

<p>All invoices quoting a valid purchase order number should be sent in PDF format to the bill to ‘email address’ provided on the purchase order to ensure <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> can match it to the original order/contract. In particular, all information requested on the purchase order or as specified in the contract must be included to avoid delays in payment. Where the supplier lets a subcontract in connection with an <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> contract, they must include similar prompt payment terms to the above in respect of payments to the subcontractor.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-prompt-payment-performance-report"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> prompt payment performance report</a> shows the percentage of invoices that are paid promptly, and is published quarterly.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/revenue-and-customs-digital-technology-services-prompt-payment-performance-report">Revenue and Customs Digital Technology Services (<abbr title="Revenue and Customs Digital Technology Services">RCDTS</abbr>) prompt payment performance report</a> shows the percentage of invoices that are paid promptly, and is also published quarterly.</p>

<h2 id="enterprise-resource-planning-erp-systeme-trading-system">Enterprise Resource Planning (<abbr title="Enterprise Resource Planning">ERP</abbr>) system/e-trading system</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Enterprise Resource Planning">ERP</abbr>/e-trading system provides access to electronic catalogue and non-catalogue ordering systems for the purchase of goods and/or services. The system configuration is workflow-based in order to control access to content and approval of requisitions and orders, in line with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s financial approval limits.</p>

<h2 id="freedom-of-information-act-2000">Freedom of Information Act 2000</h2>

<p>The Freedom of Information Act 2000 (<abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr>) provides a statutory general right of access to information held by public authorities, or by those providing services for public authorities. This means that we have certain obligations under the Act to provide information when requested, provided that the information is not exempt from disclosure under the provisions of the Act.</p>

<p>We are committed to meeting responsibilities under <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr>, while respecting commercial relationships with contractors. Due consideration will be given to the potential impact on the commercial position of any of our contractors when responding to a request for information which may concern them.</p>

<p>All information submitted to the client may be subject to disclosure to a third party in response to a request for information under the Act.</p>

<h3 id="how-this-may-affect-contractors">How this may affect contractors</h3>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> may receive requests for information specifically concerning its commercial relationship with its contractors. We will consult with the contractor(s) concerned prior to responding to a request whenever reasonably practicable.</p>

<p>Contractors tendering for <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> work will be asked in the tender documentation to identify any information they consider to be exempt from disclosure under the Act.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> receives a request to disclose the information identified, it will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consider whether the information is, in fact, exempt</li>
  <li>consider whether the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information (unless the information benefits from an absolute exemption)</li>
  <li>consult with the contractor prior to disclosure of information whenever reasonably practicable</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will not be liable for any loss or damage suffered by contractors, whether in contract, tort or any other way as a result of <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> disclosing information in response to a request made under <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr>, if the information is not specifically considered by both <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and the contractor to be exempt under the provisions of the Act.</p>

<p>Contractors should note that if they provide <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> with any information marked ‘confidential’ or equivalent, this does not mean that <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> accepts any duty of confidence by virtue of that marking.</p>

<h3 id="exemptions-from-disclosure">Exemptions from disclosure</h3>

<p>The 2 main exemptions under the Act, which have particular relevance to procurement or contractual information are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>section 41 - information provided in confidence</li>
  <li>section 43 - information that is a trade secret or which, if released, may prejudice someone’s commercial interests</li>
</ul>

<p>Contractors can obtain further information on the Freedom of Information Act 2000 from the website of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.ico.org.uk/">Information Commissioner</a> who is responsible for enforcing the Act.</p>
