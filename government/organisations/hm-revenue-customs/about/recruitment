<h2 id="what-we-do">What we do</h2>

<p>Tax keeps the UK running. It pays for public services  including hospitals, schools, police, transport, defence and security. We are responsible for working out and collecting the taxes and duties that 50 million people and 5 million businesses pay.</p>

<p>We also pay and administer Child Benefit, Tax-Free Childcare, statutory pay and tax credits. We protect our citizens, for example, through enforcing the National Minimum Wage and Living Wage. And we help keep our borders safe and ensure that trade flows smoothly in and out of the country.</p>

<p>It’s not just what we do – it’s how we do it.</p>

<p>You will be working for the UK’s largest customer services organisation - our customers are central to everything we do.</p>

<p>We want people to feel confident that we treat everyone fairly and with respect, applying the law impartially, effectively and efficiently. And we want to make it as easy as possible for people to pay their taxes and as hard as possible for the minority who don’t.</p>

<p>Our ambition is to become the world’s most digitally-advanced tax authority. We are designing new systems, products and processes around customers to make it as easy as possible for them to deal with us.</p>

<p>As a result we continue to have one of the lowest tax gaps – the difference between what is owed and what is actually collected – in the world.  We have one of the largest and most dynamic IT operations in Europe and by 2020 we will be among the most digitally-advanced tax authorities in the world.</p>

<h3 id="investing-in-our-people">Investing in our people</h3>

<p>We touch the lives of everyone in the UK through the scale and range of our work. But we are united by our values: wherever we work and whatever we do, we strive to be professional, act with integrity, show respect and be innovative.</p>

<p>We take real pride in making <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> a great place to work, investing in our employees’ skills and career development, creating modern, state-of-the-art facilities and offering a range of flexible working patterns and benefits.</p>
