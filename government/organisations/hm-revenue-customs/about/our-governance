<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> was established by the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act (CRCA) 2005, which gives the legal powers and responsibilities of the department to Commissioners appointed by the Queen.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s status as a non-ministerial department is intended to ensure that the administration of the tax system is fair and impartial.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/jon-thompson--3">Sir Jonathan Thompson</a> is the First Permanent Secretary and Chief Executive, responsible for delivering the departmental strategy and for the organisation’s performance.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/jim-harra">Jim Harra</a> is the Second Permanent Secretary and Deputy Chief Executive, as well as the Tax Assurance Commissioner.</p>

<p>Together with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/about/our-governance#executive-committee">Executive Committee</a> they are responsible for running <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>We have a Lead Non-Executive, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/mervyn-walker">Mervyn Walker</a>, who chairs the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/about/our-governance#hmrc-board"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Board</a>.</p>

<h2 id="hmrc-commissioners">
<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Commissioners</h2>

<p>Our Commissioners are responsible for the collection and management of revenue, the enforcement of prohibitions and restrictions and other functions, such as the payment of tax credits. They exercise these functions in the name of the Crown.</p>

<p>The Commissioners are also entitled to appoint officers of Revenue and Customs who must comply with their directions. The way in which the Commissioners conduct their business is governed by the CRCA. Decisions relating to the resolution of our largest and most sensitive cases are decided by three Commissioners, chaired by the Tax Assurance Commissioner.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> currently has 7 Commissioners:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/jon-thompson--3">Sir Jonathan Thompson</a></li>

</ul>

<h2 id="executive-committee">Executive Committee</h2>

<p>The Executive Committee is the department’s main executive forum and the primary place in which Commissioners make their decisions. Individual committee members have portfolios of responsibility that span each line of <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> business and corporate service function.</p>

<p>The Executive Committee oversees and assures all of <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s work and is responsible for setting and delivering strategy. It also oversees the department’s performance, both in terms of immediate and future objectives.</p>

<p>Within a dedicated performance hub, displaying performance indicators agreed by the committee, it analyses <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> performance against targets and considers ways to improve performance in all areas, including both customer service and value for money.</p>

<p>The Executive Committee is additionally supported by 3 sub-committees:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strategy and Design Committee</li>
  <li>Organisational Capabilities Committee</li>
  <li>Strategic Performance and Resources Committee</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="strategy-and-design-committee">Strategy and Design Committee</h3>

<p>The Strategy and Design Committee provides high level oversight and direction of <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s corporate and functional strategies and their implementation across the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Business Framework. It also acts as the corporate design authority that masters <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> high level design.</p>

<h3 id="organisational-capabilities-committee">Organisational Capabilities Committee</h3>

<p>The Organisational Capabilities Committee leads the identification, definition and development of the Organisational Capabilities (human, tangible and intangible) required to fulfil <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s strategic ambitions. The Committee is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of organisational capabilities.</p>

<h3 id="strategic-performance-and-resources-committee">Strategic Performance and Resources Committee</h3>

<p>The Strategic Performance and Resources Committee provides strategic oversight of the resources available to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and strategic performance against the Business Plan. It will provide oversight of key corporate performance, efficiency, and productivity; highlighting opportunities, strategic gaps and issues. It will also oversee the strategic investment process.</p>

<h2 id="hmrc-board">
<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Board</h2>

<p>The role of <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Board is critical to our success as a non-ministerial department. The Board consists of the Lead Non-Executive, the Non-Executive Board Members, the Permanent Secretaries and the Chief Finance Officer as the standing members, with other executives attending as the agenda on risks and decisions dictate.</p>

<p>The Board is chaired by Mervyn Walker, as Lead Non-Executive, and helps to guide the department strategically by drawing upon wide-ranging public and private sector expertise.</p>

<p>The Board provides challenge, advice and assurance to the Permanent Secretaries and the executive team on developing and implementing their strategy, business plan and performance against that plan. The Board is advisory and does not have a role in operational decision-making, tax policy or individual taxpayer matters.</p>

<h3 id="board-membership">Board membership</h3>
