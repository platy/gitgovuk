<h3 id="how-we-use-your-information-for-research">How we use your information for research</h3>

<p>We collect information about you to enable us to carry out our lawful functions. For more information on this, see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-protection-act-dpa-information-hm-revenue-and-customs-hold-about-you/data-protection-act-dpa-information-hm-revenue-and-customs-hold-about-you"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Privacy Notice</a>.</p>

<p>We may use this information to undertake research, the findings from which are used to improve and develop the way we carry out our lawful functions.</p>

<p>Some of our research is undertaken by a contractor acting on our behalf. Where this is the case, we may pass some of your personal information to our contractor, so they can contact you to invite you to participate.</p>

<h3 id="why-were-able-to-do-this">Why we’re able to do this</h3>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/11/section/17">Section 17 of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act (<abbr title="Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act">CRCA</abbr>) 2005</a> provides the legal basis for passing personal information to contractors acting on our behalf.</p>

<p>This allows us to use information we acquire while carrying out our lawful functions for the purposes of our other functions. For example, information we collect for the purposes of collecting tax can be used for research to improve and develop other <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> services, without seeking the permission of individual taxpayers.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN">Article 6 (1) (e) of the General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>)</a> also allows us to collect and process your data in this way, to carry out our lawful functions.</p>

<h3 id="how-we-keep-your-information-safe">How we keep your information safe</h3>

<p>When conducting research, we adhere to legal requirements (for example, those in the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) and we take our responsibilities seriously.</p>

<p>Contractors commissioned to conduct research on our behalf are also required to comply fully with the requirements of the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>. All <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> research contractors are required to sign a confidentiality agreement for each research project, which makes their unlawful disclosure of information a criminal offence. More information about confidentiality is provided in <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/11/section/18">section 18 of The Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act</a>, which covers contractors acting on our behalf.</p>

<p>We limit the information passed to research contractors to include only what is necessary and relevant to the research.</p>

<p>This information can only be used for the purposes of the research project, and is erased once it is no longer required.</p>

<p>Information you provide when you participate in <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> research projects is used for research purposes only, and, unless you agree otherwise, the information you provide will be confidential. Any personal data that is used or collected as part of the research will only be kept as long as is necessary for the research.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-dont-want-to-take-part-in-a-research-interview">If you don’t want to take part in a research interview</h3>

<p>Participation in a research interview for <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is entirely voluntary, and you can withdraw at any point.</p>

<p>Where information held by us is used to invite you to participate in our research, you will usually receive a communication in advance informing you that the research is taking place. This will provide details of who to contact if you do not wish to participate, or wish to withdraw from the research at a later time.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-put-things-right">How to put things right</h3>

<p>If you are contacted to participate in research and think we haven’t complied with the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> principles in some way, you can complain to us.</p>

<p>You can complain using the contact details for the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> project manager in any communications you have received about the research project.</p>

<p>You can also request these contact details from any interviewer who contacts you to ask you to participate in a research interview.</p>

<p>Further details of your rights under the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and how to complain can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-protection-act-dpa-information-hm-revenue-and-customs-hold-about-you/data-protection-act-dpa-information-hm-revenue-and-customs-hold-about-you"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Privacy Notice</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-hmrc-datalab">The <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Datalab</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Datalab allows approved researchers to access de-identified <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> data in a government accredited secure environment.</p>

<p>The aim of the Datalab is to produce high quality analysis that benefits both <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and the wider research community.</p>

<p>Datalab projects are not commissioned by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="data-protection-policies-and-standards">Data protection policies and standards</h3>

<p>The Datalab follows <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s strict data protection policies. There are restrictions on working practices to safeguard taxpayer confidentiality. To become an ‘approved researcher’, institutions have to submit a proposal and complete a short training course.</p>

<p>The Datalab is governed by the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act (<abbr title="Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act">CRCA</abbr>) 2005, which dictates who <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> can allow to access their data and for what reasons.</p>

<p>Research proposals for the Datalab must serve one of <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s functions under the <abbr title="Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act">CRCA</abbr> 2005. See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/209602/HMRC_s_Policy_and_Legal_Framework_08-05-13.pdf">Disclosure for the purposes of <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s functions</a> for further information.</p>

<h3 id="organisations-who-can-apply-to-use-the-datalab">Organisations who can apply to use the Datalab</h3>

<p>Access to the Datalab is open to researchers from a UK academic institution or government department.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> also considers applications from not for profit organisations, such as independent research bodies. From April 2018, we will accept applications from commercial research groups, but only when commissioned by a government department.</p>

<p>International researchers will need to be affiliated, employed by, or studying at a UK university, government department or research organisation.</p>

<p>It’s important that your proposal shows how your research will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>useful for <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>improved using <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> data rather than other available sources</li>
</ul>

<p>The Datalab Team will then advise you on your project, and may request more detailed information.</p>

<p>Proposals are then evaluated against these criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contribution to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> functions</li>
  <li>long-term benefit to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>research design and likely impact of the research</li>
  <li>feasibility of the research</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is more likely to support projects that are relevant to contemporary research questions.</p>

<p>All research in the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Datalab must be independent, with the results intended for publication.</p>

<h4 id="using-and-matching-your-own-data">Using and matching your own data</h4>

<p>You will need to describe the data you would like to bring and the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Datalab Team will consider each dataset on a case by case basis.
