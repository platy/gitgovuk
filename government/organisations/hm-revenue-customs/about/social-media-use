<h2 id="why-hmrc-engages-in-social-media">Why <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> engages in social media</h2>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> uses social media to share useful information, and engage with people, where we believe this helps our customers and helps us to deliver our objectives.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/your-charter"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> “Your charter”</a> for more information.</p>

<h2 id="protecting-your-information">Protecting your information</h2>

<p>We strongly recommend that you do not discuss the details of your financial affairs on social media, or give out your personal financial details.</p>

<p>We have a duty to protect taxpayer confidentiality and so do not discuss the tax affairs of individual taxpayers over social media. This means we will use social media to answer general, but not personal, queries.</p>

<p>We cannot accept messages through social media as notification in respect of your tax affairs. Please see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-hmrc">Contact Us</a> for help.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> does not send notifications of tax rebates via social media or by email, and will not ask you to disclose personal or payment information via social media or by email. If you receive such a message, do not respond - it is not from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and may be malicious.</p>

<p>If you see an electronic message claiming to be from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> that you suspect may be fraudulent, please forward it by email to <a href="mailto:phishing@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk">phishing@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk</a>. Find more <a href="https://www.gov.uk/dealing-with-hmrc/phishing-scams">advice about online security</a> from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you engage with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> via social media – for example by asking us a question or making a comment – we may need to process your posting and the information it contains in order to respond.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/help/privacy-policy"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Privacy Policy</a> for more about how <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> uses information.</p>

<h2 id="information-provided-by-hmrc">Information provided by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Our engagement may include supplying information or answering questions. This engagement is intended as an informal channel which complements our formal communications. It does not overwrite <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s existing channels of communication or channels of accountability such as Parliament and Freedom of Information.</p>

<p>When we post detailed information, we will typically provide links to copies of the relevant material online, usually on GOV.UK. This is to provide assurance to readers that the material is genuine and comes from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Information on social media, including information provided by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, may be incorrect, out of context, out of date, or may not apply in all circumstances.  Always check the official <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> guidance on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Information provided by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> via social media is provided ‘as is’ and on the same basis as material on the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> website or GOV.UK.

</h2>

<p>We welcome feedback and ideas from our friends and followers and will try to add value to conversations where we can.</p>

<p>We always try to read messages directed to us and ensure that any emerging themes or helpful suggestions are passed to the relevant people in <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. However, due to resource constraints we will not always be able to reply individually to messages we receive.</p>

<p>In general, we prefer not to send or receive private or direct messages to keep conversations open and public.</p>

<p>We are bound by the Civil Service Code, and cannot engage on issues of party politics.</p>

<h2 id="friends-and-followers">Friends and followers</h2>

<p>If you follow us on social media we will not automatically follow you back. This avoids us having to spend time dealing with spam accounts, and helps keep discussions open by limiting the use of private or direct messages.</p>

<p>We will follow and read social media postings from organisations and individuals where appropriate and relevant to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and tax. We reserve the right to ignore, block or unfollow social media accounts we believe are malicious or spam.</p>
