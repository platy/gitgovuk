<h2>Ongoing FCO and DFID procurement</h2>

<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) unites development and diplomacy in a single department that brings together the UK’s international effort.</p>

<p>The FCDO is continuing to align commercial processes and procedures following the merger of the Department for International Development (DFID) and the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office (FCO).</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>From 27 June 2022 there is one Supply Partner Portal for the FCDO. Read the section <a class="govuk-link" href="#how-to-become-supply-partner">How to become a Supply Partner</a> for more information.</p>
</div>

<h3>Existing contracts and agreements</h3>

<p>For now, all existing contracts made under UK law with DFID or FCO remain valid. There is no need to novate or amend those contracts and the contractual terms remain unaltered. Existing grant funding agreements remain valid and will continue without amendment. If there is an agreement under foreign law which may require revision, we will deal with this on a case-by-case basis following local (foreign) law.</p>

<p>Supply partners with funding agreements in the name of DFID or FCO should ensure that their accounts payable function recognises payments from the FCDO.</p>

<h3>Current tenders</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>From 27 June 2022 there will be one Supply Partner Portal. Read the section <a class="govuk-link" href="#how-to-become-supply-partner">How to become a Supply Partner</a> for more information.</p>
</div>

<p>For any questions on current tenders, refer to the tender documentation and send any questions to the relevant contract officer via the supplier portal.</p>

<h2>Commercial strategy</h2>

<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) buys a wide range of goods, services and works. These range from construction and maintenance of embassies to technical assistance and goods across a range of sectors.</p>

<p>The FCDO Commercial Directorate’s vision is to provide commercial expertise which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>delivers timely goods and services</li>
  <li>maximises value for money and impact</li>
  <li>is fully aligned to FCDO and UK Government priorities</li>
  <li>drives commercial reform across FCDO and the UK government</li>
</ul>

<p>We tender contracts in accordance with UK procurement legislation, which ensures open and fair competition between bidders. This means our contracts are competitively tendered following a set of standard processes.</p>

<p>The commercial function is measured against the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/commercial-operating-standards-for-government">Government Commercial Operating Standards</a> which assesses all government departments against a common set of standards and indicators.</p>

<h2>How to become a Supply Partner</h2>

<h3>Supply Partner portal</h3>

<p>Former FCO and former DFID used different e-sourcing portals. FCDO Commercial have now aligned this element of our procurement process.</p>

<p>From 27 June 2022 all new procurements and existing contract amendments will now be through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://fcdo.bravosolution.co.uk/web/login.html" rel="external">Jaggaer portal</a> used by former FCO.</p>

<p>No further opportunities will be published on the former DFID portal. Only tenders concluding before 27 June 2022 remain on the former DFID portal.</p>

<p>All former DFID suppliers details have been migrated to the Jaggaer portal and live contracts on the former DFID portal have been transferred.</p>

<h3>How we pay supply partners</h3>

This includes <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/procurement-policy-note-0720-taking-account-of-a-bidders-approach-to-payment-in-the-procurement-of-major-government-contracts">Procurement Policy Note 07/20</a> which sets out how payment approaches can be taken into account in the procurement of major government contracts.</p>

<h2>Supply Partner Compliance</h2>

<h3>FCDO Terms and Conditions of Contract</h3>
<p>Prior to tendering for a FCDO Contract, tendering organisations should ensure that they are able to fully comply with FCDO’s Terms and Conditions which are available on our supplier portal.  If you are unable to comply with any of the terms, you should raise a clarification question during the tender process.  Failure to accept our terms during the tender may invalidate your bid.</p>

<h3>Supply Partner Compliance for former DFID contracts and those contracts awarded via former DFID processes</h3>
<p>Supply Partners should refer to the <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1009859/Supply-Partner-Code-of-Conduct-FAQ-FCDO-Aug21.pdf">Frequently Asked Questions</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">414 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">33 pages</span>)</span>, our <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1102788/Commercial-Frameworks-6Sept22.pptx">FCDO Current Frameworks</a> (<span class="type">MS Powerpoint Presentation</span>, <span class="file-size">95.4 KB</span>)</span> and <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/961447/DPS-Suppliers.pdf">List of current Construction DPS suppliers</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">402 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">1 page</span>)</span>, designed to guide all Supply Partner(s) through the steps required to respond efficiently and consistently to the Code of Conduct and to upload the required documentation.</p>

<h2>Supporting government policy</h2>

<h3>Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)</h3>

<p>We use the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/business-friendly-environment/sme-definition_en" rel="external">European Union definition of an SME</a>.</p>

<p>We support the government’s SME target of 33% of spend with third-party suppliers to SMEs by 2020 through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>regularly reviewing our procurement plans to ensure that they do not prohibit SME involvement</li>
  <li>researching the market and developing appropriate market engagement strategies to encourage competition and attract a diverse range of innovative suppliers</li>
  <li>tracking the amount of expenditure awarded to SMEs</li>
  <li>advertising our contracts and requiring FCDO Prime Contractors to advertise their sub-contract opportunities in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/contracts-finder">ContractsFinder</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sustainability</h3>

<p>We practise sustainable procurement to achieve value for money while minimising environmental damage and waste.</p>

<h3>Integrity in business</h3>

<p>UK companies that do business with integrity are better positioned to reduce risks and capitalise on commercial opportunities. This means complying with the UK Bribery Act and ensuring local partners, agents and distributors adhere to the same high standards. It also means being vigilant for modern slavery and other human rights abuses, both in operations and supply chains, in line with the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015.</p>

<p>Companies that make integrity core to their business protect and strengthen brand reputation, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.u4.no/publications/the-relationship-between-business-integrity-and-commercial-success" rel="external">enjoy greater and more sustainable commercial success</a> over the long-term, and minimise the risk of prosecution.</p>

<p>Tackling bribery and corruption creates more prosperous and healthy communities and a better business environment. It also enables the UK to maintain its status as a global leader in the fight against corruption.</p>

<p>FCDO staff engaged in procurement have a duty to act in a professional and impartial manner and to be mindful of the Bribery Act 2010. We expect our suppliers to act in accordance with the Act.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Justice has published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bribery-act-2010-guidance">extensive guidance on the Bribery Act</a>. Transparency International has also published guidance for business on <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/resist_resisting_extortion_and_solicitation_in_international_transactions" rel="external">how to resist demands for bribes</a>.</p>

<h3>Transparency</h3>

<p>We publish details of both contract opportunities and awards in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/contracts-finder">ContractsFinder</a> as well as details of government Procurement Card expenditure on GOV.UK.</p>
