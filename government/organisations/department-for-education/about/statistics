<h3 id="november-2018-statistics-update">28 November 2018: Statistics update</h3>

<p>We’re now looking to deliver on the recommendations made in our recent <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/standards-for-official-statistics-published-by-the-department-for-education">Hive IT - <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> dissemination discovery</a> and further strengthen our statistics ‘offer’.</p>

<p>We’ve now moved on to the next ‘alpha’ project phase to prototype a new <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> statistics dissemination platform to make our data and statistics easier to find, access, navigate and understand. The ‘alpha’ aims to build an online platform with improved navigation and greater consistency of information to help users more easily self-serve by accessing data and statistics in a way which most suits their needs.</p>

<p>This work is part of our wider plan to look at the overall <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/682865/Developing_DfE_Statistics_in_2018.pdf">coherence of <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> data and statistics</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re a user of our published national and official statistics and want to get involved with this work through user testing fill in our <a rel="external" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_mtubqX72Mo6UGQNS8ivwhqXd2uulcyGvsYEdDshdF7mbKw/viewform">questionnaire</a>.</p>

<h3 id="july-2018-statistics-update">3 July 2018: Statistics update</h3>

<p>Over the last 12 weeks Hive IT have been working with statisticians in the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> to better understand the needs of users of <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> statistics and data, and to make recommendations for how we can further strengthen our statistics ‘offer’.</p>

<p>The report <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/standards-for-official-statistics-published-by-the-department-for-education">Hive IT - <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> dissemination discovery</a> outlines the findings of their research, including the identified needs of our users and suggestions and recommendations as to what directions we should take for our next stage of statistics development. This is part of the wider work looking at the overall coherence of <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> statistics.</p>

<p>Following the update in December 2017, we have set out our plans for developing statistics over the coming year, to improve the coherence of our statistics and to further modernise our approach to dissemination.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/standards-for-official-statistics-published-by-the-department-for-education">Developing <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> statistics in 2018</a> outlines these plans, which includes details of how to get in touch with any questions about what we have proposed. Alongside these plans, we are undertaking user research to better understand how you want to access our data and statistics. We will provide an update on the outcome of that work in due course.</p>
