We will contact you within 15 working days from receiving your complaint, either with a full reply or to let you know what is happening if we have not finished our investigation.</p>

<h3 id="step-2">Step 2</h3>
<p>If you have followed step 1 and are not satisfied with our response, you can ask us to
review your complaint.</p>

<h3 id="step-3">Step 3</h3>

<p>If you have followed steps 1 and 2 and are still not satisfied, you may ask your Member of Parliament (<abbr title="member of Parliament">MP</abbr>) to raise the matter with our Director General.</p>

<p>If you are outside the UK <a rel="external" href="http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/find-your-mp-help/">follow the advice</a> to find an <abbr title="member of Parliament">MP</abbr> where you were last living in the UK. If you have never lived in the UK, or you are having difficulty contacting an <abbr title="member of Parliament">MP</abbr>, you can write to our Director General using our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/passport-advice-line">general enquiry address</a> or a Home Office minister via  the <a href="mailto:public.enquiries@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk">Direct Communication unit</a>.</p>

<h3 id="step-4">Step 4</h3>

<p>If you are still not satisfied, you can ask your <abbr title="member of Parliament">MP</abbr> to request an investigation by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (the Ombudsman). You can only do this through your <abbr title="member of Parliament">MP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The Ombudsman’s role is to investigate complaints by members of the public about the way government departments, and their executive agencies, have treated them.</p>

<h3 id="compensation">Compensation</h3>

<p>We realise that sometimes our mistakes may cause you expense or financial loss. In these cases, you should follow the instructions in step 1 and write us a letter. You should send any documents that prove your claim with the letter. We only normally offer compensation for financial loss which has occurred as a direct consequence of an error made by the General Register Office.</p>
