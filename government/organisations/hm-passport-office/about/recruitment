<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yts71R03JqM">Working for the Home Office</a></p>

<h2 id="who-we-are">Who we are</h2>

<p>As part of the Home Office, we issue passports to British nationals (who live in the country or abroad), and oversee civil registration services in England and Wales.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-do">What we do</h2>

<p>We’re responsible for processing over 6 million passport applications a year. That’s why providing a secure and efficient service is at the heart of everything we do. Our Passport Validation Service also helps to detect and prevent fraud, by allowing businesses or government departments to check the authenticity of customer details. Through the General Register Office, we manage all civil registration services for England and Wales – which includes issuing certificates for births, marriages and civil partnerships.</p>

<h2 id="what-its-like-here">What it’s like here</h2>

<p>We are trusted with millions of personal details, which means integrity and reliability are key for every single person in our teams. We uphold incredibly high standards, and work hard to provide a cost-effective service that’s valued. To join us, you’ll need to be methodical, organised, customer-focused, and able to make sound, informed decisions.</p>

<p>We always help our people to grow and strengthen their skills. So, no matter which level you join us at, we’ll make sure you feel supported and empowered. Alongside competitive salaries, we also offer a range of excellent benefits including: a pension, flexible working, a generous holiday allowance, childcare vouchers and a season ticket loan. We also offer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maternity, adoption or shared parental leave of up to 26 weeks’ full pay followed by 13 weeks’ statutory pay and a further 13 weeks unpaid</li>
  <li>paternity leave of 2 weeks’ full pay</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ve got 7 regional passport offices, and more than 50 passport interview offices dotted around the UK. Check out our latest vacancies below for opportunities near you.</p>

<h2 id="diversity">Diversity</h2>

<p>We have an incredibly broad remit at the Home Office, with our work affecting every citizen of the country. It’s essential that our organisation reflects the very best of 21st century Britain and we encourage applications from all backgrounds and circumstances. We recruit on merit after a fair and open selection process and support different ways of working, such as flexible working.</p>

<p>We’re proud to be a ‘Disability Confident Employer’ and we were the first organisation to be ‘Clear Assured’, which recognised our efforts to recruit and retain employees with disabilities. We also offer a guaranteed interview scheme for people with disabilities who meet our minimum selection criteria.</p>

<p>To date we have been recognised by the Times Top 50 Employers for Women, named as a Stonewall Star Performer, and listed by Business In The Community as an inclusive employer for race.</p>

<p>Employees have the opportunity to join our vibrant diversity staff support networks, including Gen (gender), The Network (black Asian and minority ethnic), Spectrum (LGBT+) and Able (disabilities). Our networks help raise awareness and help us build an inclusive culture where everyone can thrive and be themselves at work.</p>
