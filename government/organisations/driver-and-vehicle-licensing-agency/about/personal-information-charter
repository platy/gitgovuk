<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> is an executive agency of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport">Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>)</a>. Our goal is to get the right drivers and vehicles taxed and on the road, as simply, safely and efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>To meet our core responsibilities we maintain over 48 million driver records and over 40 million vehicle records, and collect around £6 billion a year in vehicle excise duty (<abbr title="vehicle excise duty">VED</abbr>).</p>

<p>This information charter explains the standards you can expect from us when we collect, hold or otherwise process information about you, and how we comply with data protection law. It tells you how you can get access to your information, and what you can do if you think we or third parties processing data on our behalf are not meeting these standards. It also explains how we safeguard your information and the circumstances in which we may release it. The information charter is linked to our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dvla-privacy-policy">privacy policy</a>.</p>

<p>We will review this charter annually and update it to take account of any changes in law or policy.</p>

<h2 id="personal-data">Personal data</h2>

<p>Data protection law defines personal data as any information about a ‘natural’ (ie living) person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by referring to information such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a name</li>
  <li>an identification number</li>
  <li>location</li>
  <li>an online identifier</li>
  <li>factors about the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that person</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="types-of-personal-information">Types of personal information</h2>

<p>We hold personal and non-personal data in a variety of databases and information stores. Many of these are critical to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>’s operations and law enforcement. We also have systems which support corporate functions such as human resources, facilities management and finance.</p>

<p>Categories of personal data we process include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>personal details</li>
  <li>financial details</li>
  <li>goods or services provided</li>
  <li>contact details</li>
  <li>social media identities</li>
  <li>market research and responses to surveys (including opinions and comments)</li>
  <li>visual images</li>
  <li>details of complaints, incidents and grievances</li>
</ul>

<p>In certain circumstances, we also process more sensitive information such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>health data</li>
  <li>criminal convictions and offences</li>
  <li>racial or ethnic origin</li>
  <li>religious or other beliefs of a similar nature</li>
  <li>trade union membership</li>
  <li>biometric data</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="accuracy">Accuracy</h2>

<p>When we collect personal data from individuals we will only collect the minimum information needed, and not excessive or irrelevant information. To help us to keep your information accurate and up to date, by law you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide us with accurate information</li>
  <li>tell us promptly about any changes such as a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/driving">change of name or address</a>
</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/health-conditions-and-driving">tell us</a> if you develop a medical condition or disability that may affect your fitness to drive, or your condition or disability has got worse since you got your licence</li>
</ul>

<p>You can apply to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/driving/driving-licences">update your driving licence</a> online. Or, you can return your driving licence to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>, Swansea, SA99 1BN with a letter explaining why it needs to be updated.</p>

<p>To <a href="https://www.gov.uk/change-name-address-v5c">update your vehicle log book (V5C)</a>, make the relevant changes on the V5C, sign and date the declaration in section 8 and return the whole document to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>, Swansea, SA99 1BA. We will send you a new V5C free of charge, usually within 4 weeks.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-keep-your-data-secure">How we keep your data secure</h2>

<p>We know how important it is to protect your privacy and comply with data protection law.</p>

<p>We will use appropriate measures to protect the personal data we process against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against loss, destruction or damage.</p>

<p>We will carry out regular reviews and audits to make sure that our processing activities meet the government’s security standards and industry good practice.</p>

<p>All our staff are trained annually on the importance of protecting personal data. Some staff receive additional training depending on the nature of their role.</p>

<p>Where we introduce new technologies, policies or processes, we will make sure that we consider your privacy from the outset. We will carry out data protection impact assessments where appropriate. This will allow us to identify any risks at an early stage, and find solutions to reduce or avoid these risks.</p>

<p>We will always carry out a data protection impact assessment where the processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals.</p>

<h2 id="your-rights">Your rights</h2>

<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) sets out a number of rights which individuals have over their personal data. These rights are explained fully on the <a rel="external" href="https://ico.org.uk/">Information Commissioner’s Office</a> website.</p>

<p>Here are the rights that are most likely to apply to how <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>, as a public authority, processes your personal data.</p>

<h3 id="your-right-to-be-informed">Your right to be informed</h3>

<p>The right to be informed is a key part of the transparency requirements of data protection law.</p>

<p>When we collect your personal information we will provide a privacy notice containing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>our contact details and our <abbr title="Data Protection Officer">DPO</abbr>’s</li>
  <li>the reasons why we need your information and the legal basis that supports our processing of it (including additional information about legitimate interests where applicable)</li>
  <li>a list of the types of recipients your  data may be shared with</li>
  <li>information on whether we are intending to transfer the data to an international organisation or country outside the EU and what safeguards will be in place to protect the data</li>
  <li>an explanation about how long we will store your data or the criteria we will use to decide how long to store it</li>
  <li>information about your rights</li>
  <li>information on whether providing us with the information is a statutory or contractual requirement and the consequences of not providing it</li>
  <li>information on whether we will be using any automated decision-making (including profiling), the logic used for processing it  and what impact it might have on individuals</li>
</ul>

<p>If a third party sent us your personal data we will aim to provide you with the information above, plus the source, within one month.</p>

<h3 id="your-right-of-access">Your right of access</h3>

<p>You can find out if we hold any personal information about you and request access to it by making a ‘subject access request’. If we hold information about you, we can give you a copy.</p>

<h2 id="release-of-information">Release of information</h2>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> manages a vast amount of data to help keep motorists moving safely and legally. <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> provides information to the police, local authorities and third parties where we are allowed to by law. When releasing personal data, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> acts responsibly and in accordance with data protection law at all times.</p>

<p>Regulation 27 of the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) Regulation 2002 covers the release of information from <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>’s vehicle register to private and public sector organisations providing they can demonstrate <a href="https://www.gov.uk/request-information-from-dvla">reasonable cause</a> to receive it. Reasonable cause is not defined in law but the government’s policy is that it should relate to the vehicle or its use, following incidents where there may be liability on the driver’s part.</p>
