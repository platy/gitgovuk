<p>Most of our information can be provided in other formats on request.</p>

<h2 id="corporate-diversity-and-inclusion-objectives">Corporate diversity and inclusion objectives</h2>
<p>There is a legal requirement for organisations to evidence that they are meeting their public sector equality duties under the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents">Equality Act 2010</a>. This duty is made up of general duties supported by specific duties. The development and delivery against these objectives are a way of demonstrating that the requirement is being met. <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> will deliver against their own <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dvla-equality-objectives">objectives</a> and <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> objectives.</p>

<h3 id="purpose-and-development">Purpose and development</h3>
<p>The purpose of setting specific, measurable equality objectives is to help to better perform the general equality duty, focusing on the desired outcomes. Equality objectives help focus attention on the priority equality issues within an organisation in order to deliver improvements in policy making, service delivery and employment, including resource allocation. The <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> corporate diversity objectives explain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> will do</li>
  <li>the aim of the objective</li>
  <li>the expected outcomes</li>
  <li>why we are doing this– evidence of key issues</li>
  <li>how this objective will be met</li>
  <li>how progress and achievement of outcomes will be measured</li>
</ul>

<p>The diversity objectives will be reviewed every four years or more frequently if needed. Additional objectives will be set as and when required to ensure that continued compliance with the Equality Act 2010 is achieved.</p>

<h3 id="consultation-and-engagement">Consultation and engagement</h3>
<p>One of the key elements of developing diversity objectives is consultation with stakeholder groups and staff and customer feedback. Consultation is ongoing to help <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> gain continued understanding of differing needs of our customers and staff, ensuring the provision of improved customer service.  The consultation process includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reviewing staff and disability surveys</li>
  <li>working with staff networking groups and local trade union</li>
  <li>working with <abbr title="Equality and Human Rights Commission">EHRC</abbr> Wales and other organisations in public and voluntary sector</li>
  <li>engaging with the community</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="equality-analysis">Equality analysis</h2>
<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> staff are provided with guidance and an equality analysis toolkit to help understand what is needed and why. 
The guidance explains that equality analysis assessments should be completed when a policy, process or practice is introduced or changed. This includes business plans, efficiency proposals and staff restructures.</p>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> publish completed equality impact assessment reports internally or externally as appropriate.
