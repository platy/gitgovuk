<h2 id="who-we-are">Who we are</h2>

<p>As part of the Home Office, we determine who has the right to visit or stay in the UK, with a core focus on national security.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-do">What we do</h2>

<p>We manage 3 million visa applications a year from people who want to visit, study or work in the UK. We’re responsible for deciding who receives British citizenship, and we also consider applications from organisations that want to join the register of sponsors. Another of our key roles is to run the UK’s asylum service, offering protection to vulnerable people and their host communities.</p>

<p>Our strategic vision for 2020 is to be a world-leading immigration service, working for a safe and prosperous UK. To achieve this, we’ve defined 4 transformation goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to control migration by encouraging compliance, tackling system abuse and reducing the illegal migrant population</li>
  <li>to deliver world-class customer service by taking advantage of new, innovative technology and detailed customer insight</li>
  <li>to safeguard vulnerable people and their host communities through developing strong relationships with local authorities, enhancing our existing safeguarding mechanisms and delivering resettlement programmes</li>
  <li>to make UK Visas and Immigration a great place to work by enhancing our leadership capabilities, improving our culture, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and strengthening skills and engagement across our teams</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-its-like-here">What it’s like here</h2>

<p>Because of the sheer volume of visa and immigration applications, our teams have to be organised and efficient. We do everything we can to make sure things run smoothly and give people the very best service.</p>

<p>Working directly with asylum seekers and refugees means our work can often be emotionally charged. You’ve got to be calm under pressure, and able to make balanced decisions under difficult circumstances. It takes resilience, commitment and unwavering values.</p>

<p>Alongside competitive salaries, we also offer a range of excellent benefits – from a pension, flexible working and generous holiday allowance, to childcare vouchers and a season ticket loan. We also offer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maternity, adoption or shared parental leave of up to 26 weeks’ full pay followed by 13 weeks’ statutory pay and a further 13 weeks unpaid</li>
  <li>paternity leave of 2 weeks’ full pay</li>
</ul>

<p>Our teams are based around the UK and overseas. Check out our latest vacancies below for opportunities near you.</p>

<h2 id="diversity">Diversity</h2>

<p>We have an incredibly broad remit at the Home Office, with our work affecting every citizen of the country. It’s essential that our organisation reflects the very best of 21st century Britain and we encourage applications from all backgrounds and circumstances. We recruit on merit after a fair and open selection process and support different ways of working, such as flexible working.</p>

<p>We’re proud to be a ‘Disability Confident Employer’ and we were the first organisation to be ‘Clear Assured’, which recognised our efforts to recruit and retain employees with disabilities. We also offer a guaranteed interview scheme for people with disabilities who meet our minimum selection criteria.</p>

<p>To date we have been recognised by the Times Top 50 Employers for Women, named a Stonewall Star Performer, and listed by Business In The Community as an inclusive employer for race.</p>

<p>Employees have the opportunity to join our vibrant diversity staff support networks, including Gen (gender), The Network (black Asian and minority ethnic), Spectrum (LGBT+) and Able (disabilities). Our networks help raise awareness and help us build an inclusive culture where everyone can thrive and be themselves at work.</p>
