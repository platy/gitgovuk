<p>The Attorney General and Solicitor General (the Law Officers) have overall responsibility for the work of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Crown Prosecution Service (<abbr title="Crown Prosecution Service">CPS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Her Majesty’s Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate">HMCPSI</abbr>)</li>
  <li>The Government Legal Department (GLD)</li>
  <li>The Serious Fraud Office (<abbr title="Serious Fraud Office">SFO</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Together with the Attorney General’s Office (<abbr title="Attorney General's Office">AGO</abbr>), these departments are known as the Law Officers’ Departments (<abbr title="Law Officers' Departments">LODs</abbr>). The superintendence relationship between the Attorney General and the directors of the two prosecuting departments (<abbr title="Crown Prosecution Service">CPS</abbr> and <abbr title="Serious Fraud Office">SFO</abbr>) is set out in detail in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protocol-between-the-attorney-general-and-prosecuting-departments">Protocol between the Attorney General and the Prosecuting Departments</a>. This note supplements that protocol.</p>

<h2 id="mechanisms-of-formal-governance">Mechanisms of formal governance</h2>

<p>This note summarises the main mechanisms of formal Governance within the <abbr title="Law Officers' Departments">LODs</abbr>. These are supplemented by a range of less formal meetings and contacts at various levels within the <abbr title="Law Officers' Departments">LODs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Broadly, the mechanisms operate at 3 levels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>each of the <abbr title="Law Officers' Departments">LODs</abbr> has Departmental Governance arrangements in place to support and provide assurance to their accounting officer/head of department</li>
  <li>there are bilateral arrangements by which the Director of Public Prosecutions (<abbr title="Director of Public Prosecutions">DPP</abbr>), the Director of the Serious Fraud Office (<abbr title="Director of the Serious Fraud Office">DSFO</abbr>), the Treasury Solicitor (who oversees the Government Legal Department) and the Chief Inspector account to the Law Officers as the responsible ministers for the exercise of their functions and the running of their departments</li>
  <li>there are cross-<abbr title="Law Officers' Departments">LODs</abbr> arrangements to manage and support spending review and finance submissions together with central government initiatives on transparency and spending controls</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Director of Public Prosecutions">DPP</abbr> and <abbr title="Director of the Serious Fraud Office">DSFO</abbr> are accounting officers for the <abbr title="Crown Prosecution Service">CPS</abbr> and <abbr title="Serious Fraud Office">SFO</abbr> respectively (the <abbr title="Crown Prosecution Service">CPS</abbr> Chief Executive is an additional accounting officer). The Treasury Solicitor is accounting officer for GLD, <abbr title="Attorney General's Office">AGO</abbr> and <abbr title="Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate">HMCPSI</abbr>. In addition, the Director General <abbr title="Attorney General's Office">AGO</abbr> and the Chief Inspector (who is himself an accounting officer) also provide the Treasury Solicitor, as the Departmental Accounting Officer, with assurance on their systems of internal control, financial management and other governance matters through an annual assurance process and performance and accountability reviews.</p>

<h2 id="departmental-boards">Departmental boards</h2>

<p>Each of the Law Officers’ Departments (apart from <abbr title="Attorney General's Office">AGO</abbr> and <abbr title="Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate">HMCPSI</abbr>) is a non-ministerial Government Department.  Each of them (with the exception of <abbr title="Attorney General's Office">AGO</abbr>) is headed by a statutory office holder. <abbr title="Attorney General's Office">AGO</abbr> is small a ministerial Department which supports the Attorney General and Solicitor General in their role as Law Officers.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Crown Prosecution Service">CPS</abbr>, <abbr title="Serious Fraud Office">SFO</abbr> and GLD each has in place a departmental board which meets regularly, comprising senior staff from the Department and a number of external non-executive directors. They each have an audit and risk committee chaired by one of the non-executive Directors together with a number of other internal Governance committees.</p>

<p><abbr title="Attorney General's Office">AGO</abbr> has an internal management board, the executive board, which meets monthly and which is made up of representatives from across the different areas of the Office. <abbr title="Attorney General's Office">AGO</abbr> is subject to the oversight of the GLD audit committee.</p>

<p><abbr title="Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate">HMCPSI</abbr> has an internal management board, the inspection management board, which meets monthly and which is made up of representatives from across the Inspectorate together with an external adviser. <abbr title="Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate">HMCPSI</abbr> is also subject to the oversight of the GLD Audit Committee.</p>

<p>In addition, the Director General, <abbr title="Attorney General's Office">AGO</abbr> and the Chief Inspector meet regularly with the Treasury Solicitor and provide him with annual assurance reports, and performance and accountability reports every 6 months in relation to their systems of internal control and financial management.</p>

<h2 id="routine-business-meetings">Routine business meetings</h2>

<p>The Law Officers meet monthly with the <abbr title="Director of Public Prosecutions">DPP</abbr> and the <abbr title="Director of the Serious Fraud Office">DSFO</abbr> to discuss casework, policy and finance issues arising in relation to the work of the <abbr title="Crown Prosecution Service">CPS</abbr> and <abbr title="Serious Fraud Office">SFO</abbr>, in support of their statutory superintendence role.</p>

<p>The Law Officers meet every two months with the Chief Inspector to discuss the work of <abbr title="Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate">HMCPSI</abbr> and to agree its inspection priorities.</p>

<p>The Law Officers meet regularly with the Treasury Solicitor to discuss the work of the Treasury Solicitor and the Government Legal Service more generally.</p>

<h2 id="lods-finance-directors-group">
<abbr title="Law Officers' Departments">LODs</abbr>’ finance directors’ group</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Law Officers' Departments">LODs</abbr>’ finance directors’ group is chaired by the Deputy Director, Finance and Strategy at <abbr title="Attorney General's Office">AGO</abbr> on behalf of the Law Officers. Its membership comprises the finance directors from <abbr title="Crown Prosecution Service">CPS</abbr>, <abbr title="Serious Fraud Office">SFO</abbr>, GLD and the <abbr title="Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate">HMCPSI</abbr> Head of Corporate Services, along with other representatives from those departments and <abbr title="Attorney General's Office">AGO</abbr>. By convention, a representative of HM Treasury also attends.  The group meets monthly. It provides the mechanism by which the Law Officers can ensure that spending review and finance submissions are co-ordinated and that central government requirements on transparency and spending controls are disseminated and co-ordinated across the <abbr title="Law Officers' Departments">LODs</abbr>.</p>
