<p>This government has committed to being the greenest government ever. As the UK’s economics and finance ministry, the Treasury will be at the heart of meeting that ambition.</p>

<p>We have an important role to play to make sure that the UK makes the transition to low carbon growth in an efficient way. Our work through the Treasury Environment Network supports policy action across government to make sure that this happens effectively.</p>

<p>In 2010 alone we reduced our carbon footprint across the Treasury estate by 14.2 per cent, surpassing the 10 per cent reduction target for Whitehall departments, and helping support an across-government reduction of 13.8 per cent.</p>

<p>Building on this good work, we also need to consider the impact we each have on the environment through our actions in the workplace. The <span id="attachment_566341" class="attachment-inline">

 sets out the range of ways we are reducing our impact on the environment, in terms of our building and how we use it.</p>

<p>It’s an important element of how we plan to meet our targets but it is by no means the end. We will continue to challenge our departmental performance.</p>
