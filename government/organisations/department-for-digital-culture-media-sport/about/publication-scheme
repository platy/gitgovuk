<h3 id="charging-for-information">Charging for information</h3>

<p>Our aim is to make as much information as possible available free of charge.</p>

<p>At present there will be no charge for information available on this website. Published documents, for example legislation, will have links to the appropriate website where a charge may be made. Where a charge is applicable this will be indicated with a pound sign ‘£’.</p>

<p>A paper copy of the information contained on this website (including paper copies of reports available in electronic form) is available on request. Our <a rel="external" href="https://www.tools.culture.gov.uk/contactus/contactus.aspx">online contact form</a> is the best way to contact us.</p>

<h2 id="official-requests-for-information">Official requests for information</h2>

<p>Before making an <abbr title="Freedom of Information]">FOI</abbr> request, it is worth checking to see if the information is already available via the publication scheme. If you cannot find the information you require after searching the publication scheme, you may have to submit a request for information.</p>

<p>This must be submitted in writing to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Freedom of Information Team
<br></br>Department for Culture, Media and Sport
<br></br>100 Parliament Street
<br></br>London SW1A 2BQ
<br></br>
<br></br>
</p></div></div>

<p>Email: <a href="mailto:foi@culture.gov.uk">foi@culture.gov.uk</a></p>

<h3 id="be-specific">Be specific</h3>

<p>You will get the information faster if you help us identify the exact information you require. It will also mean that your request is less likely to be turned down on cost grounds. Make sure that you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are specific about exactly what information you want</li>
  <li>provide us with a narrow, tightly focused request</li>
  <li>give, where appropriate, a relevant time frame the information relates to</li>
</ul>

<p>You should state how you wish to receive the information, by letter or by email.</p>

<p>Please note that we cannot accept <abbr title="Freedom of Information]">FOI</abbr> requests over the phone. <abbr title="Freedom of Information]">FOI</abbr> requests from anonymous / pseudonymous requesters, that is people who do not give their names or give false names, may not be accepted.</p>

<p>We will deal with your request as quickly as we can, and will aim to let you have a response within 20 working days. If for any reason we are unable to let you have a response within 20 working days we will contact you as soon as possible explaining the reason for this.</p>

<h2 id="environmental-information-regulations">Environmental information regulations</h2>

<p>Some information held by the department may be subject to Environmental Information Regulations (<abbr title="Environmental Information Regulations">EIRs</abbr>).</p>

<p>‘Environmental information’ covers a wide range of topics, which relate to or affect the environment. Applications for information can be made by anyone, anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>The Information Commissioner’s Office, which supervises both the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Data Protection Act 1998, also supervises the operation of the <abbr title="Environmental Information Regulations">EIRs</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="environmental-information-regulations-2004">Environmental Information Regulations 2004</h3>

<p>If you wish to make a request for environmental information under <abbr title="Environmental Information Regulation">EIR</abbr> please contact the Freedom of Information central team either by sending an email to <a href="mailto:foi@culture.gov.uk">foi@culture.gov.uk</a>, via our <a rel="external" href="https://www.tools.culture.gov.uk/contactus/contactus.aspx">online enquiries system</a> putting ‘Freedom of Information request’ in the heading.</p>
