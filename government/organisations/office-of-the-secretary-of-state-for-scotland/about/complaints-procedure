<p>If you have a complaint about the service you have received from a member of the Office (other than in matters relating to Freedom of Information (<abbr title="freedom of information">FOI</abbr>) requests) you should raise the issue in the first instance with the member of staff concerned.</p>

<p>If this is not appropriate or you find that the member of staff concerned does not resolve the matter satisfactorily you should write to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Head of Corporate Services 
<br></br>Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland
<br></br>Dover House
<br></br>Whitehall 
<br></br>London 
<br></br>SW1A 2AU
<br></br>
</p></div></div>

<p>Please supply as much background information as possible.</p>

<p>The head of corporate services will either deal with the complaint or ask a suitably qualified colleague to do so. Ordinarily we will respond to you within 10 working days of the receipt of your letter. If the investigation needs longer than 10 working days we will write to you explaining the delay and saying when a full reply will be sent.</p>

<p>If you are dissatisfied with the response, a member of the Senior Management Team will review the complaint and its handling. You should write to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Executive Assistant to the Director 
<br></br>UK Government
<br></br>45 Melville Street
<br></br>Edinburgh EH3 7HW
<br></br>
</p></div></div>

<p>The executive assistant will ensure that the complaint is allocated to a suitable member of the team. You should expect a reply within 10 working days of the receipt of your letter.</p>

<p>If you remain dissatisfied with the officeâ€™s handling of your complaint you can ask a Member of Parliament (<abbr title="Member of Parliament">MP</abbr>) to refer the matter to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (the ombudsman).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Member of Parliament">MP</abbr> need not be your own <abbr title="Member of Parliament">MP</abbr>. However if you wish to contact your own <abbr title="Member of Parliament">MP</abbr> and do not know who he or she is you can find out on <a rel="external" href="http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/" title="Find your MP on the Parliamentary website">the website for Parliament</a>. The ombudsman is fully independent and has powers to investigate complaints about UK government departments.</p>
