<p>Alternatively, you can fill in our <a rel="external" href="http://www.info.doh.gov.uk/contactus.nsf/memo?openform">web contact form</a>.</p>

<p>The complaints manager will forward your complaint on to the relevant team leader to begin the investigation.</p>

<p>Please note that it is advisable to place detailed complaints in writing, where possible, to ensure your concerns are comprehensively covered.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-next">What happens next</h2>

<p>When you’ve made your complaint, we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>send an email to let you know that we’ve received it (as long as you’ve provided a valid email address).</li>
</ul>

<p>Our complaints process has 3 stages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stage 1 – complaints go to the team leader of the individual or team that your complaint references. The team leader will investigate, with a target of responding to your complaint within 20 working days</li>
  <li>Stage 2 – complaints are investigated by the senior manager responsible for the team that your complaint references. They will investigate with a target of responding to your complaint within 20 working days</li>
  <li>Stage 3 – complaints are investigated by a senior manager who is independent of the individual or team that your complaint references. They will investigate with a target of responding to your complaint within 20 working days</li>
</ul>

<p>At each stage of our complaints process, you will be provided with the information to escalate your complaint if you are unhappy with the response that you receive.</p>

<p>If, after following the 3 stages of our complaints process, you are not satisfied with the outcome of your formal complaint, you can ask <a rel="external" href="http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/">your local <abbr title="Member of Parliament">MP</abbr></a> to refer it to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.</p>

<p>You have to go through your <abbr title="Member of Parliament">MP</abbr> – you cannot approach the ombudsman directly. The ombudsman investigates complaints where government departments or other public bodies have not acted properly or fairly, or have provided a poor service. Government departments have to co-operate with the ombudsman by law.</p>
