<p>We are required to consider all individuals in their day to day work, in shaping policy and in providing services. This is in line with the public sector Equality Duty introduced by the Equality Act 2010.</p>

<h2 id="specific-duties">Specific duties</h2>

<p>We are transparent about how we respond to the Equality Duty, as required by the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/2260/contents/made" title="Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties) Regulations 2011 on legislation.gov.uk">Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties) Regulations 2011</a>. We set clear equality objectives and publish information on our efforts to achieve them.</p>

<h2 id="diversity-and-inclusion-strategy">Diversity and inclusion strategy</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/diversity-and-inclusion-strategy-2018-to-2025">diversity and inclusion strategy</a> sets out our ambitions for equality and diversity between 2018 and 2025, both in relation to staff and in providing services to the public.</p>

<p>This strategy ensures that, as a department, we continue to champion equality and diversity in all that we do, whether it concerns our staff or the wider public.</p>

<p>Read the progress report for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/diversity-strategy-progress-report-2010-to-2013">2010 to 2013</a>.</p>

<h2 id="equality-objectives">Equality objectives</h2>

<p>To support the Home Office business plan to cut crime, control immigration and stop terrorism - and to meet the requirements of the public sector Equality Duty - the department has devised specific <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/equality-objectives--2">equality objectives</a>.</p>

<p>The objectives have addressed equality issues across our functions and the services we provide. We work with stakeholders to deal with the issues that are most pressing for the department.</p>

<p>We will not discriminate on grounds of age, caring responsibilities, disability, gender, gender identity, marriage and civil partnerships, part-time working, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sexual orientation or any other factor irrelevant to a person’s work.</p>

<h2 id="employment-monitoring-report">Employment monitoring report</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/employment-monitoring-report">employment monitoring report</a> provides an annual update on how we are performing against the monitoring of statutory duties to our employees. This report aims to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enable us to determine whether processes and procedures are successfully providing equality or opportunity for all employees</li>
  <li>consider ways to improve any weaknesses in data collection and data quality</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="external-benchmarking">External benchmarking</h2>

<p>Setting <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/equality-and-diversity-external-benchmarks">external benchmarks</a> helps to assess our performance against our aims. We have been in the top 10 of the Stonewall Workplace Equality Index for the past 5 years and were named a ‘Stonewall Star Performer’ in 2015.</p>

<p>We have also been recognised in The Times Top 50 Employers for Women. The award recognises the department as a workplace where women can thrive. It also recognises our wider commitment to improving diversity across the public and private sector.</p>

<h2 id="staff-support-networks">Staff support networks</h2>

<p>While external benchmarks are important, we also recognise the immense value that staff support networks can add to our workplace and our public policy.</p>

<p>These networks provide direct support to their members through ongoing training and advice. They provide insight on the diversity of our people and run events to keep staff aware of how to respond to differing needs.</p>

<p>As an internal resource they have been instrumental in understanding how we can better engage with our stakeholders and the communities we serve.</p>

<p>Our internal networks take on a critical role, keeping us focused on creating an inclusive and engaged department. This role is increasingly important in an environment where public expenditure is being reduced.</p>

<p>We formally recognise and support the following staff support networks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>THE NETWORK - for minority ethnic staff</li>
  <li>Home Office Disability Support (HODS)</li>
  <li>Spectrum - for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender staff</li>
  <li>a:gender - the cross-government network for transgender, transsexual and intersex staff</li>
  <li>Home Office Women</li>
</ul>

<p>We also recognise a number of faith-based informal networks, which provide invaluable insights into religion and belief. These networks include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Home Office Christians</li>
  <li>Home Office Islamic Network</li>
  <li>The Hindu Connection</li>
  <li>Home Office Sikh Association</li>
</ul>
