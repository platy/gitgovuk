<p>We sometimes need to process personal information about you so that we can provide services for you, carry out Home Office and other associated public functions, and comply with applicable laws and regulations.</p>

We may disclose your information to other organisations so that we can carry out our functions, or to enable others to perform theirs. Other organisations include, but are not limited to:</p>

On occasion the Home Office may also engage third parties to process personal data on our behalf. For more information about this and to see if that affects the way your personal information is being shared, read the privacy notices issued by other parts of the Home Office.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-ask-for-your-personal-information">How to ask for your personal information</h2>

<p>If we hold any personal information about you, you have the right to ask for a copy of it through a subject access request (SAR). The Home Office includes UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI), and Her Majesty’s Passport Office (HMPO).</p>

<p>In certain circumstances we do not have to give you the information you have asked for. For example if we are using data for investigating, preventing or detecting crime, or apprehending or prosecuting offenders where to do so would be likely to prejudice those purposes. Where it is known the police are investigating, or prosecuting offences, we will ask for their view on whether providing you with the information would prejudice their activities.</p>

<p>Guidance is also available on how to ask for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/requests-for-personal-data-uk-visas-and-immigration">personal data held within the borders, immigration and citizenship system</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/subject-access-request-form">personal data held by Her Majesty’s Passport Office</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To ask for personal data held by other parts of the Home Office, please contact the information rights team using the contact details below.</p>

<p>When you write to us you must provide the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirmation of your identity: a copy of your passport, full driving license or birth certificate (please do not send original documents)</li>
  <li>confirmation of name and address: a copy of your full driving license, a copy of a recent utility bill, bank or credit card statement, pension or child benefit book (or similar official document which shows your name and address)</li>
  <li>if you are writing on behalf of someone else, a signed declaration from the person you are acting for indicating that they have asked you to make an application on their behalf</li>
</ul>

<p>If possible you should also send:</p>

<ul>
  <li>details of all addresses you have used in previous correspondence with the Home Office, including email addresses (if applicable) so that we can search our systems</li>
  <li>any information that might help us in locating the information in which you are interested (this might include details of any contacts you have had with the Home Office at any time, and details of why you think we will hold information about you)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once we receive all the above information, the Home Office has one month within which to respond to your request. This may be extended by up to 2 months in complex cases.</p>

<p>The Home Office does not keep records of individuals as a matter of routine and if you have had no previous dealings with the department, it is unlikely that we will hold information about you. If, however, you have reason to believe that we do hold information about you, please indicate any contacts or dealings you have had with the Home Office in the past, so that we can locate anything that is relevant.</p>

<h2 id="information-management-strategy">Information management strategy</h2>

<p>We will manage our information to achieve the right balance between making information more widely available to the public, while ensuring that adequate protection is in place.</p>

<p>Our information management policies include how we:</p>

<ul>
  <li>respond to subject access and freedom of information requests</li>
  <li>secure the information we hold</li>
  <li>ensure that information created, collected and stored is proportionate to the business need, and is retained only for as long as it is needed</li>
</ul>

It does not include exhaustive detail about what information we hold, every organisation the Home Office shares information with, how the information is collected or how long all information is kept.
