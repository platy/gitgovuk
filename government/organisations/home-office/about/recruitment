<h2 id="who-we-are">Who we are</h2>

<p>At the Home Office, we help to ensure that the country is safe and secure. In fact, we’ve been looking after our citizens since 1782. Our work creates a whole range of interesting and exciting challenges for our people, and we truly value their expertise. So, naturally, we support their careers and aim to evolve their skills with tools and training.</p>

<p>Because of the sheer breadth of our activities, there’s ample opportunity to move around our organisation. For instance, you could work across policy, corporate services or any number of operational roles all over the UK.</p>

<p>But wherever our people are based, we’re united by a sense of pride – as we’re helping to keep people of the UK safe every day. If you’re supportive and dedicated, the kind of person with a tenacious spirit and uncompromising values, you’ll find yourself in good company.</p>

<p>We have a number of operational areas and teams, including:</p>

<h3 id="border-forcehttpswwwgovukgovernmentorganisationsborder-forceabout"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/border-force/about">Border Force</a></h3>

<p>We’re the frontline law enforcement organisation keeping the UK border safe and secure. You’ll have probably seen us carrying out immigration and customs checks at ports (sea, rail and air) across the UK and abroad. Security will always be our top priority – it’s why we check every single passenger arriving at passport control. We also check goods coming into, and leaving, the country to ensure they’re legitimate and won’t harm people or the economy.</p>

<h3 id="immigration-enforcementhttpswwwgovukgovernmentorganisationsimmigration-enforcementabout"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/immigration-enforcement/about">Immigration Enforcement</a></h3>

<p>Everyone has a view on who should be allowed to stay in the UK, and who should be asked to leave. Our job is to get this right. And to encourage compliance with immigration laws, protect vulnerable people and prevent abuse. Importantly, it’s up to us to make difficult judgements on a topic which the public feel deeply about. We work with partners across law enforcement, the wider public sector and the private sector too, to keep our borders and citizens safe</p>

<h3 id="her-majestys-passport-officehttpswwwgovukgovernmentorganisationshm-passport-officeabout"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-passport-office/about">Her Majesty’s Passport Office</a></h3>

<p>Whether it’s a family holiday in Spain, or a business meeting in Manhattan, there are all kinds of reasons why British nationals need to travel. We’re the dedicated team who make that possible: issuing over 6 million passports every year. HM Passport Office is also responsible for civil registration in England and Wales, which includes everything from issuing birth certificates to registering marriages and civil partnerships.</p>

<h3 id="uk-visas-and-immigrationhttpswwwgovukgovernmentorganisationsuk-visas-and-immigrationabout"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-visas-and-immigration/about">UK Visas and Immigration</a></h3>

<p>With a team of 7,500 talented people based all over the country and overseas we’re responsible for managing immigration policy to the UK and running its asylum service. It means we process around 3 million visa applications a year, and assess the risk of people visiting or staying in the UK. Plus, through our asylum and resettlement programmes, we protect the most vulnerable and their host communities. We also consider applications for British citizenship, ensuring that people with crucial skills and talents can live here.</p>

<h3 id="policy">Policy</h3>

<p>With around 2,000 specialists, our policy teams are responsible for some of the most critical work in government. It sees us developing policies to cut crime and protect the vulnerable. We’re also responsible for designing and delivering a successful post-Brexit immigration policy, and an effective migration policy that gives the UK access to talented people. We’re here to develop a leaner, more effective Home Office – so it’s ready to meet future challenges, provide value for money and keep the UK safe. It means we work in smarter ways, streamlining services and simplifying processes. By combining deep subject knowledge with an expert analytical group, we lead the way in developing evidence-based policies.</p>

<h3 id="professions">Professions</h3>

<p>We’re the experts who provide the Home Office with specialist knowledge, from financial and commercial insight to project delivery and technology expertise. Our teams include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Commercial</li>
  <li>Communications</li>
  <li>Digital Data and Technology</li>
  <li>HR</li>
  <li>Policy</li>
  <li>Knowledge and Information Management</li>
  <li>Finance</li>
  <li>Legal</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, our skills and insight help everyone work to the highest standards.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-offer">What we offer</h2>

<p>No matter which part of the Home Office you join, you’ll receive a fair base salary and excellent benefits. That includes a pension, flexible working and generous holiday allowance, as well as childcare vouchers and a season ticket loan.</p>

</ul>

<p>Plus, if your role requires shift work, we’ll recompense you according to the agreed amount of flexible working. We invest heavily in training and developing our people to ensure they have the skills they need to do their job well.</p>

<p>We never take our people for granted and we make every effort to demonstrate that. Home Office staff surveys are brimming with comments about how much our people value their colleagues, and the outstanding development opportunities and lifestyle benefits we offer. Not to mention the great support and social networks we’ve established.</p>

<h2 id="diversity">Diversity</h2>

It’s essential that our organisation reflects the very best of 21st century Britain and we encourage applications from all backgrounds and circumstances.
