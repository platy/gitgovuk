<p>A man who shot his friend with a crossbow has had his sentence increased after the Solicitor General, Alex Chalk QC MP, thought his original sentence was too low.</p>

<p>Harry Jones, 19, shot the victim with a pre-loaded crossbow after luring him to a meeting place under the pretext of selling him some clothes. The victim and offender were friends, but Jones was angry that the victim had given him fake currency.</p>

<p>The victim was miraculously able to run away, pursued by the offender who produced a Samurai sword before he eventually gave up the chase.  The victim suffered life-threatening injuries to his bowel and intestines and the bolt from the crossbow was recovered from his abdomen.  He remained in hospital for a month after the attack and was told by doctors it would take a year to recover.</p>

<p>On 25 February at Woolwich Crown Court, Jones was convicted of wounding with intent, possession of an offensive weapon, and possession of cannabis. Jones was sentenced to 6 years’ detention.</p>

<p>The Solicitor General referred Jones’ original sentence to the Court of Appeal under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme.</p>

<p>On 13 May the Court of Appeal found his sentence to be unduly lenient and increased his sentence to 9 years’ detention with a 4-year extended licence period.</p>

<p>Speaking after the hearing, the Solicitor General said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Harry Jones carried out a premeditated attack on his friend which resulted in the victim suffering appalling, life-threatening injuries. I welcome the decision of the Court of Appeal to increase his sentence to properly reflect the severity of his actions.</p>
</blockquote>
