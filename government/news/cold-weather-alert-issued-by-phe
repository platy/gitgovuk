<h3 id="friday-4-december-2020">Friday 4 December 2020</h3>

<p>With a risk of severe cold weather, icy conditions and heavy snow across parts of the country, Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) is encouraging people to stay warm and look out for those most at-risk.</p>

<p>The Met Office has announced that there is a high chance that the North East of England, North West of England and Yorkshire and the Humber regions will experience cold weather from 9am Friday 4 December to 6pm on Tuesday 8 December.</p>

<p>Dr Owen Landeg, Principal Environmental Public Health Scientist at <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cold weather isn’t just uncomfortable it can be bad for your health.</p>

  <p>Heating your home to at least 18 Celsius is particularly important if you have reduced mobility, are 65 and over, or have a health condition, such as heart or lung disease.</p>

  <p>Wearing a few layers of thin clothing is better at trapping heat than one thick layer and will help to keep you warm. If you can’t heat all the rooms you use, heat the living room during the day and your bedroom just before you go to sleep. If you are struggling to afford heating bills, Simple Energy Advice provides free advice on energy efficiency and national grants that could help you keep warm and well.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Looking out for others at this time is also really important. Remember to check on frail or older neighbours or relatives, especially those living alone or who have serious illnesses, remembering COVID-19 social distancing, to make sure they are safe, warm and well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bonnie Diamond, Met Office Meteorologist, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>December has got off to a much colder start than last month, with widespread low temperatures bringing the risk of frost, ice and wintry weather across the country.</p>

  <p class="last-child">With temperatures generally limited to between 4 to 7 Celsius by day and falling widely below freezing overnight, a cold weather alert has been issued covering much of northern England and will remain in place until at least next Tuesday”.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="previous-updates">Previous updates</h2>

<h3 id="monday-20-january-2020">Monday 20 January 2020</h3>

<p>The Met Office has forecast that current cold weather conditions affecting West Midlands, East Midlands, East of England, Southeast England and Southwest England will continue until 9am Wednesday 22 January.</p>

<p>Dr Ishani Kar-Purkayastha, Consultant in Public Health at Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People with heart and lung conditions, older people and the very young are at risk of becoming unwell during cold weather. At this time, it’s really important to keep a look out for friends and family who might be affected.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Below 18 degrees, the risk of strokes, heart attacks and chest infections increases, so heating homes to at least this temperature is important to stay well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paul Gundersen, Chief Meteorologist at the Met Office said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">High pressure across England means the cold but sunny weather will continue for the southern half of England throughout the first half of the week with overnight frost and fog in places. However, it will be cloudier further north and therefore not as cold for many.</p>

<h3 id="friday-17-january-2020">Friday 17 January 2020</h3>

<p>With the forecast of cold weather and some freezing fog patches for parts of England, Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) is urging people to prepare for cold weather conditions and look out for those most at-risk.</p>

<p>The Met Office has today (17 January 2020) announced that there is a high chance that West Midlands, East Midlands, East of England, Southeast England and Southwest England will experience cold weather from 6pm on Sunday 19 January to 6pm on Tuesday 21 January.</p>

<p>Dr Owen Landeg, Principal Environmental Public Health Scientist at Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Older people and those with heart and lung problems are at risk of getting sick in cold weather.</p>

  <p>Keep an eye out for those who may need help staying warm, ensure they wear lots of thin layers and have everything they need.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Below 18 degrees, changes to the body mean that the risk of strokes, heart attacks and chest infections increase so heating homes to this temperature is particularly important to stay well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nick Silkstone, Deputy Chief Meteorologist at the Met Office said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>High pressure is in place across the UK this weekend bringing settled, mainly dry, but also cold weather for many. It will be colder than of late with temperatures dropping below freezing overnight and a chance of widespread frost but with sunny spells throughout the day.  </p>

  <p class="last-child">However, at the start of next week the chance of fog and cloud will increase across central and southern areas which will mean that it will also feel colder by day. Check updates to the forecast on the Met Office <a rel="external" href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/">website</a> or <a rel="external" href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/what/met-office-weather-app">app</a>.</p>

<h3 id="wednesday-27-november-2019">Wednesday 27 November 2019</h3>

<p>With warnings that cold weather is on the way, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> is urging people to prepare for the cold weather and look out for those most at-risk.</p>

<p>The Met Office has today (27 November 2019) announced that there is a high chance that North West England, North East England, Yorkshire and Humber, East Midlands and West Midlands will see temperatures drop from first thing on the morning of Friday November 29 and 9am on Monday December 2.</p>

<p>Dr Ishani Kar-Purkayastha, Consultant in Public Health at Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People with heart and lung conditions, older people and the very young are at risk of becoming unwell during cold weather. At this time, it’s really important to keep a look out for friends and family who might be affected.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Wearing lots of thin layers will help them to stay warm. It may also be helpful to offer to collect prescriptions and shopping. Below 18 degrees, the risk of strokes, heart attacks and chest infections increases so heating homes to at least this temperature is important to stay well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Laura Ellam, Deputy Chief Meteorologist at the Met Office said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After a notably unsettled period, clearer and colder conditions are moving in to the UK at the end of the week and through the weekend. Colder air will move in from the north through Thursday, with clearer skies and a northerly breeze a widespread frost will form on Friday morning in the northern half of the UK.</p>

  <p>By Saturday the cold and bright conditions will be across all but the very far south west, with temperatures in many places including the south east not getting above 6°C and feeling even colder in the northerly breeze.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The cold conditions will persist through the weekend with freezing conditions overnight, temperatures could dip as low as -7°C overnight in rural spots in the far north. There are signs of milder conditions moving in to the north at first by the start of next week.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="monday-18-november-2019">Monday 18 November 2019</h3>

<p>With warnings that cold weather is on the way for the north east, north west and Yorkshire and Humber, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> is urging people to look out for those most at-risk.</p>

<p>The Met Office has today (18 November 2019) announced that there is a high chance these areas will see temperatures drop between 9am on Monday 18 November and 12 noon on Wednesday 20 November.</p>

<p>Dr Emer OConnell, Consultant in Public Health at Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Older people and those with heart and lung problems are at risk of getting sick in cold weather.</p>

  <p>Keep an eye out for those who may need help staying warm, ensure they wear lots of thin layers and have everything they need.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Below 18 degrees, changes to the body mean that the risk of strokes, heart attacks and chest infections increase so heating homes to this temperature is particularly important to stay well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Met Office Chief Meteorologist, Steve Ramsdale, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After a very wet period for parts of the UK the weather is now turning much quieter for a few days.</p>

  <p class="last-child">With these quieter conditions night time temperatures will fall away with more widespread frosts than seen recently despite daytime temperatures remaining fairly similar. Tuesday morning in particular looks to be cold across much of England.</p>
