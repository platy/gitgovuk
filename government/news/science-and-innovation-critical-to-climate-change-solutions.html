<p>Science and Innovation Day at <abbr title="26th UN Conference on Climate Change">COP26</abbr> will see the announcement of new initiatives backed by global coalitions of nations, businesses and scientists. These will support the implementation of the goals announced during the World Leaders Summit and other country commitments announced during the first week of the conference.</p>

<p>Government Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance will underline the critical role of science and innovation in enabling every country to access the tools it needs to immediately reduce emissions in line with Paris temperature targets, and to adapt to the effects of climate change that we are already seeing. These initiatives include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>new commitments to accelerate innovation and low carbon transitions in industry and cities</li>
  <li>new global Adaptation Research Alliance to increase the resilience of vulnerable communities on the frontline of climate change</li>
  <li>independent experts to track progress against the Breakthrough Agenda announced by world leaders on 2 November, advising on action and collaboration</li>
  <li>global scientific research community to produce annual climate risk assessment to ensure the dangers are fully understood by world leaders</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mission Innovation</strong>, a coalition of 23 governments (covering 95% of global public investment in clean technology, research and development) will announce 4 new ‘innovation missions’ in which countries will work together to accelerate the development of clean technologies for cities, industry, carbon dioxide removal, and the production of renewable fuels, chemicals, and materials. Mission Innovation’s ‘innovation missions’ now cover sectors responsible for more than 50% of global emissions.</p>

<p>The <strong>Adaptation Research Alliance (<abbr title="Adaptation Research Alliance">ARA</abbr>)</strong> – a global first – launches today. This network of over 90 organisations across 30 economies will see governments, research institutions and communities collaborate to increase the resilience of vulnerable communities on the frontline of climate change.</p>

<p>A new landmark programme putting the <abbr title="Adaptation Research Alliance">ARA</abbr>’s work into practice is the <strong>Climate Adaptation and Resilience research programme (<abbr title="Climate Adaptation and Resilience research programme">CLARE</abbr>)</strong>, jointly funded by the UK and Canada. Today the UK announces a further £48 million towards <abbr title="Climate Adaptation and Resilience research programme">CLARE</abbr>, bringing the total UK aid funding to £100 million, alongside £10 million from Canada to support the development of actionable solutions in communities most vulnerable to climate change and extreme weather events. £40 million of the UK’s contribution will be focused on Africa, and in total the programme is set to benefit at least 5 million people around the world.</p>

<p>To support implementation of the Breakthrough Agenda announced by World Leaders on 2 November, a new ‘Global Checkpoint Process’ will seek to sustain and strengthen international cooperation in each of the emitting sectors. Independent experts led by the International Energy Agency (<abbr title="International Energy Agency">IEA</abbr>), together with the International Renewable Energy Agency (<abbr title="International Renewable Energy Agency">IRENA</abbr>) and the UN High Level Climate Action Champions will produce an annual report to track progress and advise on action. Informed by this advice, countries will discuss how they can work together to make faster progress.</p>

<p>A group of leading international scientific organisations will make a new commitment to improve the way we assess and communicate climate risk to inform the decisions of world leaders. The coalition, including, amongst others, the World Meteorological Organisation and the World Climate Research Programme, will work to ensure that research and reports for policymakers set out clearly for world leaders the full scale of the dangers we will face if global temperature increase is not held below 1.5 degrees.</p>

<p>Other announcements on Science and Innovation Day include:</p>

<p>Under the <strong>Industrial Deep Decarbonisation Initiative (<abbr title="Industrial Deep Decarbonisation Initiative">IDDI</abbr>)</strong> the UK, India, Germany, Canada and <abbr title="United Arab Emirates">UAE</abbr> will work together to create new markets for low carbon steel and concrete. The <abbr title="Industrial Deep Decarbonisation Initiative">IDDI</abbr> launched today a campaign where member governments, including the UK, commit to the disclosure of embodied carbon of major public construction by no later than 2025, they also pledged to achieve net zero in major public construction steel and concrete by 2050, and to work towards an emission reduction for 2030 to be announced next year.</p>

<p>Building on the success of the Futures We Want collaboration, the UK <abbr title="26th UN Conference on Climate Change">COP26</abbr> Presidency, in partnership with Italy, is establishing a <strong>new global partnership</strong> to leverage the power of science and innovation to address key challenges blocking the path to a climate-resilient, net-zero future. This new partnership will bring together countries from across the world to pool scientific expertise and develop new ways to bring citizen voices into policy making, by running a series of region-led projects to tackle specific net-zero challenges.</p>

<p>47 countries (including Malawi, Spain, Morocco and the US) have committed to building <strong>health systems</strong> which are able to withstand the impacts of climate change and which are low carbon and sustainable. These include 42 countries, representing over a third of global health care emissions, which have committed to develop a sustainable, low-carbon health system. 12 of these 42 countries have set a deadline of 2050 or earlier, by which their health system will reach Net Zero.</p>

<p>Patrick Vallance UK Chief Scientific Adviser said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The facts are clear: we must limit warming to 1.5C. Thanks to science, that is feasible - the technologies are already available. Investment in research and development will deliver new clean technologies, while policies to create markets will ensure they are deployed. At the same time, science will help us adapt to the impacts of climate change we’re already seeing around the world and transform our economies. Through research and innovation, we will adjust essential systems and ensure continued safety, security and prosperity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Patrick Child, Chair of Mission Innovation and Deputy Director-General for Research and Innovation at European Commission said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Clean energy solutions must be cost-effective at scale and available everywhere if we are going to reach net zero. We must invest in innovation now to scale up these vital technologies and avoid a climate disaster. International collaboration sits at the heart of this, and Mission Innovation provides a vital platform for world governments to drive action and investment in the technologies which will save our planet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jesse De Maria Kinney, Head of Secretariat for Adaptation Research Alliance (<abbr title="Adaptation Research Alliance">ARA</abbr>) said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Climate adaptation requires evidence-based solutions that are tailored to local contexts. The formal launch of the <abbr title="Adaptation Research Alliance">ARA</abbr> highlights a growing global movement supporting this approach among funders, researchers, policymakers and communities and our collective commitment to driving a paradigm shift in the adaptation community where solutions are co-produced, action oriented and lead to positive changes in people’s lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anne-Marie Trevelyan, <abbr title="26th UN Conference on Climate Change">COP26</abbr> Champion on Adaptation and Resilience said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Action-focused research is crucial to effective, inclusive and sustainable climate adaptation, particularly to protect the most vulnerable communities from the impacts of climate change. We will ensure women’s voices shape these conversations, and women’s leadership and expertise are championed to deliver gender-sensitive adaptation solutions. Both the Adaptation Research Alliance and the UK’s support for the Climate Adaptation and Resilience research programme will improve the effectiveness of adaptation, putting people at the heart of climate research to build the resilience of those living on the frontline of the climate crisis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Science Minister George Freeman, Science Minister said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Real change to combat climate change cannot happen without new scientific ideas, innovation and research, and it is clear that no country or company acting in isolation can deliver the change that is needed at the pace that is needed.</p>

  <p>As an innovation nation, we want to lead the global effort to have every country, organisation and business contribute to this agenda by encouraging new ideas and products. That is why, for example, we have launched new commitments to enhance international innovation cooperation and ensure we meet our climate goals.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The scale of the challenge we face is daunting, but there is room for optimism, and I look forward to working together to unleash a new wave of innovation to build a cleaner, better, and more prosperous world.</p>
</blockquote>
