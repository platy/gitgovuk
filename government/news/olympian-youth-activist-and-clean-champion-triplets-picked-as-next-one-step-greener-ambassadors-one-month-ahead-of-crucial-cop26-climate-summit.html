  <li>Seven more ‘One Step Greener’ Ambassadors have been selected ahead of COP26 Summit in November, with the search on for six more</li>
  <li>The newly announced Ambassadors including Melissa Wilson (GB rower), Siobhan McKenna (ReJean Denim) and Cathy Yitong Li (youth activist) will form part of the final 26 ‘One Step Greener’ Ambassadors</li>
  <li>These UK citizens and businesses are inspiring and calling on people to take greener steps for the environment</li>
</ul>

<p>The British public has selected a further seven ‘One Step Greener’ Ambassadors from across the UK who are going above and beyond to tackle climate change. They will join the existing 13 Ambassadors, inspiring the public to go one step greener and having their stories showcased at COP26.</p>

<p>GB rower Melissa Wilson decided to do something to increase the impact that athletes can have on sustainability and tackling climate change and joined Champions for Earth in 2020. Melissa instigated the elite sport and sustainability initiative OLY Earth+, working with Team GB to create a green legacy for their participation in the Tokyo Olympics.</p>

<p>Eight-year-old triplets, and Nottingham Council’s first children clean champions, Waimi, Mbetmi and Yimi Fongue heard about climate change at school and wanted to do more to help. The inspiring triplets are on a mission to protect the environment and were just six years old when they made headlines for their litter picking efforts.</p>

<p>COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In just under a month, the UK will host the crucial UN climate change conference COP26 in Glasgow to bring countries together to commit to urgent global climate action. We are leading the way in the UK – as we become pioneers in new clean technologies, we create thousands of good jobs, clean investment in local communities, and a brighter future for generations to come.</p>

  <p class="last-child">There are also thousands of communities across the country doing their bit too. So in the lead up to COP26, we are celebrating the steps people across the UK are already taking and our One Step Greener Ambassadors are leading the charge by inspiring and encouraging the nation to join in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maria Antonieta Nestor launched A Toy’s Life and Beyond to educate parents and families on the recyclability of toys and what to do with them once they are broken, not fit for purpose or no longer wanted by their owners. Maria said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I have made it my mission to help tackle climate change through reducing plastic waste. I am proud to be playing a part in helping create a better world for my children and future generations. There are so many ways we can make a difference and go One Step Greener and I encourage everyone to play their part ahead of COP26.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The other four Ambassadors announced today include Cathy Yitong Li (youth activist), Siobhan McKenna (founder of ethical fashion brand ReJean Denim), Clare Every (vegan food blogger) and Aamir Khan (eco conscious business owner).</p>

<p>The ‘One Step Greener’ Ambassadors are continuing the nationwide search for the remaining six who will represent their country and have their stories showcased at COP26 – which aims to be the most inclusive COP ever.</p>

<p>The nation can nominate themselves or people in their communities who they think are making a big difference in the fight against climate change. Those nominated could be family members, friends, colleagues, community leaders or entrepreneurs: anyone who is taking action to tackle climate change and inspiring others to follow in their green footsteps. Nominate by visiting <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://together-for-our-planet.ukcop26.org/onestepgreener/">here</a>.</p>
