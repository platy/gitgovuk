<p>The Security Industry Authority (SIA), which is the regulator for the private security industry, ran the safety resilience exercise at the Steel Yard, on Allhallows Lane near Cannon Street station. The SIA organised the exercise in partnership with City of London Police, London Ambulance Service, London Fire Brigade, and UK Counter Terrorism Policing. The First Aid Nursing Yeomanry – FANY(PRVC) – were on hand as role players to help give the impression of a busy club night.</p>

<p>The training event at the Steel Yard confronted security staff with a series of real-time simulations, involving volunteer actors, of possible emergency scenarios. These included an attack with a bladed weapon and a suspicious package.</p>

<p>Ronnie Megaughin, the SIA’s Head of Compliance and Inspections, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These realistic scenarios are an excellent method for training security operatives in the best way to approach various emergencies. We present them with a challenge, which can range from a bomb threat to a marauding attack, and let them put their training to use. Counter-terrorism experts are on-hand to give an instant debrief and guidance.</p>

  <p class="last-child">These are learning experiences that operatives, and their managers, find very useful. If one of these operatives finds themselves in the position of being first responder at an incident, this training could save lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jason Dean, SIA Liaison Officer to the National Business Crime Centre, who co-ordinated the event, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The main aim of exercises like this is to increase public safety in the night-time economy by working with venues and security staff. It’s also to showcase best practice by putting the Action Counters Terrorism (ACT) security e-learning package, which we’ve been recommending to all SIA-licensed operatives, into practice. We’re really pleased with the commitment that all the security staff put into the exercise at the Steel Yard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This emergency planning exercise at the Steel Yard continues a programme of similar exercises and follows on from events in Chesterfield, London, Glasgow and Leicester.</p>

<p>Commander Umer Khan, OBE, who is responsible for policing operations and security at City of London Police, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The threat from terrorism has not gone away. The threat to the UK from terrorism is substantial, meaning an attack is likely. Exercises like this are vital in ensuring those working in our night-time economy are prepared, especially as we enter the run-up to the festive season.</p>

  <p>Across Counter Terrorism Policing and with our partners, we are working tirelessly and at pace to confront the threat and help keep the public safe.</p>

  <p>But, as previous incidents have shown, attacks can happen at any time, and anywhere, without warning. That’s why we encourage everyone to remain alert while out and about, and report anything that doesn’t seem right immediately to security or staff, or the police.</p>

  <p class="last-child">You can also report anything suspicious in confidence at the Action Counters Terrorism website (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://act.campaign.gov.uk" rel="external">www.gov.uk/ACT</a>) or on 0800 789 321. In an emergency, always call 999.</p>
