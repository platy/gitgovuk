<p>Two men who robbed 3 properties at knifepoint have had their sentences increased after the Solicitor General, Alex Chalk QC MP referred the case to the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p>On 20 March 2021, Alfie Spain, 26, and Freddie Hanratty, 20, armed themselves with knives and travelled from London to the Isle of Sheppey where they robbed three householders at knifepoint.</p>

<p>At the first property, the victim was seen running into the road with a stab wound to his right shoulder, the offenders chased and lunged at him. At the second property, the offenders broke into the house with knives and wore black latex gloves. They smashed 4 mobile phones and stole £200 in cash and a moped.  They then forced their way into another property, where 2 young children aged 3 and 6 were present. The offenders held a kitchen knife to one of the victims faces and demanded money. Hanratty also threatened to kill the victim if he called the police.</p>

<p>On 27 September at Maidstone Crown Court, both were found guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery, and having an article with a blade or point. Spain was sentenced to 6 years’ imprisonment, and Hanratty was sentenced to 4 years’ imprisonment.</p>

<p>Following the sentencing, the Solicitor General, Alex Chalk QC MP, referred their sentences to the Court of Appeal under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme.</p>

<p>On 10 December the Court of Appeal found their original sentences to be unduly lenient and increased Spain’s sentence to 8 years and 3 months’ imprisonment, and Hanratty’s to 6 years’.</p>

<p>Speaking after the hearing, the Solicitor General, Alex Chalk QC MP said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Spain and Hanratty set off from London with the sole intention of committing these violent robberies. They inflicted a terrible ordeal on the occupants of the properties they targeted, and the victims will be suffering the effects for a long time. I hope the Court’s decision to increase these sentences can bring some comfort to all of those affected.</p>
