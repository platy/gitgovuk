<ol>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Brazil and the UK reviewed regional and international issues, in the context of the unprecedented challenges faced by the international community to alleviate the health and socio-economic effects of the pandemic.

  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parties agreed to work together towards a successful outcome at the negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, scheduled for the 26th United Nations Conference on Climate Change (COP26) in Glasgow in November 2021.

  </li>
  <li>
