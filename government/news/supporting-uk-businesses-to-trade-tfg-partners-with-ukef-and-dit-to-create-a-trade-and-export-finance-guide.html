<p>The 60-page guide comes against a backdrop of complex geopolitical circumstances and an ever-changing financial landscape.</p>

<p>Exploring recent issues, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, Brexit, and the current Russia-Ukraine conflict, this guide aims to paint a clearer picture of how to navigate the current economic status of the industry.</p>

<h3>Tim Reid, director of business group at UK Export Finance, says:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Exports can help businesses increase profits and grow, especially when you are supplying to industries that are growing faster outside of the UK.</p>

  <p>That’s why we are pleased to be working with Trade Finance Global to help business leaders understand the benefits of trade and how the right finance can unlock new opportunities.</p>

  <p class="last-child">As the UK’s national export credit agency, we can help businesses tap into global markets by making export finance and insurance more accessible.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Mark Abrams, global head of trade and receivables finance at TFG, says:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">During these uncertain times a guide such as this one can really help shed light on UK trade and export requirements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This latest guide begins with a brief definition of trade finance, as well as its advantages in financing a company’s future development.</p>

<p>Next, the guide provides an insight into the trade cycle, along with the nuances of undertaking or expanding international trade ventures in the context of the financing gap.</p>

<p>The guide also provides UK exporters with detailed information regarding UKEF’s trade finance and insurance products for a more complete picture of the sector.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the guide distinguishes between funded and unfunded trade finance, ensuring a thorough summary of underlying dynamics in buyer-seller relationships.</p>

<p>Transacting across borders can be a complicated affair, as such, the trade and export finance guide examines pre-shipment, post-shipment, and supply chain finance giving an overview of associated risks.</p>

<p>Examples of how this all comes together is shown through two UK case studies; <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-subsea-lands-major-offshore-wind-exports-with-government-support">First Subsea</a>, a designer and manufacturer of cable protection systems for offshore wind farms, and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-support-helps-british-business-get-exports-off-to-a-tea">Union Papertech</a>, a British tea and coffee supplier.</p>

<p>The guide is freely available to download now at <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.tradefinanceglobal.com/export-finance" rel="external">www.tradefinanceglobal.com/export-finance</a></p>
