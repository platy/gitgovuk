    <p>The 29th edition of the Pontignano Conference will focus on the opportunities that 
Italy and the UK can seize to shape and strengthen growth in a period of rapid 
change.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prof. Mariana Mazzucato will be recognised for her 
innovative contribution to economic thought in the UK, Italy and the world, and in 
particular for her role in founding the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Building on last year’s experience, the conference remains a hybrid, with five 
ministers attending and several others speaking remotely.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 29th edition of the Pontignano Conference, the most important event on the Anglo-Italian agenda, is being held in Siena from 16 to 18 September.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is organised by the British Embassy in Italy and the British Council, the British body for 
cultural relations and opportunities in education, in collaboration with the University of Siena 
and St. Antony’s College of Oxford. The event is co-organised in collaboration with the ICE 
Agency.</p>

<p>Chaired by Carlo Calenda and David Willetts, this year’s event is entitled ‘UK and Italy: 
together to rebuild better’. Experts in a wide range of fields and leading figures from the 
governments of London and Rome will be present. Supporting the importance of the 
occasion is the extensive ministerial representation, both in presence and virtual. Italy will be 
represented by the Minister for Economic Development, Giancarlo Giorgetti, and the Undersecretary for 
Foreign Affairs, Benedetto Della Vedova, with the Undersecretary for Technological 
Innovation and Digital Transition Assuntela Messina in attendance.</p>

<p>The UK will be represented in person by Kwasi Kwarteng, Minister for Business, Energy and Industrial 
Strategy, John Glen, Economic Secretary to the Treasury and Minister for Cities, and Wendy 
Morton, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for European Neighbourhood and the 
Americas.</p>

<p>Lord Bethell, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health and 
Social Care, and Lord Goldsmith, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Pacific and 
Environment, will also be in London.</p>

<p>The importance of the occasion in the bilateral relations between Italy and the United 
Kingdom will once again be witnessed by a significant number of very high-level speeches 
also from the world of institutions, business, research and media.</p>

<p>The British Ambassador to Italy, Jill Morris, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Strengthened by the presence of our two countries in multiple international organisations, 
Italy and the UK are once again standing side by side in tackling global challenges that affect
us all, and which require a joint global commitment. This year, through the UK’s Presidency 
of the G7 and Italy’s Presidency of the G20, as well as our partnership for COP26, we have 
a unique opportunity to lead a sustainable, green, equitable and resilient global recovery.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The themes of our respective Presidencies complement and complement each other 
perfectly, and have in common the goal of a sustainable recovery from the pandemic. 
Strengthening our resilience and addressing the issues of climate change and biodiversity 
protection, while advancing our common values: this is at the heart of the debate at the 
centre of the XXIX edition of the Conference - “UK and Italy together to rebuild better” - for a 
renewed community of purpose in the interest of our countries and the generations to come.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Director of the British Council in Italy, Rachel Launay, commented:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I look forward to participating in the Pontignano 2021 Conference, and investigating with
experts how the world of art and culture will respond to the enormous challenges posed by 
climate change, as the culture and education sectors grapple with new models of functioning
in a post-Covid world.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Programme</h3>

<p>The conference kicked off on Thursday 16 September at 18:00 in the Aula Magna of the 
University of Siena.</p>

<p>Greetings from the co-chairs, Carlo Calenda and David Willetts, and 
from the Chancellor of the University of Siena, Prof. Francesco Frati, were followed by a 
keynote address from the award-winning Margaret Heffernan, Professor at the School of 
Management, University of Bath, on the lessons learned from the pandemic to improve 
resilience in the future of Italian and British societies.</p>

<p>The Conference will continue on Friday and Saturday behind closed doors, in accordance 
with the Chatham House Rule*, at the Certosa di Pontignano, just outside Siena, and will be 
divided into four thematic areas that will allow participants to address some fundamental 
issues for the future of our countries and Europe.</p>

<h3>The third “Pontignano Award”</h3>

<p>In the first edition this was given to the renowned scientist Rino Rappuoli, Head of Research and Development and Chief Scientist of GSK Vaccines, 
and in 2020 to the President Emeritus of the Republic and Senator for Life Giorgio 
Napolitano. This year it will be presented to Professor Mariana Mazzucato, in recognition of her 
innovative contribution to economic thinking in the UK, Italy and the world, and in particular 
for her role in founding the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, on the evening of 
Friday 17 September.</p>

<p>Professor Mazzuccato commented on the prestigious award as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I am deeply honoured to receive this year’s Pontignano Award. Italy and the UK face many 
of the same problems, such as climate change, inequality and lagging productivity, but they 
also have the same opportunities. Working closely with the UK government since 2017 on its
industrial strategy, with Prime Minister Conte on Italy’s recovery programme and, in 2021, 
with the ‘G7 Panel on Economic Resilience’ under the leadership of Lord Mark Sedwill, has 
been truly inspiring.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">If we are to achieve our goals of inclusive and sustainable growth, it is crucial that economic
theory and practice is rethought to be more goal-oriented, with new metrics around the 
common good and public goals when we think about budgets, procurement and public-
private partnerships. Only in this way will we be able to improve equity in the global health 
response, accelerate investment in climate mitigation and adaptation, and promote fair 
labour standards. The G7 working group offers timely recommendations for both countries 
as they seek to build more resilient economies in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
</blockquote>
