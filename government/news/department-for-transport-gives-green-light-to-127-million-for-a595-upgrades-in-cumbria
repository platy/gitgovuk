<ul>
  <li>£12.7 million investment announced today for upgrades to the A595 at Grizebeck</li>
  <li>scheme will improve safety and enhance capacity on key industrial route</li>
  <li>funding is the latest step by government to level up transport infrastructure in the North, deliver for the Northern Powerhouse and build back better</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Residents and businesses in Cumbria are set to benefit from quicker, safer and better-connected commutes, thanks to over £12 million of funding announced by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps today (Tuesday 27 October 2020).</p>

<p>Under plans drawn up by Cumbria County Council, the multi-million-pound investment will see the A595 road upgraded at Grizebeck – with a new 1km stretch built to replace the existing section at Dove Farm. The upgrades will also include the installation of a new crossing for farm vehicles and cyclists, as well as more space for those walking and cycling along the route.</p>

<p>The new stretch of road will see the A595’s capacity and connectivity with other major link roads boosted, helping local businesses grow and supporting residents to access more work and employment opportunities.</p>

<p>Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I visited Cumbria last November, I heard about frustrations with local infrastructure, including the bottleneck at Grizebeck. I promised then that we would take action and I’m pleased today to deliver on that.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It joins other investment in Cumbria – including £7.5 million to help support development plans to upgrade the coastal railway between Carlisle and Sellafield, and £1 billion to dual the A66. We’re committed to delivering for Cumbria and unleashing every part of the Northern Powerhouse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Subject to final approvals, work is due to start by July 2022. The total cost of the A595 scheme is £14.9 million, with the Department for Transport’s funding contribution forming the majority of the total scheme costs.</p>

<p>Simon Fell, MP for Barrow and Furness, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m beyond delighted that this project now has the green light after years of relentless campaigning by local people and businesses.</p>

  <p>It beggars belief that the main A-road from Barrow to Sellafield is through a farmyard. Finally that situation can be righted, making the road far safer and much more reliable for locals and commuters alike, and Furness a more attractive place to do business.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I’m hugely grateful to the Department for Transport, Lancashire Evening Post and Cumbria County Council for backing and funding this scheme, and the A595 Action Group for keeping the pressure up over the years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rob Johnston, Chief Executive of Cumbria Chamber of Commerce, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reduced journey times make businesses more efficient and productive, and create new opportunities for work, learning and leisure.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This scheme will bypass the notorious bottleneck at Dove Farm. It will benefit commuters to BAE Systems and Sellafield, and improve links to Millom. It’s long overdue and businesses will welcome it wholeheartedly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The government is also committed to investing in other transport links in Cumbria – including £7.5 million to help support development plans to upgrade the coastal railway between Carlisle and Sellafield.</p>

<p>Today’s announcement further underlines the government’s commitment to level up transport infrastructure across the entire country, including throughout the Northern Powerhouse.</p>

<p>Alongside recent investment in roads such as the A630, the government has set up the Northern Transport Acceleration Council to work with local leaders to drive forward progress on schemes meeting the needs of their communities.</p>
