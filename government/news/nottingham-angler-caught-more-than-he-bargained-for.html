  <li>Angler found guilty of breaching national fishing byelaws</li>
  <li>The night-time fishing trip cost him a penalty of £619</li>
</ul>

<p>A Nottingham man’s fishing trip in the middle of the night on the River Trent in Colwick, Nottinghamshire in September 2021 has cost him £619 after he illegally removed fish from the river.</p>

<p>His case was brought to Nottingham Magistrates Court by the Environment Agency on Tuesday 5 April, where 37-year-old Piotr Czyzak, of Leonard Street, Nottingham, was found guilty to the offence of removing the fish.</p>

<p>He was fined £440 and ordered to pay £135 costs and a victim surcharge of £44.</p>

<p>The defendant was found by Environment Agency fisheries enforcement officers to be in possession of chub that he had removed from the river on 4 September.</p>

<p>Following the verdict, Lee Watts, Fisheries Enforcement Officer for the Environment Agency, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We found the defendant with the fish that had been removed from the River Trent while out on our night patrols, between 3am - 4am. On this occasion the defendant had a valid fishing licence, but it is also imperative for anglers to observe fishing byelaws.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The case shows how seriously the courts take these offences and we hope the penalty will act as a deterrent to any angler who is thinking of breaking fishing byelaws. Not complying with the byelaws can incur a fine of up to £50,000.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Environment Agency carries out enforcement work all year round and is supported by partners including the police and the Angling Trust. Fisheries enforcement work is intelligence-led, targeting known hot-spots and where illegal fishing is reported.</p>

<p>Anyone with information about illegal fishing activities can contact the Environment Agency’s incident hotline 24/7 on 0800 80 70 60 or anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>

<h2>Notes to editors</h2>

<p>On 4 September 2021 the defendant removed chub from the River Trent contrary to Byelaw 3(i) of the Environment Agency National Byelaws in accordance with section 210 and Schedule 25 of the Water Resources Act 1991 and contrary to Section 211 of the Act.</p>

<p>The national fishing byelaws protect and improve freshwater fish and their habitats. If you do not comply with them, you could face prosecution and be fined up to £50,000.</p>
