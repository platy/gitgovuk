  <li>New flood risk management scheme for Lower Wick area of Worcester</li>
  <li>The new scheme will reduce the risk of flooding to 26 properties</li>
  <li>The design is due to be completed&nbsp;by the end of the year&nbsp;with construction beginning in the spring</li>
</ul>

<p>The Environment Agency is leading on the project with Worcestershire County Council assisting on the plans for the scheme for Toronto Close in the Lower Wick area of the city.</p>

<p>Toronto Close is situated close to the River Teme and Laugherne Brook and has a history of flooding, most recently in February 2020 when 16 houses were flooded.</p>

<p>The new scheme will reduce the risk of flooding to 26 properties and consists of an embankment and a new wall along the Laugherne Brook together with strengthening an existing wall around Powick Mills. The scheme will also include two new flood gates and the strengthening of the Old Road wall.</p>

<p>The design is due to be completed&nbsp;by the end of the year&nbsp;with construction beginning in the spring and is due to be completed by the end of the&nbsp;next&nbsp;year.</p>

<p>Environment Agency Manager for Worcester, David Throup said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The work will provide improved flood resilience for Toronto Close and we are working closely with Worcestershire County Council to ensure the delivery of this scheme.&nbsp;Flooding has a devastating impact which is why protecting people and communities is our top priority.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We can already see the impacts of climate change in the UK and around the world. With this scheme we will be upgrading and improving the existing defences to better protect communities from the future flood risk climate change will bring, greatly reducing the risk of flooding to properties most vulnerable when the local rivers rise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Councillor Alan Amos, Cabinet Member with Responsibility for Highways and Transport&nbsp;added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This scheme is one of a number of flood risk management projects which Worcestershire County Council is investing in, to reduce the risk of flooding on local communities. We are supportive of this scheme and the benefits it will bring and are pleased to see the progress towards delivery. We will be working closely with the Environment Agency to ensure their successful delivery of the project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Environment Agency provides a Flood Warning Service for Lower Wick. Please contact the 24-hour Floodline service on 0345 988 1188 for any ongoing flood related queries or advice.&nbsp;Sign up for Flood Warnings at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/sign-up-for-flood-warnings">https://www.gov.uk/sign-up-for-flood-warnings</a> .</p>

<p>The best way to protect yourself from flooding is to know what to do in advance – download and save a simple <a rel="external" href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fflood-warning-information.service.gov.uk%2Fwhat-to-do-in-a-flood&amp;data=04%7C01%7CKatharine.Barker%40defra.gov.uk%7C65b30b28df1746565bf008d9ae85191a%7C770a245002274c6290c74e38537f1102%7C0%7C0%7C637732708934100002%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=XCt1EWHEJ6OHTYf12RMS2Nf545VeOvqcyX0tBZsG3rQ%3D&amp;reserved=0">Prepare, Act, Survive plan</a> so you’ll know what to do when there’s a flood warning in your area.</p>

<p>Across the country, the Environment Agency has led projects to deliver flood schemes that see 314,000 homes are now better protected since 2015. Yet the Environment Agency is delivering more:&nbsp;earlier this year the Government announced a record £5.2 billion investment in flood and coastal defences to build around 2,000 new flood and coastal defences and better protect 336,000 properties by 2027.</p>

<h3>Notes to editors</h3>

<p>Make sure you’re prepared for flooding this year by following these top tips:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prepare a bag that includes medical and insurance documents</li>
  <li>Check the latest flood situation online <a href="https://check-for-flooding.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">https://check-for-flooding.service.gov.uk/</a>
</li>
  <li>Know how to turn off your gas, electricity and water</li>
  <li>Check your insurance to make sure you are covered for flood damage. If you rent your home, it is your responsibility to have insurance for your belongings.</li>
  <li>If you are flooded, call 999 if in immediate danger and follow advice from emergency services.</li>
</ul>
