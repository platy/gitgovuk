<p>Salih Ozhot, from Southgate, North London, petitioned for his bankruptcy before being made bankrupt on 13 October 2021.</p>

<p>The Official Receiver was appointed as his trustee in bankruptcy before uncovering the former café manager had falsely applied for a £50,000 bounce back loan.</p>

<p>Salih Ozhot applied for the loan on behalf of Kangaroo Courier Services, claiming the business had been set-up in November 2019. However, the business never traded and was ineligible for government support.</p>

<p>Enquiries found that out of the £50,000, Salih Ozhot used £15,000 towards setting up a website for Kangaroo Courier Services. In interviews with the Official Receiver, Salih Ozhot claimed he thought he could invest the bounce back loan into the business.</p>

<p>Due to the risk he posed to creditors, the Official Receiver applied for Salih Ozhot to be placed under additional years of bankruptcy restrictions.</p>

<p>On 11 May 2022 Salih Ozhot accepted an 8-year bankruptcy undertaking, which restricts him from being able to borrow more than £500 without disclosing his bankrupt status. He also cannot act as a company director without the court’s permission.</p>

<p>Mitzi Mace, Official Receiver, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Salih Ozhot cynically applied for government support, intended to help viable businesses during the pandemic, for a business that didn’t even exist. At best, it was an idea for a business and investment in a potential venture’s website was not a legitimate reason to receive the loan.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Salih Ozhot’s actions indicated a cavalier approach to business and a risk to future creditors. His 8-year ban should serve as a warning that the Insolvency Service will take action to tackle such financial wrongdoing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In their capacity as Salih Ozhot’s trustee in bankruptcy, the Official Receiver is assessing assets available in order recover the bounce back loan.</p>
