<h3>Rupen Shah</h3>
<p>Appointed as a Board Member from 01 September 2022 until 31 August 2026.</p>

<p>Growing up a stone’s throw away from Wembley Stadium, it was almost impossible for Rupen not to be inspired by elite sport from an early age. Whether it was an England home international or FA Cup Final day, the excitement generated in the local area cemented his passion and enthusiasm for it. Rupen is now a powerful advocate for sport and believes in the transformational effect it can have on people’s lives and society.</p>

<p>Qualifying as a chartered accountant with KPMG, Rupen spent several years working strategically with high profile clients and also completed a secondment to India. He went on to become the Chief Financial Officer of the Football Foundation, the UK’s largest sports charity set up by the Government, The FA and Premier League. Rupen combines substantial expertise in commercial, charity and public finance with a real grasp of the challenges participants face when engaging and competing in sport.</p>

<p>Alongside his professional journey, Rupen developed a longstanding relationship with Arsenal FC for over a decade, which included several voluntary and part-time roles. This saw him deliver local community programmes, coaching clinics in 14 countries and coaching elite female players in the Academy, many of whom have now become, and will become, Lionesses.</p>

<p>Rupen now enjoys mentoring the next generation of talented sport enthusiasts, spending time with his family and travelling the world. He also continues his charitable work to tackle inequalities through trustee roles in sport and beyond, including Women In Sport and The Legal Education Foundation.</p>

<h3>Remuneration and Governance Code</h3>
<p>This role is remunerated at £218 per day. These appointments have been made in accordance with the Cabinet Office’s Governance Code on Public Appointments.
