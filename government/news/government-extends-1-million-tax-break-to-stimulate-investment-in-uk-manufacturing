<ul>
  <li>new measures to tackle promoters of tax avoidance, including tougher sanctions and additional HMRC powers, to be consulted on this coming spring</li>
  <li>comes as the government publishes draft tax legislation on a range of measures including the Plastic Packaging Tax</li>
</ul>

<p>A £1 million tax break to stimulate investment in UK manufacturing, to support business confidence, is to be extended, HM Treasury has announced.</p>

<p>Businesses, including manufacturing firms, can continue to claim up to £1 million in same-year tax relief through the Annual Investment Allowance (AIA) for capital investments in plant and machinery assets until 1 January 2022. The extension of the temporary £1 million cap was originally due to revert to £200,000 on 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>This move is intended to boost confidence as companies look to weather the pandemic and plan for the future.</p>

<p>Financial Secretary to the Treasury Jesse Norman said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is vital that we support business through the difficult months ahead.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Extending the Annual Investment Allowance’s £1 million cap will give businesses the confidence they need to invest into next year, helping them to grow whilst benefitting the wider economy too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As part of today’s announcements, the government is also delivering on its commitment to help protect UK taxpayers through clamping down on promoters of tax avoidance schemes.</p>

<p>In spring 2021 the government will consult on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>making UK partners equally responsible for the anti-avoidance regime penalties incurred by offshore promoters</li>
  <li>giving taxpayers more information on the products sold to them by promoters</li>
  <li>ensuring promoters face quick and significant financial consequences for promoting tax avoidance so they do not continue to profit while HMRC investigates them</li>
  <li>providing HMRC with additional powers to shut down promoters that continue to promote schemes and to stop them from setting up similar businesses</li>
</ul>

<p>The government has also announced it will launch a consultation on a proposal to require advisers to hold professional indemnity insurance, giving taxpayers greater recourse against bad tax advice.</p>

<p>The government is also publishing draft legislation for Plastic Packaging Tax, as originally announced at Budget 2018. This tax will be £200 per tonne for plastic packaging that contains less than 30% recycled plastic and will come into effect from April 2022. Further publications today include a consultation response and technical guidance on the tax impacts arising from the withdrawal of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and a consultation on the design for Making Tax Digital for Corporation Tax.</p>

<p>As announced at March 2020 Budget, the government has also delivered on its pledge to uprate Tobacco Duty in line with the Tobacco Duty Escalator (RPI + 2%). In order to narrow the gap between hand-rolling tobacco (HRT) and cigarette duty rates HRT will increase by RPI + 6%. To ensure the Minimum Excise Tax continues to be effective in the current market it will increase by RPI + 4%.</p>
