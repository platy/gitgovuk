<p>Flooding remains a risk to some areas in England, particularly the North West and West Midlands. This follows heavy rain from Storm Christoph that fell on already saturated ground, which has led to exceptionally high river levels in recent days.</p>

<p>Very sadly, around 570 properties have been flooded so far and the Environment Agency’s officers are working hard with partners to help reduce the risk, including up to 30 properties in Bewdley in Worcestershire. However, 38,000 properties across the country have already been protected from flooding and teams are operating flood defences, flood storage reservoirs and putting up temporary barriers where needed to help protect communities.</p>

<p>At 11.30am on 24 January there are 54 flood warnings, meaning that flooding is expected, and 77 flood alerts, meaning that flooding is possible.</p>

<p>People living in northern and central parts of England, especially around Ironbridge and Bewdley and further down the river Severn where river levels remain high, are being urged to prepare for the risk of flooding over the weekend. The public should sign up to flood warnings and check the latest safety advice.</p>

<p>Dr Kate Marks, Flood Duty Manager at the Environment Agency, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our thoughts are with anyone who has been affected by Storm Christoph, especially those whose homes or businesses have been flooded. Environment Agency officers are out today across the country assessing defences and operating flood barriers, and so far 38,000 properties have been protected.</p>

  <p>As river levels react to recent heavy rainfall from Storm Christoph this could bring flooding to some areas, particularly along parts of the River Severn today and into Sunday, with a risk of damage to buildings in some communities. There is also a chance of localised flooding of land and roads across parts of the North West of England on Tuesday due to further rain.</p>

  <p>We urge people to keep away from swollen rivers and not to drive through flood water – it is often deeper than it looks and just 30cm of flowing water is enough to float your car.   </p>

  <p class="last-child">People should check their flood risk, sign up for free flood warnings and keep up to date with the latest situation at via <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-flood-risk">Gov.uk</a> or follow @EnvAgency on Twitter for the latest flood updates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Storm Christoph brought some heavy, and at times record breaking, rain to parts of England. Provisional figures show Honister, in Cumbria, received 123.8 mm of rainfall on Tuesday 19 January, a new daily rainfall record for this winter and 2021. Figures also show parts of Cleveland, in North Yorkshire, received more than their average January rainfall in just a 48 hour period. Tuesday 19 January was the wettest January day for Rochdale (46.8mm), Preston (43.6 mm) and Stonyhurst, Lancashire (43.8mm) since 1954.</p>

<p>Evacuating people from their homes is a multi-agency decision where all risks are considered. Preparations for evacuations and to create Covid-secure rest centres will have been made by the relevant agencies as a precautionary measure. We would urge anyone advised to evacuate to follow the advice of the emergency services at the time.</p>
