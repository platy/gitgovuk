<p>The UK Government is suspending trade remedy measures of approximately £50 per tonne on imports of hot rolled flat and coil (HRFC) steel from Ukraine for nine months.</p>

<p>The decision follows a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-remedies.service.gov.uk/public/case/SR0025/submission/5285c9ae-e26a-4b1b-a03f-a5d3b0de005b/" rel="external">recommendation from the Trade Remedies Authority (TRA)</a>, which assessed whether the measure should be removed after the Ukraine Government wrote to the UK Government to ask for this issue to be investigated. The decision will mean Ukraine imports of HRFC steel won’t be subject to the higher trade remedy rate. HRFC steel is used mainly in the mechanical and electrical engineering, building and car-making sectors.</p>

<p>The TRA looked at whether there had been a change in market conditions and whether the effect of this change was temporary. It concluded that these conditions were met following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. The TRA also looked at what effect this change might have on UK industry. Domestic producers of this product were consulted as part of the TRA’s assessment and the TRA found no evidence that suspending the tariffs on Ukraine exports would cause injury to UK producers.</p>

<p>The suspension will come into effect from Wed 31 August 2022 and will last for nine months as this is the maximum duration allowed for an initial suspension under UK legislation. The suspension can be extended if it continues to be needed.</p>

<h2>Background information:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The Trade Remedies Authority is the UK body that investigates whether new trade remedy measures are needed to counter unfair import practices and unforeseen surges of imports.</li>

  <li>Anti-dumping remedies address imported goods which are being dumped in the UK at prices below what they would be sold for in their home country.</li>
  <li>Anti-subsidy measures, also known as countervailing measures, are one of three types of trade remedy that are allowed under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. They are put in place to offset imports being sold at unfair prices due to government subsidies in their country of origin.</li>
  <li>Trade remedy investigations were carried out by the EU Commission on the UK’s behalf until the UK left the EU. Forty-four EU trade remedy measures of interest to UK producers were carried across into UK law when the UK left the EU and the TRA is currently reviewing each one to check if it is suitable for UK needs.</li>
