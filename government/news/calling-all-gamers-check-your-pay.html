<p>From this week, gamers playing Angry Birds, The Sims, FIFA, Sugar Blast and others, will be targeted by adverts calling on workers to check they are being paid properly following the annual increase in the minimum wage.</p>

<p>With younger workers among those set to benefit most from the rise, the department has widened its reach in this demographic by targeting gamers. A 15 second animation during game play will remind players of the higher rates with a link to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://checkyourpay.campaign.gov.uk/" rel="external">check your pay page</a>.</p>

<p>Known as reward video, the adverts will run during natural pauses in the game play and players will be incentivised to watch the entire video to gain an in-game reward such as coins, points, or extra lives - for example receiving an extra ‘bird’ when playing Angry Birds.</p>

<p>The National Minimum Wage rates increased on 1 April, which included the largest ever rise to the National Living Wage to £9.50 per hour. The uplift is one of the many ways the government is supporting people with the rising costs of living, while growing our economy and boosting jobs as the best solution in the long term.</p>

<p>Labour Markets Minister Paul Scully said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Put simply, this is real life, not The Sims - and businesses need to pay their staff the legal rate following the minimum wage uplift, to pass on the extra coins.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We’re taking action with mobile game adverts to ensure UK workers know how to check their pay and make sure they aren’t being short-changed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The wider campaign, already underway, encourages workers to check their pay packets by reminding them that all workers are legally entitled to be paid the National Minimum Wage.</p>

<p>Messaging includes encouraging workers to check their hourly rate of pay, and to also check for any deductions or unpaid working time. Workers can speak to their employer, contact <abbr title="Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service">ACAS</abbr> or complain to <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> if they believe they are being underpaid.</p>

<p>The uplift in the National Minimum Wage rates, which took place on 1 April, is set to benefit around 2.5 million people, with the National Living Wage meaning that a full-time worker earns £1,000 more per year.</p>

<h2>Notes to editors</h2>

<p>The adverts will be run via Venatus, an agency representing some of the biggest gaming and entertainment publishers, reaching a wide audience across the UK.</p>
