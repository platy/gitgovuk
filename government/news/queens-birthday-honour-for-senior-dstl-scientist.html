<p>Warren Marks is awarded the honour in recognition of his service to the defence and security of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, with his pioneering novel applied data science capabilities helping to increase operational effectiveness.</p>

<p>His work saw him spend significant amounts of time supporting defence, both in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and abroad. Warren’s applied data and digital expertise on a broad range of data types and sources has helped analysts and senior defence leaders make timely decisions in a wide variety of situations. During his 24 year career he has worked with many of the front line commands in the Ministry of Defence (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>) as well as directly supporting several Government organisations.</p>

<p>Applied data science forms a vital component of modern warfighting. Analysing multiple data sources to create information advantage provides commanders with critical information to act at the right time, from mission planning to operations, winning the battle and keeping <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> forces from harm.</p>

<p>Warren said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m absolutely proud and humbled to receive this award.</p>

  <p>The role of <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> science and engineering has never been more relevant. <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>’s impartiality, integrity, honesty and objectivity are vital in the application of data science to <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>.</p>

  <p>There have been so many exciting projects, dedicated colleagues, passionate customers and challenging science and engineering problems that I have had the privilege of working on and with over 24 years.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I’m fortunate to work in an organisation where we listen to specialists, take appropriate risk and have the autonomy to act in the best interests of the customer community to try to really make a difference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Paul Hollinshead, the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory’s Chief Executive, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am proud that Warren’s skills are recognised in his ability to guide and influence capability across Government through his work within the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> in a wide range of data engineering, science and analysis roles supporting national security and a number of key programmes.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Warren should be justly proud that his professionalism and passion has made, and continues to make, an immense impact on our nation’s defence and security. I am delighted that Warren has been considered worthy of this state recognition and honour.</p>
