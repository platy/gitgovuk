<p>Algernon Marsden by the French artist Jacques Joseph Tissot – who lived and worked in London and became known as James Tissot in the UK – is at risk of leaving the country unless a buyer can be found.</p>

<p>Dating from the late 19th century, the painting depicts Algernon Moses Marsden, an infamous figure in the Victorian art world who later became known for his appearances in bankruptcy courts.</p>

<p>The painting has become an icon of the Aesthetic movement in recent years, despite having never been displayed during Tissot’s lifetime, and depicts a young man in a luxurious interior. Algernon Marsden epitomises Tissot’s desire to elevate a portrait of an individual into a timeless genre painting and the sympathy between the artist, the sitter, and their surroundings is extraordinary.</p>

<p>Arts Minister Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Tissot has had an important influence on British art, the full extent of which is only just beginning to be explored. Algernon Marsden is a fascinating painting and reveals much about the Aesthetic movement, Victorian art dealers, and Tissot’s significance for future artists. I hope a buyer comes forward so we can continue to learn about this exceptional painting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Minister’s decision follows the advice of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/supporting-collections-and-cultural-property/reviewing-committee#section-1" rel="external">Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest</a>. The Committee agreed that this is a fascinating painting, presented in Tissot’s highly insightful style. It also noted the painting presents precarious, recent, and specifically Jewish affluence characteristic of this era, and emphasised this portrait’s value for research into social history and as a commentary on Marsden at this time.</p>

<p>Committee Member Pippa Shirley said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This languidly handsome young man, who fixes us with his direct, appraising gaze, invites us into a world which is both luxurious and deceptive. He looks completely at home in his environment, but the setting was in fact the artist’s studio, and the tiger skin and some of the elaborate furnishings are actually props. Tissot, referred to as ‘the French Millais’ was at this point one of the most celebrated and successful French artists on both sides of the Channel, and this portrait, painted in 1877 and very much of its time, precisely observed and beautifully painted, more than justifies that reputation. The empathy, and sense of connection with Algernon Marsden, whom he knew, is palpable, and the composition hints at the sitter’s background.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Marsden’s history was almost literally rags to riches and back again – his family were Jewish entrepreneurs who had risen from poverty in the East End of London through a fortune made in the ready-made clothing business, but Algernon turned his back on that to set up as an art dealer, so encountering Tissot. It was not a wise move. Some years after this portrait was painted, he was declared bankrupt three times, thanks to his addiction to gambling, and eventually fled to America. This colourful yet shadowy figure and what he represents deserves to be better understood. His activities in the art market, his social circle and his relationship to Tissot and influence of French artists in London all merit further research, and it is very much to be hoped that the portrait can remain in this country to encourage that exploration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Committee made its recommendation on the grounds that the departure of the painting from the UK would be a misfortune owing to its outstanding significance to the study of Tissot’s influence on British art, as well as the culture of art dealers at this time.</p>

<p>The decision on the export licence application for the painting will be deferred for a period ending on 16 September 2022 inclusive. At the end of the first deferral period owners will have a consideration period of 15 Business Days to consider any offer(s) to purchase the painting at the recommended price of £2,430,130 (plus VAT of £72,900 which can be reclaimed by an eligible institution). The second deferral period will commence following the signing of an Option Agreement and will last for four months.</p>
