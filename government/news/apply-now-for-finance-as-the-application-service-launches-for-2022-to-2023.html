<p>Full-time undergraduate students in Wales are being encouraged to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk/discover-student-finance" rel="external">apply now</a>  for student finance, as the application service opens for the 2022 to 2023 academic year. The Student Loans Company (SLC) expects approximately 1.5 million full-time, undergraduate students to apply for funding this year and the advice is to get applications in early.</p>

<p>Students in Wales can apply for a Tuition Fee Loan to pay for tuition fees and a Maintenance Loan and Grant to help with living costs. 
By applying before the deadline (27 May 2022 for new students and 17 June 2022 for returning students) students can ensure they will have their finance in place for the start of term. Even if they are unsure of what course they will be doing or what university they will be attending, SLC is still encouraging students to apply now.</p>

<p>Applications can take six to eight weeks to process. Students can check their application status online and view a ‘to do list’ of any outstanding actions they need to take.</p>

<p>Chris Larmer, SLC Executive Director of Operations, said:
“SLC exists to enable opportunity for students to invest in their futures through access to further and higher education. We want students to get their higher education journey off to the best start by ensuring they have their finances in place at the start of term. That’s why we are encouraging them to apply now for their student finance.</p>

<p>“We want to make it as easy as possible for students to access student finance and to support them resources are available online at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk/discover-student-finance" rel="external">https://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk/discover-student-finance</a>.
