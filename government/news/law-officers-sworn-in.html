<p>The Rt Hon Suella Braverman QC MP, was sworn in as Attorney General for England and Wales in a joint ceremony at the Royal Courts of Justice today.</p>

<p>Alex Chalk QC MP joined the Attorney General at the ceremony where he was sworn in as Solicitor General for England and Wales.</p>

<p>The Rt Hon Dominic Raab MP was also sworn in as Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary at the historic ceremony.</p>

<p>The Lord Chief Justice, the Lord Ian Burnett of Maldon spoke at the ceremony to welcome the Law Officers and the Lord Chancellor into their roles.</p>

<p>Speaking after the ceremony, the Attorney General, the Rt Hon Suella Braverman said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am honoured to be sworn in to resume my role as Attorney General. One of my top priorities is to continue to work to restore confidence in the criminal justice system.</p>

  <p>I warmly welcome Alex Chalk to his role as Solicitor General. Alex brings a wealth of experience to the role, and I look forward to working with him as a Law Officer.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I am also delighted to welcome Dominic Raab to his role as Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary. I am confident he will do his upmost to defend and uphold the independence of the judiciary, and I look forward to working with him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lord Chancellor, the Rt Hon Dominic Raab MP, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is an honour to be sworn in as Lord Chancellor and entrusted with the role of upholding the rule of law and defending the independence of our judiciary – responsibilities I take very seriously.</p>

  <p class="last-child">My priorities are to drive up productivity through the courts, build more prison places and create a regime that rehabilitates offenders, cuts reoffending, and boost support for victims. I also want to take forward human rights reform to ensure a better common-sense balance. I look forward to working with the returning Attorney General and new Solicitor General who I know will bring energy and enthusiasm to their historic offices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Commenting on his new appointment Alex Chalk QC MP said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is a privilege to be sworn in as Solicitor General for England and Wales and I thank everyone for their kind words since my appointment.</p>

  <p class="last-child">There are important responsibilities that come with this unique role, and I look forward to working with the Attorney General to play my part in strengthening our precious justice system and upholding the rule of law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Attorney General is the Government’s chief legal advisor and also attends Cabinet. As well as providing advice to government, the Law Officers oversee the Law Officers’ Departments which include the Crown Prosecution Service, Serious Fraud Office, Government Legal Department and HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate.</p>

<p>The Law Officers carry out a number of functions in the public interest, such as considering unduly lenient sentences, and taking action when there has been a contempt of court. These functions are carried out independently of their role as government ministers.</p>

<p>Suella Braverman was appointed Attorney General on 13 February 2020. She was re-appointed as Attorney General on 10 September 2021 following her maternity leave.</p>

<p>Alex Chalk was appointed as Solicitor General for England and Wales on 16 September 2021.</p>
