        <p>Housing Minister Rt Hon Christopher Pincher MP has today (26 January 2021) confirmed Simon Dudley has been appointed as the new chairman of Ebbsfleet Development Corporation.</p>

<p>The 4-year appointment follows a fair and open recruitment process, after which the Prime Minister confirmed his suitability for the role.</p>

<p>Simon’s appointment follows Michael Cassidy CBE ending 6 successful years as Chair of Ebbsfleet Development Corporation’s board.</p>

<p>Simon is the former leader of Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead Council where he served from 2007 to 2019. He became a non-executive director of Homes England in 2017, becoming Senior Independent Director and then Interim Chair between the summer 2019 and the autumn of 2020.</p>

<p>The Ebbsfleet Development Corporation (EDC) is the Urban Development Corporation established by government in 2015 to deliver the new Ebbsfleet Garden City in North Kent.</p>

<p>Ebbsfleet Garden City is the first Garden City for over 100 years and one of the largest housing developments on brownfield sites in the UK.</p>

<p>With well over 2,000 quality new homes, the Garden City has the potential to create around 30,000 new job opportunities.</p>

<p>New communities, such as Ebbsfleet Garden City make an important contribution to the government ambition of delivering 300,000 new homes per year.</p>

<p>Housing Minister Rt Hon Christopher Pincher MP said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am delighted to announce Simon Dudley has been appointed as the new chairman of Ebbsfleet Development Corporation and would like to thank Michael Cassidy for his sterling work over the past 6 years.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The Ebbsfleet, Northfleet and Swanscombe area has huge potential to create not only new homes, but also a vibrant community where people want to live and work. We look forward to working with him and wish him every success in helping to deliver a garden city of which we can all be proud.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simon Dudley, incoming Chairman of EDC said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The creation of Ebbsfleet Garden City is a fantastic opportunity to grow a new community and business location where London meets the Garden of England.</p>

  <p>Building on a series of brownfield sites in one of the best-connected locations in England, we aim to deliver a vibrant new city of up to 15,000 new homes.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I’m absolutely thrilled to be appointed by the Prime Minister to one of the most successful regeneration projects in the country and I can’t wait to start.</p>
</blockquote>
