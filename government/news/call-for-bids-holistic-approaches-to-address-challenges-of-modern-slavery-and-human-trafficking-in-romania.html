<p>This project is a significant part of a wider portfolio of projects which seeks to support the Romanian government and civil society in reducing the drivers of Serious and Organised Crime (<abbr title="serious and organised crime">SOC</abbr>).</p>

<p>Addressing human trafficking and <abbr title="serious and organised crime">SOC</abbr> requires international cooperation, as the nature of these crimes is transnational and criminal networks frequently operate across borders. This is a priority policy area for the British Government and the British Embassy Bucharest, as Romania is a source, transit and destination country for <abbr title="modern slavery and human trafficking">MSHT</abbr>. In 2020 alone, the British referral mechanism registered 368 Romanian victims of trafficking.</p>

<p>The UK’s strategy for tackling <abbr title="modern slavery and human trafficking">MSHT</abbr> crime threats and risk has four pillars: Prevention, Protection, Pursue and Prepare (the four “P”s). Broadly these pillars cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prevention of individuals being drawn into crime, and reduction of vulnerabilities for potential victims</li>
  <li>protection of victims, including in their interactions with the legal system, or from societal stigma and isolation</li>
  <li>pursuing criminals, by improving law enforcement capacity in working on <abbr title="modern slavery and human trafficking">MSHT</abbr> cases or supporting victims in working with the justice system</li>
  <li>preparing law enforcement, government (including local government) and civil society to handle and identify <abbr title="modern slavery and human trafficking">MSHT</abbr> cases more effectively</li>
</ul>

<p>Proposals should incorporate activities under each of the 4 pillars to ensure a holistic approach to tackling <abbr title="modern slavery and human trafficking">MSHT</abbr> in the counties identified. In due course and depending on the results of this project, the outcomes and lessons may be used to inform further project work in other areas of Romania.</p>

<p>Proposals should focus principally on activities in the counties of Dolj and Olt, and focus on in-depth activities on a local scale. These two counties are some of the most prevalent origin counties in <abbr title="modern slavery and human trafficking">MSHT</abbr> statistics, so have been chosen for this initial project.</p>

<p>We welcome consortium proposals which bring in expertise from more than one organisation, working together, as we recognise achieving outcomes on all 4 aspects of this project would be difficult for a single organisation.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>The main objective for this project is to reduce the risk of human trafficking in the counties of Dolj and Olt through prevention activities and campaigns, improving capacity to prosecute criminals, protection of victims and preparing local government, communities and influential actors to identify potential risks and vulnerabilities in the future.</p>

<h2>Scope of work</h2>

<p>The project should be focused in Dolj and Olt counties and take into account both rural and urban communities. If there is natural crossover into neighbouring counties (e.g. Teleorman, Caraș-Severin), this would also be considered in scope but the project should focus on in-depth in a limited location rather than having national reach.</p>

<p>This project may act as a pilot for future work (depending on the availability of UK funding) so capturing results, monitoring of outcomes and demonstrating ability to replicate or adapt to other regions will be significant factors in the evaluation of bids.</p>

<h2>Activities</h2>

<p>Activities financed under this project could include*:</p>

<ul>
  <li>awareness campaigns delivered through the local media and informal local leaders to discourage vulnerable individuals from becoming involved into human trafficking, whether as perpetrators or victims</li>
  <li>training sessions for informal community leaders or individuals with relevant responsibilities, to empower them to identify signs of modern slavery and report them to the Romanian authorities</li>
  <li>offering trauma-informed care training to local police officers and law enforcement</li>
  <li>improving victim pathway support with Police Officers and Prosecutors, enabling better engagement</li>
  <li>efforts to break myths and stigma around human trafficking victims, in communities, or with authorities</li>
  <li>offering psychological and legal counselling to survivors, supporting their reintegration and preventing re-trafficking</li>
  <li>campaigns or activities targeted at those at risk of becoming involved in criminal activity and promoting positive alternatives to crime</li>
  <li>providing training or resources for professionals in a position to identify trafficking risks (e.g. airport staff)</li>
  <li>educational activities focused at young people on protecting themselves from human trafficking risks, including recruitment tactics</li>
  <li>financial and technical support to victim support organisations or shelters in the region, aimed at reducing re-trafficking risk or financial dependence</li>
</ul>

<p>*This is not an exhaustive list and the British Embassy welcomes innovative proposals from potential implementing partners which suggest additional or alternative activities to deliver the key objectives.</p>

<h2>Project approach</h2>

<p>Bidders are asked to submit a project proposal which will be approved by the British Embassy Bucharest and will form the basis for project planning. The proposal should set out how the implementing partner(s) will deliver activities to support the objectives set out above with an implementation plan and supporting budget. The British Embassy Bucharest will oversee the project planning and provide the necessary contacts to the implementers.</p>

<p>The project implementer(s) will manage project logistics, including travel plans, lodging, car hiring etc. and is expected to consider the pandemic context and its possible impact on the project implementation when submitting the bid.</p>

<p>The Embassy will provide contact persons and focal points for UK institutions or experts that might be needed in the process. The Embassy can also facilitate providing government expertise from the UK to support activity where appropriate and proportionate. The Embassy can also provide support to ensuring the project reflects UK holistic approaches and methods, and will work implementers on this.</p>

<h2>How to Bid</h2>

<p>Our process will consist of a one-stage full bid proposal.</p>

<p>For organisations who wish to bid as a consortium we will be looking for a lead organisation who will be the signatory of the grant agreement and accountable for delivery of the whole project. It will be the responsibility of the lead organisation to run the consortium, provide assurance on areas such as due diligence and safeguarding, and agree terms and delivery with consortium members. Organisations who are bidding as a consortium, are required to include and complete the table below in their bidding documentation.</p>

</div>

<p>Please specify in the subject of the email the name of implementing organisation(s) and title of the project. Activity Based Budgets should list the activities needed to deliver the outcomes (results) of the project and all costs should be in Romanian Lei (RON).</p>

<h2>Reporting</h2>

<p>The reports to be produced during the course of this project are to be delivered in English:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an Inception Note detailing approach and proposed activities. This should also set out key stakeholders who will be engaged, a proposed schedule of activities, risks, safeguarding approach and any additional details</li>
  <li>a Draft Report</li>
  <li>monthly financial reports</li>
  <li>after a facilitated process of commenting, the Final Report</li>
</ul>

<h2>Composition of the project teams</h2>

<p>A Project Director, from the part of BE Bucharest (i.e. Tanya Collingridge, Deputy Head of Mission) and a Project Manager, from the part of BE Bucharest will oversee the project delivery.</p>

<p>Project proposals should demonstrate that the staffing level is appropriate to the aim of the project and that the staff have relevant expertise and experience in Modern Slavery, Human Trafficking, working with Romanian law enforcement, victim support, crime prevention campaigns, as well as a detailed overall knowledge of the Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking threat in Romania.</p>

<p>Proposals should also allocate at least 10% of the budget for monitoring and evaluation.</p>

<h2>Timing and scope of input</h2>

<p>The bidding round is an open and competitive process, assessed by the British Embassy in Bucharest. Results will be issued in October. Once a bid is approved, a Grant Agreement will be signed with the successful bidders. In the documents section you will find an example of a Grant Agreement. Your organisation will be expected to sign the contract within one week of the funds being awarded. Failure to do so will result in the funds being re-allocated. The implementing organisation will be required to submit report updates and a final evaluation of the project.</p>

<p>There are no pre-payments. Reimbursements will be completed once activities have taken place and all receipts submitted. Implementing organisations will request repayments using an invoice (including receipts and a financial report of spend) and the repayments will be carried out during those dates agreed upon in the respective contract.</p>

<p>The budget should be presented in Romanian Lei. All payments will be made in RON to a bank account held in Romania.</p>

<p>Please send any questions regarding the call for bids to <a href="mailto:rsvp.bucharest@fcdo.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">rsvp.bucharest@fcdo.gov.uk</a> and <a href="mailto:andrada.petrache@fcdo.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">andrada.petrache@fcdo.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>It is expected that the project will be carried out from end October 2021 to end February 2022. However, this project has the potential to be financed again in FY22-23 subject to results and availability of funding.</p>

<p>The crucial milestones will be the submission of the Draft report (February 2022) and the Final report (March 2022).</p>

<h2>Budget</h2>

<p>Grant applications must include an estimated budget of up to 848,750 RON. Depending on the quality of the proposals, the British Embassy reserves the right not to grant all or part of the available funds. The Embassy also reserves the right to award a grant of less than the amount requested by the applicants. In such a case, applicants will be asked to increase the amount that they co-finance, to propose other co-financing means or to decrease the total costs without altering the substance of the proposal.</p>
