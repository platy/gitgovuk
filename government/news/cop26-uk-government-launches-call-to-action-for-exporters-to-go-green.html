  <li>Campaign highlights the overseas renewable energy opportunities UK businesses can take advantage of</li>

<abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> supports businesses to deliver vital exports in sectors like offshore wind, solar and hydrogen, with a pipeline of export opportunities for UK suppliers</li>

</ul>

<p>UK Export Finance (<abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>), the UK’s export credit agency, has today launched a call to action to business across the country to take advantage of renewable export opportunities around the world in the race to net zero.</p>

<p>Launched at COP26 conference in Glasgow, <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> is highlighting the global reach of ‘Made in Britain’ excellence and the scope for businesses to take the lead on driving a more sustainable future.</p>

<p>Green trade is set to be worth £1.8 trillion by 2030, delivering up to £170 billion of export sales in goods and services for the UK by 2030.  <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> has enormous liquidity for UK businesses to tap into and take advantage of green trade, with a £50 billion capacity to support UK exports.</p>

<p>In recent years, <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s support has helped UK businesses to win export contracts in over 80 countries, including Spain, Taiwan, Dubai and Ghana, developing wind farms, solar-powered clean drinking water and sustainable transport. In turn, this is estimated to have helped support 64,000 jobs each year since 2018.</p>

<p>The campaign emphasises the work of Lancaster-based wind farm supplier First Subsea; offshore engineering company Offshore Design Engineering (ODE) Group; and clean water provider Aqua Africa, all of whom have used <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s support to win millions of pounds of overseas sustainable contracts.</p>

<p>Clean and green exports currently make up at least 50% of <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s multi-billion business development pipeline of potential deals it may be able to support in the future and <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> is seeking to connect UK suppliers with these international projects.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> is highlighting these opportunities this week at COP26 in the UK Pavilion alongside other international Export Credit Agencies, outlining the need for greater international cooperation to finance green projects.</p>

<h4>International Trade Secretary and UK International Champion on Adaptation and Resilience for the COP26 Presidency, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, says:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the world becomes greener, there are huge opportunities for businesses across the UK to be at the forefront of a sustainable future.</p>

  <p>UK Export Finance has the tools exporters need to tap into green markets across the world with over £2 billion of lending dedicated to financing clean growth and huge capacity to support SMEs.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The UK can be very proud of our expertise and quality, which are in demand around the globe. <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> is here to provide the financial support our exporters need to grow and spur an international green industrial revolution.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>John Shaw, Managing Director, First Subsea Ltd. said:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>We thought renewables was an up-and-coming industry, and were very excited about the wind farms around the coast of the North West. We then realised it was a global marketplace, but quickly understood that the commercial proposition was very different to oil and gas. That meant we had much more of a challenge to overcome in terms of financing, bonds and payment terms.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Our bank and <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> worked very well together and delivered us a product very quickly, and we have potentially had a major game change in this business because of this funding, so I would encourage other businesses to take advantage.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>About UK Export Finance</h4>
