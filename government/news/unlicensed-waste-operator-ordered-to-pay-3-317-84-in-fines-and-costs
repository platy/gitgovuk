  <li>Multi-agency action ends in court proceedings</li>
  <li>Magistrates impose fine of £1,100 and costs of £2,217.84</li>
  <li>Operator found guilty in his absence after failing to attend court</li>
</ul>

<p>The case against Stephen Hornby, of Central Avenue, Stapleford, was proved in his absence at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court on Monday 14 December 2020 after he failed to attend.</p>

<p>He was fined £1,100, ordered to pay costs of £2,107.84 and a victim surcharge fee of £110.</p>

<p>Hornby was directed to stop by a multi-agency operation staged at Buzz Bingo, Gala Way, Nottingham, on 26 September 2019.</p>

<p>He was driving a Ford transit flatbed vehicle bearing the sign ‘Hornby’s Home and Garden Improvements.’</p>

<p>Officials found that the vehicle was carrying waste including a tree stump, branches, plastic wrapping, a fence panel and concrete and rubble.</p>

<p>The defendant was given a letter advising him to register as a waste carrier within 10 days.</p>

<p>However, a further check on the database on 14 October 2019 showed that no records of a registration had taken place.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the Environment Agency said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We hope that this result will send a clear message to waste recycling operators that they should make sure they are fully licensed.</p>

  <p>We are actively targeting illegal waste activities across the country and urge all those seeking to become involved in the waste industry to ensure they have the appropriate permits and authorisations.</p>

  <p>Everyone has a part to play to help solve the waste crime problem and make sure waste is managed responsibly.</p>

  <p class="last-child">If you pass your waste to someone else to take away for you, you must first check they are registered with the Environment Agency so it doesn’t end up in the hands of operators who break the law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Businesses and householders should carry out checks to ensure that they are using legitimate companies to deal with their waste.</p>

<p>To check if a waste carrier is genuine visit: <a rel="external" href="https://environment.data.gov.uk/public-register/view/search-waste-carriers-brokers">https://environment.data.gov.uk/public-register/view/search-waste-carriers-brokers</a>.</p>

<h3 id="charges">Charges</h3>

<p>On 26 September 2019, Stephen Hornby, being a person who is not a registered carrier of controlled waste, did, in the course of his business or otherwise with a view to profit, transport controlled waste, namely a tree stump, branches, plastic wrapping, a fence panel and concrete and rubble to Buzz Bingo, Gala Way, Nottingham, NG5 9RU, being a place in Great Britain contrary to section 1 (1) of the Control of Pollution (Amendment) Act 1989.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>You must register with the Environment Agency to legally operate as a waste carrier, broker or dealer. Search ‘waste carriers register’ on gov.uk to register: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/waste-carrier-or-broker-registration">https://www.gov.uk/waste-carrier-or-broker-registration</a>.</p>

<p>More information on the Environment Agency’s regulatory approach can be found at: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environment-agency-regulatory-response-to-coronavirus">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environment-agency-regulatory-response-to-coronavirus</a>.</p>

<p>Anyone who suspects a company is operating illegally can call the Environment Agency 24/7 on 0800 80 70 60 or report it anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
