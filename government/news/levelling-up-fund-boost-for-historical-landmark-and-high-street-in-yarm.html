    <p>Yarm one of five places in the North East to receive a share of £100 million from the first round of the £4.8bn Levelling Up Fund</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Chancellor visited Yarm today to see first-hand how the government’s Levelling Up Fund is kickstarting a number of important local projects, which will drive growth and create an attractive place for residents to call home.</p>

<p>Rishi Sunak toured the high street to see how £20 million of government investment will transform the town’s Grade-II listed 18th century town hall into a visitor centre and community learning space, spreading opportunity and helping to boost jobs and the economy.</p>

<p>He saw how the funding will widen the footpath to create opportunities for outdoor seating, and spoke to local business owners about how improved access will increase their footfall.</p>

<p>The neighbouring village of Eaglescliffe will also benefit as Preston Park and Museum is extended to create an exhibition and gallery space for international exhibits. This will open up access to cultural opportunities in the region.</p>

<p>Yarm is one of the five places in the North East of England to receive a share of £100 million from the £1.7 billion first round of the Levelling Up Fund, as announced by the Chancellor in October’s Budget. His visit comes ahead of Small Business Saturday, a campaign to encourage consumers to ‘shop local’ and support small businesses in their community.</p>

<h4>Following his visit, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>We want to level up all corners of the UK so that people have the same opportunities wherever they’re from and can feel proud in the places they call home.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It’s fantastic to come to Yarm and see the difference our £20 million investment will make to the community. From transforming the historic town hall, improved cycling infrastructure and new exhibition and gallery space, this funding will make the area an attractive and accessible destination for visitors, all while boosting the economy and jobs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Residents will also benefit from new cycle infrastructure. This will connect key employment sites and residential areas with Yarm High Street and Preston Hall, making it easier for communities to access cultural, employment and leisure opportunities.</p>

<p>As announced at the Budget and Spending Review, the region will see a record investment in local transport infrastructure, including millions to transform local transport across the Tees Valley, and up to £50,000 feasibility funding for a proposal to reopen the Darlington to Weardale line.</p>

<p>This all builds on the new Town Deals announced in the Spring Budget for the region, including Thornaby-on-Tees and Middlesbrough, to help the region build back better from the pandemic.</p>
