<h2>Why you should enter this competition</h2>

<p>Women and girls represent half of the world’s population and therefore also half of its potential. Today there are too few women in international diplomacy, including women from under-represented backgrounds, whether ethnic, religious, economic, cultural, or personal identity, among others. Women are not represented at parity in political and business sectors.</p>

<p>To end this underrepresentation, we must ensure equality of opportunity and equitable outcomes for everyone.</p>

<p>This is why we are encouraging young women in Turkey to make their voices heard on topics that affect us all. We will encourage the winners to become leaders and advocates for change by offering them the opportunity to take a look behind the scenes of the British Embassy in Ankara and the British Consulate General in Istanbul.</p>

<h2>Who can enter</h2>

<p>You can enter this competition if, at the time of applying, you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify as female</li>
  <li>reside in Turkey</li>
  <li>are aged between 18 and 24 years</li>
</ul>

<p>Close relatives of British Embassy Ankara and Consulate General Istanbul employees and anyone otherwise connected with the judging of the competition will not be eligible to enter.</p>

<p>Expenses: There is no entry fee.  The British Embassy Ankara and Consulate General Istanbul will cover agreed travel costs and, if needed, accommodation expenses for the winners. Winners will be contacted by the Consulate or Embassy to agree this on an individual basis.</p>

<h2>How to apply</h2>

<ul>
  <li>if you had the power to make one change to improve the lives of women and girls around the world, what would it be?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
