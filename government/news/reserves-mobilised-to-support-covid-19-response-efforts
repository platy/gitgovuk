<p>Based at <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Brize Norton, 4624 (County of Oxford) Squadron is the only Movements squadron within the Reserves and normally employs its specialist personnel to handle and move freight and passengers worldwide. A busy squadron providing ongoing support to enduring operations, it has stepped outside of its usual role to mobilise 22 Reservists for Operation RESCRIPT within a very short timescale. Initially held on 48 hours stand-by as part of the high-readiness contingency force to support the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>, 20 personnel have recently assumed responsibility for mobile testing in Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire working alongside personnel from 606 Squadron, <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Benson.</p>

<p>Senior Aircraftman Geetha Ramesh, who works for Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HRMC) as an Intelligence Development Officer, volunteered to be mobilised and is currently deployed as part of one of the numerous Mobile Testing teams working on a daily basis around the three counties. She joined the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Reserves in 2017 and Operation RESCRIPT is her first mobilisation.</p>

<p>Geetha said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As soon as I heard from the Squadron that they were seeking volunteers for COVID-19 operations, I consulted my managers in <abbr title="Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs">HMRC</abbr>, who were very supportive with my intention to assist during the difficult pandemic times.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I also cancelled my pre-booked holiday and organised domestic matters swiftly as I did not want to miss the opportunity to render my services to the nation. I feel satisfied and proud that I am a little drop in the mighty ocean of selfless people helping the country to overcome this disaster.</p>
