<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/corporate-insolvency-and-governance-bill-receives-royal-assent">The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 received royal assent on 25 June 2020</a>. The Act granted automatic extensions for filing deadlines between 27 June 2020 and 5 April 2021 to relieve the burden on companies during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and allow them to focus all their efforts on continuing to operate. Automatic extensions were granted for accounts, confirmation statements, event-driven filings and mortgage charges.</p>

<p>There will be no further automatic extensions for confirmation statement filings, accounts filings and event-driven filings after 5 April 2021. Any deadlines that fall after this date will revert to normal.</p>

<p>For mortgage charges created up to and including 4 April 2021, those with an interest in the charge will continue to receive an automatic extension of 10 additional days to file the particulars of a charge (31 days). Mortgage charges created after 4 April 2021 will not receive an automatic extension, and those with an interest in the charge will need to file within 21 days as normal. The 21-day period starts the day after the charge was created.</p>

<h2>If you need more time to file your accounts</h2>

<p>For accounts filing deadlines that fall after 5 April, companies can still <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/extensions" rel="external" class="govuk-link">apply for a 3-month extension</a>.</p>

<p>Companies that are eligible and cite issues around COVID-19 in their application will be granted an extension.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Companies that have already had their accounts deadline extended may not be eligible, as the law only allows a maximum filing period of 12 months.</p>
</div>

<p>It’s important to check if you’re eligible for an extension and to apply for an extension before your deadline. You must file your accounts on time or you’ll receive a late filing penalty.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1</strong>
Company A has an accounting reference date (ARD) of 30 June 2020. Their deadline would usually be 31 March 2021. The company received an automatic 3 month extension under the Act, resulting in a deadline of 30 June 2021. Company A cannot apply for a further extension as the law only allows a maximum filing period of 12 months.</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2</strong>
Company B (a public company) has an ARD of 30 June 2020. Their deadline would usually be 31 December 2020. The company received an automatic 3 month extension under the Act, resulting in a deadline of 31 March 2021. Company B can apply for a further extension if they cite COVID-19 as a factor, as the maximum filing period of 12 months has not yet been reached.</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 3</strong>
Company C has an ARD of 31 July 2020 and its accounts are due by 30 April 2021. Company C were granted a 3 month extension for their previous filing period (ARD of 31 July 2019). The company will not get an automatic extension as the deadline falls after 5 April 2021, but they can still apply for a 3 month extension for their current filing period to give them the maximum amount of time allowed.</p>
