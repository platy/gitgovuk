<p>As we continue to celebrate the outstanding work being done across government, we are delighted to share that 3 GLD colleagues, and one former colleague, have been recognised in this year’s Queen’s Birthday Honours list.</p>

<p>Virginia Bennett and Catherine (Cat) Gulliver, both senior lawyers in the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Legal Advisers, have been awarded O.B.E’s for services to climate change law. Virginia and Cat have both worked on a wide variety of climate change matters, in particular, climate and trade, the climate parts of the UK/EU Trade &amp; Cooperation Agreement, and climate change and human rights. They also provide advice on international climate negotiations and both attended the COP26 climate summit where they supported and provided guidance to the UK Presidency team.</p>

<p>Virginia and Cat reflect:</p>

<p>“We are both thrilled to have been awarded O.B.Es. We’d also like thank everyone in our legal team, everyone in the COP26 Unit, and all of our other colleagues. Everyone we work with shows incredible passion and commitment to getting the UK and the world on track for net zero and we feel privileged to be part of the team. We also want to remember our dear colleague Clare Radcliffe who dedicated so much to the civil service, to GLD, and to climate work in particular.”</p>

<p>Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) Legal Advisers Deputy Legal Director Henry Ripley has been awarded a C.B.E for his services to the law, specifically for his work on supporting the government in its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Henry led the DHSC team through the drafting of an immense amount of legislation that protected the public during the unprecedented time. Henry reflects:</p>

<p>“I am incredibly touched by this, not least because it recognises the astonishing work done by DHSC Legal Advisers during the COVID-19 pandemic. I couldn’t have asked for a more supportive, talented, can-do and good humoured group of colleagues to deliver so much of the government’s COVID-19 response – so this is for them.”</p>

<p>Finally previous Director General Stephen Braviner Roman who received a C.B also for his services to the law. Stephen was at GLD for over 25 years and led on EU Exit, COVID-19 and setting up the GLD office in Leeds.</p>

<p>Of these awards Director General Elizabeth Hambley said, “On behalf of my Board and Executive Committee colleagues I would like to offer many congratulations to Virginia, Cat and Henry. You have all played a pivotal role leading hugely important and at times challenging work in the civil service, and this recognition of your contribution is richly deserved. We are also delighted that Stephen’s public service has been recognised in this way and send him our best wishes and congratulations.”</p>
