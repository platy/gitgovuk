<p>Megan has worked for Sellafield Ltd for 3 years as an apprentice nuclear operator.</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">When I started my apprenticeship, I was quiet and unsure about what I could achieve. I’m now much more self-confident, proud of the skills that I have developed and delighted to of won this award.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two other Sellafield Ltd employees were recognised on the night. And Sellafield Ltd itself, alongside training partner Gen2, were finalists in the ‘Best Employer and Provider’ category.</p>

<p>Luke Doran, a 5th year process engineer degree apprentice, was shortlisted in the ‘Higher and Degree Apprentice’ category.</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Being a finalist shows my hard work hasn’t gone unnoticed and it gives me a great deal of pride in what I’ve managed to achieve.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I’m incredibly grateful for the support I’ve received throughout my apprenticeship.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Luke Crampton, who is working towards his chartership in IChemE design systems was also shortlisted for ‘Graduate of the Year’.</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was delighted to be shortlisted for this award and grateful to the company for putting my name forward.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The nuclear industry provides technical challenges which put my skills to the test while helping to better myself as an engineer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sellafield Ltd and Gen2, our engineering and technology training provider, were shortlisted in the Best Employer and Provider Category.</p>

<p>Sellafield Ltd has approximately 600 apprentices on its books with qualifications ranging from level 2 (GCSE equivalent) to level 6 (degree level) across 15 schemes.</p>

<p>The company also has more than 120 graduates on a 2-year programme across 24 disciplines.</p>

<p>Gen2 has 5 training centres across Cumbria working with over 300 clients delivering a range of short courses and apprenticeship programmes with progression routes into employment and higher education including honours degrees.</p>

<p>Donna Connor, head of education and skills for Sellafield Ltd said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Being shortlisted in this category is testament to the recruitment and support provided by Sellafield Ltd and the excellent training provision of Gen2 in West Cumbria.</p>

  <p>We have such a diverse range of apprenticeships, including nuclear welding inspection, fire and rescue and business administration, and this award emphasises the exciting career opportunities at Sellafield Ltd and the nuclear industry.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Having 3 people shortlisted and Megan going on to win, highlights the excellent calibre of apprentices on our books – I couldn’t be prouder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amanda Towers, Managing Director of Gen2 said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We were extremely proud to have been shortlisted for this category.</p>

  <p>It’s testament to the long standing collaboration and partnership between Gen2 and Sellafield Ltd and our shared purpose to ensure we provide high quality training for many hundreds of Sellafield apprentices.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We believe the success of the partnership is due to the shared understanding of nuclear sector, passion for training development and delivery and a flexible and responsive approach that enables training solutions which are high quality and fit for purpose.</p>
