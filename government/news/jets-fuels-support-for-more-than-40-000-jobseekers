        <p>In its first fifty days, Work Coaches across the country have acted quickly to deliver the additional support, signposting tens of thousands of Universal Credit and New Style Job Seeker’s Allowance (JSA) claimants to the programme - providing job hunters with the boost they need to return to employment.</p>

<p>Targeting those made jobless by coronavirus, the support has already had early successes in finding participants roles. Jobseekers have received specialist advice on how they can move into growing sectors where jobs are available, as well as CV and interview guidance.</p>

<p>The tailored programme also sees those out of work for three months or longer agree an action plan with their Work Coach, receive peer support and be signposted to opportunities helping them build vital skills.</p>

<p>Minister for Employment Mims Davies MP said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Many people are sadly facing unemployment due to the pandemic, for the first time in years, and will need help to build their confidence, get back on their feet and apply for new roles – JETS gives people the tools and support they need to succeed.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">During such a challenging time, our new employment support is already helping thousands of jobseekers to get back into work and I’ve met with JETS providers to see first-hand the vital help this programme has already given people across Britain.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Our Plan for Jobs is supporting people of all ages – we’re doubling the number of Work Coaches across our Jobcentres, creating thousands of opportunities for young people through our Kickstart Scheme and our SWAP scheme is helping people retrain in new industries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>JETS has taken off across the nation and is already benefitting jobseekers, including Kyran, 31, who was referred to the scheme in early November 2020.</p>

<p>Kyran felt the full impact of the coronavirus and, in the seven months to November, was homeless and living in a hostel. However, after finding accommodation and being referred to the JETS programme, he secured a job that suited his needs to care for his daughter.</p>

<p>Kyran said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">You could say I haven’t made some of the best choices in life and I didn’t want help because I thought I could do everything myself. I acted too proud at times. But I needed help and had to swallow that pride after being in a hostel for nearly 7 months, never knowing what would be next.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I was approached to join the JETS programme and from the moment contact was made they have helped me get on my feet. They made me feel welcome with friendly polite phone calls, not just wanting to get me into work but also wanting to know I was okay. It took a matter of days before work was already looking likely and I managed to secure a job where I would still be able to look after my daughter.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I would recommend them and, to anyone ever in my position, their number would be the first I give.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The £238 million programme is part of the government’s Plan for Jobs, and follows the launch of the £2billion Kickstart scheme which will create thousands of new high quality jobs for young people, and Restart, aimed at helping those unemployed for over a year.</p>
