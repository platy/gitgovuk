<p>Cruse Bereavement Care, the Peace Foundation, South London and Maudsley NHS Trust and Victim Support will each receive £125,000 to ensure a range of victims’ needs are supported. This builds upon the £500,000 originally awarded to these organisations last year.</p>

<p>Since these services were launched in October 2020, they have provided vital support to those affected by terror attacks. The additional funding will mean that victims can continue to access support, including a 24/7 national contact centre and caseworker support, mental health and bereavement services, and facilitated peer support.</p>

<p>We recognise a victim as anyone who has suffered harm, including those who have been injured by, witnesses to, bereaved, responded to or otherwise affected by a terrorist attack. These services will support those affected by domestic and overseas terrorist attacks, and their family members.</p>

<p>Home Secretary, Priti Patel, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Victims can be affected by terrorist attacks in more ways than many of us could ever imagine.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This funding extension ensures those affected by a terrorist attack in the UK or abroad can access the range of support they need and deserve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Victims’ Commissioner for England and Wales, Dame Vera Baird QC, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Terror attacks can have a profound and life-changing impact on victims and their families and victims can often have complex needs, which include long-term counselling and support. We need to make sure that when the TV cameras disappear, victims and survivors get the right support they need to rebuild their lives and recover from their injuries.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I welcome this extension of Home Office funding, which will help strengthen the range of specialist support available for victims and survivors of terror.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cruse Bereavement Care provide bereavement support for victims not eligible for support under the Homicide Service, while South London and Maudsley NHS Trust’s service focusses on outreach, screening, and (where indicated) assessment and onwards referrals for psychological treatments.</p>

<p>Victim Support run a 24/7 National Contact Centre to provide victims with consistent and easily accessible support and the Peace Foundation facilitates a long-term peer support network for victims of terrorism.</p>

<p>The Home Secretary has also committed to reviewing the wider support package available to victims of terrorism.</p>
