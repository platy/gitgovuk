<p>HM Treasury announce that Jill Lucas has been reappointed as a Non-executive Director on the Board of NS&amp;I (National Savings &amp; Investments), as of 1 February 2022. Jill Lucas’ reappointment will be for a term of 3-years.</p>

<p>Non-Executive members of NS&amp;I’s Board ensure a sound strategy is in place to meet the organisation’s remit of raising cost-effective debt financing for the government. They also act as an external source of advice, have oversight of risk control and ensure NS&amp;I’s links with its outsourcing partner, Atos, remain open and transparent.</p>

<p>NS&amp;I is one of the largest savings organisations in the UK, offering a range of savings and investments. All products offer 100% capital security because NS&amp;I is backed by HM Treasury.</p>

<p>Jill was appointed a Non-Executive Director for a three year term from February 2019. Jill has spent all her career in technology, currently as a consultant at US Healthcare firm, Mass General Brigham and prior to that at Unilever. She has served as Chief Information Officer at both Towergate Insurance and Belron International. In her early career, she undertook many technology leadership roles at Reuters (now Thomson Reuters), Barclays and Sainsburys. Jill is also a Non-executive Director of Curtis Banks plc and Chairman of Dunstan Thomas Ltd.</p>

<p>The current NS&amp;I Board members are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ed Anderson – Non-executive Director and Chairman of the Board</li>
  <li>Ian Ackerley – Chief Executive</li>
  <li>Paul Henry – Director, Risk</li>
  <li>Dax Harkins – Director, Business-to-Business</li>
  <li>Jill Waters – Director, Retail</li>
  <li>Ruth Curry– Director, Finance</li>
  <li>Matthew Smith – Chief Operating Officer and Senior Responsible Officer for Rainbow Programme</li>
  <li>Gareth Headon – Acting Director, People and Strategy</li>
  <li>Nina Hingorani-Crain – Non-Executive Director</li>
  <li>Sharmila Nebhrajani OBE – Non-Executive Director</li>
  <li>Jill Lucas – Non-Executive Director</li>
  <li>Azin Roussos – HM Treasury Representative</li>
</ul>

<h4>Further information:</h4>

<p>The reappointment of Jill Lucas was regulated by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments.</p>

<p>All appointments are made on merit and political activity plays no part in the selection process. However, in accordance with the original Nolan recommendations, there is a requirement for appointees’ political activity (if any declared) to be made public. Jill Lucas confirmed that she has not engaged in any political activity in the last five years.</p>
