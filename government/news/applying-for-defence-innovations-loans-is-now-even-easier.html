<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-and-security-accelerator" class="govuk-link">Defence and Security Accelerator</a> (DASA) launched <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/competition-defence-innovation-loans">Defence Innovation Loans</a> in 2021, to offer small and medium enterprises (SMEs) affordable funds to help commercialise their innovations.</p>

<p>After internal review, DASA has taken the decision to run a pilot scheme making the application process for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/competition-defence-innovation-loans">Defence Innovation Loans</a> even easier. Defence Innovation Loans are now continuously open for proposals, and once a proposal is submitted, it will be assessed with initial outcomes communicated within seven weeks. This means that you won’t have to wait until the end of a cycle to receive feedback and if you’re invited to resubmit you will be able to do it quicker. The pilot scheme will be under review and will end on 16 March 2022.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/competition-defence-innovation-loans" class="govuk-link">Read the full competition document here</a> and apply for a Defence Innovation Loan.</p>

<h3>Rundown: Key changes to Defence Innovation Loans</h3>

<p>Detailed below is a list of key changes to Defence Innovation Loans, and how these changes have made the application process more straightforward.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Innovators can apply at any time, and can expect an initial outcome response within seven weeks. Applications are no longer tied to cycles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The initial outcome response is the DASA outcome. Success at this stage leads to an in-depth financial analysis by Innovate UK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The DASA stages of assessment remain the same. See the full <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/competition-defence-innovation-loans">Defence Innovation Loans</a> document for more information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This new format is a pilot that will be reviewed; when the pilot ends on 16 March 2022 we might change the format of the Defence Innovation Loans e.g. returning to cycle-based assessment periods.</p>
  </li>
