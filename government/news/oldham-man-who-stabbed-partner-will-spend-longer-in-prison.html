<p>A man who violently attacked his partner over two days has had his sentence increased after it was referred to the Court of Appeal by the then Solicitor General.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of Saturday, 15 May 2021 Stephen John Turnock, 40, was at home with his partner when they started to argue.  The offender flipped over the kitchen table and chased the victim upstairs.  Turnock then struck her to the face before cutting her left hand with a knife while she tried to defend herself.  He continued to beat her but eventually calmed down.</p>

<p>The next morning, when the victim woke up, Turnock stabbed her several more times, including to the neck and chest.  He then threw items at her, shaved her hair and damaged her clothes.  After he had left, the victim was able to contact the police.</p>

<p>She had suffered multiple injuries, including four separate stab wounds and a laceration to her hand that required surgery.</p>

<p>On 16 August 2021, Turnock was sentenced to 4 years’ imprisonment for wounding with intent at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court. He also had a restraining order imposed on him.</p>

<p>Following the sentence, the then Solicitor General referred Turnock’s sentence to the Court of Appeal under the Unduly Lenient Sentence (ULS) scheme. On 21 October the Court of Appeal found his original sentence to be unduly lenient and increased it to 7 years and 6 months’ imprisonment.</p>

<p>Speaking after the hearing, the Solicitor General, Alex Chalk QC MP said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This was a shocking and cowardly attack on a defenceless woman. This kind of violence is even more serious for having taken place in the home. I am pleased that Turnock’s sentence has been increased and I hope that the victim finds some comfort in the Court’s decision.</p>
</blockquote>
