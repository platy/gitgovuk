        Mark Smith used land in Corfe Mullen to illegally dump, bury and burn rubbish

          <p>Without a permit, Mark Smith, 54,&nbsp;was bringing waste back to land called Heatherlands&nbsp;in Corfe Mullen where he was sorting through it for anything of value.</p>

<p>However, Environment Agency officers found the illegal waste site&nbsp;in April 2019&nbsp;along with signs&nbsp;that rubbish was being&nbsp;buried and&nbsp;burned.&nbsp;Tradespeople were also spotted visiting the site to dump rubbish but quickly turned around when they saw the officers present.</p>

<p>Smith was warned that his operation was illegal and two months later a fire broke out, requiring the aid of the fire service.</p>

<p>During interview under caution, Smith claimed he had inherited 90% of the waste and&nbsp;didn’t know what he had been doing was illegal. He&nbsp;admitted he had broken up a number of refrigerators, which would have released harmful gases. But he denied&nbsp;burning rubbish, claiming he only burned green waste and that&nbsp;he suspected&nbsp;children&nbsp;of starting the fire&nbsp;in June 2019.</p>

<figcaption><p>The site was being used by cost-avoiding tradespeople to dispose of rubbish instead of using permitted sites</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>Bruce Maguire of the Environment Agency said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was disappointing to see&nbsp;tradespeople dumping waste here instead of paying to take it to a&nbsp;permitted site like a&nbsp;recycling centre.</p>

  <p>Anyone employing a tradesperson for building, gardening or house clearance work has a duty of care to ensure that the person employed is an authorised waste carrier and will be taking any waste produced to a regulated facility.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This allows&nbsp;legitimate&nbsp;business to&nbsp;compete&nbsp;on equal terms as well as preventing significant harm to the environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Smith pleaded guilty to two charges of running a waste site without a permit and was fined £2,800 by Poole Magistrates Court on 3 November 2021&nbsp;and ordered to pay costs of £700.</p>
