        <p>• The Environment Agency will carry out the investigations at sites across the town with work expected to last 8 weeks</p>

<p>• Once completed, the scheme will better protect over 150 homes, businesses and key infrastructure in central Padiham as well as manage surface water risk on local highways.</p>

<p>Padiham’s multi-million pound flood risk management scheme is set to move a step closer to construction with ground investigation works commencing this week.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency will carry out the investigations including digging of trial pits and boreholes to identify foundations and underground services at sites across the town.</p>

<p>The work is expected to last for around 8 weeks.</p>

<p>This investigation work is essential to the scheme and will allow the Environment Agency, Burnley Borough Council and other partners to anticipate any issues and plan effectively for the construction phase.</p>

<p>Plans for the scheme itself include new and enhanced flood walls, earth embankments as well as modifications to the local highways. Works are also set to include additional environmental, biodiversity and amenity improvements with the defences closely linked to local growth and regeneration, as part of the Northwest Burnley Growth Corridor, which has received £5.2m for all works in Padiham from Lancashire Enterprise Partnership’s Growth Deal Programme.</p>

<p>Andy Brown, Flood Risk Manager at the Environment Agency, said:</p>

<p>“This is a step closer to constructing the Padiham Flood Risk Management Scheme and will build on the outline work and proposals shared with the community in October 2019.</p>

<p>“By delivering these minor works ahead of constructing the main flood alleviation scheme, we will be able to reduce the risk of unknown issues coming to light and keep any disruption for the local community, whilst this work takes place, to a minimum. All our work will be carried out in line within the Government coronavirus guidelines and activities will continue to be reviewed so that they can be completed safely.”</p>

<p>Steve Fogg, Chair of the Lancashire Enterprise Partnership said:</p>

<p>'’It’s great to hear the investigative works are about to commence for the flood risk management scheme.&nbsp; Improvements to Padiham’s flood defences will complement the wider growth and regeneration work of the NW Burnley Growth Corridor Scheme, in which the LEP has invested £5.2m from its Growth Deal Funding to boost the vitality of the town centre.&nbsp; Flooding can have a devastating effect on communities and businesses, and the investigative works starting on site means Padiham is a step closer to having a flood management scheme in place to help mitigate the flood risk for the town.’’</p>

<p>Further site investigations will also be taking place on the ground in Padiham between January and March 2021.&nbsp; These are the final major investigations and will help the Environment Agency to better understand the condition of existing walls already in place along the riverbanks, the local ground water conditions and any risks posed by old mining works in the area.</p>

<p>Notes to editors</p>

  <li>Image shows Padiham Bridge</li>
  <li>Once completed, the Padiham Flood Risk Management Scheme will better protect over 150 homes, businesses, public buildings and key infrastructure. The scheme will manage flood risk along the River Calder, Green Brook and surface water risk on the highways.</li>
  <li>The detailed designs of the Padiham scheme are currently in progress and are due for completion in spring 2021.&nbsp; The legally required planning, consents, agreements and approvals will subsequently be submitted and confirmed.</li>
  <li>Up to £170m of government funding was announced in July 2020 to accelerate work on ‘shovel-ready’ flood defence schemes to begin construction in 2020 or 2021. Padiham was one of the beneficiaries, with an investment of £2m, providing an immediate boost to jobs supporting the local economy.</li>
  <li>The government has also recently announced a record £5.2 billion investment in flood and coastal defences – double the previous investment – to protect 336,000 properties, and the EA’s FCRM strategy will prepare us for more extreme weather and build a better prepared and more resilient nation. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-strategy-for-england--2">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-strategy-for-england–2</a>.</li>

  <li>The climate emergency means we cannot prevent all flooding. We’re working to make communities resilient to future flooding but it is essential that people know their flood risk and sign up for flood warnings in their area. <a rel="external" href="https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/warnings">https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/warnings</a>.</li>
