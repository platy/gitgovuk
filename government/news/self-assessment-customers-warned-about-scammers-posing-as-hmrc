<p>Self Assessment customers should be alert to criminals claiming to be from HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>).</p>

<p>As the department issues thousands of SMS messages and emails as part of its annual Self Assessment tax return push, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is warning customers completing their returns to take care to avoid being caught out by scammers. The annual tax return deadline is on 31 January 2021.</p>

<p>The department knows that fraudsters use calls, emails or texts to contact customers. In the last 12 months, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has responded to more than 846,000 referrals of suspicious <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> contact from the public, and reported over 15,500 malicious web pages to internet service providers to be taken down. Almost 500,000 of the referrals from the public offered bogus tax rebates.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Customers can report suspicious activity to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> at <a href="mailto:%20phishing@hmrc.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">phishing@hmrc.gov.uk</a> or by sending a text to 60599. They can also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/reporting-fraudulent-emails" class="govuk-link">report phone scams online</a> on GOV.UK.</p>
</div>

<p>Many scams target customers to inform them of a fake ‘tax rebate’ or ‘tax refund’ they are due. The imposters use language intended to convince them to hand over personal information, including bank details, in order to claim the ‘refund’. Criminals will use this information to access customers’ bank accounts, trick them into paying fictitious tax bills, or sell on their personal information to other criminals.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Interim Director General for Customer Services, Karl Khan, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We know that criminals take advantage of the Self Assessment deadline to panic customers into sharing their personal or financial details and even paying bogus ‘tax due’.</p>

  <p class="last-child">If someone calls, emails or texts claiming to be from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, offering financial help or asking for money, it might be a scam. Please take a moment to think before parting with any private information or money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pauline Smith, Head of <a rel="external" href="https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/" class="govuk-link">Action Fraud</a>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Criminals are experts at impersonating organisations that we know and trust. We work closely with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> to raise awareness of current scams and encourage people to report any suspicious calls or messages they receive, even if they haven’t acted on them, to the relevant channels.</p>

  <p>This information is crucial in disrupting criminal activity and is already helping <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> take down fraudulent websites being used to facilitate fraud.</p>

  <p>It’s important to remember if you’re contacted out the blue by someone purporting to be from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> asking for your personal or financial details, or offering you a tax rebate, grant or refund, this could be a scam.</p>

  <p>Do not respond, hang up the phone, and take care not to click on any links in unexpected emails or text messages. You should contact <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> directly using a phone number you’ve used before to check if the communication you have received is genuine.</p>

  <p class="last-child">If you’ve been the victim of fraud, contact your bank immediately and please <a rel="external" href="https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/" class="govuk-link">report it to Action Fraud online</a> or by calling 0300 123 2040.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is also warning the public to be aware of websites that charge for government services – such as call connection sites – that are in fact free or charged at local call rates. Other companies charge people for help getting ‘tax refunds’. One way to safely claim a tax refund for free is to log into your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/personal-tax-account" class="govuk-link">Personal Tax Account</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has a dedicated Customer Protection team that identifies and closes down scams but asks the public to recognise the signs to avoid becoming a victim. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> regularly publishes examples of new scams on GOV.UK to help customers recognise phishing emails and bogus contact by email, text or phone.</p>

<h2 id="ways-to-spot-a-tax-scam">Ways to spot a tax scam</h2>

<p>It could be a scam if it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is unexpected</li>
  <li>offers a refund, tax rebate or grant</li>
  <li>asks for personal information like bank details</li>
  <li>is threatening</li>
  <li>tells you to transfer money</li>
</ul>

<p>Self Assessment customers can complete their tax return online and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/topic/personal-tax/self-assessment" class="govuk-link">help and support</a> is available on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>To protect against identity fraud customers must verify their identity when accessing <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s online services. They must have two sources of information including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>credit reference agency data</li>
  <li>tax credits</li>
  <li>P60/payslip</li>
  <li>UK Passport</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="further-information">Further information</h2>

<ul>
  <li>responded to 846,435 referrals of suspicious <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> contact from the public. More than 495,937 of these offered bogus tax rebates</li>

</ul>

<p>If you’re concerned about falling victim to a potential scam, remember:</p>

<p>Stop:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take a moment to think before parting with your information or money</li>
  <li>don’t give out private information or reply to text messages, and don’t download attachments or click on links in texts or emails you weren’t expecting</li>
</ul>

<p>Challenge:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it’s ok to reject, refuse or ignore any requests - only criminals will try to rush or panic you</li>
  <li>read about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/identify-hmrc-related-scam-phone-calls-emails-and-text-messages" class="govuk-link">avoiding scams</a> on GOV.UK: information on how to recognise genuine <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> contact and avoid and report scams</li>
</ul>

<p>Protect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>forward suspicious emails claiming to be from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> to <a href="mailto:%20phishing@hmrc.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">phishing@hmrc.gov.uk</a> and texts to 60599.</li>
  <li>contact your bank immediately if you think you’ve fallen victim to a scam, and report it to <a rel="external" href="https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/" class="govuk-link">Action Fraud</a>
</li>
