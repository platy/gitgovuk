<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The Monitoring Engagement with the Natural Environment is the largest survey of its kind and the new tool allows users to dig into place level data as never before using leading edge geo-visualisation skills to help the public and policy makers better understand how we engage with the environment. I would like to congratulate Nathan Shaw and the team at Natural England for an outstanding piece of work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gideon Henderson, Chief Scientific Advisor at Defra said</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Defra Group is very proud of our geographers who are an important part of our science and analysis community. Many congratulations to Nathan Shaw and the team at Natural England for deservedly winning this prestigious award; a testament to the quality of our geographers, and the impact they are having as part of our multi-disciplinary approach to policy design and delivery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marian Spain, Natural England’s Chief Executive added</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I am absolutely thrilled to be able to congratulate Nathan Shaw in the Natural England Evidence Team for winning his category (Excellence in geo-visualisation and cartography) for the work on the Monitoring Engagement with the Natural Environment tool, as well as winning the overall award! This is fantastic news and well deserved and I’d like to congratulate the whole team for the hard work they put into this incredibly important survey work. It produces such a wealth of information that is driving real changes in policy and practice by health and environmental professionals and so making a real difference for people. Congratulations to Nathan and the team from us all at Natural England.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Professor Sir Ian Diamond, Head of the Government’s Analysis Function added</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We find ourselves in a time where ever greater innovation and collaboration is essential in order to provide timely insights into complex, multidisciplinary issues and the unique specialism of those within the Geography profession will be key to helping inform decision making and overcoming the key challenges facing our society and economy.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
