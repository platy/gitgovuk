  <li>Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) to strengthen joint-headquarters in East Kilbride with 500 extra staff</li>
  <li>Plans will bring new jobs and investment to Scotland as part of the UK Government’s commitment to level up in every part of the United Kingdom and build back better from the pandemic</li>
</ul>

<p>Glasgow, East Kilbride and the surrounding areas will benefit from new jobs and investment from the UK Government, as the Cabinet Office and FCDO are set to relocate over 1000 civil service roles to Scotland.</p>

<p>The move brings key decision makers closer to the communities they serve and will strengthen diversity in the UK Civil Service. The new jobs and investment form part of the  UK Government’s commitment to level up every part of the United Kingdom and build back stronger, fairer and greener from the pandemic.</p>

<p>Today’s announcement will also mean that ministers will spend a significant amount of time in Scotland as the UK Government and Scottish Government work together to build a sustainable recovery from the pandemic. This will create new opportunities to join UK efforts in tackling domestic and international challenges, and allow closer collaboration between Scotland’s two governments as we work together to build back better from the pandemic.</p>

<p>Underlining the importance of the United Kingdom pulling together as we embark upon the road to recovery, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, has confirmed today that the Cabinet Office will establish a second flagship headquarters in Glasgow, with at least 500 staff based there within the next four years and new ministerial offices. The move will build on the presence of the COP 26 team, as the UK hosts the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties in Glasgow in November.</p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary has also confirmed today that an additional 500 roles are moving to FCDO’s joint-headquarters in East Kilbride, taking the total number of jobs at its Scottish base to 1,500 by 2025. This underlines the immense contribution that the Scottish people make to the UK’s foreign policy and international development work as we tackle global challenges as one United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Cabinet Office’s new HQ in Glasgow will co-locate the engine room of the UK Government in Scotland, bringing decision makers closer to the communities they serve and ensuring closer collaboration between Scotland’s two governments as we tackle the COVID-19 pandemic together and work to build a sustainable recovery.</p>

  <p>Not only will this bring new jobs and investment to Scotland, it will strengthen the diversity of the UK Civil Service, ending the Westminster knows best approach to policy making and ensuring Scottish voices shape everything we do.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The road to recovery from the pandemic will be tough, but with all four nations pulling together we can ensure we build back a stronger, fairer and greener United Kingdom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There can be no clearer demonstration of our commitment to our joint HQ in East Kilbride than today’s announcement that an extra 500 Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office jobs are coming to Scotland. This will ensure the Civil Service represents all parts of the UK and will be a boost to the Scottish Economy.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Staff at Abercrombie House are at the forefront of delivering the UK’s diplomatic clout, as we prepare to host the G7 and COP26, while supporting the delivery of our £10billion aid budget to continue helping the world’s poorest people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is great news that hundreds more UK Government civil service jobs will be moving to Scotland, along with the creation of a second flagship headquarters. It will join Queen Elizabeth House in Edinburgh as a demonstration of our unwavering commitment to strengthening the United Kingdom.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I very much look forward to seeing the UK Government’s expanded presence in Scotland, along with our ambitious new spending plans, as we continue to deliver for people and businesses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chief Operating Officer for the Civil Service and Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary Alex Chisholm said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Civil Service needs to draw on the talents and skills of individuals and communities across the UK.</p>

  <p>With the Cabinet Office establishing our second headquarters outside of London, we are opening up opportunities for our existing staff to develop their careers, while also drawing on a new and diverse talent pool.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This is why it’s great news that the Cabinet Office will now be operating out of Glasgow as our second headquarters, as well as in York and other locations across the UK.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today’s announcement will bring economic benefits, with new spending power of those civil servants working in and around the areas outlined. £65 million has been allocated for the Government Hubs Programme in 2021/22 for office works and improvements.</p>

<p>The Cabinet Office, the heart of the UK government, will also continue to build the UK Government presence in Scotland, including in Queen Elizabeth House, the new UK Government Office in Edinburgh.</p>
