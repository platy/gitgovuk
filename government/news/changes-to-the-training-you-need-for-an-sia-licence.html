<p>We have made some changes to the training you need to take before you can get a front line SIA licence.</p>

<p>The changes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we have introduced new, updated qualifications for all sectors except close protection and vehicle immobilisation</li>
  <li>you must have a first aid qualification before you can take the training required for a door supervisor or security guard licence</li>
</ul>

<p>We will be making more changes in October 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on 1 October 2021, we will introduce updated close protection qualifications</li>
  <li>from 1 October 2021, you must have one of the new qualifications or take top-up training before you can apply for a door supervisor and security guard licence – this includes renewals</li>
</ul>

<p>We explain these changes in more detail below.</p>

<h2>Why are we making these changes?</h2>

<p>We need to make sure that people working in the private security industry can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep the public safe</li>
  <li>follow new working practices</li>
  <li>understand recent changes to the law</li>
  <li>make the best use of new technology</li>
</ul>

<h2>New requirement: first aid training</h2>

<p>We already expected applicants for a close protection licence to complete a first aid qualification before taking their licence-linked training. We now expect applicants for a door supervisor or security guard licence to do the same.</p>

<p>You will need to do this if either of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are applying for a licence for the first time</li>
  <li>it has been longer than 3 years since you last held a licence for that activity</li>
</ul>

<p>From 1 October 2021, you will also need to do this if you are renewing your licence.</p>

<p>The qualification must be an Emergency First Aid at Work qualification or equivalent.</p>

<p>The requirement for first aid training will improve your skills as an SIA licence holder. It will not change the obligations you have when responding to an emergency.</p>

<h3>What do we mean by “equivalent”?</h3>

<p>We will accept other qualifications that comply with the relevant <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/geis3.htm">guidance from the Health and Safety Executive</a>. Some examples are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First Aid at Work (FAW)</li>
  <li>First Person on Scene (FPOS)</li>
  <li>First Response Emergency Care (FREC)</li>
</ul>

<p>Your training provider can tell you more about this.</p>

<h2>New requirement: top-up training for some licence holders</h2>

<p>From 1 October 2021, you must have one of the following before you can apply for, or renew, a door supervisor or security guard licence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>one of the new qualifications set in place in April 2021</li>
  <li>one of the older licence-linked qualifications and a ‘top-up’ qualification</li>
</ul>

<p>This applies to any applications submitted on or after 1 October, including renewals. If you submit your application before this date, you will not need to take additional training.</p>

<h3>If you hold a door supervisor licence</h3>

<p>From 1 October 2021, if you hold a door supervisor licence you can choose one of the following options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take the door supervisor top-up training and renew your door supervisor licence</li>
  <li>take the security guard top-up training and switch to a security guard licence</li>
</ul>

<p>In either case, you must have an Emergency First Aid at Work qualification, or equivalent, before can you take the top-up training.</p>

<p>The security guard top-up training is shorter than the door supervisor top-up training, so is likely to be cheaper. However, you should consider the day-to-day duties of the job that you do. If your job involves guarding licensed premises (such as a pub or a club) you will need to renew your door supervisor licence.</p>

<h2>Other changes</h2>

<h3>More relevant course material</h3>

<p>We have moved training that is critical for all sectors to the ‘common unit’ (taken by all security operatives). This includes new training on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>terror threat awareness</li>
  <li>dealing with emergencies</li>
</ul>

<p>We have introduced new sector-specific content – for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the close protection course includes new material on physical intervention</li>
  <li>the door supervision course includes new material on the use of equipment such as body worn video recorders and breathalysers</li>
  <li>the public space surveillance (CCTV) course includes new material on CCTV operational procedures and the law</li>
  <li>the security guarding course includes new material covering personal safety</li>
</ul>

<h3>More practical assessments</h3>

<p>We have increased the number of practical elements in the training to help learners reinforce their knowledge. The practical assessments include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>searching</li>
  <li>dealing with conflict</li>
  <li>report/statement writing</li>
  <li>using communications devices</li>
</ul>
