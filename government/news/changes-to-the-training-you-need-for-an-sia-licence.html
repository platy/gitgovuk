          <div class="govspeak">
<p>In 2021 we made some changes to the training you need to take before you can get a front line SIA licence.</p>

<p>The changes were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we introduced new, updated qualifications for all sectors except close protection and vehicle immobilisation</li>
  <li>you must have a first aid qualification before you can take the training required for a door supervisor or security guard licence</li>
  <li>you must have one of the new qualifications or take top-up training before you can apply for a door supervisor and security guard licence - this includes renewals</li>
</ul>

<p>We will be making more changes in 2022:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on 1 April 2022 we introduced an updated close protection qualification (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sia-announces-a-change-to-the-launch-date-for-the-new-close-protection-qualification">read our press release about this</a>)</li>
  <li>from 1 April 2022 you must have the new qualification to apply for a close protection licence – this does not include renewals</li>
  <li>from 1 October 2022, you must have the new qualification or take top-up training before you can renew your close protection licence</li>
</ul>

<p>We explain these changes in more detail below.</p>

<p>We have also created a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/changes-to-sia-licence-linked-training-flowchart">flowchart to explain what the changes mean</a> for people applying for a door supervisor or security guard licence.</p>

<h2>Why are we making these changes?</h2>

<p>We need to make sure that people working in the private security industry can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep the public safe</li>
  <li>follow new working practices</li>
  <li>understand recent changes to the law</li>
  <li>make the best use of new technology</li>
</ul>

<h2>First aid training for door supervisors and security guards</h2>
<p>We now expect applicants for a door supervisor or security guard licence to complete a first aid qualification before taking their licence-linked training.</p>

<p>You need to do this if either of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are applying for a licence for the first time</li>
  <li>it has been longer than 3 years since you last held a licence for that activity</li>
</ul>

<p>You also need to do this if you are renewing your licence.</p>

<p>The qualification must be an Emergency First Aid at Work qualification or equivalent.</p>

<p>The requirement for first aid training will improve your skills as an SIA licence holder. It will not change the obligations you have when responding to an emergency.</p>

<h3>What do we mean by “equivalent”?</h3>
<p>We accept other qualifications that comply with the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/geis3.htm" rel="external">guidance from the Health and Safety Executive</a>. Some examples are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First Aid at Work (FAW)</li>
  <li>First Person on Scene (FPOS)</li>
  <li>First Response Emergency Care (FREC)</li>
</ul>

<p>Your training provider can tell you more about this.</p>

<h2>First aid training for close protection operatives</h2>

<p>We expect applicants for a close protection licence to complete a first aid qualification at level 3 or above before taking their licence-linked training. Some examples are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Level 3 First Person on Scene (FPOS)</li>
  <li>Level 3 First Response Emergency Care (FREC)</li>
</ul>

<p>We accept other qualifications. Your training provider can tell you more about this.</p>

<h2>Top-up training for some licence holders</h2>

<h3>Door supervisors and security guards</h3>

<p>You must have one of the following before you can apply for, or renew, a door supervisor or security guard licence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>one of the new qualifications set in place in April 2021</li>
  <li>one of the older licence-linked qualifications and a ‘top-up’ qualification</li>
</ul>

<p>This applies to any applications, including renewals.</p>

<h3>Close protection operatives</h3>

<p>From 1 October 2022, you must have one of the following before you can apply for, or renew, a close protection licence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the new qualification introduced on 1 April 2022</li>
  <li>one of the older licence-linked qualifications and a ‘top-up’ qualification</li>
</ul>

<p>This applies to any applications, including renewals.</p>

<h3>If you hold a door supervisor licence</h3>
<p>If you hold a door supervisor licence you can choose one of the following options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take the door supervisor top-up training and renew your door supervisor licence</li>
  <li>take the security guard top-up training and switch to a security guard licence</li>
</ul>

<p>In either case, you must have an Emergency First Aid at Work qualification, or equivalent, before you can take the top-up training.</p>

<p>The security guard top-up training is shorter than the door supervisor top-up training, so is likely to be cheaper. However, you should consider the day-to-day duties of the job that you do. If your job involves guarding licensed premises (such as a pub or a club) you will need to renew your door supervisor licence.</p>

<h2>Other changes</h2>

<h3>More relevant course material</h3>

<p>We have moved some training to the ‘common unit’ that is taken by all security operatives except close protection operatives. This includes new training on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>terror threat awareness</li>
  <li>dealing with emergencies</li>
</ul>

<p>We have introduced new sector-specific content – for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the door supervision course includes new material on the use of equipment such as body worn video recorders and breathalysers</li>
  <li>the public space surveillance (CCTV) course includes new material on CCTV operational procedures and the law</li>
  <li>the security guarding course includes new material covering personal safety</li>
  <li>the close protection course includes a bespoke physical intervention unit, as well as material from the door supervision course needed to allow close protection operatives to work as door supervisors</li>
</ul>

<h3>More practical assessments</h3>

<p>We have increased the number of practical elements in the training to help learners reinforce their knowledge. The practical assessments include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>searching</li>
  <li>dealing with conflict</li>
  <li>report/statement writing</li>
  <li>using communications devices</li>
  <li>application of physical intervention skills for close protection operatives in the private security industry</li>
</ul>
