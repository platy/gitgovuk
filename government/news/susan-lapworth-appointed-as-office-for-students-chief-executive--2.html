<p>Susan Lapworth has been appointed as Chief Executive of the Office for Students (OfS) following an open appointment process conducted by the Department for Education.</p>

<p>Susan has served as OfS interim Chief Executive since May 2022, prior to which she was its Director of Regulation, and has worked in the higher education sector for 19 years.</p>

<p>The Office for Students acts as the independent regulator for Higher Education in England. The Chief Executive is responsible for setting and delivering the strategic vision for how the OfS will achieve its aims of championing the interests of every student, whatever their background, and making sure that all students have a fulfilling higher education experience.</p>

<p>The appointment will take effect from 1 September 2022 until the end of August 2026.</p>

<p>Susan will work closely with the OfS board, Government and higher education stakeholders to deliver the OfS’s regulatory priorities for the next four years.</p>

<p>Secretary of State for Education James Cleverly said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As interim Chief Executive of the Office for Students, Susan has demonstrated her leadership skills and put students’ interests first. She has extensive knowledge and experience of our world-class higher education sector, so I’m pleased to make this appointment.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I look forward to seeing her play a pivotal role in improving graduate outcomes and ensuring that all students receive the high-quality academic experience they deserve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chief Executive of the OfS Susan Lapworth said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am delighted to have been appointed as the OfS’s chief executive. English universities and colleges make an enormous contribution to society and individuals, through teaching, research and work in their communities.&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="last-child">This complex and diverse sector would not have a regulator if its work was unimportant and I look forward to continuing to work with the excellent team at the OfS to ensure that students from all backgrounds can access and succeed on high quality courses which leave them well prepared for life after graduation.</p>
