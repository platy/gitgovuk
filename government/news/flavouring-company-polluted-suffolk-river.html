          <p>The escape of the liquid has led to the company handing thousands of pounds to charity, and making significant changes to procedures and infrastructure.</p>

<p>International Flavours and Fragrances I.F.F. (Great Britain) Ltd allowed around 93 litres of an undiluted solution called Quatdet to enter Stour Brook in October 2017.</p>

<p>As a result, the company has paid £50,000 to <a href="https://www.essexsuffolkriverstrust.org/" rel="external">Essex and Suffolk Rivers Trust</a> in a civil sanction, as well as the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency">Environment Agency’s</a> investigation and legal costs of more than £16,000.</p>

<p>The money will support the charity’s work protecting river habitats in the 2 counties.</p>

<p>Ben Marshall, a land and water officer for the Environment Agency in Suffolk, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is important all organisations take action to avoid polluting the environment through careful consideration of their processes and procedures, and the monitoring of operations.</p>

  <p>Serious errors occurred at IFF’s Haverhill plant, allowing a cleaning agent to escape into the brook.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Following the Environment Agency’s investigation, IFF took steps to avoid a repeat by installing equipment to contain spills, and improving its accident-reporting system. The company has also reviewed the sites drainage plans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In agreeing to the sanction, known as an enforcement undertaking that can be used as an alternative to a prosecution. The Environment Agency accepted the company’s negligence wasn’t down to dangerous or foolhardy behaviour.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency was also satisfied IFF had improved its infrastructure and systems since the incident to prevent it happening again.</p>

<p>Enforcement undertakings allow companies and individuals to make good some of the environmental damage they cause, including through a financial contribution to a local project. The Environment Agency must also be sure the polluter will make changes to its operations.</p>

<p>While agreeing to enforcement undertakings, the Environment Agency continues to prosecute organisations and individuals where evidence shows high levels of culpability and serious environment harm.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The Environment Agency urges anyone who spots what they think is pollution to call its free, 24 hour incident hotline: 0800 80 70 60. Officers respond to limit damage to the environment, protecting people and wildlife.</p>
</div>

<p>International Flavours and Fragrances I.F.F. (Great Britain) Ltd, of Duddery Hill, Haverhill, was sanctioned under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2010/9780111491423/contents" rel="external">Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010 (as amended)</a>. IFF paid the Environment Agency’s costs of £16,299.92 for the case.</p>
