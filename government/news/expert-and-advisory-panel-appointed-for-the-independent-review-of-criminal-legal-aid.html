        <p>The Expert and Advisory Panel, appointed by the Lord Chancellor, will provide support by testing and challenging the review’s emerging findings and recommendations.</p>

<p>Sir Christopher, who was appointed by the Lord Chancellor on 21 December 2020 will chair monthly meetings of the expert and advisory panel, beginning in February.  Sir Christopher will submit his recommendations to the Lord Chancellor later this year and it is intended that the report will be published by the end of this year alongside the government’s response.</p>

<p>The review will consider the criminal legal aid system in its entirety, specifically it seeks to ensure that it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provides high quality legal advice and representation</li>
  <li>is provided through a diverse set of practitioners</li>
  <li>is appropriately funded</li>
  <li>is responsive to user needs both now and in the future.</li>
  <li>contributes to the efficiency and effectiveness of the Criminal Justice System</li>
  <li>is transparent</li>
  <li>is resilient</li>
  <li>is delivered in a way that provides value for money to the taxpayer</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the latest step in the Criminal Legal Aid Review, which has already led to up to £51 million per year for the sector. It forms part of wider work to ensure criminal defence remains an attractive career for practitioners now and in the future.</p>

<p>The Lord Chancellor, Robert Buckland QC MP, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I am grateful to Sir Christopher Bellamy and his esteemed panel for undertaking this vital piece of work which will play a crucial role in ensuring the long-term sustainability of the criminal legal aid market.</p>
