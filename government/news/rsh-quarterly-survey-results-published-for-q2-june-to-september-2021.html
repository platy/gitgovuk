<p>The Regulator of Social Housing has today (25 November 2021) published the results of its latest quarterly survey of registered providers’ financial health.</p>

<p>The report covers the period from 1 July to 30 September 2021. The social housing sector continues to recover from the pandemic with strong liquidity and robust interest cover and income collection indicators.</p>

<p>The sector’s total agreed borrowing facilities increased by £1.8 billion, to reach £115.3 billion at the end of September. New finance of £2.9 billion was agreed in the quarter with 71% of this from capital markets. There was further refinancing activity in the quarter due to the expiry of the Covid Corporate Financing Facilities.</p>

<p>Providers continue to invest capital in new and existing homes, although current uncertainties make accurate forecasting difficult. £2.9 billion was invested in the acquisition and development of new homes between July and September 2021; 7% less than in the previous quarter, and 32% below the forecast for this quarter. Capitalised major repairs spend increased to £479 million, but again less than previously forecasts for the quarter. The difference from forecasts was due to the impact of supply chain issues over the quarter.</p>

<p>As a result of seeking to make up these shortfalls, forecast capital expenditure for the twelve months ahead is at a record high with both development spend (at £18.3 billion) and capitalised major repairs spend (at £3.1 billion) predicted to be over 50% higher than in the previous twelve months. However, given the current challenges being experienced with delays relating to labour and material shortages, we expect some variation from forecasts: this is an area <abbr title="Regulator of Social Housing">RSH</abbr> will continue to monitor.</p>

<p>The number of unsold properties reduced in the quarter. At £531 million, Affordable Home Ownership first tranche sales are the highest value ever recorded and the unit sales are higher than pre-pandemic levels, with a fall of 11% in the number of units unsold in 6 months. There was also a 24% fall in the number of market sale units unsold for more than six months.</p>

<p>Will Perry, Director of Strategy at <abbr title="Regulator of Social Housing">RSH</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">While the social housing sector continues to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, current economic conditions continue to provide challenges for providers in the form of labour and material shortages. Providers will need to closely monitor these and wider pressures to ensure they are able to manage the range of risks their organisation is facing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The quarterly surveys are available on the  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/quarterly-survey-of-private-registered-providers"><abbr title="Regulator of Social Housing">RSH</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>The Regulator of Social Housing promotes a viable, efficient and well-governed social housing sector able to deliver homes that meet a range of needs. It does this by undertaking robust economic regulation focusing on governance, financial viability and value for money that maintains lender confidence and protects the taxpayer. It also sets consumer standards and may take action if these standards are breached and there is a significant risk of serious detriment to tenants or potential tenants.</p>
