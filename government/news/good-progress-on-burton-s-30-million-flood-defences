  <li>Environment Agency opens further section of £30m flood defence project</li>
  <li>Public access to embankment and local nature reserve</li>
  <li>Project on target to be completed spring 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>Members of the public are now able to access the embankment between the Riverside Hotel and the edge of the golf course. The path through Toad Hole Nature Reserve has also been reopened.</p>

<p>It is hoped to open the remainder of the section near the golf course by the end of the year.</p>

<p>The whole project, which started in June 2019, is scheduled to finish next spring and will improve flood defences for over 4,500 homes and 1,000 businesses.</p>

<p>Construction work is continuing throughout the latest national lockdown with Environment Agency staff and contractors following government guidelines.</p>

<p>William Groves, senior flood advisor for the Environment Agency, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The work on this important infrastructure for the town is progressing very well.</p>

  <p>We will be opening further sections as they are completed to minimise the inconvenience to members of the public.</p>

  <p class="last-child">With the onset of winter weather in recent weeks, we are also urging people to check their flood risk, sign up for free flood warnings and keep up to date with the latest situation at this link <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-if-youre-at-risk-of-flooding">https://www.gov.uk/check-if-youre-at-risk-of-flooding</a> or follow @EnvAgencyMids.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Environment Agency has adopted COVID-19-safe ways of working in helping to protect people from flooding and are calling for people to be prepared this winter.</p>

<p>Simple steps should be taken, such as checking if you live in an area at high risk of flooding, preparing a bag with medication and important documents and moving valuable and sentimental items upstairs or to a safe place.</p>

<p>Know your risk:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Find out if you’re at risk – <a rel="external" href="https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/long-term-flood-risk">Use this postcode checker</a> to see if you live in flood risk area</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you do live in a flood risk area <a href="https://www.gov.uk/sign-up-for-flood-warnings?_ga=2.197701353.796625785.1602500951-282784966.1602500951">sign up for flood warnings</a>. These warn of the risk of flooding from rivers, the sea and groundwater. You’ll be alerted by phone, email or text when flooding is expected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Environment Agency has specially trained Flood Support Officers across the country who provide information and advice during and after floods. Call Floodline (24-hour service) on 0345 988 1188 or type-talk (for the hard of hearing) on 0345 602 6340 to find out if they’re active in your area.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="notes-to-editor">Notes to editor</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The Burton scheme is part of the £2.6 billion being spent over 2015-21 across the country, delivering more than 1,500 projects to better protect 300,000 homes. This is on top of £1 billion by 2020 to maintain flood defences.</li>
  <li>We will be doubling this investment to a record £5.2 billion between 2021-27, creating around 2,000 new flood and coastal defences to better protect 336,000 properties across England.</li>
  <li>In July 2020, the government published a new long-term policy statement on flood and coastal erosion risk management. This long-term plan to tackle flooding is the most comprehensive in a decade, with 5 ambitious policies and over 40 supporting actions to accelerate progress to better protect and prepare the country for future flooding and coastal erosion.</li>
  <li>Flood defence investment takes place where the risk is highest, wherever it is across the country. Each scheme is carefully considered to where it will benefit the most people and property.</li>
  <li>Further information about the Burton scheme is available at this link
