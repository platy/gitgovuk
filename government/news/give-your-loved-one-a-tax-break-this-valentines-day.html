<p>HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is encouraging married couples and people in civil partnerships to sign up for a tax break this year.</p>

<p>Marriage Allowance offers individuals the chance to transfer part of their Personal Allowance to their husband, wife or civil partner, which could reduce their tax by up to £250 a year. For some couples, this could mean a backdated payment of up to four years of claims which could be as much as £1,188.</p>

<p>It is free to apply for Marriage Allowance and HMRC is encouraging customers to claim directly through its online portal to ensure they receive 100% of the tax relief they are eligible for.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Find out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/marriage-allowance">how to apply for Marriage Allowance</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Angela MacDonald, HMRC’s Second Permanent Secretary, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For some, a tax break will be a welcome source of extra cash during these difficult times. I urge couples to take advantage of this offer, which could put up to £250 back in their pockets each year.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Signing up is simple - the quickest way to claim is through the GOV.UK website, just search ‘marriage allowance’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marriage Allowance lets people earning £12,500 or less transfer up to £1,250 of their Personal Allowance to their husband, wife or civil partner – if their income is higher and they are a basic rate taxpayer. This will reduce their tax by up to £250 for the 2020 to 2021 tax year. Claims can also be backdated to April 2016 until 5 April 2021. After 6 April 2021, couples will only be able to claim back to the 2017 to 2018 tax year.</p>

<p>The same criteria applies for people in married couples and civil partnerships in Scotland, except their partner must pay Income Tax at the starter, basic or intermediate rates between £12,501 and £43,430.</p>

<p>The Personal Allowance rate for the 2021 to 2022 tax year is increasing to £12,570.</p>

<p>Customers are urged to cut out the middle man, who may charge a fee, and receive a guaranteed 100% of their eligible entitlement by applying directly to HMRC via <a href="https://www.gov.uk/marriage-allowance" class="govuk-link">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>Marriage Allowance claims are automatically renewed every year. However, couples should notify HMRC if their circumstances change.</p>

<h2>Further information</h2>

<p>Marriage Allowance was introduced in April 2015.</p>

<p>Marriage Allowance is 10% of an individuals’ tax-free Personal Allowance. The maximum amount that can be transferred to their husband, wife or civil partner is dependent on the Personal Allowance for that tax year.</p>
