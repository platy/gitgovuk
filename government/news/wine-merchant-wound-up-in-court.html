<h2>Update: 26 October 2021</h2>

<p>The Official Receiver has been made aware that third parties have contacted investors stating that they will receive the return of their investment if they pay over money to the person who is calling. In some instances the person calling claims to work for The Insolvency Service.</p>

<h4>This is a scam and investors should not pay over any money.</h4>
<p>Further details about such scams can be found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/investors-warned-about-approaches-to-recover-lost-funds" class="govuk-link">here</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Dow And Jones Limited was wound up in the public interest on 17 March 2020 in the High Court of Justice before Deputy Judge Jones. The Official Receiver has been appointed as liquidator.</p>

<p>At the hearing to consider the petition to wind up the company, the court heard that Dow and Jones Limited was incorporated in September 2015, with a registered office in Sidcup, Kent, and a trading address in Central London until May 2019.</p>

<p>The Insolvency Service, however, conducted confidential investigations into the wine merchants having received complaints about Dow and Jones’s trading practices.</p>

<p>Investigators discovered that the company sold wine to members of the public as an investment opportunity. Dow and Jones, however, usually sold the stock to those investor customers at double the normal retail price, making it unlikely that investors would ever get their original capital back or make a profit.</p>

<p>Sales staff working for Dow and Jones falsely claimed to investors that additional purchases were required to ensure that a portfolio of wines could be sold quicker and at a higher price.</p>

<p>Dow and Jones had also failed to honour customer orders going back to 2016, with the company also having filed inaccurate accounts at Companies House.</p>

<p>In her judgment, Deputy Judge Jones stated that “there is something extremely wrong about this company”, before confirming that the promised returns to investors were “vastly overstated”.</p>

<p>Irshard Mohammed, Senior Investigator at the Insolvency Service, said</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Similar to boiler room operations, Dow and Jones used sales scripts from previously failed companies, which assisted salesmen to convince people, including the vulnerable, to invest their money in unregulated investments. Even those customers who received the wine they had paid for lost a sizable proportion of their investment, as the wine was materially overpriced.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The courts recognised the unscrupulous nature of Dow and Jones when it wound-up the company and our advice is always to reject unsolicited investment offers that sound too good to be true.</p>
</blockquote>
