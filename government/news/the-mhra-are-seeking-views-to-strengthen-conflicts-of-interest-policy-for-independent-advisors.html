<p>The six-week consultation, which launched today, outlines a number of key proposals that strengthen the current code of practice, to ensure that experts providing the MHRA with advice are independent and impartial, and that the processes in place to manage conflicts of interest are robust and clear to all. It also enables greater inclusion of patient experts in committee discussions so that individuals with lived and personal experiences can contribute to discussions more easily.</p>

<p>The UK regulator is committed to responding to the recommendations set out in the Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Review and is taking steps to be a more transparent and inclusive independent regulator.</p>

<p>The proposals include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A register of interests accessible to all (through GOV.UK), which will be updated to reflect any changes from members</li>
  <li>The provision of more guidance on interests, to ensure that members can provide relevant information if or when their circumstances change</li>
  <li>Encouraging greater inclusion of patient experts in expert groups and committee discussions, so that individuals with lived and personal experience can contribute to discussions more easily.</li>
  <li>A new panel process to advise on complex or novel conflicts to ensure standards are upheld consistently and to deal with breaches of the conflict-of-interest policy as necessary and any disciplinary action that may be warranted</li>
</ul>

<p>The changes proposed will impact all expert groups, including the Commission on Human Medicines, bringing together requirements across all groups for the first time, ensuring consistency and high standards for all.</p>

<h3>Dr June Raine, Chief Executive of MHRA said:</h3>

<p>“We know that trust is an important factor in our role as regulator. We want to attract and retain the right expertise in those who give the regulator independent advice; but the public should also feel confident those called upon to give their expert opinions do so in an impartial way.</p>

<p>“This consultation, which I encourage all to respond to, demonstrates how seriously we take independent and impartial advice on our regulatory decisions.”</p>

<p>The public consultation will run for six weeks from 12 April 2022. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-a-new-code-of-practice-for-the-expert-advisory-committees">Have your say by visiting our consultation page</a>.</p>
