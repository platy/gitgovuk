<p><abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>’s Professor Veronica Bowman has been awarded Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (<abbr title="Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire">OBE</abbr>), while Lt Col Ross Carter, a <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> Military Advisor, has been awarded Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (<abbr title="Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire">MBE</abbr>). A large number of <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> scientists and industry partners have been awarded Vice Chief of Defence Staff (<abbr title="Vice Chief of Defence Staff">VCDS</abbr>) Commendations.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Professor Veronica Bowman OBE" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/139346/Professor_Ronni_Bowman.jpg"></div>
<figcaption><p>Professor Veronica Bowman OBE</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>Professor Bowman has been recognised for her work in defence and security during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>At the start of the pandemic, Veronica worked tirelessly to understand the progression of the virus within the UK, which was critical to developing effective mitigation strategies. One of the key tools developed was CrystalCast - combining uncertain epidemiological outputs to demonstrate the benefit of having a single combined R value estimate.</p>

<p>Professor Bowman, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I know I’m privileged to receive this award, but I’m also humbled because having the vision to put something in place and actually make it happen was not just down to me, but an amazing team I work with who have helped bring the project to fruition.</p>
</blockquote>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Lt Col Ross Carter MBE" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/139345/Ross_Carter_960x640.png"></div>

<p>Meanwhile Lt Colonel Ross Carter was recognised for his deployment to the Department of Health and Social Care in response to a Military Assistance to Civil Authorities request from the Head of Mass Testing within NHS Test and Trace. He was central to the successful development of four different mobile processing unit designs.</p>

<p>Col Ross, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I’m shocked, it is such an honour to be recognised, but there is no doubt that credit must go the amazing team who delivered on this task - it was a massive team effort.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A <abbr title="Vice Chief of Defence Staff">VCDS</abbr> Commendation has been awarded to the Strategic Partnering Agreement Team, led by <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> and working collaboratively across Ministry of Defence (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>), Air Command, Defence Equipment and Support (<abbr title="Defence Equipment and Support">DE&amp;S</abbr>), WHATEVER GOC STANDS FOR (GOC) and industry partners Leonardo.</p>

<p>Their work was highlighted as a trailblazing example of a transformational, ambitious proactive approach, which has enabled the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> to embark on a new way to develop, deliver and support critical air survivability solutions.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>’s Interim Chief Executive Doug Umbers, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These awards are an incredible achievement and represent individual and team awards for <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>, notwithstanding the vital collaboration work that is also recognised across government and industry.</p>

  <p class="last-child"><abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> has been working tirelessly during the COVID-19 pandemic and many of these awards highlight those teams and individuals involved. I have great pride in congratulating all of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nine other <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> scientists were also awarded a <abbr title="Vice Chief of Defence Staff">VCDS</abbr> Commendation for their work in Transport Risk Assessment for COVID Knowledge (<abbr title="Transport Risk Assessment for COVID Knowledge">TRACK</abbr>) Team and recognised for their tireless work since the start of the pandemic on developing models to assess the potential risks of COVID-19 on transport systems.</p>
