<h4 id="notes-to-editors">Notes to editors:</h4>

<p>International Space Pitch Day is a joint UK-US initiative that aims to find, fund and fast-track innovation and technology that gives advantage to military personnel and operations in the space domain.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/competition-international-space-pitch-day" class="govuk-link">The competition</a> was open to innovators and entrepreneurs from all over the world delivered through the UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-and-security-accelerator" class="govuk-link">Defence and Security Accelerator (DASA)</a>, assisted by <a rel="external" href="https://starburst.aero/" class="govuk-link">Starburst Accelerator</a>.</p>

<p>It is specifically designed to bolster tech start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and harness the power of their ingenuity and innovation.</p>

<p>The endeavour is jointly funded by the UK’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-science-and-technology-laboratory" class="govuk-link">Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl)</a>, <a rel="external" href="https://www.raf.mod.uk/" class="govuk-link">Royal Air Force</a> and the <a rel="external" href="https://www.airforce.com/" class="govuk-link">US Air Force</a>.</p>

<p>A grand coalition of Dstl, DASA, Royal Air Force, UK Strategic Command, the US Air Force, US Space Force, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) has been assembled to find, fund, and fast-track the best ideas from start-up innovators to the front line.</p>

<p>Starburst Aerospace is acting as an industry partner to the International Space Pitch Day and carry out specialist training and mentoring on its behalf through an Allied Defence Accelerator.</p>

<p>The format is the first of its kind in an international collaboration between two international allies.</p>

<p>This competition focuses on commercial innovation that could give solutions to six challenges set by the UK and US Space teams:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Visualisation of key events and information for combined space operations with allies and commercial partners.</li>
  <li>Understanding current satellite systems relevant to the operations of a particular commander.</li>
  <li>Understanding the present and potential impact of space weather on users across all domains.</li>
  <li>Provision of training against realistic threats and opportunities, incorporating live data, and integrating space across multiple domains.</li>
  <li>Enabling common and user-defined operational pictures to support multi-national space domain awareness and command and control.</li>
  <li>A verification and comparison tool for Space domain awareness, which can take orbital observation data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats and produce a single, reliable operational picture.</li>
</ol>
