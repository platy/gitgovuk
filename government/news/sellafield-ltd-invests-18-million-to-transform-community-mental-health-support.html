<p>The West Cumbria Mental Health Partnership is part of a £1.8 million investment by Sellafield Ltd’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sellafield-ltd-social-impact-strategy-2018" class="govuk-link">Social Impact, Multiplied (SiX) programme.</a></p>

<p>It will operate under the <a href="https://www.cumbriafoundation.org/transforming-west-cumbria/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Transforming West Cumbria</a> programme, led by Cumbria Community Foundation (CCF).</p>

<p>The partnership aims to create a co-ordinated and collaborative approach to community mental health provision in the boroughs of Copeland and Allerdale, in West Cumbria.</p>

<p>It was developed in response to the closure of Mind West Cumbria in 2019.</p>

<p>That left a void in community support for people experiencing mental health issues.</p>

<p>Sellafield Ltd stepped in to support a short-term solution, funding one-to-one and group support services.</p>

<p>Working with CCF, the focus soon switched to creating a long-term sustainable model and the new partnership was born.</p>

<p>It built on work already started by CCF to encourage mental health providers to work together while identifying and addressing gaps in provision.</p>

<p>As well as providing much-needed funding, the partnership will support community organisations to improve their resilience, capability, and financial sustainability.</p>

<p>The partnership has chosen today, Blue Monday, said to be the most depressing day of the year, to launch.</p>

<p>Its new <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://wcmhp.org.uk/">website</a> has also gone live. It provides details of mental health and wellbeing support, allowing users to choose the right provider for them.</p>

<p>Gary McKeating, head of community and development for Sellafield Ltd, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Poor mental health is an issue that can affect all of us.</p>

  <p>Ensuring high quality services are available for our workforce and our community is incredibly important to us.</p>

  <p>We’re fortunate to have such a diverse range of community-based support available in West Cumbria but provision was patchy and in need of co-ordination following the closure of Mind West Cumbria.</p>

  <p>That’s what the partnership is all about: building a strong platform so organisations can collaborate, develop their skills, and thrive in the long term.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This will be a game-changer for mental health provision in West Cumbria.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Annalee Holliday, senior grants, programmes, and communications officer for CCF, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The closure of Mind West Cumbria highlighted the fragility of organisations delivering such critical services.</p>

  <p>We were pleased to work with Sellafield to address this through the development of the West Cumbria Mental Health Partnership.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The launch couldn’t be more timely as demand for support in West Cumbria continues to grow and statutory mental health services are stretched to capacity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tamsin Beattie, West Cumbria Adult Mental Health Partnership lead for Groundwork NE &amp; Cumbria, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re delighted to be leading the adult mental health programme.</p>

  <p>The funding will allow us to deliver far more high quality support services to people in West Cumbria than we have ever had in the past.</p>

  <p>We’re aiming to support a minimum of 2,000 people over the three-year programme, although we expect we’ll be able to support many more.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Together we’re determined to make a positive difference to the lives of as many people as we can.</p>
</blockquote>
