<p>Innovation in awarding long-term work packages is continuing at the Sellafield site, with the Programme and Project Partners appointing its next partners to support transformation and a lasting legacy for future generations.</p>

<p>The partners have appointed Balfour Beatty Kilpatrick and Doosan Babcock to deliver the mechanical and pipework requirement, through a framework agreement worth £112 to £237 million, over the life of the programme.</p>

<p>The mechanical and pipework package is the third key delivery partner framework to be awarded by the partners as part of a major programme spanning the next 18 years.</p>

<p>The framework has been procured under a new multi project procurement model which encourages long-term collaboration throughout the supply chain, enhanced project delivery, and paves the way for greater economic and social impact in the West Cumbria region.</p>

<p>This new model will see the appointment of key delivery partners to deliver work packages covering everything from building fit out, groundworks and general civils to steelwork and cladding.</p>

<p>Will Smith, managing director, Balfour Beatty Kilpatrick, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Utilising our expert capabilities and collaborative delivery approach, Balfour Beatty Kilpatrick is perfectly positioned to deliver the latest mechanical and pipework framework at Sellafield.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Having now been appointed to the third Programme and Project Partners’ framework, we have cemented our status as a key delivery partner; through which we will continue to deliver a lasting positive legacy across the region.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cameron Gilmour, vice president for nuclear and defence, Doosan Babcock, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The 18-year framework provides a unique opportunity to build upon our site-delivery and expertise heritage at Sellafield and provide further value to the local West Cumbrian area.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Programme and Project Partner head of supply chain Peter Hogg added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are delighted to have confirmed our third long-term work partnership. I’m confident that these 2 companies will bring positive innovations and value to our projects.</p>

  <p class="last-child">They will also be working closely with small and medium-sized enterprises within these frameworks to ensure enhanced project delivery, and increased social impact and economic benefits for our communities.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The Programme and Project Partners awarded its first long-term framework for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/programme-and-project-partners-announce-winners-of-new-multi-million-pound-hvac-contract">heating, ventilation, and air conditioning work</a> to Balfour Beatty Kilpatrick and EJ Parker and the second long-term framework for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/the-programme-and-project-partners-announce-winners-of-new-multi-million-pound-framework">electrical and instrumentation</a> to Balfour Beatty Kilpatrick and NG Bailey.</p>

<p>As part of its pioneering approach to project delivery and local impact, the partners have engaged with the ‘Swimming with the Big Fish small and medium-sized enterprise matchmaker service’, which brokers introductions and develops relationships between those bidding to become key delivery partners and high performing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) willing to invest in West Cumbria.</p>

<p>These SMEs plan to create additional jobs, recruit apprentices and invest to expand/create new facilities in the West Cumbria as a result of the work they do with their respective key delivery partners.</p>

<p>The Programme and Project Partnership is made up of lot partners:</p>

<ul>
  <li>KBR (integration partner)</li>
  <li>Jacobs (design and engineering partner)</li>
  <li>Morgan Sindall Infrastructure (civils construction management partner)</li>
  <li>Doosan Babcock Ltd (process construction management partner)</li>
</ul>

<p>Sellafield Ltd is the 5th partner.</p>
