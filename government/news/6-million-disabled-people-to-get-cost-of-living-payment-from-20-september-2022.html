          <ul>
  <li>£150 disability Cost of Living payments to be made from 20 September 2022</li>
  <li>6 million people who are paid certain disability benefits will benefit</li>
  <li>Automatic support part of wider package of help with the rising Cost of Living, including other cost of living payments totalling £650</li>
</ul>

<p>Those being paid a qualifying disability benefit will be paid automatically from 20 September, with the vast majority of those eligible expected to receive their one-off payment within a couple of weeks by the beginning of October.</p>

<p>The payment will help disabled people with the rising Cost of Living acknowledging the higher disability-related costs they often face, such as care and mobility needs.</p>

<p>For those disabled people on low-incomes, this payment comes on top of other Cost of Living payments totalling £650, £400 for all households to help with energy bills, and an extra £150 for properties in Council Tax bands A-D in England.</p>

<p>Over eight million eligible households in receipt of a means-tested benefit received the first of two automatic Cost of Living payments of £326 from 14 July. The second means-tested payment of £324 will be issued later this year.</p>

<p>Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work Chloe Smith said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We know disabled people can face additional costs, which is why we are acting to help reduce the financial pressures on the most vulnerable.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This £150 disability payment is on top of the £1,200 most low income benefit claimants will also receive and alongside wider support targeted at disabled people, including help with transport and prescription costs.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We know it’s a worrying time for some people and I’d urge them to check they are getting all the support on offer by searching Help for Households.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Cost of Living payments from the government are part of a £37 billion package of support, which will see millions of households receive at least £1,200 this year to help cover rising costs.</p>

<p>The government has also expanded support for the Household Support Fund in England – which helps people with food and energy bills – with an extra £421 million – for October 2022 to March 2023, and topped up funding by £79 million for devolved nations; the total value of this support now stands at £1.5 billion.</p>

<p>This is all in addition to changes to the Universal Credit taper rate and work allowances worth £1,000 a year on average for 1.7 million working claimants, a rise in the National Living Wage to £9.50 an hour, and a tax cut for around 30 million workers through a rise in National Insurance contribution thresholds.</p>

<p>UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Nadhim Zahawi said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We know that rising prices faced by many countries around the world are a significant worry for many people here in the UK, especially those most vulnerable to additional costs.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Today’s announcement that disabled people will begin to receive an additional £150 payment from the end of September reinforces our commitment to help UK households through the challenging times ahead.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This payment is in addition to further help households can expect over the coming months – including a second cost of living payment of £324&nbsp;for households on means-tested benefits, £300 for pensioners this winter and £400 discount on energy bills for every household. This is all part of our significant £37 billion support package.</p>
</blockquote>
