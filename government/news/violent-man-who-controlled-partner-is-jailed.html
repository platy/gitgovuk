<p>A man who subjected a woman to a campaign of abuse has been sent to prison after his sentence was referred to the Court of Appeal by the Solicitor General, Alex Chalk QC MP.</p>

<p>Over a period of more than two and a half years, Tatenda Nyagumbo, 22, subjected the victim to a campaign of abuse, and controlling and coercive behaviour. The offending began in January 2017 after Nyagumbo met the victim while they were both living in a care home.  Nyagumbo frequently strangled the victim, as well as carrying out other assaults. The victim sustained a broken nose during one of the attacks and the offender also threw water and dog faeces at her, as well as filming her when she was distressed and threatening to share the recordings.</p>

<p>Nyagumbo was abusive and controlling throughout the relationship. He stopped the victim from seeing her family and locked her in the house. The offender prevented the victim from reporting the incidents and stopped her from returning to the care home until her bruises had diminished.</p>

<p>On 18 October 2021, at Croydon Crown Court, Nyagumbo was convicted of controlling or coercive behaviour. He was sentenced to 2 years’ imprisonment suspended for 2 years. He also received a 40-day rehabilitation activity requirement and was ordered to carry out 140 hours of unpaid work.</p>

<p>Following the sentencing, the Solicitor General referred Nyagumbo’s original sentence to the Court of Appeal under the Unduly Lenient Sentence (ULS) scheme.</p>

<p>On 21 December the Court of Appeal found his original sentence to be unduly lenient and increased it to 24 months’ imprisonment.</p>

<p>Speaking after the hearing, the Solicitor General, Alex Chalk QC MP said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Nyagumbo subjected his victim to a prolonged campaign of abuse and violent behaviour, even preventing her from seeing her family. His controlling and coercive behaviour will have a lasting impact on the victim. I hope the Court’s decision to impose a custodial sentence can bring some closure to the victim.</p>
</blockquote>
