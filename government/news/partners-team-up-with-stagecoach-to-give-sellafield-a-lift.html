<p>The two-year contract will provide people working on the Sellafield site’s biggest infrastructure projects with transport directly to their workplace, reducing the number of vehicles on local roads and helping to meet Sellafield Ltd’s target to have zero cars on site by 2025.</p>

<p>Stagecoach have also committed to helping Sellafield Ltd drive social impact through corporate volunteering using the Programme and Project Partners Timebank Scheme and supporting people back into work through internal opportunities.</p>

<p>A 75-seater double-decker bus will transport workers onto the site from Lillyhall, Workington, Kangol park and ride facilities, Cleator and Yottenfews car park at Sellafield, with plans to add more pickup locations in the future.</p>

<p>The framework covers 2 inflight major projects being delivered by the partnership at Sellafield – the SIXEP Continuity Plant and the Sellafield Product and Residue Store Retreatment Plant. It will also cover any increase in the numbers of services for any other projects during that time.</p>

<p>Rob Jones, managing director for Stagecoach Cumbria and North Lancashire, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We are delighted to have been awarded the contract and we look forward to working in partnership. It presents an exciting opportunity for us to grow our business and support the local economy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The company has a strong presence in Cumbria and the north west with depots in Carlisle, Kendal, Barrow and Morecambe.</p>

<p>Head of Programme and Project Partners Duncan Elliott added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The partnership is keen to support Sellafield Ltd’s target to reduce vehicles on site. This solution is focussing on moving towards a programme which will share busses between projects, improving efficiency. This will provide a flexible approach to demand. It will help support our social impact and sustainability initiatives, which are key to providing a positive lasting legacy for the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The long-term, complete solution will ultimately provide the following benefits to the partnership and Sellafield Ltd:</p>

<ul>
  <li>financial benefits estimated around £47.07 million by reducing the total number of vehicles required and increasing the effectiveness of running services (1)</li>
  <li>supporting the Sellafield Ltd Enterprise Strategy to reduce private vehicles on site and travelling to site, freeing up space for major infrastructure projects that will support Sellafield’s decommissioning</li>
  <li>reduction in travel time to and from the Sellafield site</li>
  <li>reduction in congestion on the A595 and subsequent carbon emission savings, improving air quality in the local area</li>
  <li>standardisation of travel arrangements across the Programme and Project Partners contract, and the wider enterprise</li>
  <li>increased utilisation of services by mixing and matching project staff on busses if needed, as demands fluctuate</li>
  <li>allows Sellafield to become better ‘neighbours’ to the local communities</li>
</ul>

<p>(1)  cost savings for the Programme and Project Partners pipeline</p>
