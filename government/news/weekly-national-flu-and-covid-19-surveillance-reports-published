<p>The main points from this week’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a> are:</p>

<h3 id="covid-19">COVID-19</h3>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that coronavirus (COVID-19) activity at a national level has remained high during week 46, between 9 and 15 November 2020.</p>

<p>Case rates have fallen among those aged 20 to 69 years old. The highest case rates were seen in those aged 20 to 29, with a rate of 362.1 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Case rates for those aged 80+ are 245.3 per 100,000 population in week 46, compared to 235.5 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 were highest in Yorkshire and the Humber, North East and West Midlands.</p>

<p>Positivity rates through Pillar 1 (NHS and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> testing) have increased slightly and decreased slightly through Pillar 2 (community testing).</p>

<p>Positivity rates were highest among those aged 80 and over tested through Pillar 1 (NHS and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> testing) and in 10 to 19-year-olds tested through Pillar 2 (community testing).</p>

<p>COVID-19 hospital and critical care admission rates continued to increase.</p>

<p>The hospitalisation rate for COVID-19 was 16.74 per 100,000 in week 46 compared to 14.23 per 100,000 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates for COVID-19 were observed in Yorkshire and the Humber and the North East</p>

<p>By age group, the highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and over.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The highest rate of infections from the last week continues to be seen in the younger generations. Whilst it is encouraging that case rates amongst those aged between 20 to 69 have fallen, they continued to rise in those over 70 who are more at risk of a bad outcome from the virus. The hospital admission rate also increased and was highest in those over 85.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The effect of the current measures does not yet appear in the data, but we should begin to see the impact soon. By mixing with fewer people, we can help to slow the spread of COVID-19 and bring down the number of infections. This in turn will help us to control the virus and save lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="influenza">Influenza</h3>

<p>Flu activity, including <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> consultations and hospital admissions, remains low.</p>

<p>Flu vaccine uptake is higher in all groups except pregnant women compared to this time last year. Provisional data suggests uptake rates are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>72.9% in 65+ year olds</li>
  <li>37.8% in under 65 years in a clinical risk group</li>
  <li>30.8% in pregnant women</li>
  <li>45.0% in 2-year-olds</li>
  <li>46.8% in 3-year-olds</li>
</ul>

<p>The first uptake rates for school-age children (Reception to Year 7) and healthcare workers will be published in November.</p>

<p>Dr Vanessa Saliba, Head of Flu, Public Health England said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This winter, more people than ever are being offered a free flu vaccine and it is encouraging to see uptake in 2 to 3-year-olds and those aged 65 and over is higher than ever for this point in the season.</p>

  <p class="last-child">There is still time to get vaccinated against flu before it starts circulating in the community. We are urging anyone who is eligible to take up the offer. By getting the jab, you can help protect yourself, your family and the NHS – it will help save lives.</p>

<h3 id="covid-19-1">COVID-19</h3>

<p>Detections of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in England remained high in week 45 with a slight increase on the previous week.</p>

<p>Case rates have increased across all age groups. The highest case rates were seen in those aged 20 to 29, with a rate of 358.9 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The biggest increase was seen in those aged 80+ with a rate of 217.1 per 100,000 population in week 45, compared to 192.4 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 were highest in the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber.</p>

<p>Positivity rates through Pillar 1 (NHS and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> testing) and Pillar 2 (community testing) have decreased slightly.</p>

<p>Positivity rates were highest among those aged 80 and over tested through Pillar 1 (NHS and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> testing), as they are more likely to be in hospital, and in 10 to 19-year-olds tested through Pillar 2 (community testing).</p>

<p>COVID-19 hospital and critical care admission rates continued to increase.</p>

<p>The hospitalisation rate for COVID-19 was 14.03 per 100,000 in week 45 compared to 13.53 per 100,000 in the previous week.</p>

<p>By NHS regions, the highest hospital admission rates for COVID-19 were observed in the North East.</p>

<p>By age group, the highest hospital admission rates were in those aged 85 and over.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The highest rate of infections continues to be seen in the younger generations, but worryingly it is rising quickly in those over 80 who are most at risk of poor outcomes. The current measures are in place to help protect all of us, and anyone can suffer serious illness from this virus.</p>

<h3 id="covid-19-2">COVID-19</h3>

<p>Case detections decreased slightly compared to last week though this is likely to be driven by reduced testing over the half term period.</p>

<p>Case rates have slightly fallen in those aged 5 to 39, however continue to increase in those aged 40 and over. The highest case rates were seen in those aged 20 to 39, with a rate of 333.6 per 100,000 population for those aged 20 to 29 and 289.5 per 100,000 population for those aged 30 to 39.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 were highest in the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber.</p>

<p>Positivity rates through Pillar 2 (community testing) continue to rise and has flattened under Pillar 1 (NHS and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> testing).</p>

<p>Positivity rates were highest among those aged 80 and over tested through both Pillar 1 (NHS and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> testing), as they are more likely to be in hospital, and in 10 to 19-year-olds tested through Pillar 2 (community testing).</p>

<p>COVID-19 hospital and critical care admission rates continued to increase.</p>

<p>The hospitalisation rate for COVID-19 was 13.23 per 100,000 in week 44 compared to 10.36 per 100,000 in the previous week.</p>

<p>By age group, the highest hospital admission rates were in those aged 85 and over.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Sadly we know that more people will be admitted to hospital in the coming weeks and this will inevitably lead to more COVID-related deaths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The number of COVID-19-related deaths increased further.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Everyone has made huge sacrifices over the past few months and I appreciate just how difficult it is to continue to follow the restrictions and guidelines. In doing so, we protect ourselves, our families and the most vulnerable.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Sadly, the number of COVID-19 related deaths continue to rise, but we can all play our part. By socially distancing, wearing a face covering and washing our hands regularly we can help to cut transmission and save lives.</p>

<p>The hospitalisation rate for COVID-19 was 7.74 per 100,000 in week 42 compared to 5.55 per 100,000 in the previous week.</p>

<p>We are concerned by the disproportionate impact that COVID-19 continues to have on Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. Almost 4 in 10 (39.9%) new critical care admissions have involved people from these backgrounds over the course of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Highest case rates continue to be observed among those aged 10 to 29, with a rate of 245.2 per 100,000 population for the 10 to 19 age group and 252.6 per 100,000 for those aged 20 to 29.</p>

<p>Positivity rates were highest in those aged between 10 to 19; this was mainly in those in the upper end of the age group.</p>

<p>Incidence and positivity rates remained highest in the North West, North East and Yorkshire and Humber.</p>

<p>COVID-19 hospital and critical care admission rates continued to increase.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director for Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We’re now seeing about 40 per cent of positive cases among young adults in their late teens and early twenties, which is causing the disease to spread rapidly throughout the community and older people. And while there are fewer cases among older people, they are far more likely to get seriously ill. That means we are also seeing a worrying increase in people aged over 75 being admitted to hospital. We must be prepared for the number of deaths to rise rapidly as a result.</p>
