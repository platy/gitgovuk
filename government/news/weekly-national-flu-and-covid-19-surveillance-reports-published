<p>The main points from this week’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a> are:</p>

<h3 id="covid-19">COVID-19</h3>

<p>Case detections decreased slightly compared to last week though this is likely to be driven by reduced testing over the half term period.</p>

<p>Case rates have slightly fallen in those aged 5 to 39, however continue to increase in those aged 40 and over. The highest case rates were seen in those aged 20 to 39, with a rate of 333.6 per 100,000 population for those aged 20 to 29 and 289.5 per 100,000 population for those aged 30 to 39.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 were highest in the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber.</p>

<p>Positivity rates through Pillar 2 (community testing) continue to rise and has flattened under Pillar 1 (NHS and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> testing).</p>

<p>Positivity rates were highest among those aged 80 and over tested through both Pillar 1 (NHS and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> testing), as they are more likely to be in hospital, and in 10 to 19-year-olds tested through Pillar 2 (community testing).</p>

<p>COVID-19 hospital and critical care admission rates continued to increase.</p>

<p>The hospitalisation rate for COVID-19 was 13.23 per 100,000 in week 44 compared to 10.36 per 100,000 in the previous week.</p>

<p>By NHS regions, the highest hospital admission rates for COVID-19 were observed in the North West.</p>

<p>By age group, the highest hospital admission rates were in those aged 85 and over.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sadly we know that more people will be admitted to hospital in the coming weeks and this will inevitably lead to more COVID-related deaths.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It is vital we all follow the new measures that are now in place to reduce infections and save lives. The fewer people you see, the more you’ll help stop the spread of the virus and protect your loved ones.</p>

<h3 id="thursday-29-october-2020">Thursday 29 October 2020</h3>

<p>The main points from the weekly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a> for week 44 (data up to week 43) are:</p>

<h3 id="covid-19-1">COVID-19</h3>

<p>Case rates increased in every age group except for those aged 10 to 19, which saw a small decrease. The rate for week 43 was 226.9 per 100,000 population compared with 234.3 per 100,000 population in the previous week.</p>

<p>The highest case rates were seen in those aged 20 to 39, with a rate of 333.2 per 100,000 population for those aged 20 to 29 and 274.1 per 100,000 population for those aged 30 to 39.</p>

<p>Positivity rates were highest among 80+ year olds tested through both Pillar 1 (NHS and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> testing) and in 10- to 19-year-olds tested through Pillar 2 (community testing).</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 were highest in the North East, North West and Yorkshire & Humber.</p>

<p>COVID-19 hospital and critical care admission rates continued to increase.</p>

<p>The hospitalisation rate for COVID-19 was 10.01 per 100,000 in week 43 compared to 7.74 per 100,000 in the previous week.</p>

<p>By NHS regions, the highest hospital admission rates for COVID-19 were observed in the North West. By age group, the highest hospital admission rates were in those aged 85 and over.</p>

<p>The overall number of acute respiratory infection incidents reported to Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) Health Protection Teams increased from 1,125 in the previous week to 1,312 in week 43 in England. In the majority of these incidents, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected.</p>

<p>The number of COVID-19-related deaths increased further.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone has made huge sacrifices over the past few months and I appreciate just how difficult it is to continue to follow the restrictions and guidelines. In doing so, we protect ourselves, our families and the most vulnerable.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Sadly, the number of COVID-19 related deaths continue to rise, but we can all play our part. By socially distancing, wearing a face covering and washing our hands regularly we can help to cut transmission and save lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="influenza">Influenza</h3>

<p>Flu activity, including <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> consultations and hospital admissions, remains low.</p>

<p>Flu vaccine uptake is higher in all groups compared to this time last year. Provisional data suggests uptake rates are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>63.6% in 65+ year olds</li>
  <li>24.5% in under 65 years in a clinical risk group</li>
  <li>22.3% in pregnant women</li>
  <li>32.0% in 2-year-olds</li>
  <li>33.4% in 3-year-olds</li>
</ul>

<p>The first uptake rates for school-age children (Reception to Year 7) and healthcare workers will be published in November.</p>

<p>Dr Vanessa Saliba, Head of Flu, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This winter, more people than ever are being offered a free flu vaccine and it is encouraging to see uptake so far is higher than last season in all groups – particularly for 2- to 3-year-olds and those aged 65 and over.</p>

  <p class="last-child">There is still time to get vaccinated against flu before it starts circulating in the community. We are urging anyone who is eligible to take up the offer. By getting the jab, you can help protect yourself, your family and the NHS – it will help save lives.</p>

<h3 id="friday-22-october-2020">Friday 22 October 2020</h3>

<p>The main points from the weekly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a> for week 43 (data up to week 42) are:</p>

<h3 id="covid-19-2">COVID-19</h3>

<p>Highest case rates continue to be observed among those aged 10 to 29, with a rate of 207.7 per 100,000 population for the 10 to 19 age group and 274.3 per 100,000 for those aged 20 to 29, although these have decreased since week 41.</p>

<p>Positivity rates were highest in those aged between 10 and 29 years old.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 are highest in the North East, North West and Yorkshire & Humber.</p>

<p>COVID-19 hospital and critical care admission rates continued to increase.</p>

<p>The hospitalisation rate for COVID-19 was 7.74 per 100,000 in week 42 compared to 5.55 per 100,000 in the previous week.</p>

<p>We are concerned by the disproportionate impact that COVID-19 continues to have on Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. Almost 4 in 10 (39.9%) new critical care admissions have involved people from these backgrounds over the course of the pandemic.</p>

<p>By NHS regions, the highest hospital admission rate for COVID-19 were observed in the North West. By age group, the highest hospital admission rates were in those aged 85 and over.</p>

<p>The overall number of acute respiratory infection incidents reported to Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) Health Protection Teams reduced slightly from 1,140 in the previous week to 1,125 in week 42 in England. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the majority of these incidents.</p>

<p>The number of COVID-19-related deaths increased further.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hospital admissions and deaths continue to climb right across the country, and there are signs in the data that increasing numbers of older people are now getting seriously ill.</p>

  <p>This virus continues to have a disproportionate impact on our Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities, who represent nearly 40% of admissions to intensive care.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It is essential to wash your hands, wear a face covering in enclosed spaces and follow social distancing rules. It is a matter of life and death.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="influenza-1">Influenza</h3>

<p>Flu activity, including <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> consultations and hospital admissions, remains low.</p>

<p>Flu vaccine uptake is higher in all groups compared to this time last year. Provisional data suggests uptake rates are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>57.2% in 65+ year olds</li>
  <li>16.4% in under 65 years in a clinical risk group</li>
  <li>18.1% in pregnant women</li>
  <li>26.0% in 2-year-olds</li>
  <li>27.4% in 3-year-olds</li>
</ul>

<p>The first uptake rates for school-age children (reception to year 7) and healthcare workers will be published in November.</p>

<h3 id="covid-19-3">COVID-19</h3>

<p>Highest case rates continue to be observed among those aged 10 to 29, with a rate of 245.2 per 100,000 population for the 10 to 19 age group and 252.6 per 100,000 for those aged 20 to 29.</p>

<p>Positivity rates were highest in those aged between 10 to 19; this was mainly in those in the upper end of the age group.</p>

<p>Incidence and positivity rates remained highest in the North West, North East and Yorkshire and Humber.</p>

<p>COVID-19 hospital and critical care admission rates continued to increase.</p>

<p>Hospitalisation rates for COVID-19 were 5.55 per 100,000 in week 41, compared to 3.60 per 100,000 in the previous week.</p>

<p>By region, the North West had the highest weekly rate of hospital admissions. By age group, rates were highest among those aged 75+.</p>

<p>The overall number of acute respiratory infection incidents reported to <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> Health Protection Teams increased from 885 in the previous week to 1140 in week 41 in England. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the majority of these incidents.</p>

<p>The number of COVID-19-related deaths increased further.</p>

<h3 id="influenza-2">Influenza</h3>

<p>Flu activity, including <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> consultations and hospital admissions, remains low.</p>

<p>Flu vaccine uptake is higher in all groups compared to this time last year.</p>

<p>Provisional data suggests uptake rates are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>47.5% in 65+ year olds</li>
  <li>12.0% in under 65 years in a clinical risk group</li>
  <li>13.0% in pregnant women</li>
  <li>19.5% in 2 year olds</li>
  <li>21.0% in 3 year olds</li>
</ul>

<p>The first uptake rates for school age children (Reception to Year 7) and healthcare workers will be published in November.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director for Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re now seeing about 40 per cent of positive cases among young adults in their late teens and early twenties, which is causing the disease to spread rapidly throughout the community and older people. And while there are fewer cases among older people, they are far more likely to get seriously ill. That means we are also seeing a worrying increase in people aged over 75 being admitted to hospital. We must be prepared for the number of deaths to rise rapidly as a result.</p>

  <p>This picture is particularly acute in the North of England, with the North West the region worst affected.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I cannot stress enough how vital it is that everyone follows the guidelines as they are there to help protect you and your loved ones. Wash your hands regularly, use a face covering and keep your distance.</p>
