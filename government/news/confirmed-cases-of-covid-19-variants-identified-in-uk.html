<h3>Four more cases of Variant of Concern <abbr title="variants of concern">VOC</abbr>-202101/02 (P.1) found in England</h3>

<p>Four more cases of the Variant of Concern <abbr title="variants of concern">VOC</abbr>-202101/02, also known as P.1, have been identified in England – 3 in South Gloucestershire and one in Bradford, West Yorkshire.</p>

<p>The cases in South Gloucestershire are all close or household contacts of the 2 existing P.1 cases in the area. They were offered testing in response to the initial cases.</p>

<p>Specialist contact tracing teams have undertaken a comprehensive investigation to identify any further contacts and additional testing has been in place since the initial cases were identified.</p>

<p>The individual in Bradford tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) in late February after travelling back from Brazil via Paris on 14 February 2021. Subsequent genomic sequencing confirmed the case as the P.1 variant. Contact tracing teams have followed up close contacts of the individual and advised them to isolate and get a test.</p>

<p>The latest cases bring the total number of P.1 variant cases in the UK to 10 – 7 in England and 3 in Scotland, all of which have links to travel or to a previously confirmed case that has travelled to Brazil.</p>

<h3>New Variant Under Investigation (<abbr title="Variant Under Investigation">VUI</abbr>) designated in UK</h3>

<p>A new variant identified in the UK has been designated a Variant Under Investigation (<abbr title="Variant Under Investigation">VUI</abbr>) by Public Health England.</p>

<p><abbr title="Variant Under Investigation">VUI</abbr>-202103/01 (lineage B.1.324.1) was designated a <abbr title="Variant Under Investigation">VUI</abbr> on 4 March after 2 cases were found in the South East of England in individuals who had recently travelled to Antigua. Despite the travel history of these cases there is no scientific evidence to determine where this variant first emerged.</p>

<p>The variant contains the spike mutations E484K and N501Y, both usually associated with Variants of Concern (<abbr title="variants of concern">VOC</abbr>), however it does not feature specific deletions that would lead to a designation as a <abbr title="variants of concern">VOC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Contact tracing teams have completed thorough investigations to identify and follow up any close contacts and no additional cases have been found to date.</p>

<h3>Contact tracers successfully identify sixth case of P.1 Variant of Concern</h3>

<p>Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) and NHS Test and Trace teams have successfully located the third individual in England who tested positive for the P.1 Variant of Concern that originated in Manaus, Brazil.</p>

<p>Tracing teams narrowed their search to a small number of households in Croydon, South London, when an individual from the borough made themselves known by responding to calls made by specialist contact tracers.</p>

<p>NHS Test and Trace were then able to match the barcode from the individual’s testing pack to the variant test result.</p>

<p><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> is now carrying out enhanced contact tracing with the individual and other members of their household. The case had been in contact with an individual who travelled from Brazil in early February.</p>

<p>Although investigations are ongoing, current early indications are that all members of the household isolated for the correct amount of time after the traveller returned and after the case developed symptoms.</p>

<p>Doctor Fu-Meng Khaw, Strategic Response Director for <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> and Deputy Chief Medical Adviser for Test and Trace, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The identification of this individual is the result of an enormous collaborative effort between specialist teams at NHS Test and Trace and Public Health England.</p>

  <p>Staff have been working around the clock to pursue every line of investigation and this is a fantastic result that enables us to fully investigate the circumstances around the case and reduce the risk of onward transmission.</p>

  <p>As an additional precaution, we’re working closely with Croydon Council to put in place further testing in the area.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We are continuing to monitor all variants closely and the best way to protect against all COVID-19 infections is to remember the basics of Hands, Face, Space.</p>

<h3>Thursday 4 March</h3>

<h3>New Variant Under Investigation designated in the UK</h3>

<p>Sixteen cases of a new variant, <abbr title="Variant Under Investigation">VUI</abbr>-202102/04 (lineage B.1.1.318), have been identified in the UK. The variant has been designated a Variant Under Investigation (<abbr title="Variant Under Investigation">VUI</abbr>) by Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>).</p>

<p>Cases of this variant, understood to have originated in the UK, were first identified on 15 February through genomic horizon scanning. All individuals who tested positive and their contacts have been traced and advised to isolate.</p>

<p>Following assessments, the variant was designated a <abbr title="Variant Under Investigation">VUI</abbr> on 24 February. It contains the E484K mutation, which is also found in 2 existing <abbr title="variants under investigation">VUIs</abbr> present in the UK, but does not feature the N501Y mutation, present in all variants of concern (<abbr title="variants of concern">VOCs</abbr>).</p>

<p>The addition of this variant as a <abbr title="Variant Under Investigation">VUI</abbr> means there are now a total of 4 <abbr title="variants under investigation">VUIs</abbr> and 4 <abbr title="variants of concern">VOCs</abbr> currently being tracked in the UK.</p>

<h3>Cases with no travel links</h3>

<p>As of 3 March:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a total of 59 cases of the variant <abbr title="variants of concern">VOC</abbr>-202012/02, first detected in South Africa, have been found in England where no travel links could be established</li>
  <li>a total of 26 cases of the variant <abbr title="Variant Under Investigation">VUI</abbr>-202101/01, the P2 variant first detected in Brazil, have been found in England where no travel links could be established</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tuesday 28 February</h3>

<h3>Cases of Variant of Concern first detected in Manaus identified in the UK</h3>

<p>Up to 6 cases of the&nbsp;Variant of Concern first identified in Manaus, Brazil (P.1)&nbsp;have been detected in the UK. Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) has identified 3 of these cases of the Variant of Concern in England.</p>

<p>Two of the cases in England are from one household in South Gloucestershire with a history of travel to Brazil and there is a third, currently unlinked case.</p>

<p>The cases in South Gloucestershire were rapidly followed up by the <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> Health Protection Team – cases and their contacts have been identified and retested. One case that had travelled to Brazil has been isolating at home with their household since returning to the UK.</p>

<p><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> and NHS Test and Trace are following up with all passengers on Swiss Air flight LX318 travelling from Sao Paulo via Zurich and landing in London Heathrow on 10 February, to provide public health advice and test them and their households. Anyone who returned to the UK at that time should have gone home immediately from the airport and isolated for 10 days.</p>

<p>If you were a passenger on the flight and have not been contacted, please call 01174 503 174 to arrange a test for you and your household contacts.</p>

<p>Although the risk to the wider community is considered low, as a precaution, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, working in collaboration with South Gloucestershire Council and NHS Test and Trace, is taking swift and decisive action to deploy surge asymptomatic testing as well as increasing sequencing of positive samples from the area. Residents of South Gloucestershire should visit the council’s website for more information on testing. The most important actions are identifying cases and their contacts and supporting these individuals to isolate effectively.</p>

<p>Further investigation is underway regarding the third case in England. The individual did not complete their test registration card so follow-up details are not available. We are therefore asking for anyone who undertook a test on 12 or 13 February and hasn’t received their result or has an uncompleted test registration card, to call 119 in England or 0300 303 2713 in Scotland for assistance as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The P.1 variant has been designated ‘of concern’ as it shares some important mutations with the variant first identified in South Africa (B.1.351), such as E484K and N501Y. &nbsp;It is possible that this variant may respond less well to current vaccines, but more work is needed to understand this.</p>

<p>Dr Susan Hopkins, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> strategic response director for COVID-19 and NHS Test and Trace Medical Advisor, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have identified these cases thanks to the UK’s advanced sequencing capabilities which means we are finding more variants and mutations than many other countries and are therefore able to take action quickly.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The important thing to remember is that COVID-19, no matter what variant it is, spreads in the same way. That means the measures to stop it spreading do not change. Stay at home and if you do need to go out for essential reasons, cover your nose and mouth, wash your hands thoroughly and keep your distance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We ask that individuals come forward for testing through the symptomatic and asymptomatic test sites across the countries in order to continue to drive down cases in the community.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Three cases of the variant have also been identified in Scotland but these are not linked to these 3 cases in England.</p>

<h3>Tuesday 16 February</h3>

<p>Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) has identified 38 cases of COVID-19 which genomic sequencing has shown to feature a specific set of mutations which are currently being referred to as lineage B.1.525. The set of mutations includes the E484K spike protein mutation, which is present on a number of other variants of concern and variants under investigation.</p>

<p>This variant has been designated a Variant Under Investigation (<abbr title="Variant Under Investigation">VUI</abbr>) and will be referred to as VUI202102/03.</p>

<p>The variant has been detected in other countries, including Nigeria, Denmark and Canada.</p>

<p>Cases are geographically dispersed across England. Enhanced contact tracing and genomic sequencing is underway to monitor the situation as it develops.</p>

<p>Professor Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> is monitoring data about emerging variants very closely and where necessary public health interventions are being undertaken, such as extra testing and enhanced contact tracing.</p>

  <p>There is currently no evidence that this set of mutations causes more severe illness or increased transmissibility.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The best way to stop the spread of the virus is to follow the public health advice: wash your hands, wear a face covering and keep your distance from others. While in lockdown, it is important that people stay at home, where possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regular updates of confirmed variant cases will be provided on this page.</p>

<h3>Friday 15 January</h3>

<p>As of Thursday 14 January 2021, 35 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-variants-genomically-confirmed-case-numbers">genomically confirmed</a> and 12 genomically probable cases of the SARS-CoV-2 variant which originated in South Africa (called VOC202012/02 in the UK, also named B1.351 and 501Y.V2 internationally) have been identified in the UK.</p>

<p>Two variants of interest have also been identified in Brazil. The first variant is variant under investigation (<abbr title="Variant Under Investigation">VUI</abbr>) 202101/01 – this variant has a small number of mutations. The spread and significance of this variant remains under investigation. In partnership with COG-UK, 8 genomically confirmed cases of this variant have now been identified in the UK. All necessary public health action is being taken to follow-up the cases.</p>

<p>The second variant has been designated a Variant of Concern by <abbr title="New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group">NERVTAG</abbr>, now termed VOC202101/02, and this variant has more mutations. We have NOT detected this second Brazil originated strain in the UK– this has been detected in Manaus and travellers arriving in Japan.</p>

<p>Laboratory work has begun on the <abbr title="variants of concern">VOC</abbr> 202012/02 in the UK and is routinely undertaken on all variants under investigation or of concern once samples are available.</p>

<p>Dr Susan Hopkins, COVID Strategic Response Director at Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are continuing&nbsp;efforts to understand the effect of the variants on transmissibility, severe disease, mortality, antibody response and vaccine efficacy.</p>

  <p class="last-child">For now, our advice remains the same following detection of a Brazilian variant in the UK, even though this is not the variant detected in Manaus with more mutations: the best way to stop the spread of the virus is to wash your hands, wear a face covering and keep your distance from others. Whilst in lockdown, it is important that we also stay at home unless it is absolutely essential to go out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Through COG-UK, the UK is a global leader in SARS-CoV-2 genomics, providing around 48% of the genomic data supplied to <a rel="external" href="https://www.gisaid.org/">GISAID</a>, the scientific initiative which allows global, real-time surveillance of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p><abbr title="whole genome sequencing">WGS</abbr> is vital to the global response to the pandemic, allowing us to monitor and understand the evolution of new COVID-19 variants and respond with timely public health interventions.</p>

<p>In addition to the travel ban imposed on South Africa on 23 December 2020, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/travel-restrictions-update-south-africa-ban-extended-israel-and-jerusalem-removed-from-travel-corridors-list">Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>) has announced new restrictions</a> for everyone arriving into the country from Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Eswatini, Zambia, Malawi, Lesotho, Mozambique, Angola, Mauritius and Seychelles.</p>

<p>The restrictions follow new data on the steep rise in incidence of the B1.351 variant, which has vastly increased the risk of community transmission between these 9 southern African countries, as well as the Seychelles and Mauritius which have strong travel links with South Africa.</p>

<p>From 15 January 2021, the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> has also imposed a subsequent travel ban to the UK from several South American countries and countries with strong travel links to Brazil. Passengers who have been in or transited through Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Cape Verde, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Panama, Portugal (including Madeira and the Azores), Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela in the last 10 days will no longer be granted access to the UK.</p>

<p>British and Irish Nationals (and or third country nationals with residence rights in the UK) who have travelled from or transited through these countries must self-isolate for 10 days, as must members of their household. Contact tracing and testing of close contacts of confirmed cases will be used to identify and manage potential transmission. The decision to impose these restrictions has been taken to prevent the spread of the variant of coronavirus, known as VOC202101/02, into the UK.</p>

<p>The Isolation Assurance Service (IAS) will be contacting all returnees from all southern African countries, Mauritius and Seychelles to reinforce the advice to self-isolate, to encourage testing even if asymptomatic and to inform anyone treating/testing them of their recent travel.</p>

<h3>Wednesday 23 December</h3>

<p>The 2 cases were identified in the UK on 22 December 2020 and both have been in contact with someone who has travelled from South Africa. <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>’s Health Protection Teams have followed up with both cases and contact tracing is underway.</p>

<p>The new variant named B1.351 (also referred to as 501Y.V2) was first detected in Nelson Mandela Bay, South Africa, in samples at the beginning of October. Molecular dating suggests that it could have been in circulation from the end of August.</p>

<p>The rapid spread of the variant in South Africa could be an indication of increased transmissibility but this is not yet confirmed. <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> is investigating this variant and will share its findings in due course. There is currently no evidence to suggest that the variant has any impact on disease severity, antibody response or vaccine efficacy. Epidemiological and virological investigations are also ongoing in South Africa.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for viruses to undergo mutations; seasonal influenza mutates every year. More than 4,000 variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified in the UK and variants have been observed in many other countries.</p>

<p>Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser on COVID-19 to <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> &amp; Test and Trace, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are investigating this new variant of SARS-CoV-2 which originated in South Africa. Viruses often evolve and this is not unusual. We are carrying out work as a priority to understand the potential risk this variant may cause. It is important to say that there is currently no evidence that this variant causes more severe illness, or that the regulated vaccine would not protect against it.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The best way to stop infection is to stick to the rules – wash our hands, wear a face covering and keep our distance from others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The recommended control measures to limit the spread of the new variant continue to be testing, following the existing public health guidance and abiding by the restrictions, including ‘Hands, Face, Space’ and limiting your number of contacts. <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> have announced new restrictions for everyone arriving in the country from South Africa.</p>
