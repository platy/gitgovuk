<p>The Prevention Foundation, a community interest company, has been wound-up by the High Court, after complaints regarding misleading sales tactics.</p>

<p>Businesses were misled into paying for sponsorship of anti-knife crime, anti-bullying, and fire and road safety educational booklets sent to schools.</p>

<p>Prevention Foundation began trading in early 2019 after taking over the business previously operated by Safety Guide Ltd, which was itself <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/courts-shut-down-rogue-education-publisher">wound up in the public interest in June 2020</a> following an Insolvency Service investigation.</p>

<p>Investigating complaints about Prevention Foundation, the Insolvency Service established that it operated substantially the same business as Safety Guide, targeting small businesses with unsolicited sales calls and using misleading sales tactics to obtain sponsorship.</p>

<p>Prevention Foundation’s directors failed to co-operate with the investigation and failed to provide any company accounts or records.</p>

<p>Despite this, the investigation established that Prevention Foundation secured more than £1.6 million by February 2021, but due to the lack of co-operation it was impossible to account for over £1 million worth of expenditure.</p>

<p>As a result, Prevention Foundation was wound up in the public interest by the High Court in Manchester before District Judge Bever on 1 October 2021. The Official Receiver has been appointed as the Liquidator.</p>

<p>David Hope, Chief Investigator for the Insolvency Service, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This company abused its status as a community interest company.  It used dubious sales tactics to elicit significant funds from small businesses without providing any recognisable community benefit. Prevention Foundation also demonstrated a wilful disregard for its obligations by obstructing our investigation.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Thankfully the court recognised the severity of the misconduct.  Now it’s been wound-up, the Official Receiver can make further enquiries into Prevention Foundation’s practices and the conduct of its directors.</p>
</blockquote>
