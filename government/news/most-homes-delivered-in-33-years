  <li>New stats show 243,770 homes delivered in 2019 to 2020</li>
  <li>Highest number of homes delivered since 1987 and the 7th year in a row the number of new homes built has increased</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/housing-supply-net-additional-dwellings-england-2019-to-2020">Official statistics</a> published today (26 November 2020) show more homes were delivered last year than in any year since 1987, making this the 7th year in a row the number homes delivered has increased.</p>

<p>The new figures show 243,770 homes were delivered in 2019 to 2020. The development of new build homes has contributed significantly to this number – accounting for 90% of the homes delivered.</p>

<p>Today’s statistics also show that an additional 2,130 communal dwellings were added to the housing stock, including more than 1,700 student accommodation units, and that the government’s ‘change of use’ reforms have made available almost 27,000 new homes.</p>

<p>Since 2010 more than 1.8 million homes have been delivered across England, supported by government investment including the £3.9 billion allocated through the Housing Infrastructure Fund, our existing £9 billion Shared Ownership and Affordable Homes programme, and the government’s Help to Buy schemes which have provided confidence and certainty to the sector</p>

<p>The government has been working is closely with industry to support home building during the pandemic.</p>

<p>In June, the Housing Secretary <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-plans-to-get-britain-building-in-coronavirus-recovery">announced</a> the extension of planning permissions to ensure work temporarily disrupted by Covid restrictions could continue where possible.</p>

<p>Measures were also introduced to speed up planning appeals and to allow more flexible working hours for builders on site, helping them to continue building much-needed new homes in a safe environment.</p>

<p>Housing Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nearly a quarter of a million homes were delivered during the last year - more than at any point in the last 33 years, helping families across the country get the keys to their first home.</p>

  <p>The pandemic has posed significant challenges for home building but this government will continue to support the industry and the £20 billion investment announced at the Spending Review will ensure we deliver the homes this country needs.</p>

  <p class="last-child">In the longer term, our overhaul of the planning system will deliver even more high-quality, sustainable homes in the communities which need them most.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The government continues to support home building and this week in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/spending-review-2020">Spending Review</a> announced nearly £20 billion of investment in housing - the single biggest investment in new homes in England’s history.</p>

<p>This includes a National Home Building Fund, investing £7.1 billion over four years to shake up the housing market by backing smaller developers, unlocking brownfield land, and supporting innovative construction techniques such as modular housing. This will unlock up to 860,000 new homes.</p>

<p>And more than £12 billion in affordable housing will be invested over the next five years, the largest investment in affordable housing in a decade, which will provide up to 180,000 new homes across the country and unlock a further £38 billion in public and private investment in affordable housing.</p>

<p>In August the government published <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/launch-of-planning-for-the-future-consultation-to-reform-the-planning-system">Planning for The Future</a>, setting out reforms to the country’s outdated planning system to deliver the high-quality, sustainable homes that communities need.</p>

<p>Executive Chairman of the Home Builders Federation, Stewart Baseley said;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today’s numbers show the continued progress being made by the industry to deliver more homes. Home builders have delivered more homes seven years in a row, increasing the number of homes built by 42% in 5 years.</p>

  <p>Alongside these benefits, the industry is also creating tens of thousands of new jobs each year and boosting economies across the country. Delivering new homes generates huge investment in infrastructure and amenities in communities, benefiting both new and existing residents.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Looking ahead, building more high quality, environmentally friendly homes can play a major part in supporting the economy as the country recovers from the impacts of coronavirus.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="further-information">Further information</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/net-supply-of-housing">‘Housing Supply: Net Additional Dwellings’ statistics</a> show the net number of homes available in 2020/21 from 1 April and 31 March against the previous year, including through new build homes and conversions.</p>

<p>The Statistical Release presents National Statistics on net additional dwellings in England up to 2019-20. The figures show the net change in dwelling stock in England between 1 April and 31 March the following year.</p>

<p>The ‘net additional dwelling’ figures are based on local authority estimates of gains and losses of dwellings during each year and are calculated using the most comprehensive list of sources available. This includes council tax base, building control, site visits and any other management information available to the authority.</p>

<p>The statistics track changes in the size of dwelling stock due to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>new builds</li>
  <li>conversions</li>
  <li>changes of use</li>
  <li>demolitions</li>
</ul>
