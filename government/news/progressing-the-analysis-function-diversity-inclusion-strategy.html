<p>The Analysis Function Diversity &amp; Inclusion Strategy is supported by the D&amp;I working group, which is made up of three elements or strands.  Each strand supports one of the strategic aims outlined in the Analysis Function D&amp;I Strategy;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Attract - focus on recruitment and attracting a diverse range of candidates to careers in government analysis. This includes developing a school and university outreach approach, as well as consideration of recruitment diversity data to better understand success rates of candidates from different demographics at each stage of the process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Build – focus on creating additional development opportunities for members of the function un under-represented groups, organising a series of talks with senior analysts across government and looking to improve opportunity sharing across profession and departmental boundaries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create – focus is to champion a more inclusive approach and practices across the function. The group seeks to capture different perspectives, identify and share best practice and encourage all analysts to create a welcoming culture in which everyone has the opportunity to thrive.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each month we’ll be updating this page, and the AF Newsletter with interesting nuggets and highlighting news from the Create group.</p>

<p>The Create team champion best practice from across government and beyond to demonstrate that creating analytical teams that are both diverse and inclusive is not only right but also more effective.  By regularly sharing best practice, the group aims to help you consider how to improve equality and inclusion in your teams and will begin to normalise what is currently the exceptional.</p>

<p>By nurturing differing perspectives, the group hope to encourage analysts to take credit for their hard work and feel supported to bring their diverse experiences to the table in order to improve analytical outputs across government.</p>

<p>If you would like to join the working group, tell us about best practice within your teams and departments or subscribe to the AF monthly Newsletter, please email us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:analysis.function@ons.gov.uk">analysis.function@ons.gov.uk</a></p>

<h3>This month, to celebrate International Women’s Day, the Create team asked the Women in Economics group to provide us with the highlights of their work:</h3>

<p>“Have you ever been the only woman in a meeting and worried that people won’t take you seriously? Been so nervous to contribute that you missed your chance? Or cried in the loos during a terrible day? Well we have. And until we started talking to others about it, we thought it was just us.”</p>

<p>The Women in Economics network provides a forum to share experiences, providing a network for nearly 350 economists (A0-G7) over 25 departments and agencies. Popular events have involved SCS speaking candidly on topics that aren’t often discussed - ‘Are women judged for what they wear at work?’ or ‘Being afraid to speak up in meetings’.  Hearing honest admissions from senior role models normalises these experiences, empowering members to share their own issues and to recognise that this won’t prevent them from achieving their full potential.  </p>

<p>To sign up to the mailing list and attend events, please email <a href="mailto:womenineconomicscommittee@gmail.com" class="govuk-link">womenineconomicscommittee@gmail.com</a> All are welcome to take part regardless of gender or grade, and the group is also open to non-economists.</p>
