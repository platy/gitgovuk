<p>The Regulator of Social Housing has today (17 November) published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reshaping-consumer-regulation-our-principles-and-approach">‘Reshaping consumer regulation: Our principles and approach’</a>. This sets out its initial thinking about how it will put in place the changes to consumer regulation described in the social housing white paper, published a year ago.</p>

<p>The document describes the big picture for reshaped consumer regulation as well as outlining progress on the individual areas that deliver it, many of which depend on legislation. <abbr title="Regulator of Social Housing">RSH</abbr> will regulate proactive consumer regulation using the same underlying principles it applies for economic regulation. These are being co-regulatory, proportionate, and risk- and assurance-based in approach as well as focusing on outcomes rather than being prescriptive. <abbr title="Regulator of Social Housing">RSH</abbr> confirms that, in line with the white paper its remit will continue to focus on organisational, rather than individual issues, and sets out high level outcomes it wants proactive consumer regulation to achieve.</p>

<p>In developing revised consumer standards, <abbr title="Regulator of Social Housing">RSH</abbr> wants to build on the best aspects of the existing standards as well as incorporating the new expectations set out in the white paper and matters on which it is directed. It has identified six themes the standards will cover: safety, quality, neighbourhood, transparency, engagement and accountability, and tenancies. Details of the standards are still to be developed and will be subject to full consultation.</p>

<p>To support the new standards, <abbr title="Regulator of Social Housing">RSH</abbr> will design a new approach to proactive consumer regulation – including the role of tools such as consumer regulation inspections and desk-top reviews – and will collect data from new tenant satisfaction measures. Work on the approach to proactive consumer regulation will continue to develop and the document outlines a number of questions still to be explored with landlords, tenants and other stakeholders. The document also describes progress on the tenant satisfaction measures, with a detailed consultation to follow in early December 2021.</p>

<p>Fiona MacGregor, Chief Executive of <abbr title="Regulator of Social Housing">RSH</abbr> said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are pleased to share an overview of our early thinking about how we will reshape consumer regulation and implement the changes set out in the social housing white paper. We look forward to working with social housing tenants, landlords, and other stakeholders as we develop our thinking further.</p>

  <p class="last-child">However, delivering all this will take time. Boards and councillors responsible for social housing should not wait for new consumer regulation to look at how they can improve their landlord services and their engagement with tenants.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Notes to editors</h3>

<p>The Regulator of Social Housing promotes a viable, efficient and well-governed social housing sector able to deliver homes that meet a range of needs. Its role is defined in legislation to have an economic regulation objective relating to private registered providers, and a consumer regulation objective relating to both local authority providers and private registered providers. In line with current legislation, <abbr title="Regulator of Social Housing">RSH</abbr> regulates consumer standards reactively.
