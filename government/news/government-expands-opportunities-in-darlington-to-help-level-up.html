    <p>Recruitment drive in the north east accelerated as more jobs go live at the Darlington Economic Campus</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opportunities will be promoted at Darlington College career fair, as the Government launches ‘Closer to Home’ recruitment campaign</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Latest recruitment drives follow the Chancellor’s first working day at the Darlington Economic Campus on Friday</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Government will this week step up a recruitment drive for roles at the new economic campus in Darlington – as it continues to take action to level up the UK.</p>

<p>A number of new Treasury roles based at the new campus will go live as part of a drive to diversify the way the Government makes policy, broaden access to skills and talent and widen opportunities.</p>

<p>As part of the recruitment drive, a Career Fair will be held at Darlington College on Thursday with senior civil servants from the Treasury, Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and Department for International Trade providing a flavour of what it is like to work in government.</p>

<p>A Government advertising campaign will also begin targeting Wales, Yorkshire and The Humber as well as the North East, with adverts online, in local newspapers as well as outdoors, in places such as gyms, bus shelters and shopping centres.</p>

<p>The ‘Closer to Home campaign’ promotes Civil Service roles moving out of London and closer to communities that will put local people at the heart of Government decision-making, with vacancies available in numerous departments alongside the Treasury including Cabinet Office, Department for International Trade and others.</p>

<h4>The Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is fantastic to see more job opportunities opening up this week at our brand-new Darlington Economic Campus.</p>

  <p>We are giving talented people in the North East the opportunity to work in the heart of government, making decisions on the most important issues for our country.</p>

  <p class="last-child">These are exciting times to be part of the Civil Service. I encourage as many people as possible – from Darlington and the wider region – to go along to the recruitment fair and find out more about joining our growing team.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Steve Barclay, said:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a fantastic and diverse array of talent and skills throughout the UK and it’s important that we get the word out about the opportunities that we’re bringing to local areas.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Through moving roles out of London we are bringing the Civil Service closer to the communities it serves — meaning people across all corners of the country will be at the forefront of decision-making.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Chancellor Rishi Sunak spent the day working at the Darlington Economic Campus on Friday (1 October) where he had lunch with some of the Darlington-based staff and unveiled the new Campus branding.</p>

<p>Announced at the March Budget, between 200-300 Treasury roles will be based at the campus. These will be filled by a mixture of people recruited directly to the campus and some existing staff who relocate.</p>

  <li>It will also include teams from the Department for International Trade, Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities , the Office for National Statistics, and the Department for Education.</li>
