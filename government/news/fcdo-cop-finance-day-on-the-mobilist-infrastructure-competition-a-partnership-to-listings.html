<p>Join senior FCDO officials on Wednesday, 3rd November at 08:15am – 09.00am for a progress report on the competition and to hear directly from the financial institutions participating in the advanced stages.</p>

<p>In <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/fcdo-competition-launched-to-mobile-investment-in-emerging-and-developing-countries">February 2021</a> the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) launched a public competition to engage financial institutions in a search for the best sustainable infrastructure proposals that could list either on the London Stock Exchange or local exchanges.</p>

<p>The UK government now invites the investment and policy communities to a discussions hosted by the FCDO on 3rd November (COP Finance Day) at PwC’s offices in Glasgow, that will showcase the financial institutions participating in the competition.</p>

<p>It is FCDO’s intention to back these proposals at the conclusion of a successful commercial negotiation – as well as future finalists in subsequent competitions.</p>

<p>FCDO will be joined by representatives from the following Competition finalists:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chapel Hill Denham Management Limited (Africa Infrastructure Equity Fund)</li>
  <li>FirstRand Bank Limited and UN Capital Development Fund (Exchange Listed Investment Platform for Sustainable Infrastructure Securitization</li>
  <li>InfraCo Africa and Helios Investment Partners (African Green Infrastructure Fund</li>
  <li>The Development Guarantee Group Limited (The Green Guarantee Company)</li>
  <li>ThomasLloyd Group Limited (ThomasLloyd Energy Impact Trust plc)</li>
</ul>

<p>Developing economies need over $2.5 trillion annually to achieve the Global Goals. In the context of COP Finance Day, the international community also needs to make good on its commitment to mobilise $100 billion of climate finance annually if developing countries are to be supported in their respective net zero pathways.</p>

<p>Mobilising Institutional Capital Through Listed Product Structures (MOBILIST) is FCDO’s flagship programme to mobilise large scale investment flows through public ‘listed’ markets and establish the UK as a global development finance hub. Catalysing new listed products will be transformative in the way development capital is intermediated between emerging, frontier and global markets.</p>

<p>We ask you to join FCDO in this collaboration and hear from us about these future plans.</p>

<p>The Infrastructure Competition is being managed by PwC who will host the event on the 3rd of November 2021, at PwC’s Glasgow office on COP Finance Day.
