<p>Cath Giel, Communications and Stakeholder Relations Director at the LLW Repository Site in Cumbria until her retirement earlier this year, was made a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE).</p>

<p>She is joined by Professor Cherry Tweed, Nuclear Waste Services Chief Scientific Advisor, and June Love, Community Relations Manager at Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd, who have also been awarded MBEs. Both are due to retire this year.</p>

<p>NDA Group Chief Executive David Peattie said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The impact that Cath, Cherry and June have made, both to the nuclear industry and to the communities in which we belong, can’t be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Cumbria and Caithness and North Sutherland are better connected with our sites and are stronger communities because of Cath and June’s contribution. We have also taken significant steps on the journey towards our long-term mission of constructing a Geological Disposal Facility thanks to Cherry’s significant expertise and involvement in that important programme.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I’m sure everyone in the NDA group will join me in congratulating them and agreeing that this is well-earned recognition for their many years of service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cath Giel said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I’ve been blown away by this tremendous recognition and feel grateful that I’ve had the support of those around me, both professionally and from the community, which has played a huge part in the many great achievements I’ve been involved in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>June Love added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I was delighted to receive this honour and have been so humbled by all the messages and kind words received since it was announced. I feel privileged that I’ve received this award for contributions during my career.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cherry Tweed said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This is an incredible honour and came completely out of the blue. It’s also a tribute to the committed and dedicated NWS team who support the UK’s geological disposal programme.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Magnox Ltd and Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd Chair Lawrie Haynes was also recognised in the list. He has been made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his voluntary service, supporting RAF personnel and veterans.</p>
