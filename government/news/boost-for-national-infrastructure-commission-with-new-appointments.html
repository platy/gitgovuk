<p>Nicholas Winser CBE, Kate Willard OBE and Jim Hall will strengthen infrastructure, energy and environment expertise as new Commissioners at the NIC, which was established in 2017 to provide impartial, expert advice to government on major long-term economic infrastructure challenges.</p>

<p>The Commission carries out in-depth studies into the UK’s major infrastructure needs – covering transport, energy, water, flood protection, waste and digital infrastructure - and makes recommendations to the government. 
Alongside these appointments, Neale Coleman CBE, Julia Prescot, and Andy Green CBE have been reappointed as Commissioners for further five-year terms.</p>

<h4>The Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, Helen Whately, said:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>The National Infrastructure Commission plays an invaluable role providing expert and impartial advice to the government on the UK’s long-term infrastructure challenges.</p>

  <p class="last-child">These appointments bring extensive expertise to advise the Government as we boost the economy, level up opportunities, and transition to net zero.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Chair of the Commission, Sir John Armitt, said:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am pleased to welcome Nick, Kate and Jim to the Commission at a critical time for ensuring long term infrastructure policy helps address some of society’s biggest challenges. Their expertise will be particularly useful as we work towards publication of the second National Infrastructure Assessment next year.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I would also like to pay tribute to David Fisk as he steps down from the Commission. David has helped us chart the steps necessary to deliver a low carbon future for energy and the interventions needed to safeguard the resilience of vital services upon which we all rely. We wish David all the best for his future work in infrastructure and beyond.</p>
</blockquote>
