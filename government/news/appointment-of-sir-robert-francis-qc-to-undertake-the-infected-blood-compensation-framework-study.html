<p>The Paymaster General is pleased to announce the appointment of Sir Robert Francis QC to carry out a study which will look at options for a framework for compensation, and to report back to the Paymaster General with recommendations, before the independent Infected Blood Inquiry reports.  The terms of reference of this study will be finalised following consultation between Sir Robert and those infected and affected.  Further details will be announced shortly.</p>

<p>The study shall provide the Paymaster General with advice on potential options for compensation framework design and solutions for consideration on publication of the inquiry’s report.</p>

<h4>The Paymaster General said:</h4>

<p>“Sir Robert will be carrying out this study to provide the Government with advice and recommendations on a potential compensation framework. Sir Robert brings his vast legal expertise - including his background and experience in medical ethics and clinical negligence work. He also has experience of chairing public inquiries into issues involving medical negligence. Sir Robert will bring the integrity and thoughtful consideration this review requires.”</p>

<h4>Sir Robert said:</h4>

<p>“I feel privileged to be asked to undertake this review to advise on options for a compensation framework for those who have suffered so grievously from being given defective blood products.  I look forward to finding out what those most closely affected need and what the options might be for a fair and effective compensation scheme.”</p>
