    <p>China is the UK’s third-largest export market and the world’s second-largest and fastest-growing major economy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <a rel="external" href="https://digitalandtechchina.campaign.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">government website</a> has been developed in response to demand from tech sector looking for guidance around opportunities in China</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Government has published guidance to help cutting-edge UK firms negotiate the ethical, legal and commercial questions they may encounter in China or when working with Chinese businesses.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://digitalandtechchina.campaign.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">guidance</a> sets out key issues digital and tech SMEs should consider as they weigh the benefits and risks of commercial ventures, as well as signposting specialist sources of advice.</p>

<p>The site, which has been developed in response to demand from the sector, will support safe and appropriate UK-China collaboration in digital and tech.</p>

<p>The Government recognises that for many UK businesses, working with world-leading Chinese firms at the cutting edge of innovation is not just about the lucrative market China offers, but is also critical to remaining globally competitive in the future.</p>

<p>The UK’s AI Unicorns - including Improbable and Blue Prism - have launched in China and more leading companies are likely to follow.</p>

<p>China is the UK’s third-largest export market and the world’s second-largest and fastest-growing major economy.
But this must be done safely and in a way that reflects the UK’s values and takes account of national security concerns.</p>

<p>The Government’s guidance will help SMEs to make a success of business ventures linked to China, to choose the right partners and to manage risk by taking appropriate steps.</p>

<p>It complements <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/liz-truss-launches-future-trade-strategy-for-uk-tech-industry" class="govuk-link">measures announced</a> in June to support UK tech companies to seize trade and investment opportunities overseas.</p>

<p>These included a new Digital Trade Network for Asia-Pacific, which will support UK SMEs to break into the Asian market, and a new Tech Exporting Academy to provide expert advice to UK scaleups on subject areas essential to expansion, including regulation, intellectual property, and compliance.</p>

<p>Minister for Digital and Culture Caroline Dinenage said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The latest statistics show UK-China bilateral trade has exceeded the £70 billion mark for the first time and our digital tech sector is the fifth biggest exporter of services in the world.</p>

  <p>But we recognise the ethical, legal and commercial questions businesses face when they work in China or with Chinese businesses.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The UK is determined to support our businesses to engage with China in a way that reflects the UK’s values and takes account of national security concerns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Julian David, CEO, techUK, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At techUK, we recognize the massive opportunity that China presents for the UK’s digital and tech businesses as well as challenges that firms face when navigating each other’s unique marketplaces.</p>

  <p>To be successful and protect their operations, digital and tech businesses need to know the challenges and take the right steps to navigate them.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We welcome the Government’s launch of the bespoke guidance to SMEs and we look forward to working together to help digital and tech SMEs to grow safely and successfully in China.</p>
</blockquote>
