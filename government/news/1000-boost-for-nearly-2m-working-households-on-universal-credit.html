          <p>The Department for Work and Pensions has worked around the clock to implement a reduction to the Universal Credit taper rate as well as an increase to claimants’ work allowances, effectively giving the lowest paid workers on Universal Credit a tax cut worth £2.2 billion, one week ahead of the schedule announced by the Chancellor in his recent Budget.</p>

<p>By bringing in the change a week earlier than planned, up to 500,000 more people could benefit before&nbsp;Christmas with almost two million of the lowest paid in-work claimants overall being better off by around £1,000 a year on average.</p>

<p>Claimants will be notified how much Universal Credit they will be awarded in their usual monthly statement, with the first of those to reflect the changes being issued today.</p>

<p>Work and Pensions Secretary Thérèse Coffey said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From today, two million people will see their income boosted by £1,000 per year, on average, as we bring in an effective tax cut worth £2.2billion for the lowest paid.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We are making the change earlier than planned which means up to 500,000 more households can benefit before Christmas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rishi Sunak, Chancellor of the Exchequer said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We want this to be a country that rewards hard work by helping the lowest income families keep more of their hard-earned cash.</p>

  <p class="last-child">That’s why at Budget, I announced an effective tax cut for 2 million people worth over £2 billion. These changes come into force today and will mean that with Christmas approaching, hard-working families keeping an extra £1,000 a year of what they earn.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Work allowances, the amount a claimant can earn before their Universal Credit is reduced, will increase by £500 per year from today meaning many families will be able to earn over £500 per month before their benefits are tapered off.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, the taper rate, the amount that a person’s Universal Credit is reduced by when their earnings are more than their work allowance, will drop from 63% to 55%.</p>

<p>With a number of people expected to now be newly eligible for Universal Credit and those not currently claiming potentially being better off, people are being urged to check a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/benefits-calculators">benefit calculator</a> on the government’s website gov.uk to see if they could increase their income.</p>

<p>Those receiving other benefits from the government including Working Tax Credits should note that if they apply for Universal Credit they cannot return to their previous benefits.</p>

<p>For those not in work, they will continue to benefit from Universal Credit standard allowance and additional extra support if they have children, have a disability or health condition which prevents them from working or need help paying their rent.</p>

<p>Vulnerable households across the country are also able to access a new £500 million support fund to help them with essentials over the coming months as the country continues its recovery from the pandemic. The devolved administrations will receive almost £80 million of the £500 million (£41 million for the Scottish Government, £25 million for the Welsh Government and £14 million for the NI Executive).</p>
