<h3>Alain Clapham</h3>

Marvel-mastermind Stan Lee, and shared his story on the TED stage. An experienced
educator and creative producer, he is now a lead facilitator for YouTube - empowering
thousands of young people to better navigate the digital landscape – while also helping
award-winning CEOs discover their own stories of transformation.</p>

<p>He has consulted for Wellcome Collection, Historic Royal Palaces and the Department for
Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and is the driving force behind BMT – an immersive live and online platform celebrating the ‘awesome everyday stories of black men and women’. Alain takes on all challenges with irrepressible energy, curiosity and a desire to get to the heart of the matter.</p>

<p>In this post-pandemic world, Alain has become a highly sought-after facilitator and host
capable of harnessing the power of Transformative Storytelling to bring local, corporate and
cultural communities together. Through his expertise and guidance, he helps to find and

Moving to documentaries he made a wide range of science and history programmes working with museums and heritage organisations around the world.</p>

<p>He used his experience as a journalist and historical knowledge to create independent, fresh narratives. Since leaving the BBC he has made a series on the role of the Queen in our national life. His most recent work ‘World War II Battles in Color’ launched last month on the Smithsonian Channel. It uses soldiers’ personal film archive and testimony to give a fresh take on six decisive battles. The episode on the 1944 Battle of the Bulge highlights the role soldiers from diverse backgrounds played in delivering an Allied victory.</p>

<p>In the House of Lords he speaks on the media and digital issues amongst other matters. Most recently he supported amendments in the Environment Bill to reduce plastic pollution. As a member of cross-party Communications and Digital Select Committee he has taken part in inquiries on digital regulation and UK public service broadcasting.
