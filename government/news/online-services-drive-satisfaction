<p>DVLA and the National Franchised Dealers Association (NFDA) are highlighting to motor dealers how DVLA’s online services can help increase customer satisfaction, following new research published 9 December by DVLA.</p>

<p>A recent survey commissioned by DVLA showed that 97% of those asked would recommend DVLA’s online services. The most popular reason to transact online was convenience (86%), followed by speed (82%). DVLA’s research also showed that 9 out of 10 motorists asked said the dealer took care of the administration at the point they purchased the vehicle.  Over half of motorists (52%) also said that they would be more likely to sell their vehicle to a dealer who completed the admin for them.</p>

<p>The quickest and simplest way to tell DVLA that a vehicle has been bought into trade, sold into trade or sold to a customer will always be via <a href="https://www.gov.uk/sold-bought-vehicle" class="govuk-link">DVLA’s online service</a>.  Customers will receive instant confirmation that they are no longer the keeper, and an automatic refund of any full months of vehicle tax remaining. Those purchasing a vehicle will receive their new log book (V5C) within 5 working days.</p>

<p>As well as increased customer satisfaction levels, dealers also benefit from reduced administration time, no postage costs and a clearer audit trail for date of keepership changes.</p>

<p>With over half of those motorists asked (51%) saying they part exchanged when buying a vehicle, DVLA’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-log-book" class="govuk-link">latest online service to request a duplicate V5C log book</a> slashes the time it takes to receive this from 6 weeks to just 5 days, making this the perfect tool for those seeking to avoid hold-ups where the vehicle’s log book has been lost or damaged.</p>

<p>DVLA Chief Executive Julie Lennard said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DVLA’s online services will always be the quickest and simplest way for customers to deal with us, and millions of motorists already use these. The research shows that motorists value the support dealers offer with the administration, and customer satisfaction is so important in this industry that we are keen to show dealers the benefits of our online services.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Businesses and motorists can save time and money by going online when they need to make an application or tell us that a vehicle has changed hands - at the time and place that suits them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sue Robinson, Chief Executive, the National Franchised Dealers Association (NFDA) said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We are aware that many franchised dealers already embrace the benefits of DVLA’s online services. These services are quick, efficient and easy-to-use and, as a result, a great driver for those seeking to increase customer satisfaction and repeat business by excelling in the customer service they offer. We encourage franchised dealers to continue to highlight to their customers the benefits of using DVLA’s online services.</p>
