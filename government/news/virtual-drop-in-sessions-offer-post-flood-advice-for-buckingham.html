<p>The Environment Agency is inviting people living in Buckingham to two virtual drop in surgeries on Thursday 10 June to discuss the winter 2020/21 flooding.</p>

<p>Anyone who has been affected by or has concerns about the winter flooding is welcome to attend and share their experiences with Environment Agency officers.</p>

<p>The 2 sessions are at 1:00pm and 6:30pm, and will include short presentations plus a live question and answer session.</p>

<p>The 2 hour sessions will be hosted on Zoom and include information about the winter flooding, the flood warning service, how rivers are maintained and operated, and what residents and the community can do to become more flood resilient.</p>

<p>Tamsyn Ellway, Flood Resilience Advisor, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We canâ€™t stop flooding, but we work to limit the impact from main rivers and we help communities to prepare along with our partners. These surgeries are an excellent opportunity for residents to share their concerns and discuss flooding issues with the Environment Agency.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We want to understand the extent of flooding in Buckingham, gather views and evidence for subsequent investigations.  Under normal circumstances, we would have gathered this information in person but we have been unable to do this. Understanding flood risk at a local level and taking appropriate action can help communities become more flood resilient.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Take part</h2>
<p>Residents can join the Zoom session by using this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://bit.ly/3eIXkED" rel="external">link</a> and entering the passcode 072814.</p>

<p>Zoom is an online audio and web conferencing platform. If anyone needs help with accessing Zoom, or has any questions relating to these virtual sessions, please email us at <a href="mailto:flood.resilience.eastanglia.cb@environment-agency.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">flood.resilience.eastanglia.cb@environment-agency.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Further information</h2>

<h3>December 2020 flooding</h3>

<p>In December 2020, East Anglia received an exceptionally high amount of rain with a total averaged rainfall of 108 millimetres, which was 195% of the monthly average.</p>

<p>Up to 55 millimetres rain fell in less than 24 hours between 23 and 24 December 2020. Falling on an already wet catchment this intense rainfall led to widespread flooding across the River Great Ouse, through Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and parts of Suffolk.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency issued 27 flood alerts, 41 flood warnings and a severe flood warning between 23 and 24 December. Over 30 communities recorded property flooding resulting from either surface water or rivers, with at least 567 properties being affected to some degree.</p>

<p>A flood warning was issued in Buckingham on 23 December on the River Great Ouse. At least 30 properties flooded as a result of a combination of river and surface water flooding overwhelming roads, rivers and gullies in the area.</p>

<h2>What has happened since the flooding?</h2>

<p>The Environment Agency has worked with communities affected by the flooding and its professional partners on the Local Resilience Forum (LRF) including the police, fire and rescue service, local authorities and others to understand the full extent of the flooding.</p>

<p>As part of working more closely with a strengthened Flood Group for Buckingham we will be able to discuss future needs and explain maintenance plans.</p>

<h2>Sign up for flood warnings</h2>

<p>Residents and businesses in flood-risk areas are encouraged to sign up to our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/environment-countryside/flooding-extreme-weather">flood warning service</a> or phone Floodline on 0345 988 1188.</p>
