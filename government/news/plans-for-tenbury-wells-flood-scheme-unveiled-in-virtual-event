    <p>Construction of the scheme is due to start in March 2022 and aims to reduce the risk of flood to Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire, benefitting approximately 120 residential and 145 commercial properties.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Visitors have until 31 January 2021 to explore the virtual room and find out about the history, options reviewed and current proposals of the scheme, and provide feedback.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The much needed flood defence scheme for Tenbury Wells will see a mix of new flood walls and embankments to reduce flood risk to 120 residential and 145 commercial properties, after the Government announced funding for the scheme in July.</p>

<p>The online engagement room has been developed during the current coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions to provide the local community with all of the information that a face-to-face meeting would offer. It will also allow them to provide their feedback on the scheme.</p>

<p>Information is displayed on notice boards in a virtual online room and a video provides an introduction to the scheme, ahead of construction which is due to start in March 2022. Ground investigation and site survey work is due to start in early 2021.</p>

<p>Information boards will also be displayed in a number of locations within the town itself, to allow those without internet access the opportunity to get involved.</p>

<p>Dave Edwards, Flood Risk Management Team Leader for the Environment Agency said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have launched our virtual engagement room to provide the local community with more information about the proposed Tenbury Wells flood risk management scheme.</p>

  <p>As current coronavirus restrictions have not allowed us to hold a face-to-face event, we hope that by visiting the virtual event, local residents and commercial users will receive a similar experience.</p>

  <p>And, because the virtual engagement room will be available until the end of January, it provides an opportunity for more people to attend.</p>

  <p class="last-child">As well as finding out more about the current proposals for the scheme, there is also an opportunity for visitors to provide feedback through the virtual room and we are looking forward to receiving their comments.</p>

<h3 id="notes-to-editors">Notes to editors</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Tenbury Wells lies within the flood plain of the River Teme and Kyre Brook. Tenbury has suffered from extensive flooding to large parts of the town on a number of occasions, most recently in November 2019 and in February 2020, when levels were just below those which occurred in 2007.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the February floods, the Government committed an additional £4.9 million towards a scheme for Tenbury. This funding has allowed the Environment Agency to progress plans for the Tenbury Wells project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Facilitated phone calls will also be available in January 2021. These will be group phone calls that can be accessed by telephone, or through online connections. Further details will be available on the following link: <a rel="external" href="https://consult.environment-agency.gov.uk/west-midlands/tenbury-wells-flood-risk-management-scheme">https://consult.environment-agency.gov.uk/west-midlands/tenbury-wells-flood-risk-management-scheme</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To check if your property, business, or place of work is within the new warning area, visit <a rel="external" href="https://gov.uk/check-flood-risk">https://gov.uk/check-flood-risk</a> or call Floodline on 0345 988 1188.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 2015, we have been investing £2.6bn to better protect the country from flooding and coastal erosion. We are on course to have better protected 300,000 homes by March 2021.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier this year the Government announced a record £5.2 billion investment in flood and coastal defences – double the previous investment – to build around 2,000 new flood and coastal defences and better protect 336,000 properties.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In July, the Government announced an additional £170m to accelerate the construction of flood defence projects in 2020 and 2021, where they would drive growth and benefit local economies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Environment Agency has also published its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-blueprint-to-protect-and-prepare-nation-from-flooding">Flood and Coast Erosion Risk Management Strategy</a>, a blueprint setting out how it will work with communities to deliver the government’s plan.</p>
