<p>Home Secretary Sajid Javid has today (Wednesday 10 April 2019) announced that 57 organisations across the UK will receive funding to provide practical support to vulnerable or at-risk people applying to the EU Settlement Scheme.</p>

<p>The Home Office has made up to £9 million available in funding which will be used to help organisations both inform vulnerable individuals about the need to apply for settled status and support them to complete their applications to protect their status as the UK exits the EU.</p>

<p>The successful organisations, including disability and homeless charities and a wide-range of community organisations will provide support to an estimated 200,000 people, who may be marginalised or in need of extra help.</p>

<p>The funding comes as the Home Office confirmed it had now received more than 400,000 applications to the EU Settlement Scheme.</p>

<p>Home Secretary Sajid Javid said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>EU citizens have contributed so much to this country and we want them all to stay. That’s why we have made the EU Settlement Scheme free and simple to use.</p>

  <p>It’s vital no one is left behind and we support vulnerable people who may have difficulties applying.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This £9million of funding will help do that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those who may require additional support include victims of human trafficking or domestic abuse, those with severe mental health conditions, those without a permanent address, and those who are elderly and isolated.</p>

<p>Over the last year, officials have met with experts from more than 200 community groups, voluntary sector bodies and businesses nationwide that have strong local links with vulnerable EU citizens to inform them about the EU Settlement Scheme and to make sure that we reach everyone.</p>

<p>Additional support is also available to those EU citizens in the UK who do not have the appropriate access, skills or confidence to apply. This includes <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eu-settlement-scheme-assisted-digital-service">over 200 assisted digital locations across the UK</a> where applicants can be supported through their application.</p>

<p>The EU Settlement Scheme is designed to make it straightforward for EU citizens and their family members to stay after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>They only need to complete 3 key steps - prove their identity, show that they live in the UK, and declare any criminal convictions. Deal or no deal, EU citizens will have until at least 31 December 2020 to apply.</p>

<p>Full details of all the organisations receiving funding will be published on GOV.UK in due course.</p>

<p>The Home Office will be publishing a full report on the public beta test phase shortly. Further information will be published in statistical updates and a more detailed quarterly official statistics publication from August 2019.</p>
