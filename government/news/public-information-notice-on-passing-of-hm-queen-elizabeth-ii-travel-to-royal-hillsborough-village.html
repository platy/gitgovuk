  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Please be aware that only floral tributes will be allowed to be laid in the dedicated area at Hillsborough Castle. On arrival at the Eikon Centre, all floral tributes will undergo a full security search, and any cellophane wrapping will be removed and disposed of at the Eikon Centre to avoid a fire risk.&nbsp; Notes will also be removed and preserved by the NIO at Eikon Centre for onward transmission to Buckingham Palace.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other ‘artefacts’ (i.e. items other than flowers, such as teddy bears) are not allowed to be laid, and will also be removed and stored at the Eikon Centre.&nbsp; Items such as soft toys will be donated by the NIO to local hospitals.</p>

<h2>Q&amp;A</h2>

<h3>When is Hillsborough Castle and Eikon open?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The area for floral tributes at Hillsborough Castle will be open from Saturday 10 September: a free and frequent shuttle bus service will be in operation from the Eikon Centre Park &amp; Ride facility to / from Hillsborough Castle. Information on bus timetables is available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.translink.co.uk/royal" rel="external">Translink’s Website</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is there?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Ample parking</li>
  <li>Toilets</li>
  <li>Refreshments</li>
</ul>

<h3>Where is the Eikon Centre?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The Eikon Centre is close to the M1 and only 10 minutes from Royal Hillsborough.</li>
  <li>Yellow signs will direct you to the Hillsborough Park &amp; Ride. You will be directed as follows, if approaching from:
    <ul>
      <li>The South (A1): Stay on the A1 past Royal Hillsborough Village and turn left onto Harrys Road</li>
      <li>The East (M1): Leave the M1 at junction 7 onto the Blaris Road</li>
      <li>The West (M1): Leave the M1 at junction 9 onto the A3 and turn South on the Halftown Road</li>
      <li>The North (A26): At the junction with the M1 and A3, turn East onto the the A3 and turn South on the Halftown Road</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How do I get there by public transport?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A shuttle bus will run from Lisburn rail station to and from the Eikon Centre</li>
  <li>Public buses will still run through Royal Hillsborough, but you will not be able to access the Castle other than via the Eikon Centre. You will be able to hand floral tributes to staff to lay on your behalf.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why is there a security check?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>As you are aware, Hillsborough Castle is a secure venue and for this reason it will be necessary for everyone coming on site to undergo a short security check before boarding the buses at the Eikon Centre as well as a further check before entering Hillsborough Castle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All cellophane on floral tributes will be removed during this security check.&nbsp; No other tributes will be allowed at the Hillsborough Castle site, and guests are requested to refrain from bringing any other objects or tributes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To facilitate a speedy security check, guests are requested not to bring large bags or holdalls.&nbsp; There will be no storage facility in the Eikon Centre for luggage.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>I am attending the ceremonial events, do I need to travel via the Eikon Centre?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Yes. Guests for ceremonial events in Royal Hillsborough and Belfast also be asked to travel to the Eikon Centre.</li>
  <li>Guests will be handled separately to members of the public seeking to lay floral tributes. You should have received information about travel from the Northern Ireland Office alongside notification of your attendance at the event(s).</li>
</ul>

<h3>I live in Hillsborough, do I need to travel to Eikon?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Local residents and business owners within Royal Hillsborough Village should receive a leaflet from Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council regarding the special arrangements in operation during the national period of mourning. If you have not received this, please contact the Community Assistance Centre on 028 9244 7999 for further information and support.</li>
</ul>

<h3>I just want to lay flowers, do I really need to go to Eikon?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Hillsborough Castle is only accessible to the general public (aside from local residents and business owners) during the national period of mourning via the Park &amp; Ride facility at the Eikon Centre.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Flowers may be handed to staff outside Hillsborough Castle; any other material (such as wrappings and other tributes) will be removed and the flowers will be laid in the dedicated area.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
