<p>The funding will support a diverse range of projects over the next two years including helping women at risk of homelessness or modern slavery to programmes that address problem gambling and violence against women. The money has been awarded to larger projects with around £7.5 million given to four projects making onward grants to small and medium sized organisations across the UK.</p>

<p>Minister for Civil Society Mims Davies said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is absolutely right we invest money from sanitary products in projects to give more women and girls the help >and support they need to address difficult challenges they face in our society.</p>

  <p>This important funding will help thousands more vulnerable women of all ages across our communities.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It will provide more of the opportunities they need to rebuild their lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Over 70 charities have received grants from the Tampon Tax Fund, with £47 million allocated since the Autumn Statement in 2015. This additional £15 million brings the total to £62 million.</p>
