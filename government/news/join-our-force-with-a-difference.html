<h3>We value difference in our force with a difference</h3>

<p>We know that a diverse workforce is essential to a strong future for the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr>, and we’re keen to encourage applications from candidates who may have never considered a career in armed policing before.</p>

<p>To join the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr> you do not need any previous experience in policing or firearms. We’re more interested in personal qualities, and we welcome people from a range of backgrounds and experiences, with some new recruits that join us having recently left education and others changing their career later in life.</p>

<p>Representation within our workforce of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic communities, women, and LGBT+ people is currently lower than we would like it to be. This is something that we want to change for the benefit of the communities we serve, and for the growth of our organisation.</p>

<p>Our people are our greatest asset and we’re committed to supporting everyone in an inclusive environment where people can bring their true selves to work, with a culture that respects, values and celebrates all our differences.</p>

<p>We want everyone who works with us to feel proud to be themselves. Different ways of thinking and different life experiences, be those in relation to age, personality, cultural background, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, education or faith (to name but a few), are important to enable us to develop and enrich our work – both in policing and in nurturing talent in our <abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr> family, so that everyone can be the best they can be.</p>

<p>Staff networks play an important part in supporting an inclusive culture in the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr>. Our Gender, REACH (Race, Ethnicity and Cultural Heritage), LGBT+ and Disability and Wellbeing networks work closely with our Diversity and Inclusion team, to support staff and make sure that their voices are heard. This work includes providing advice and support throughout the recruitment process for those underrepresented in our organisation.</p>

<p>To find out more: visit our <a href="https://www.mod.police.uk/diversity-and-inclusion/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Diversity and inclusion page</a> or email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:MDP-PositiveActionGMB@mod.gov.uk"><abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr>-PositiveActionGMB@mod.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Interested in joining us? Visit www.mod.police.uk and <a href="https://www.mod.police.uk/new-recruits/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Apply Now</a>.</p>
