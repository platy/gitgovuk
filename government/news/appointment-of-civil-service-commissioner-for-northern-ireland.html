<h2>NOTES FOR EDITORS</h2>

<h3>The Civil Service Commissioners for Northern Ireland</h3>
<p>The Civil Service Commissioners for Northern Ireland are independent of Government and the Northern Ireland Civil Service, and have a statutory responsibility to uphold selection on merit for appointments to the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS). The Commissioners also hear appeals under the NICS Code of Ethics.  Commissioners work in partnership with the NICS and other stakeholders to uphold the merit principle and promote public confidence in recruitment.</p>

<h3>Terms of appointment</h3>
<p>The position attracts a remuneration of £300 per day and is not pensionable.</p>

<h3>Political Activity</h3>
<p>All appointments are made on merit and political activity plays no part in the selection process. However, in accordance with the original Nolan recommendations, there is a requirement for appointees’ political activity in defined categories within the last five years to be made public.</p>

<p>The appointee has declared no such political activity in the past five years.</p>

<h3>Regulation</h3>
