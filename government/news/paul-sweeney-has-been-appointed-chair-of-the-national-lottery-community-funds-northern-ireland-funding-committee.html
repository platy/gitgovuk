<p>In his early career Paul worked in the voluntary and community sector in Northern Ireland.  From 1987 to 1994 he was the Director of an independent charitable trust (NIVT), which funded community-based self-help initiatives.
He joined the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS) in 1994, initially on secondment, as an adviser on community development and reconciliation.  Throughout his subsequent career in the NICS he has held a number of senior positions - Deputy Secretary in the Department for Regional Development (1999-2002); Deputy Secretary in the Office of the First and deputy First Minister (2002-2006); Permanent Secretary in the Department for Culture, Arts and Leisure (2006-2010); and Permanent Secretary in the Department of Education (2010-2017).</p>

<p>Since retiring from the NICS in 2017 Paul has undertaken a trustee role in a number of non-for-profit organisations involved in regeneration, culture and young people. In his career, Paul has been privileged to witness the determination of individuals, neighbourhoods and local agencies to improve the quality of life in some of the most disadvantaged communities of Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>This role is remunerated at £24,000 per annum. The role is not pensionable. Expenses will be paid. This appointment has been made in accordance with the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/578498/governance_code_on_public_appointments_16_12_2016.pdf">Cabinet Office’s Governance Code on Public Appointments</a>. The process is regulated by the Commissioner for Public Appointments. The Government’s Governance Code requires that any significant political activity undertaken by an appointee in the last five years is declared. This is defined as including holding office, public speaking, making a recordable donation or candidature for election. Paul has not declared any activity.</p>
