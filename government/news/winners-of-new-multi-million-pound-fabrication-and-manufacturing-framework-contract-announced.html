<p>The Programme and Project Partners has appointed its first Goods/Services Agreement Framework suppliers.</p>

<p>The Programme and Project Partners has appointed the following suppliers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NIS Ltd</li>
  <li>Hyde Group</li>
  <li>Ansaldo Nuclear</li>
  <li>James Fisher Nuclear</li>
  <li>Carr’s Group</li>
  <li>West Cumberland Engineering</li>
  <li>NWEC Alliance</li>
</ul>

<p>These suppliers will deliver fabricated and manufactured equipment packages for the projects, a framework agreement for an initial 3 years, worth up to £20 million.</p>

<p>The fabrication and manufactured equipment package is the first Good/Services Agreement (GSA) to be awarded by the partners as part of a major framework spanning the next 18 years. Items and equipment to be provided include process cabinets, encast Items, bogies and rail systems.</p>

<p>It has been procured under a new multi project procurement (MPP) model which encourages long-term collaboration throughout the supply chain, enhanced project delivery, and paves the way for greater economic and social impact in the West Cumbria region.</p>

<p>The MPP model will see the appointment of key delivery partners and GSA Framework suppliers to deliver work packages covering everything from electrical and instrumentation and fabrication and manufacturing to groundworks and general civils.</p>

<p>Tom Wiseman, GSA framework manager, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Programme and Project Partners has undertaken a rigorous selection process over the last 12 months in order to reach this position.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I’m delighted to work alongside all of the successful suppliers for the next 3 years and am confident that they will all deliver the benefits for the projects that this framework has been established to do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NIS managing director Steve Rothwell said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NIS have been supporting the delivery of Sellafield major projects for over 3 decades, so we are thrilled with this latest award which perfectly compliments our growing Programme and Project Partners portfolio.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We look forward to playing our part in the successful delivery of this framework and strengthening our collaboration with the partnership and the other framework partners.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Will Pearson, business development director at Hyde Group Nuclear, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hyde Group Nuclear Limited is pleased to have been selected as a supplier to the Programme and Project Partners Manufacturing and Fabrication Framework.</p>

  <p>This framework provides a commercial route through which we can provide the capability and capacity of the Hyde group of companies in support of the partnerships mission.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The Hyde Group provide a broad range of engineering and manufacturing services from our 20 facilities in Manchester, and we look forward to working with the partners to deliver the major programmes of work at Sellafield, whilst also bringing benefits to our wider community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Andrea Basso, managing director of Ansaldo Nuclear Limited, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ansaldo is extremely pleased to secure a position on the Fabrication and Manufactured Equipment Framework.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This endorsement by the Programme and Project Partners provides an excellent opportunity for Ansaldo to continue its successful relationship with Sellafield and to further develop its Cumbrian presence and supply chain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Steve Tulk, sales director at James Fisher Nuclear Ltd, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>James Fisher Nuclear has been a long-term supporter of the Sellafield decommissioning programme as part of a concerted effort to clean up the legacy of our nuclear heritage.</p>

  <p>We are pleased to be part of this important exciting new and collaborative framework. This achievement is a real testament to the hard work of the entire James Fisher Nuclear team and an endorsement of our shared history of innovation and collaboration on site at Sellafield.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We look forward to working with our framework partners to drive forward project delivery and support the partnership and Sellafield Ltd to achieve increased certainty in delivery to its customer the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ben Gilbert, technical proposals manager, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Carr’s Engineering Group are proud of to be a member of the GSA Framework; we look forward to strengthening our relationship with the MPP Framework team and the wider Programme and Project Partners.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We believe the partnership provides a strong, transparent and collaborative structure between Sellafield, the lot partners and their suppliers which will help Sellafield to achieve their goals as well as benefiting local businesses and communities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Graeme Phillips, managing director at West Cumberland Engineering Ltd, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m delighted to announce that West Cumberland Engineering Ltd have won a position on the Programme and Project Partners GSA Fabrication and Manufactured Equipment Framework over the next 3 + 1 years with a potential value of £20,000,000.</p>

  <p>We are proud to build on our existing relationship with the partnership having already supplied Sellafield Continuity Plant phase 1 and 2 wall boxes/encast items and in the process of completing 23 high integrity vessels also for the project.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This long term fabricated and manufactured equipment contract will enable us to offer enhanced employment opportunities within West Cumbria and provide long term investment in people and facilities in an area of the country that has recently been decimated with industrial closures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>McMenon chief executive officer Anand Puthran and chief operating officer Shiby Bernard said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are delighted with the news and excited at the prospect of becoming one of the main Cumbrian small and medium-sized enterprise suppliers to the nuclear industry. McMenon’s Workington facility has a 75-year engineering and manufacturing heritage with exports to over 50 countries.</p>

  <p>When we acquired the business from a global corporation in 2018, we promised our Cumbrian workforce that our future growth would include diversification into nuclear and renewable sectors.</p>

  <p>Now being included as a delivery partner in the Programme and Project Partners framework is a major step in fulfilling that promise to our people.</p>

  <p class="last-child">And it gives us even more satisfaction to envisage the success of the North West Energy Coast (NWEC) Alliance culminating in increased job opportunities within the alliance and our supply partners in Cumbria.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Joint owners of TIS Cumbria Tony O’Pray and John Bragg said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are delighted that the NWEC Alliance has been successfully named as a key delivery partner on the Programme and Project Partners framework at Sellafield for the next 3 years.</p>

  <p>The commitment of the alliance between TIS Cumbria and McMenon Engineering over many years has matured, enabling our 2 West Cumbrian small and medium-size enterprises to sit equally beside our elite Tier 2 manufacturers in the UK.</p>

  <p>We would like to thank the partnership project team for their confidence in recognising the capabilities of our West Cumbrian alliance and we hope this success will be reflected out into the local community.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Programme and Project Partners will work closely with all key delivery partners and GSA Framework suppliers to deliver its ambition to create a clean and safe environment at the Sellafield site for future generations, improve sustainability and better outcomes for the local economy and communities.</p>
