<p>Ofsted is seeking views on proposals for a more effective and proportionate approach to inspecting the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (<abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr>).</p>

<p>Launched today, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/future-inspection-of-cafcass-from-2021" class="govuk-link">consultation</a> seeks a range of views from those working with children and families in the family courts.</p>

<p>If implemented, the new approach will align <abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr> inspections with Ofsted’s other inspections of children’s social care. It will maintain a high bar, while introducing more proportionate inspection in response to <abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr>’s continued good performance.</p>

<p>The proposed new framework will create a ‘whole-system’ approach of shorter inspections, with more regular contact in-between. More frequent engagement will help Ofsted to build a better picture of <abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr>’s practice.</p>

<p>The proposals in today’s consultation include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a 3-yearly national judgement inspection  </li>
  <li>focused visits between judgement inspections, or inclusion in joint targeted area inspections</li>
  <li>annual sharing of a self-evaluation of frontline practice in both public and private law  </li>
  <li>an annual engagement meeting between Ofsted and the <abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr> chief executive and senior leadership team</li>
</ul>

<p>Three-yearly inspection of the national organisation will continue, but in light of <abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr>’s history of positive inspection outcomes, the inspection will be shorter than it is currently. If <abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr>’s performance drops below the level of good, Ofsted will have the flexibility to extend the inspection. </p>

<p>At the 3-yearly inspection, Ofsted proposes to make judgements on the quality and effectiveness of <abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr>’s private law and public law practice, and on the impact that its leaders have on practice with children and families.</p>

<p>While individual service areas (<abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr>’s operational units) will no longer receive a graded judgement, inspectors will feed back to each area on its key strengths and areas for improvement at the end of each visit.</p>

<p>The consultation will close on 11 November and the proposed new framework will take effect from February 2021. </p>

<p>Yvette Stanley, Ofsted’s National Director for Regulation and Social Care said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr> has a hugely important role in providing expert social work advice to the family court. I urge anyone working with children and families in the family justice system to give us their views on these proposals.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The family courts can be a frightening and confusing experience, so good-quality, thoughtful work with children and families is vital. Our proposals retain all the rigour of previous inspections but will be more proportionate, with a greater focus on organisational culture and direct work with children and families.</p>
