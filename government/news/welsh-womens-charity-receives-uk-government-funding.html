<p>Welsh Women’s Aid ‘Sector Strength Cymru’ is among 14 women and girls’ charities confirmed to receive a share of the final round of the Government’s £11.25 million Tampon Tax Fund.</p>

<p>The UK-wide grants generated from the VAT on period products, will be directly invested in vital projects tackling issues facing women and girls.</p>

<p>Over the last six years, the Tampon Tax Fund has awarded £79 million, with this final round bringing the total to £90.25 million.</p>

<p>In March last year, the Chancellor announced that following the UK’s departure from the EU on 1st January 2021, the EU 5% VAT charge on period products would be removed, permanently reducing associated costs for these products.</p>

<p>Welsh Women’s Aid are receiving a grant of £507,512 towards their project, which provides targeted support and open grant giving opportunities for Women’s Aid members across Wales that enable the development, testing and delivery of new high-quality services, activities, approaches, research, or technologies that have the overarching aim of improving the quality of life for women and girls impacted by violence against women.</p>

<p>Best Beginnings and White Ribbon Alliance UK are also running their project, Safer Beginnings, across the UK, including in Wales.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Prime Minister has announced the latest Points of Light award is being awarded  to 
Molly Fenton, for exceptional contributions towards reducing period poverty. Molly runs the Love Your Period campaign, which reduces stigma and period poverty in schools across Wales. She has been recognised for her inspirational work through the Prime Minister’s prestigious award.</p>

<p>Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Nadine Dorries, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m delighted that Welsh Women’s Aid is among the 14 organisations receiving grants towards their exceptional projects helping disadvantaged women and girls.</p>

  <p>Over the last six years, the UK Government’s Tampon Tax Fund has supported charities right across the UK, and I’m extremely pleased that we were able to use VAT on period products for these important causes.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I’d also like to congratulate Molly on her very well deserved award, and thank her for her selfless hard work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Secretary of State for Wales, Simon Hart said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Supporting organisations such as Welsh Women’s Aid, who do such vital work on behalf of survivors of domestic abuse, is so important. And I’m proud that the UK Government’s Tampon Tax Fund is being used to directly tackle issues facing women and girls in Wales.</p>

  <p class="last-child">And I’d like to pay tribute to Molly Fenton, whose work has been recognised by this prestigious award. She has done an incredible job of raising awareness of period poverty, and starting an important conversation that affects so many women in Wales. Huge congratulations to her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Molly Fenton said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I am honoured to be receiving such an award, and I am honoured to see the amazing changes being made to eradicate period poverty and stigma for all across the country. My work isn’t done, and I won’t stop until every single person that menstruates has the dignity they deserve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sara Kirkpatrick, Chief Executive, Welsh Women’s Aid said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We are delighted to be receiving funding from the Tampon Tax Fund.  The Sector Strength Cymru project will enable our specialist member services to respond to the needs of survivors, and develop or deliver new high-quality activities and approaches that will improve the quality of life for women and girls impacted by violence against women in Wales.</p>
</blockquote>
