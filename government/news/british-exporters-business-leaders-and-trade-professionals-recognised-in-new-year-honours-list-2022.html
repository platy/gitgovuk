He invented his product SwimFin, a multipurpose teaching aid and flotation device used in teaching children to learn how to swim.

<h3>Kevin Mosely, Founder &amp; CEO SwimFin Ltd. said:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">It is an extremely proud and honouring moment. I am an average man receiving an MBE. I am hugely passionate about making a difference to people’s lives, every child should have the opportunity to learn to swim.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Gregory Childs – awarded an OBE for his services to International Trade and the children’s media sector.</h3>

<p>Greg has made an outstanding contribution to Children’s media for over 35 years and has built an unrivalled network of domestic talent that he is able to match with key international commissioners across the globe. Greg has become a role model in the field. Using his unique position as the one-stop shop on market and export intelligence in the UK, Greg has supported individual professionals and worked with HMG on policy and the duty of care to children. Working with DIT to organise the UK delegation to “Kidscreen” in the USA amounted to exports totalling over £300 million for the UK children’s business community.</p>

<h3>Gregory Childs, Co-Founder, Children’s Media Conference &amp; Director of Children’s Media Foundation said:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This is a fantastic new year’s surprise. This honour is not just for me but for the whole children’s media industry. This OBE recognises that children’s media is an important contributor to British society as well as to British trade.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Vivienne Stern – awarded an MBE for her services to international education.</h3>
<p>Vivienne has led the university sector’s efforts to grow its international activity and has driven the unprecedented growth bringing huge commercial and soft power benefits to the UK. Vivienne can take credit for the significant expansion of the numbers of students choosing the UK as a study destination, thus significantly increasing the value of education exports. Internationally, she is a vocal and enthusiastic champion for the UK, speaking at public and Government-to-Government events about the UK international offer and providing a welcoming message to overseas students considering coming to the UK to study.</p>

<h3>Vivienne Stern, Director, Universities UK International, said:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I am astonished and delighted to be receiving an Honour. It means a huge amount to me to have my work validated. It makes it worthwhile. International students who study here bring many benefits to the UK, which go beyond the economic contribution. They contribute to making our universities international learning environments, and to making them great places to study for all students.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Timothy Smith – awarded a CBE for services to agriculture, food, and drink trade policy.</h3>
<p>Tim is now Chairman of Cranswick, appointed in July 2021. Tim has made an outstanding contribution to the industry by providing Government with fresh, innovative ideas for striking a balance between liberalising trade and safeguarding UK food standards. In March 2021, as Chair of the Trade and Agriculture Commission, Tim presented Government with many recommendations on future trade policy for agriculture, food, and drink. He is also a Non-Executive Director at Pret a Manger where, in 2018, he chaired an independent Food Advisory panel, resulting in a Five-Point Allergy Plan. Tim is a Director and Trustee of Farm Africa, a charity that works with farmers to unlock the commercial potential in their smallholdings.</p>

<h3>Timothy Smith, Chairman, Cranswick, said:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I was surprised and thrilled to receive a CBE. I have never had anything like this before. It is truly an honour.</p>
