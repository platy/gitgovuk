<p>UK businesses are being encouraged to unlock their exporting potential and sell to the world as International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan launches the inaugural International Trade Week, which starts today [Monday 15 November].</p>

<p>Throughout the week, the Department for International Trade (DIT) will host over 100 events and workshops all over the UK to support and encourage businesses to explore their expansion into international markets. From London to Edinburgh and Cardiff to Belfast, events will connect businesses of all sizes and sectors with expert trade advisors, Parliamentarians and Ministers.  </p>

<p>The Minister for Exports, Mike Freer will be launching a new “Made in the UK, Sold to the World” campaign with Mayor Street at International Trade Week’s headline event in Birmingham. The campaign will champion local export success stories and promote opportunities in international markets to take advantage of the global demand for the high quality goods the UK is known for.</p>

<p>Government-led research estimates that exports support 6.5 million jobs across the UK and shows that exporters pay higher wages, are on average 21% more productive, and tend to be more resilient, innovative, and profitable. However, many businesses across the UK are yet to take the plunge and aren’t sure how to start selling their products overseas.</p>

<h2>International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said:</h2>

<blockquote>

  <p>The UK makes some of the best products in the world, but only 1 in 10 businesses currently export them around the world. I want this International Trade Week to be a catalyst for businesses to sell to new markets and take advantage of the trade deals we are negotiating.</p>

  <p>My department has a clear message to any business thinking about exporting for the first time. There has never been a better time to export.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Our industry experts in Trade and Investment Hubs around the UK and based around the world will stand shoulder to shoulder and give you the support you need to take the next step on your exporting journey and sell to the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>13 businesses from all over the UK have been selected to front the “Made in the UK, Sold to the World” campaign and the International Trade Secretary will visit one of them, Crep Protect, to celebrate the launch.</p>

<p>This sneaker care business, founded by three brothers from London in 2013, now exports to 52 countries and employs almost 100 people. Not only are they supplying Foot Locker and JD Sports, they’ve partnered with one of the most recognisable sports leagues in the world, the NBA, and have DJ Khaled as a brand ambassador.</p>

<h2>Rizwan Ahmed, Co-Founder and Owner at Crep Protect said:</h2>

<blockquote>

  <p>We are proud that Crep Protect, has grown from a London based business into an international brand which now sells to the world. Having built our premium sneaker care brand within the UK, we wanted to share our passion for sneakers and innovation with international markets, who could also benefit from our products and services.</p>

  <p>Much of our growth in the last eight years has come through building relationships with key retailers and our award-winning marketing. Our international sales account for 65% of our revenue and have helped turn a passion for sneaker care into a global brand.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We wanted to be part of the “Made in the UK, Sold to the World” campaign to help inspire other small business owners to think big; and we are excited to see billboards highlighting Crep Protect’s growth go live this week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exports are central to the government’s ambition to level up every part of the UK and help businesses build back better, which is why exporters who get involved with this campaign will have access to marketing materials specific to their hometown or region.</p>

<p>With International Trade Advisors and sector specialists stationed around the country, DIT has the expertise to support new and experienced exporters on their international journey.</p>

<p>The UK has already agreed trade deals with 69 countries plus the EU and has an ambitious programme of negotiations to build relationships with our trading partners, reduce market access barriers and help UK businesses take advantage of these opportunities.</p>
