<p>Commenting on this year’s Birthday Honours list, Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am very pleased to see so many Scots on the Queen’s Birthday Honours list.</p>

  <p>Today we celebrate the people who are the mainstays of communities across Scotland, selflessly giving back to those around them through their work and their personal lives.</p>

  <p>This year, in the face of the global pandemic, we have seen many Scots come to the aid of their fellow citizens. People like David Maguire who, at the height of the pandemic, repurposed his restaurant to provide free food to thousands of NHS workers and vulnerable local people. People like the University of Glasgow’s Professor Matthew Walters, who volunteered to treat large numbers of acutely ill patients with suspected coronavirus. I salute all of Scotland’s frontline and community covid heroes, and I am delighted that so many have been recognised by Her Majesty.</p>

  <p>Some recipients we know and love, such as Scotland’s Lorraine Kelly. A great journalist and popular TV presenter, Lorraine is also a committed advocate for many charities.</p>

  <p>Scotland’s love of sport is recognised with awards to curling champion Eve Muirhead and former Scottish Football Association president Alan McCrae.</p>

  <p>Many of those who contribute to Scotland’s most important industries have been honoured, including Bertie Armstrong, former chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation, and Stobo Castle’s Stephen Winyard.</p>

  <p>Scotland’s world-leading academics are recognised, including Professor Muffy Calder of the University of Glasgow, who is honoured for her huge contribution to scientific research.</p>

  <p>And today Her Majesty has also recognised many of the Scots who quietly dedicate their lives to public service, never seeking thanks or attention. I am very glad that so many of Scotland’s community volunteers are being recognised today.</p>

  <p class="last-child">My congratulations go to everyone receiving an honour — you represent the very best of Scotland.</p>
