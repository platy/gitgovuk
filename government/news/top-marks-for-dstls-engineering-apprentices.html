<p>All 3 received top marks for the qualification attained during 4 years while they earned money, gained experience and progressed on their career paths.</p>

<p>The trio are now working in cyber for the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (<abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>) – 2 are based in Salisbury and 1 has just started a secondment in the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr>.</p>

<p>Team Leader Chris said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are all extremely proud to see our apprentices receive outstanding degrees which are testament to their hard work, dedication and passion for science.</p>

  <p>They are rolling off the apprenticeships and they are world class. We want to make sure we keep them. They are fantastic.</p>

  <p>They have set the bar extremely high for those currently doing their degrees and shown that you don’t have to choose between a top degree and an apprenticeship.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We support our apprentices both in terms career development and academic achievement. It’s win win.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The group studied on a 6-week block release at Aston University in Birmingham when COVID-19 rules allowed.
They studied Embedded Electronics Systems Design and Development degrees.</p>

<p>George said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was sceptical about paying an enormous amount of money to go to university and this was a chance to learn on the job, embed myself in a career and get a really good qualification</p>

  <p>I think it works really well doing an apprenticeship and a degree as you get to apply what you are learning and that keeps you enthusiastic and improves your academic performance.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I would highly recommend the <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> apprenticeship scheme and advise anyone on it to make the most of it – it is a fantastic opportunity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He went on to say he was allowed time to study at work and found advice from people in the same field invaluable.</p>

<p>Josh said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I was looking at jobs before the course and I used to joke ‘how are you supposed to be a fresh graduate and have 3 years of work experience?’ Now I have 4 years.</p>

  <p>I had the choice of going to university full-time or doing this apprenticeship and I think I definitely made the right decision and don’t feel I’ve missed out on much - maybe I’ve sacrificed Freshers’ Week for a 4-year head start in my career.</p>

  <p class="last-child">One of the best things about doing an apprenticeship with <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> is the support they give you. We were given a reasonable period of time for our studies while people we knew elsewhere had to work every weekend to find the time.</p>
