<p>Thousands of victims of the infected blood scandal will each receive an interim compensation payment of £100,000, the Government has announced today (17 August).</p>

<p>The Government intends to make payments to those who have been infected and bereaved partners in England by the end of October. The same payments will be made in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>The commitment to pay interim compensation meets, in full, the recommendations set out by inquiry chairman Sir Brian Langstaff in his interim report last month. That report built on the study by Sir Robert Francis QC in his detailed consideration of the issues.&nbsp; Details were announced by Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Kit Malthouse today.</p>

<p>The intention is that payments will be tax-free and will not affect any financial benefits support an individual is receiving. Infected individuals and bereaved partners who are registered with any of the four UK infected blood support schemes will receive payment. Advice to those people on how exactly the interim payment will be made will be outlined to them shortly.</p>

<p><strong>Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While nothing can make up for the pain and suffering endured by those affected by this tragic injustice, we are taking action to do right by victims and those who have tragically lost their partners by making sure they receive these interim payments as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We will continue to stand by all those impacted by this horrific tragedy, and I want to personally pay tribute to all those who have so determinedly fought for justice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Kit Malthouse said:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those affected by the infected blood scandal have suffered terribly over many years and that heart-breaking and unimaginable pain has been compounded by the financial uncertainty many have faced.</p>

  <p>These interim payments will start the process of securing that certainty. My priority is to get the money to those people as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I am grateful to Sir Brian Langstaff for the work he has done to date on the inquiry, and Sir Robert Francis, for his work on compensation. Of course, no amount of money will compensate for the turmoil victims and their loved ones have faced, but I hope these payments help to show that we are on their side and will do everything in our power to support them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Health and Social Care Secretary, Steve Barclay, said:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The infected blood scandal should never have happened. In accepting Sir Brian Langstaff’s recommendations, today we are taking an important step in righting this historic wrong for the thousands of people infected and bereaved partners left behind.</p>

  <p>Building on the ongoing support we are providing through the England Infected Blood Scheme, these new interim payments of £100,000 will ensure those impacted across the whole country by this injustice can access the compensation they need, right now.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I’m grateful to those who have campaigned extensively in support of these changes – we have listened and work is underway to ensure those impacted by this tragedy receive the support they rightly deserve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In England, the intention is to make payments by the end of October.</p>

<p>The Government has updated Sir Brian Langstaff that his recommendations have been accepted.</p>

<p>ENDS</p>

<p><strong>Notes to Editors:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The administration of the schemes in the Devolved Administrations is for the relevant devolved administration.
These interim compensation payments for current beneficiaries are estimated to cost c.£400 million for the whole UK.</p>
