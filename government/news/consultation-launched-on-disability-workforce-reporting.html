  <li>Consultation one of 100 immediate commitments in the National Disability Strategy</li>
  <li>Employers, staff networks, disabled people and their organisations, encouraged to have their say</li>
  <li>Survey will run until close 25th March 2022.</li>
</ul>

<p>Views on voluntary and mandatory reporting of disability in the workforce by large employers are being sought as part of a new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/disability-workforce-reporting">Government consultation</a>.</p>

<p>Launched today (Thursday 16 December), the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/disability-workforce-reporting" class="govuk-link">consultation</a>, part of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-disability-strategy" class="govuk-link">National Disability Strategy</a>, seeks views on how employers with more than 250 employees might be encouraged to collect and report statistics about disability to make their workforces more inclusive.</p>

<h3>Minister for Disabled People, Chloe Smith, said:</h3>

<p>“Making the most of disabled people’s skills is not just good for employees but also for businesses - a more diverse workforce leads to improved financial returns.</p>

<p>“We want to support employers to have the right information, so they can take the steps needed to make their organisations inclusive for all.</p>

<p>“We know that there are lots of views on how to achieve these aims, and lots of good work already going on. We want to hear from employers, employees and other disabled people, giving us a strong understanding of the issue from all perspectives.”</p>

<p>A voluntary reporting framework, developed by Government in partnership with large employers and expert partners, including leading disability charities, has been in place since 2018. The consultation will explore how government and employers can make workplaces more inclusive for disabled people and increase transparency.</p>

<p>This consultation asks employers, disabled people and representative groups to set out their views and experiences of disability workforce reporting.</p>

<p>Today’s announcement is one of 100 immediate commitments from the National Disability Strategy – the first truly cross-government effort to transform disabled people’s everyday lives. Published in July, the Strategy includes a wide range of practical actions aimed at making tangible improvements to the everyday lives of disabled people, focused on the issues that disabled people say matter most. Amongst these, many disabled people highlight the importance of being able to get a good job and to progress in their careers.</p>

<p>It is supported by £1.6bn of funding alongside an ambitious agenda for future reform. It builds on the Disability Discrimination Act which enshrined protections for disabled people when it comes to employment, transport, education and provision of goods and services.</p>

<h3>Further information:</h3>

<p>The consultation is available in multiple alternative formats and can be:</p>

  <li>downloaded</li>
  <li>requested</li>
  <li>or filled in online</li>
