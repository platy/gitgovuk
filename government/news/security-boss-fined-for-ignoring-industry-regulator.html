<p>Kevan Warren, of Liverpool, was sentenced at Liverpool and Knowsley Magistrates’ Court on 11 February 2021. District Judge Shaw imposed a fine of £230.00 plus a victim surcharge of £32.00. Warren, who is the director of SecureSec Security Solutions Ltd, must also pay costs of £500.00.</p>

<p>Warren, who is also known as both Kevin and Keven Warren, changed his plea from not guilty to guilty at the hearing, at which he represented himself. The Security Industry Authority brought the prosecution after Warren stopped engaging with requests for information under Section 19 of the Private Security Industry Act 2001. Requests made under the Act place the recipient under a legal obligation to respond; not to do so is a criminal offence.</p>

<p>The SIA originally wrote to Warren on 18 March 2020 with a request for information relating to the contracts undertaken by SecureSec between October 2019 and March 2020. Warren replied the following day, and again three days later, showing that he had received and understood the SIA’s request. However, he failed to provide the information and the SIA has had no response from him since 22 March 2020.</p>

<p>Pete Easterbrook, of the SIA’s Criminal Investigation Team, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">It’s very important that those within the industry understand that requests for information from us cannot be ignored. Working within a regulated sector carries certain responsibilities, one of which is engaging with the regulator when we ask you to do so. If you work in the private security industry and ignore a request from us, you could find yourself in court. A conviction will almost certainly mean the end of your career in the industry. If we get in touch, please engage with us for your own sake. Ignoring the regulator is not worth the damage to reputation and livelihood that might follow.</p>
</blockquote>
