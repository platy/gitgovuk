<p>The Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) has recently been working with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk" rel="external">The National Trust</a> to provide free, specialised training and support to help keep staff, volunteers, and visitors at the trust, safe.</p>

<p>To date, more than 70 members of National Trust staff have undergone training in a series of DBS workshops across England and Wales.</p>

<p>This training aims to give staff at the National Trust, which has 10,000 staff and nearly 50,000 volunteers, a better understanding of the work we do at DBS. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>eligibility for DBS checks</li>
  <li>the information contained on each type of DBS certificate</li>
  <li>when an organisation has the duty or power to make a barring referral</li>
</ul>

<p>These training sessions have been delivered by the DBS Partnerships and Engagement team, who offer support to organisations at both a national and regional level.</p>

<p>Last year, within the Partnerships and Engagement team, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-dbs-regional-outreach-service">Regional Outreach service</a> launched. This service provides organisations with a single point of contact for all DBS-related queries and questions, as well as the opportunity to access tailored, DBS training for their staff. The team also collates feedback to ensure future improvements can be made to DBS services and processes.</p>

<p>Natalie Benton, Executive Director of Strategy and Performance at DBS, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The DBS Partnerships and Engagement team is committed to working with organisations so we can keep the most vulnerable in our society safe. By providing advice and training to organisations, we can provide their staff with a more comprehensive understanding of DBS checks and barring referrals, which will ultimately lead to organisations making safer recruitment choices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sara Bird, National Safeguarding Lead at The National Trust, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">As the Trust continue to welcome large numbers of visitors to our places as well as forming partnerships and engagement opportunities with adults, young people and children, itâ€™s imperative we offer a safe environment. Our work with the DBS gives assurance and instils confidence in creating a safe space for all.</p>
</blockquote>
