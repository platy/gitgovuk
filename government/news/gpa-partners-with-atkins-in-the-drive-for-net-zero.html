<p>The Government has updated plans to achieve Net Zero by 2050 with the UK setting the world’s most ambitious climate change target. In June 2021, the new target was published in law that would reduce emissions by 78 percent which means that the UK will be more than three quarters of the way to Net Zero by 2035.</p>

<p>Given 38 percent of all emissions originate from construction, a number of laws have been passed to help regulate the industry, for example Energy Performance Certificate targets which concern all owners or stakeholders of property – commercial or residential.</p>

<p>Steven Boyd, CEO of the GPA, said: “As the delivery body for the Government’s office portfolio, we have a crucial role to play in the Government’s Net Zero initiative. Our strategy is to partner with industry leading companies to support successful delivery and drive the best commercial deals in the market.  Atkins is world-renowned for its sustainability track record and we are pleased to appoint them as our partner on this critical initiative.”</p>

<p>Atkins will provide technical and design support including due diligence, compliance and assurance, as well as cost management and annual planning cycles across the portfolio.</p>

<p>Richard Robinson, Engineering Design and Project Management (EDPM) CEO, UK &amp; Europe at Atkins, said: “Net Zero will only be achieved through public and private sector collaboration, as we step up together to tackle climate change and deliver a greener future.  As such, we look forward to working alongside the GPA, recognising the impact we can make as we help shape the Government’s wider Net Zero agenda.”</p>

<p>The GPA is an executive agency of the Cabinet Office formed in 2018. It is responsible for delivering the Government’s property agenda across its office and warehouse portfolios, and currently manages 9m sq ft of the Government’s property. It also provides guidance on workplace services including design, technology, sustainability, and the customer experience.</p>

<p>The GPA has a crucial role in the Government’s Hubs programme as part of its Levelling Up agenda, as well as the Civil Service’s Workplace Transformation programme and the Net Zero initiative. The GPA is pioneering best practice as it offers guidance and leads by example in retrofitting and installing sustainability aspects to the Government’s general purpose portfolio.</p>

<p>Atkins is a world-leading design, engineering and project management consultancy that specialises in sustainability. It bases its sustainability strategy around the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals on climate change, amongst others, and is a member of the UN Global Compact.</p>
