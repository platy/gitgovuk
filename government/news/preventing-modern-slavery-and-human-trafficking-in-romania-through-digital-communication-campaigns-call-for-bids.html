<h2>1.	Background</h2>

<p>The UK invites project proposals to support the prevention of modern slavery and human trafficking (<abbr title="modern slavery and human trafficking">MSHT</abbr>) in Romania through digital communications campaigns. This project is part of a wider British Embassy portfolio of projects which seeks to support the Romanian government and civil society in reducing the drivers of serious and organised crime (<abbr title="serious and organised crime">SOC</abbr>) and the ability of organised crime groups to exploit vulnerabilities and re-traffic <abbr title="modern slavery and human trafficking">MSHT</abbr> victims.</p>

<p>Addressing <abbr title="modern slavery and human trafficking">MSHT</abbr> and <abbr title="serious and organised crime">SOC</abbr> requires international cooperation, since criminal networks know no borders. This is a priority for the British government and British Embassy Bucharest, as Romania is a source, transit and destination country for human trafficking. In 2020 alone, the British referral mechanism registered 368 Romanian victims. Proposals should focus on delivery in Romania.</p>

<p>Previous awareness campaigns have focused on raising awareness but have not always reached the most vulnerable or young people at risk of trafficking because they have not used methods of communication that could directly target these audiences. We know that traffickers use digital tools to reach and then target potential victims, so there is a need for coordinated anti-trafficking campaigns using digital tools, focused on connecting with those most at risk, and providing them with information to protect themselves and identify risks, rather than raising general awareness.</p>

<h2>2.	Objective</h2>

<p>The aim of this project is to partner with the Romanian Government and civil society in delivering a communications campaign that raises awareness about <abbr title="modern slavery and human trafficking">MSHT</abbr> and reduces the drivers of <abbr title="serious and organised crime">SOC</abbr> and the ability of organised crime groups to exploit vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>The main objective is to inform vulnerable individuals about the risk of trafficking (including early signs of abuse that might precede trafficking, for example: emotional, physical, financial, coercive control) and what they can do to safeguard themselves against it, using digital tools to target the most vulnerable.</p>

<h2>3.	Scope of work</h2>

<p>The project should have a national reach, while specifically targeting the vulnerable individuals through online tools.</p>

<h2>4.	Activities</h2>

<p>Activities financed under this project may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>designing a campaign to raise awareness about the signs of trafficking and how to protect yourself against it for young audiences</li>
  <li>providing relationship education and helping teenagers recognise the signs of a manipulative/abusive or coercive relationship, in order to reduce ‘lover boy’ trafficking methods</li>
  <li>running a communications campaign aimed at raising awareness about trafficking, using algorithms and digital marketing tools to target young people within demographics most at risk, and the most commonly used social media platforms by the target age groups</li>
  <li>using online influencers to amplify the communications message</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list and the British Embassy welcomes innovative proposals from potential implementing partners which suggest additional or alternative activities to deliver the key objectives.</p>

<h2>5.	Project approach</h2>

<p>Bidders are asked to submit a project proposal which will be approved by the British Embassy Bucharest and will form the basis for project planning. The proposal should set out how the implementing partner will deliver activities to support the objectives set out above with an implementation plan and supporting budget. The British Embassy Bucharest will oversee the project planning and provide the necessary contacts to the implementers.</p>

<p>The project implementer will manage project logistics, including travel plans, lodging, car hiring etc. and is expected to consider the pandemic context and its possible impact on the project implementation when submitting the bid.</p>

<p>The embassy can provide contact persons and focal points for UK institutions or experts that might be needed in the process.</p>

<h3>How to bid</h3>

<p>Our process will consist of a one-stage full bid proposal. Forms should be completed in English.</p>

<p>You should submit:</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="attachment-inline"><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1017589/Project_Proposal_Bid_Form_For_Implementers.odt" class="govuk-link">Project proposal bid form for implementers</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="OpenDocument Text document">ODT</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">48.4KB</span>)</span></li>
  <li><span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1017740/Activity_based_budget_template.ods">Activity-based budget template</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="OpenDocument Spreadsheet">ODS</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">10.2KB</span>)</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Activity-based budgets should list the activities needed to deliver the outcomes (results) of the project and all costs should be in Romanian Lei (RON).</p>

<p>Deadline for submitting project bids is 28 September 2021.</p>

<p>Email completed forms to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:rsvp.bucharest@fcdo.gov.uk">rsvp.bucharest@fcdo.gov.uk</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:andrada.petrache@fcdo.gov.uk">andrada.petrache@fcdo.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>You should state in the subject of the email: name of implementing organisation and title of the project.</p>

<h2>6.	Reporting</h2>

<p>The reports to be produced during the course of this project are to be delivered in English:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an inception note detailing approach and particular aspects of the activities to be pursued, including a communications plan</li>
  <li>a draft report</li>
  <li>three-monthly financial reports</li>
  <li>the final report, following a facilitated process of commenting</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Composition of the project teams</h2>

<p>A project director, from the part of BE Bucharest (Tanya Collingridge, Deputy Head of Mission) and a project manager (Andrada Petrache, Senior Political Officer), from British Embassy Bucharest, will oversee the project delivery.</p>

<p>Project proposals should demonstrate that the staffing level is appropriate to the aim of the project and that the staff have relevant expertise and experience in <abbr title="modern slavery and human trafficking">MSHT</abbr> victim support, as well as detailed knowledge of the <abbr title="modern slavery and human trafficking">MSHT</abbr> situation in Romania.</p>

<h2>8. Timing and scope of input</h2>

<p>The bidding round is an open and competitive process, assessed by the British Embassy in Bucharest. Results will be issued by early October. Once a bid is approved, a Grant Contract will be signed with the successful bidders. In the documents section you will find an example of a Grant Contract. Your organisation will be expected to sign the contract within one week of the funds being awarded. Failure to do so will result in the funds being re-allocated. The implementing organisation will be required to submit report updates and a final evaluation of the project.</p>

<p>There are no pre-payments. Reimbursements will be completed once activities have taken place and all receipts submitted. Implementing organisations will request repayments using an invoice (including receipts and a financial report of spend) and the repayments will be carried out during those dates agreed upon in the respective contract.</p>

<p>The budget should be presented in RON. All payments will be made in RON to a bank account held in Romania.</p>

<p>Please send any questions regarding the call for bids to <a href="mailto:rsvp.bucharest@fcdo.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">rsvp.bucharest@fcdo.gov.uk</a> and <a href="mailto:andrada.petrache@fcdo.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">andrada.petrache@fcdo.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>It is expected that the project will be carried out from October 2021 to February 2022. The crucial milestones will be the submission of the draft report (February 2022) and the final report (March 2022).</p>

<h2>9. Budget</h2>

<p>Grant applications must include an estimated budget of up to RON 97,142. Depending on the quality of the proposals, the British Embassy reserves the right not to grant all or part of the available funds. The embassy also reserves the right to award a grant of less than the amount requested by the applicants. In such a case, applicants will be asked to increase the amount that they co-finance, to propose other co-financing means or to decrease the total costs without altering the substance of the proposal.</p>
