          <p>The Minister for Pensions, Guy Opperman, has announced today that Brendan will take up the role on 1 February 2022 for a five-year term.</p>

<p>Nest was set up by the government to ensure every UK employer has access to a guaranteed, easy-to-manage pension scheme following the introduction of automatic enrolment and it has a public service obligation to admit any employer that applies to it.</p>

<p>Minister for Pensions and Financial Inclusion, Guy Opperman said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am delighted to confirm Brendan McCafferty as the next Chair of Nest Corporation. He brings a wealth of financial services knowledge to the role and will be a great fit.</p>

  <p>Brendan will oversee an important five years as Nest transitions to a new service administrator. I am confident he will continue to develop its service and help millions of workers enjoy a more comfortable retirement.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I would also like to thank Otto Thoresen for his service as Chair. He successfully steered Nest through the ramp up of automatic enrolment and the establishment of its industry-leading responsible investment approach. He leaves behind a lasting legacy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brendan McCafferty said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nest is now well established and has shown itself to be an organisation with the interests of its over ten million members at its heart.</p>

  <p class="last-child">As Nest sets about the next phase of its development, I am delighted to have been given the opportunity to work with the Trustee Board and wider stakeholders to help ensure we deliver the Nest purpose of helping millions of people enjoy a better retirement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nest currently supports around 10.5 million pension scheme members, working with over 940,000 employers.</p>

<p>Automatic enrolment, which has already affected more than 10 million workers, is continuing to play a major role in increasing private sector pension saving to record levels. Since 2012, private sector participation has almost doubled to 86% with 14.3 million eligible employees in 2020.</p>
