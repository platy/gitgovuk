<p>As part of the UK-Ghana partnership, the British High Commission is pleased to announce the signing of a contract between the Government of Ghana’s Ministry of Roads and Highways and Mabey Bridge, which will facilitate the delivery of 89 modular, steel, emergency-response bridges rapidly deployed across Ghana to restore critical infrastructure.</p>

<p>Iain Walker British High Commissioner to Ghana said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>89 bridges deployed across the country shows the strength of the UK-Ghana partnership; a long-term partnership working for the long-term benefit of Ghana.</p>

  <p>Developed at the third UK-Ghana Business Council in 2019, this deal will improve connectivity for communities across the country, making the daily journeys to school and work both safer and faster.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Together we are committed to creating opportunities that move beyond aid and towards the trade and investment relationships which drive economic growth and local job creation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The £43m bridge programme, forming a key part of discussions at the third UK-Ghana Business Council held in Accra in October 2019, has been developed to improve connectivity for rural communities enabling quicker, safer and more efficient access to employment, education and healthcare.</p>

<p>Michael Treacy Mabey Bridge CEO said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are delighted to be working with the Government of Ghana to help expedite and successfully implement this urgent, high-profile project. Sustainable, climate-resilient infrastructure is critically important to post-disaster recovery and rehabilitation, and we very much look forward to working in partnership with the Ghanaian government to deliver this ambitious programme.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The bridges will be designed, manufactured and built over a two year period. The programme will provide full technical support to assist with the local project management of every bridge. An expert training team will ensure that local engineers working on every bridge have the knowledge and expertise needed to build these specialist bridges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Adam Afriyie Her Majesty’s Trade Envoy for Ghana said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UK partnerships with Ghana such as the Mabey Bridge emergency bridge supplies demonstrate the effective collaboration between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of Ghana.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This project shows the UK’s ability to mobilise the best of our shared expertise, with the technical skills to offer world-class solutions, to the increasing need for improving infrastructure in Ghana to support its development.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I am so pleased to see a project advanced by the UK-Ghana Business Council, now made possible with support from the UK Government.</p>
</blockquote>
