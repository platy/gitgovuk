<p>The Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has today (1 February 2022) appointed Dr Peter Highnam as Chief Executive of the UK’s new Advanced Research and Invention Agency (<abbr title="Advanced Research and Invention Agency">ARIA</abbr>), to lead the formation of the agency and direct its initial funding of high-risk programmes.</p>

<p><abbr title="Advanced Research and Invention Agency">ARIA</abbr> forms a critical part of the UK government’s science and research agenda. Backed by £800 million, it will empower exceptional scientists to focus on high-risk projects at the frontier of discovery and innovation that could transform people’s lives for the better, maintaining the UK’s position on the international stage as a science superpower.</p>

<p>Born in the UK, Dr Peter Highnam brings a wealth of experience making him uniquely capable to step into the role, as he joins <abbr title="Advanced Research and Invention Agency">ARIA</abbr> from the USA’s research agency <abbr title="Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency">DARPA</abbr> where he has served as Deputy Director since February 2018. He will take up his post as <abbr title="Advanced Research and Invention Agency">ARIA</abbr>’s first <abbr title="chief executive officer">CEO</abbr> on 3 May 2022, for a fixed term of 5 years.</p>

<p><abbr title="Advanced Research and Invention Agency">ARIA</abbr> is based on models that have proved successful in other countries, in particular the influential US Advanced Research Projects Agency (<abbr title="Advanced Research Projects Agency">ARPA</abbr>) model. This was instrumental in creating transformational technologies such as the internet and GPS, changing the way people live and work, while increasing productivity and economic growth.</p>

<p>More recently, <abbr title="Advanced Research Projects Agency">ARPA</abbr>’s successor, <abbr title="Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency">DARPA</abbr>, was a vital pre-pandemic funder of mRNA vaccines and antibody therapies, leading to critical <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>-19 therapies.</p>

<p>Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dr Peter Highnam’s appointment is a major triumph for the UK. His expert direction will lead the agency’s formation, ensuring the funding of high-risk programmes that will continue to push the boundaries of science and technology.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Under Dr Highnam’s leadership, <abbr title="Advanced Research and Invention Agency">ARIA</abbr> will ensure the benefits of research and development will be felt in our society and economy over the course of generations, and that the technologies, discoveries, products, and ideas the agency invests in are supported to create the industries of tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The government has committed to increase public investment in R&amp;D to £20 billion in 2024-2025, and <abbr title="Advanced Research and Invention Agency">ARIA</abbr> will be an integral and invaluable addition to the UK’s flourishing R&amp;D ecosystem.</p>

<p>Operating with flexibility and speed, avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy, and experimenting with different funding models, <abbr title="Advanced Research and Invention Agency">ARIA</abbr> will ensure the UK remains on the front line of experimental research.</p>

<p>Science Minister George Freeman said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The UK’s scientific community has a proud history of discovery, and the imagination and creativity of our discovery scientists and innovators – from Isaac Newton to Ada Lovelace, Frank Whittle, Alan Turing and Dame Sarah Gilbert’s team developing the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>-19 vaccine – continue to transform our world.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Dr Peter Highnam’s appointment as <abbr title="Advanced Research and Invention Agency">ARIA</abbr>’s first <abbr title="chief executive officer">CEO</abbr> will enable our ground-breaking new agency to push the boundaries of high-risk science in the 21st century. His impressive wealth of experience puts him in a unique position to lead the direction of funding for the most ground-breaking projects in the UK and maintain our status as a leading innovation nation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>UK Research and Innovation Chief Executive Professor Dame Ottoline Leyser said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dr Peter Highnam‘s breadth of experience in leading the development and translation of transformational ideas will be a huge asset to <abbr title="Advanced Research and Invention Agency">ARIA</abbr> and to the UK’s research and innovation system.</p>

  <p><abbr title="Advanced Research and Invention Agency">ARIA</abbr> has a unique role to play in the ecosystem, enhancing the UK’s ability to experiment with novel approaches to finding and supporting people and ideas at the frontiers of discovery and innovation.</p>

  <p class="last-child">On behalf of <abbr title="UK Research and Innovation">UKRI</abbr> I’d like to welcome Dr Highnam to his new role. I am looking forward to working alongside him to unleash the full potential of researchers and innovators across the UK to change people’s lives for the better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the appointment Dr Highnam as chief executive, the search for <abbr title="Advanced Research and Invention Agency">ARIA</abbr>’s first Chair has also recommenced today.</p>

<p>This is an unprecedented opportunity to help to design and build <abbr title="Advanced Research and Invention Agency">ARIA</abbr> from the ground up, as the Chair will support Dr Peter Highnam to deliver <abbr title="Advanced Research and Invention Agency">ARIA</abbr>’s goals and ground-breaking ambitions. The Chair will also be a key counsel to the <abbr title="chief executive officer">CEO</abbr>, and ensure the agency’s effective governance.</p>

<p>All applications will be reviewed by an Advisory Assessment Panel comprised of the Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance; <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>’ Director General for Science, Innovation and Growth, Jo Shanmugalingam; <abbr title="chief executive officer">CEO</abbr> and co-founder of DeepMind, Demis Hassabis CBE, former Chairman of the Vaccine Taskforce, and Managing Partner at SV Health Investors, Kate Bingham DBE.</p>

<p>This appointment will be a fair and open process, overseen by the Executive Search agency Saxton Bampflyde. <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.saxbam.com/appointment/advanced-research-and-invention-agency-aria-3">More information about the role of <abbr title="Advanced Research and Invention Agency">ARIA</abbr> Chair is available on the Saxton Bampflyde site</a>.</p>
