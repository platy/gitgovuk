<p>Our student finance application service launched at the end of February and before I know it, it’s May, and I’m already talking about the deadline approaching this Friday (20 May) for full time, undergraduate students in England.</p>

<p>At SLC, we enable opportunity for students to invest in their futures through further and higher education and it’s a role we take extremely seriously. In the Operations side of our business, which is my world, we have been focused on delivering a seamless application journey for students.</p>

<p>We recognise that preparing to go to university or college can initially seem a bit overwhelming, so we want the application process to be as simple as possible. The bottom line is students need to start the new academic year with their funding in place – that’s our overall goal.</p>

<p>The good news is that students can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://studentfinance.campaign.gov.uk/" rel="external">apply online</a> and can do this even if they don’t have a confirmed place at university. The process doesn’t take too long and once it’s complete, students can relax knowing there is one less thing to take care of before they head off on this next chapter.</p>

<p>We receive around 1.5million applications each year, and for the most part, the majority are approved without a hitch. However, there are some applications that can be more complicated to process and require additional information. But our focus is on ensuring a good customer experience, which is why the improvements we have made to our digital services are so important.</p>

<p>The online account gives the student the freedom to self-serve where possible – update personal details and check the progress of the application at a time that suits them. Once submitted, applications can take up to six to eight weeks to process but if we need anything, or want to clarify their information, we will get in touch directly with a message on the account to-do list, by text or email.</p>

<p>There is also a range of resources and content available <a class="govuk-link" href="https://studentfinance.campaign.gov.uk/" rel="external">online</a>, which answer the most common student finance questions. We strongly recommend that applicants check this out first before calling us, as our phonelines are always extremely busy at this time of year, and we would prefer not to keep people waiting.</p>

<p>Students can also stay up to date on the latest student finance information by following SFE on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://twitter.com/SF_England" rel="external">Twitter</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/SFEngland" rel="external">Facebook</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/studentfinance_england" rel="external">Instagram</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, applications continue to stay open throughout summer, but we can’t guarantee full funding will be received before the academic term starts. So, my advice to all students starting or continuing their studies at college or university this year is to apply now. We look forward to receiving your application.</p>
