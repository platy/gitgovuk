<p>In honour of Commonwealth Day on Monday 8 March, the British High Commission Nassau is holding a climate action photography contest for young Bahamians (ages 11-18).</p>

<p>Details of the contest are on the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/BritishHighCommissionNassau/">UK in The Bahamas Facebook Page</a>. Young Bahamians aged 11-14 and 15-18 years old can submit photos that represent Nature-based Solutions to Combat Climate Change and its Impacts. Prizes in each age category include a Go Pro Hero 5 camera worth over $400 and a snorkel experience at the BREEF Coral Reef Sculpture Garden and Coral Nursery.</p>

<p>The contest is organised by the British High Commission Nassau in partnership with the Sustainable Development Goals Unit <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sdgunit242/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">SDG Unit</a> of the Office of the Prime Minister and the Bahamas Reef Environment Education Foundation <a class="govuk-link" href="https://breef.org/" rel="external">BREEF</a>.</p>

<p>Protecting the environment and combatting climate change are very important for the 54 members of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>•	Did you know? 31 of the Commonwealth’s 54 member countries are small island states</p>

<p>•	Did you know? The Bahamas is part of the Commonwealth action group on mangroves</p>

<p>•	Did you know? The Bahamas is part of the Commonwealth action group on the Blue Charter (shared oceans, shared values)</p>

<p>•	Did you know? Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the head of the Commonwealth</p>

<p>So join us in raising awareness about The Bahamas’ role in combatting climate change through the promotion of Nature-Based Solutions. Your photo should capture the unique way that an island archipelago in the Commonwealth like The Bahamas can address climate change and its impacts.</p>

<p>Take an original still photo that reflects a ‘nature-based solution’ to climate change. Nature based solutions can counteract climate change in all sorts of ways, such as:</p>

<p>•	the protection, restoration and sustainable management of mangroves and their ecosystems</p>

<p>•	supporting woodlands</p>

<p>•	protecting coral reefs and their ocean habitats</p>

<p>•	sustainable farming and agriculture</p>

<p>•	celebrating and protecting biodiversity on land and sea</p>

<p>The winners of the competition will be awarded prizes and have their photography featured in a virtual Gallery Space on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BritishHighCommissionNassau/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">UK in The Bahamas Facebook Page</a>.</p>
