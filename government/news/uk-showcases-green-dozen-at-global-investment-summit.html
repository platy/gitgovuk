  <li>Government-hosted Global Investment Summit will showcase best of UK innovation and green technology</li>
  <li>Twelve companies from across the nation will display electric vehicles, hydrogen, offshore wind technology and more</li>
  <li>Summit aims to drive billions of investment to every part of the country</li>
</ul>

<p>Twelve of the UK’s leading green innovators will showcase their technology to some of the world’s most high-profile investors at the Global Investment Summit on 19th October.</p>

<p>Hosted by the Prime Minister and supported by members of the Royal Family, the Summit will demonstrate Britain’s commitment to green industrial revolution in the UK and abroad ahead of COP26, and promote the UK as a top destination for foreign investment.</p>

<p>Around 200 investors attending the Summit will see the latest cutting-edge innovation that is helping deliver key areas of the Prime Minister’s Ten-Point Plan, helping cement the UK’s position as a science superpower and the world’s number one centre for green technology. The country’s pioneering work in this space will be vital in helping  reduce emissions and limit the rise in global temperatures.</p>

<p>The showcase will demonstrate major leaps forward in renewable energy such as the tidal turbine technology pioneered by Orbital Marine Power, as well as advancements in green technologies like the world’s first zero-emission double-decker hydrogen bus, made by Wrightbus.</p>

<p>Household names like Rolls-Royce will be on hand to showcase models such as its all-electric aircraft and small modular reactor, alongside start-ups such as Automated Architecture, which will display its robot-assembled automated sustainable construction systems for housing, which could see homes being delivered more quickly by localising housing production through automation.</p>

<h4>Minister for Investment Gerry Grimstone said:</h4>
<blockquote>

  <p>Our Global Investment Summit will put UK innovation on the map, and demonstrate how we can use investment to nurture technological developments and propel our economy towards a more prosperous, exciting future.</p>

  <p>These businesses show why the UK is a global hub for green technology – from major advances in tidal turbines and fusion energy, to electric vehicle development and zero emission aircrafts.</p>

  <p class="last-child">These industries of the future will not only help ensure a cleaner, greener planet but also create high-value jobs across the UK.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Rolls-Royce CEO Warren East said:</h4>
<blockquote>

  <p class="last-child">The transition to net zero is a societal imperative and one of the greatest commercial opportunities of our time. We are proud to play our part in the Global investment Summit alongside the UK Government, demonstrating the positive transforming power of industrial technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Orbital CEO Andrew Scott said:</h4>
<blockquote>

  <p class="last-child">We are delighted to be given this amazing platform to showcase the innovative technology we pioneered here in the UK and to share our vision of how tidal stream energy can play a part in turning the tide on climate change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Ten-Point Plan will mobilise £12 billion of government investment to create and support up to 250,000 highly skilled green jobs in the UK - and unlock three times as much private sector investment by 2030.</p>

<p>In the last decade Foreign Direct Investment has created more than 700,000 jobs across the country, and since April 2019 projects supported by the Department for International Trade have contributed more than £7 billion to the economy.</p>

<p>Inward investment also helps level up the UK by making companies more profitable, which means they can invest back into local economies and stronger supply chains, and more sustainable communities for the future.</p>
