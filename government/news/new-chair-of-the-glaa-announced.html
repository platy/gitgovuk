<p>Julia was appointed as chair on 18 November 2021 following a robust competition, conducted in accordance with the governance code on public appointments.</p>

<p>Julia initially worked in communications and business consulting, which included running her own business for 7 years.</p>

<p>She stood as the Conservative Party candidate for the post of Police and Crime Commissioner for North Yorkshire and was elected in November 2012.

<p>In 2018, Julia became one of the first Police, Fire and Crime Commissioners in the country, subsequently sitting on the national Fire Standards Board.</p>

<p>Julia was a director of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners for 6 years. During that time she chaired the Police Reform and Transformation Board, set up by the Home Secretary to lead the transformation of policing across England and Wales. She held 3 national portfolios; for Victims, Rural Affairs and Integrity and Transparency, working closely with the Independent Police Complaints Commission and the Independent Office for Police Conduct on reform of the police complaints system.</p>

<p>Julia has been:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a member of the advisory panel to the Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner since January 2019</li>
  <li>the chair of the Independent Domestic Abuse Service since January 2020</li>
  <li>a non-executive director on the board of the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority since May 2020</li>
