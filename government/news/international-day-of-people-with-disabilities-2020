<p>Thursday 3 December was International Day of People with Disabilities (<abbr title="International Day of People with Disabilities">IDPWD</abbr>) - a day to spread awareness and understanding of the experiences of those living with disabilities. The theme for <abbr title="International Day of People with Disabilities">IDPWD</abbr> 2020 is ‘Not all Disabilities are Visible’ and places a spotlight on disabilities that are not immediately apparent to others, such as mental health, hearing impairments, conditions related to learning and understanding, or chronic pain, to name just a few.</p>

<h2 id="mikes-blog">Mike’s blog</h2>
<p>Inclusivity is central to our future people priorities in the Government Analysis Function. Essential to this is celebrating diversity by enabling analysts across government to understand the experiences of colleagues. To celebrate <abbr title="International Day of People with Disabilities">IDPWD</abbr>, we’re sharing <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mikes-story" class="govuk-link">Mike’s story</a>. Mike is an Assistant Economist at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. He suffered a severe traumatic brain injury in a cycling accident in 2005, which set his life on a new path. Here he discusses disability and inclusion in an effort to help others get an environment in which they can succeed.</p>

<h2 id="leaders-in-analysis-event">Leaders in Analysis event</h2>
<p>Following a successful pilot session in September, we are delighted to announce our next ‘Leaders in Analysis’ event. To celebrate <abbr title="International Day of People with Disabilities">IDPWD</abbr>, join us for a career development session for colleagues with a disability, visible or invisible, at all grades across the function alongside:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jonathan Nancekivell-Smith (Head of the Prime Minister’s Implementation Unit and Director of Analysis, Cabinet Office)</li>
  <li>Paul Vickers (Deputy Director, Insights Division, Analysis and Data Directorate at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government</li>
</ul>

<p>They will share their career stories, discuss moments that really mattered in their development and talk about their current roles to give a flavour of where a career in analysis can lead.</p>

<p>Our vision is to create a truly inclusive Analysis Function community that is reflective of the UK society we serve. A top priority in our diversity and inclusion action plan is to create meaningful career development and networking opportunities for colleagues from underrepresented groups across the function. These events are designed as a forum for analysts to hear from senior leaders and build an understanding of the wide range of career trajectories available in government analysis.</p>

<p>This online event takes place on Wednesday 16 December at 12pm.  Please <a rel="external" href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/leaders-in-analysis-career-event-for-ipdwp-tickets-131184104187" class="govuk-link">book your place via Eventbrite</a> by  Friday 11 December.</p>
