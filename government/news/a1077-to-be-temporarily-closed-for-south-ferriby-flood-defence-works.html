<p>As part of the Environment Agency’s £12m flood defence works in South Ferriby, the A1077 will be closed for 7 days from 13 February 2021.</p>

<p>This will allow the Environment Agency to install a flood gate, which will reduce flood risk to the village. Traffic from Barton-upon-Humber to Winteringham and villages west of Winteringham will need to follow the diversion route via the A15, A18 and via Scunthorpe.</p>

<p>Travellers are advised to plan ahead to help minimise disruption to their journeys during the week.</p>

<p>Construction work for the scheme started in May 2019 and most of the new defences are in place. The final sections of the project around Ancholme Sluice and the installation of the flood gate are now underway.</p>

<p>Aminu Adamu, Project Manager for the Environment Agency, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As we reach an important milestone in this project we will need to close the A1077 for a short time.</p>

  <p>We have worked closely with our contractor, South Ferriby Parish Council and North Lincolnshire Council to reduce the road closure from the initial period of 30 weeks. Due to the innovative design, we are pleased to announce that the A1077 will only be closed for around 7 days, commencing 13 February which will coincide with the half-term school holiday.</p>

  <p class="last-child">During this time a temporary shuttle bus service, serving Winteringham, Winterton to Scunthorpe and South Ferriby to Barton, is planned to maintain public transport links.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The project is scheduled to reach a major milestone in March 2021 as the defence is brought up to its full height. Works will continue until June 2021 to restore the areas affected to their previous states.</p>

<p>The project has received funding from a number of government sources, with CEMEX UK contributing all of the clay required to construct new flood banks.</p>

<p>Sara Haddon, Chair South Ferriby Parish Council Flood Protection Committee, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We are sorry about the disruption caused by this road closure, but it marks an important stage in the construction of the new flood defences. We are looking forward to later this year when the work is complete and residents will be able to face next winter knowing that the likelihood of flooding is much reduced.</p>
