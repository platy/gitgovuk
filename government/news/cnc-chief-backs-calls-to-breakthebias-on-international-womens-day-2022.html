<p>More than 60% of the <abbr title="Civil Nuclear Constabulary">CNC</abbr>’s 300-strong police staff are female, with over 30% in senior management positions.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Civil Nuclear Constabulary">CNC</abbr> also boasts one of the highest numbers of female Authorised Firearms Officers (<abbr title="Authorised Firearms Officers">AFO</abbr>) in the country, with 14%, while over 70 women are trained in specialist roles, such as: firearms commander, police medic, enhanced carbine, launcher and interdiction team.</p>

<p>Chief Constable Simon Chesterman aims to do even more to #BreakTheBias by attracting women to the force while increasing the number in senior positions.</p>

<p>He said: “It’s important that we take time to celebrate <abbr title="International Women's Day">IWD</abbr> because the <abbr title="Civil Nuclear Constabulary">CNC</abbr> is built on equality, fairness and inclusivity – it is, rightly, the heart of everything we do.</p>

<p>“I am proud that the <abbr title="Civil Nuclear Constabulary">CNC</abbr> has a higher number of female AFOs than the national average, but there is always more we can do.</p>

<p>“The <abbr title="Civil Nuclear Constabulary">CNC</abbr> is a diverse, inclusive force, and we will continue to push for gender equality. It is reassuring, however, to know we are on the right path as reading the stories and hearing from our female colleagues on International Women’s Day 2022 attest to.”</p>

<p>DCC Harrison is <abbr title="Civil Nuclear Constabulary">CNC</abbr>’s most senior female and is responsible only to Chief Constable Chesterman.</p>

<p>Her role is to develop and maintain <abbr title="Civil Nuclear Constabulary">CNC</abbr>’s ability to deliver its mission.</p>

<p>She said: “<abbr title="International Women's Day">IWD</abbr> gives me the opportunity to reflect on the brilliant work that has been achieved by our female staff and officers over the last 12 months.</p>

<p>“<abbr title="International Women's Day">IWD</abbr> is a time to celebrate the great women we have at <abbr title="Civil Nuclear Constabulary">CNC</abbr>, the innovation, determination, courage and hard work they put in.</p>

<p>“It also allows us to shine a spotlight on the men, women, family and friends who power and facilitate our women to be brilliant.</p>

<p>“As the most senior female officer in <abbr title="Civil Nuclear Constabulary">CNC</abbr>, I realise we are incredibly lucky to have such great representation across the organisation, but we can’t be complacent. We still have some way to go ensure parity is seen and felt across the organisation.</p>

<p><abbr title="International Women's Day">IWD</abbr> is celebrated annually on 8 March, and has been since 1911. It celebrates women’s achievements and increasing visibility, while calling out inequality.</p>
