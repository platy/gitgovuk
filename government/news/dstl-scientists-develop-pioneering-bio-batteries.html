<p>Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (<abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>) scientists are working on bio-batteries powered by deoxyribonucleic acid (<abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>) which could ‘change the world and change the way we do things’.</p>

<p>The pioneering work is a collaborative project with Touchlight Genetics, the Office of Naval Research Global (<abbr title="Office of Naval Research Global">ONRG</abbr>) from the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> Department of Defense, and the University of Utah.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>’s Synthetic Biology Lead Petra Oyston said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of things that is really clear is that power and batteries is a big need for defence, to have alternatives.</p>

  <p>The current battery technology that our soldiers are using is containing a lot of energy in chemical format and if that battery gets shot for example it’s going to explode and burst into flames.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Our bio-battery is made out of <abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, enzymes, lactate and water. If you shot it it would just go splat so there’s a significant safety benefit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She went on to say that this idea was scalable and could take the form of large batteries, batteries too small to see or a completely new format such as a coating.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://youtu.be/z1HQl6-oadY" rel="external">Bio-Batteries: The Power of <abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr></a></p>

<p>The concept behind the batteries is to use naturally occurring products such as lactate.</p>

<p>This is then degraded using enzymes, which release electrons, which are then captured and can be used as power.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office of Naval Research Global">ONRG</abbr> Chief Scientist Patrick Rose said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For defence our warfighters continue to carry more and more electronics that require the power and that means carrying batteries with them.</p>

  <p>These batteries might provide a solution, a greener solution to generating power.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It feels absolutely fantastic to be involved in these types of projects. The impact for defence as well as for society at large will be multi-fold.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Touchlight Genetics Head of Platforms Tom Adie said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s really interesting to occasionally, step back and see where it’s going to go.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It has applications in so many areas potentially that it’s sort of exciting to think about.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He added that it could be “dried down” and reconstituted when needed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">You have an incredibly energy-dense battery that can be carried very portably. It’s very light and you can reconstitute it anywhere: seawater, freshwater. So you can carry it on ships; you can carry it in disaster areas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He added that Touchlight is unique in the scale, speed and quality of <abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> it produces.</p>

<p>The project, which started in 2017, is being funded by <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> and <abbr title="Office of Naval Research Global">ONRG</abbr>. Touchlight Genetics are undertaking the work to produce the <abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> at scale while the University of Utah are working on the enzyme optimisation and cascade evolution.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> Military Adviser Andrew said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s vital in this day and age that the army considers sustainability and its impact on the environment.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This is the type of project that offers the military amazing benefits. It will save lives. It is the sort of technology defence needs.</p>
