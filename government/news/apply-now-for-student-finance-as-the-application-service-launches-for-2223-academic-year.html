<p>Full-time undergraduate students in England are being encouraged to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://studentfinance.campaign.gov.uk/" rel="external">apply now</a> for student finance, as the application service opens for the 22/23 academic year. The Student Loans Company (SLC) expects approximately 1.5 million full-time, undergraduate students to apply for funding this year and the advice is to get applications in early.</p>

<p>Students in England can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://studentfinance.campaign.gov.uk/" rel="external">apply</a> for Tuition Fee Loans to cover their fees and Maintenance Loans to help with living costs.</p>

<p>By applying before the deadline (20 May 2022 for new students and 24 June 2022 for returning students) students can ensure they will have their finance in place for the start of term. Even if they are unsure on what course they will be doing or what university they will be attending, SLC is still encouraging students to apply now.</p>

<p>Applications can take six to eight weeks to process, and students do not need to contact us during this time.  As soon as they have applied, they can check the progress of their application using the new application status tracker in their online account.  This shows them what stage their application is at currently.  Applicants can also view a to do list of any outstanding actions required to support their application and will be contacted by text message or e-mail if any further information is required from them.</p>

<p>Chris Larmer, SLC Executive Director of Business Operations, said: 
“SLC exists to enable opportunity for students to invest in their futures through access to further and higher education. We want students to get their higher education journey off to the best start by ensuring they have their finances in place at the start of term. That’s why we are encouraging them to apply now for their student finance.</p>

<p>“We want to make it as easy as possible for students to access student finance and to support them resources are available <a class="govuk-link" href="https://studentfinance.campaign.gov.uk/" rel="external">online</a> and they can follow Student Finance England (SFE) on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/SFEngland/" rel="external">Facebook</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://twitter.com/SF_England" rel="external">Twitter</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/studentfinance_england" rel="external">Instagram</a> for all the latest student finance updates. We’ve also made it easier for students to check the status of their application using the new application status tracker in their SFE online account, and applicants can be assured that we will contact them via text message or e-mail if we require any further information to support their application.”</p>

<p>To help students apply for student finance, SLC has put together the following tips:</p>

<ul>
  <li>

  </li>
