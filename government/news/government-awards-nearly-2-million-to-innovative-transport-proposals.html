  <li>creative entrepreneurs awarded share of £1.95 million to revolutionise UK’s transport network</li>
  <li>projects include technology to protect public transport systems from extreme weather conditions and proposals to reduce carbon emissions from HGVs</li>
  <li>government-backed projects will help support a greener and more efficient transport future, as UK drives towards net zero targets</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Entrepreneurs and innovators pioneering new ways of creating a more efficient transport system are being backed by government funding announced today (13 April 2022).</p>

<p>In total, 51 projects have been awarded a share of £1.95 million in Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>) funding as part of the government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transport-technology-research-innovation-grants-t-trig-funding-winners">Transport Research and Innovation Grant (<abbr title="Transport Research and Innovation Grant">TRIG</abbr>) programme</a>, the largest number of projects backed in the programme’s history.</p>

<p>One winner, Makesense Technology Ltd, will develop a technology to guide visually impaired people through the public transport network. A handheld device will scan the area and provide touch feedback, such as a vibration to the tablet holder, alerting them to any obstacles and their direction of travel.</p>

<p>AJEA Products Ltd is also among those awarded funding, creating autonomous flood protection for critical transport infrastructure. It will design self-deploying barriers that can be installed at train stations across the UK and pop up automatically when floods are detected, preventing passenger journeys from being disrupted by extreme weather.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Unitrove Innovation Ltd is being backed to develop a control system for the world’s first liquid hydrogen fuel container facility for zero emission ships (as seen in the image above).</p>

<p>The University of Cambridge is developing a new low-cost and lightweight steering system for heavy goods vehicles (<abbr title="heavy goods vehicles">HGVs</abbr>), which will reduce tyre wear, reduce carbon emissions and make it easier for larger vehicles to manoeuvre on the road.</p>

<p>Transport Minister Trudy Harrison said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Innovation funded as part of <abbr title="Transport Research and Innovation Grant">TRIG</abbr> could be the key to unlocking a more efficient and safer transport system for tomorrow.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I support the ingenious ideas of this year’s cohort every step of the way and wish the successful applicants all the very best. I look forward to seeing the ideas develop to boost our green agenda and create high-skilled jobs across the UK.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now in its 11th round of funding, the <abbr title="Transport Research and Innovation Grant">TRIG</abbr> programme, delivered in partnership with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://cp.catapult.org.uk/" rel="external">Connected Places Catapult</a>, brings together talented start-ups – mainly SMEs and universities – and policymakers at the earliest stage of innovation to help enhance the UK’s transport system.</p>

<p>Since launching in 2014, over £6 million in grants has supported more than 200 <abbr title="Transport Research and Innovation Grant">TRIG</abbr> projects.</p>

<p>This year, the programme focused on increasing the diversity of its applicants. From Southampton to the Shetland Islands, the winning projects are based across the UK and reflect <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>’s commitments to levelling up.</p>

<p>The winners were selected based on 4 key themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maritime decarbonisation</li>
  <li>future of freight</li>
  <li>COVID-19 recovery</li>
  <li>transport resilience</li>
</ul>

<p>An open call, where any transport related idea was also considered.</p>

<p>For the first time, 6 Future of Freight grants worth £100,000 each were piloted for larger projects, moving them past ‘proof of concept’ and towards being demonstration ready. These will complement remaining 45 grants of up to £30,000 each, spread across all 4 themes.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> will also be working in partnership with Connected Places Catapult this year to pilot an Innovation Accelerator Programme, which will support companies at a later stage in their innovation journeys. The programme will provide funding to help projects take the last step towards the market by providing bespoke training from industry experts.</p>

<p>Rachel Gardner-Poole, Connected Places Catapult, Chief Operating Officer said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><abbr title="Transport Research and Innovation Grant">TRIG</abbr> is a one-of-a-kind programme. It provides a mechanism to identify and support early-stage innovation that might slip through the nets of traditional funding routes.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Connected Places Catapult is extremely proud to deliver <abbr title="Transport Research and Innovation Grant">TRIG</abbr> 2021, which is supporting over 50 innovators across 4 different challenges, including the future of freight, maritime decarbonisation, COVID-19 recovery and resilient transport systems. I am excited to see what great products and services arise.</p>
