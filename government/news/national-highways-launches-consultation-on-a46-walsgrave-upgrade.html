<p>The consultation period on the scheme starts on Tuesday 11 January with details about the project being uploaded onto the scheme website for people to look at.</p>

<p>Members of the public are invited to look at the design options with opportinuties to speak to the National Highways project team about the work in a series of online events taking place later this month.</p>

<p>Following detailed analysis of four design options by National Highways at Walsgrave junction, one of these options has been found to deliver the required improvements at Walsgrave.</p>

<p>The vital upgrade work to the junction is set to cost between £75m and £125m with a final cost set to be determined later in the process following detailed design work.</p>

<p>National Highways Project Manager, Joe Mulqueen said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The viable design option for the Walsgrave junction is incredibly exciting and it’s an important scheme on the A46 in Coventry.</p>

  <p>We know that this junction is incredibly busy and once the scheme is complete, it will alleviate congestion at a well-known bottleneck on the A46.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We’re looking forward to speaking to people to find out what comments they have and to hear their feedback.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Due to the ongoing coronavirus situation, events will be held online through Microsoft Teams.</p>

<p>These events will take place on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Thursday 20 January from 6pm to 8pm</li>
  <li>Wednesday 26 January from 12pm to 2pm</li>
  <li>Saturday 29 January from 11am to 1pm</li>
</ul>

<p>Meeting invitations will be posted on the National Highways webpage ahead of each session. Those unable to attend the online events can also speak to the project team with a special telephone call back service.</p>

<p>The A46 is a strategic link between the East and West Midlands and connects Coventry and Warwickshire to the motorway network.</p>

<p>The Government’s Road Investment Strategy (RIS2) 2020 - 2025 included a commitment to the A46 Coventry Junctions scheme, which includes upgrading both the Binley and the Walsgrave junctions.</p>

<p>Work is currently taking place at Binley to create a new £61m flyover set for completion in early 2022.</p>

<p>Current levels of congestion at Walsgrave and the impacts this has on journey time reliability, are having a serious effect on communities and businesses and would constrain future development in the area.</p>

<p>Once the consultation has closed on Monday 14 February 2022, responses will be analysed and a consultation report will be produced summarising the feedback received.</p>

<p>National Highways will then consider the feedback, incorporating the comments received where possible, whilst completing further assessment and design work.</p>

<p>The preferred route announcement for the scheme is set to take place in summer this year and will be taken through to the next stage of design development.</p>

<p>To request a call back from the team, people should call 0300 123 5000 to discuss a suitable time to receive a call back from one of the team.</p>
