<p>Leading Glasgow employer, the Student Loans Company (SLC), has launched a recruitment campaign to encourage technology professionals in the central belt to apply for a range of technology and technical roles with the Company.</p>

<p>Launched as the organisation adopts the Young Person’s Guarantee, the campaign includes a new recruitment website and social media activity featuring current SLC colleagues talking about why they enjoy working at SLC.</p>

<p>SLC, which recently announced it is moving to a state-of-the-art development at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/student-loans-company-to-move-to-state-of-the-art-buchanan-wharf-development" class="govuk-link">Buchanan Wharf in Glasgow in 2023</a>, houses one of the largest public sector technology operations in Scotland. Its technology division, which is comprised of over 500 technical experts, is responsible for the underlying systems that process student finance for approximately 1.5 million students annually, advance funding to universities and colleges, and manage repayment services for graduates across the UK. In 2020-21, SLC paid out £11bn in tuition fee loans and manages a loan book worth £177.9bn.</p>

<p>The new technology and technical roles are critical to transforming SLC to become a more agile organisation through digital technologies and data transformation.</p>

<p>SLC’s Chief Information Officer, Stephen Campbell said: “SLC offers a dynamic working environment in which technology professionals are encouraged to <a href="https://careers.slc.co.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">unlock their potential</a>. We want people to join us who are passionate about shaping our future technology capability as we continue to embed industry leading systems to help us enable opportunity for future generations of students.</p>

<p>“Successful candidates will have the opportunity to develop their skills and experience working on a range of exciting technology projects. Our technology footprint is similar in scale and complexity to a retail bank and the new roles will be critical to designing systems that deliver an outstanding customer experience for students, graduates and further and higher education providers across the UK.”</p>

<p>As well as offering a competitive salary, SLC offers a range of benefits and rewards, including Civil Service pension scheme. SLC has introduced blended working, allowing colleagues to combine time working remotely with days in our office to support collaboration and team development.</p>
