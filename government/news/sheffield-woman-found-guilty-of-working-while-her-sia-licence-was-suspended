<p>Taggart, who was prosecuted by South Yorkshire Police, was sentenced to a 60 hours’ community service order to be completed within 12 months. She was also required to pay court costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £85.</p>

<p>Taggart was supplied to the Foxwood Embassy as a door supervisor by JKL Leisure and Pubs Ltd. SIA investigators and South Yorkshire Police licensing officers visited the venue and reviewed CCTV footage and the venue’s signing-in book on 20 March 2019. They found that Taggart had worked illegally on five occasions between 18 November 2018 and 08 March 2019. The SIA had suspended her licence on 10 April 2018 and eventually revoked it on 08 August 2019.</p>

<p>South Yorkshire Police took the lead on this prosecution, with the support of the SIA. Nigel Davies, the SIA’s Regional Criminal Investigation Manager for the East Region, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We are pleased to have worked with our enforcement partner, South Yorkshire Police, to prosecute Taggart successfully. She was clearly
told that it would be illegal for her to work in the private security industry while her licence was suspended. Nonetheless, she completely 
ignored this, lied to her employers about her licence, and put the Foxwood Embassy’s patrons at risk. This undermines the integrity of, 
and confidence in the SIA licensing regime. As a result she now has a criminal record.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notes to Editors:</p>

<p>By law, security operatives working under contract must hold and display a valid SIA licence. Information about SIA enforcement and penalties can be found on the website.</p>

<p>The offence relating to the Private Security Industry Act (2001) that is mentioned in the above news release is: Section 3 working without an SIA licence (suspended).</p>
