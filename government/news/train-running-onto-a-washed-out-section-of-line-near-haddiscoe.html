<p>At around 07:45 hrs on 30 January 2022, the 07:25 hrs Greater Anglia service from Norwich to Lowestoft ran onto a section of track between Reedham and Haddiscoe stations where the supporting ballast and embankment was being washed out by water. This water was flowing from the Haddiscoe New Cut waterway, which is on the north-east side of the railway, across the line and into the Haddiscoe Marshes.</p>

<p>As the train approached the section of track concerned, the driver of the train noticed what appeared to be standing water on the line ahead and started braking. The train, which was formed of three passenger vehicles and a power car, stopped with its front carriage above the flowing water. Over the next twenty minutes the flowing water caused all support for the track to be lost and the track sank significantly, causing the front carriage to tilt forwards and sideways. The driver attempted to move the train back clear of the damaged section of track, but this proved impossible because of the angle of the front carriage. The driver and guard evacuated the five passengers from the train onto the track, and a rescue train was arranged to convey them back to Reedham station.</p>

<p>No one was hurt in the incident and the train was subsequently recovered undamaged. However, the washout caused damage to the track and supporting formation and the line was closed for a week while these were repaired.</p>

<p>The incident occurred following a significant tidal surge, which impeded drainage from the Broadland rivers and raised the level of the Haddiscoe New Cut at the location of the accident to the extent that water overtopped the flood defences. The Environment Agency had issued a Flood Warning covering the area, but the water level at Reedham and Haddiscoe was not predicted to be higher than the flood defences.</p>

<p>Our investigation will seek to identify the sequence of events which led to the accident. It will also consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the management of the flood defences in the area</li>
  <li>the adequacy of the flood warning systems used by the railway industry</li>
  <li>Network Rail’s knowledge of the condition of assets external to the railway, such as flood defences, whose condition and management can affect the safety of the railway</li>
  <li>any underlying factors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our investigation is independent of any investigation by the railway industry or by the industry’s regulator, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.orr.gov.uk/" rel="external">Office of Rail and Road</a>.</p>

<p>We will publish our findings, including any recommendations to improve safety, at the conclusion of our investigation. This report will be available on our website.</p>
