<div data-module="govspeak" class="gem-c-govspeak govuk-govspeak direction-ltr">
    
        <div class="govspeak">
<p>This week marks four years since the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr> first adopted use of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ministry-of-defence-police-project-servator" class="govuk-link">Project Servator</a> a policing tactic that aims to disrupt a range of criminal activity, including terrorism, while providing a reassuring presence for the Defence community and public.</p>

<p>Even at distance Project Servator officers can still use their specialist training to spot the tell-tale signs of criminal activity or intent. Our Project Servator deployments have continued, with suitable social distancing, during the <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> pandemic and have expanded to include <abbr title="Her Majesty">HM</abbr> Naval Base Devonport and the surrounding area, with our officers often working in partnership with their colleagues in Devon and Cornwall Police. We are also currently trialling Project Servator at <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Menwith Hill, with joined up working alongside North Yorkshire Police.</p>

<p>In addition to operational delivery of Project Servator, and since late 2019, we have trained more than 950 people to watch out for signs of potential criminal activity, in and around the defence sites from which <abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr> Project Servator officers operate. From March 2020, the <a href="https://www.cpni.gov.uk/Scan" rel="external" class="govuk-link">See Check and Notify (<abbr title="See Check and Notify">SCaN</abbr>)</a> training has been delivered by us remotely, working with Base security teams, partners, stakeholders, local businesses and employers. This training has been undertaken in accordance with the ongoing <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> restrictions.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/118076/SCaN_logo_-_Crown_Copyright.jpg" alt="The SCAN link logo. "></div>

<p>As Superintendent Steffen Morgan-Fisher, <abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr> Project Servator Strategic Lead, explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over the past year we have continued to build a network of vigilant contacts across the Defence estate and in the surrounding communities. Using <abbr title="See Check and Notify">SCaN</abbr> training and our Project Servator deployments, we have further promoted a security minded culture and enhanced onsite resilience and our interoperable working relationships with security partners. This means that more people in and around the sites we protect, now have a better understanding of what to look out for and the importance of reporting anything suspicious that they see or hear, or that just doesn’t seem right.</p>

  <p>Project Servator is founded on a collective responsibility to be vigilant and that approach is as important as ever. It remains vital for now that people follow the rules to stop the spread of <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> but, the threat of terrorism has not gone away: the need to be alert in and around the sites we protect is still of the utmost importance.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I thank all who have taken part in <abbr title="See Check and Notify">SCaN</abbr> training and engaged with our Project Servator officers during the past year. Communities defeat terrorism and by working together, we can all help to keep each other and the nation’s defences safe.</p>
