<p>Two new hybrid trains recently joined our internal rail network at Sellafield, replacing older and less environmentally friendly engines.</p>

<p>It’s part of our plan to replace all our solely diesel locomotives with smaller all electric 40-tonne versions, making our rail operations 100% electrically powered in 2022.</p>

<p>The new CBD80 tonne locomotives, supplied by Clayton Equipment, are capable of being operated fully by electric and have the cleanest available diesel engines as back-up.</p>

<figcaption><p>The new CBD80 tonne locomotives, supplied by Clayton Equipment, are capable of being operated fully by electric and have the cleanest available diesel engines as back-up.</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>As part of our rail fleet they will safely move nuclear materials and wastes across our internal rail network that criss-crosses the Sellafield site, helping us deliver our purpose of creating a clean and safe environment for future generations.</p>

<p>Mark McSherry, from the Sellafield site railways team said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s been on the cards for a long time to replace some of the existing locos. Our existing fleet has done a great job keeping site operations going but they run on diesel, have high emissions, and aren’t environmentally friendly.</p>

  <p>These new locos are hybrid; they have the cleanest diesel engines available and are able to run completely on electric with on board battery charging.</p>

  <p>They are designed to reduce operations and maintenance costs and have reduced emissions, reducing our carbon footprint. It’s all positive.</p>

  <p>Our future aim is to reduce the fleet that we have and decommission two of the older locos and replace the remaining diesel model with a smaller all electric version, which will make our rail operations completely electrically powered.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We are still in the commissioning phase, but all the feedback is really good, they are easier and a lot smoother and quieter to drive. It also makes the job a lot easier and reduces rework as we can move more in one go.
“I would like to thank everyone involved, it has taken us three years to get to this point, but that time and commitment has paid off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clive Hannaford, managing director at Clayton Equipment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We are very pleased with this new order to supply Sellafield Ltd with sustainable, low emission, environmentally compliant equipment which meets their commitment to invest in technology and provide cost savings with long term durability.</p>
