  <li>new road to provide better access to Littlehampton and quicker journeys in the area</li>
  <li>scheme will boost local economy, supporting 1,260 new homes and 700 new jobs</li>
  <li>latest move in government’s drive to level up transport across the country</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>West Sussex is set to benefit from £11.8 million of government funding to construct the northern section of the Lyminster Bypass, Roads Minister Baroness Vere announced today (5 June 2021).</p>

<p>The planned scheme will link up with the southern section of the bypass, which is currently under construction, to complete a new 1.1-mile single carriageway running to the east of Lyminster and Wick villages.</p>

<p>The road will link a new junction on the A259 in Littlehampton to the A284 just south of the A27 at Crossbush, easing congestion, providing much-needed improvements to routes in and out of Littlehampton and supporting plans for 1,260 new homes and 700 new jobs in the region.</p>

<p>It comes as part of the government’s drive to build back better from the pandemic and boost transport links across the country.</p>

<p>Transport Minister Baroness Vere said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Local residents deserve quicker, easier and more reliable journeys in and out of Littlehampton and around West Sussex, and that’s exactly what this scheme will deliver, along with new jobs, houses and safer and better journeys for cyclists and pedestrians.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This government is committed to levelling up transport across the country, so that no matter where you live, you can get around easily and safely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Joy Dennis, West Sussex County Council’s Cabinet Member for Highways and Transport, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Department for Transport’s financial backing for the project to build the northern section of the A284 Lyminster Bypass is excellent news.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It shows confidence in the scheme which is designed to provide strategic north-south access to and from the A27 for residents, businesses and visitors alike, address congestion and remove delays caused by the level crossing at Wick.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Currently, journeys in and out of Littlehampton are often very slow along the narrow route into the town centre, with numerous delays caused by the Wick railway level crossing. The proposed bypass would provide motorists and road-users with a shorter and less congested route, slashing journey times and avoiding the level crossing.</p>

<p>A 3m-wide shared cycle and footway will run along one side of the road and a signalised crossing will be built so cyclists, pedestrians and horse riders can safely cross.</p>

<p>Councillor Keith Glazier, Chair of Transport for the South East, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The planned Lyminster Bypass will provide a vital connection between Littlehampton and the A27. This investment will help boost economic growth, support new housing and jobs, and will improve quality of life for local residents.</p>

  <p>A high-quality, reliable transport network is critical to our region’s economic recovery and future sustainable growth, so it’s good news that another of our top priority road schemes has received a major funding boost.</p>

  <p class="last-child">By speaking with one voice to influence where and how money is spent in our region, the Transport for the South East partnership is making a real difference for the 7.5 million people who live and work in the South East.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The total cost of the scheme comes to £21.6 million, with the remaining £9.8 million coming from West Sussex County Council, Coast to Capital Local Enterprise Partnership and private developers, on top of the Department for Transport’s multimillion-pound contribution.</p>

<p>Today’s announcement is the latest investment from the government in transport in West Sussex, with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/17-million-to-make-journeys-in-west-sussex-quicker-and-greener">£17 million funding awarded last year towards improvements to the A2300 at Burgess Hill</a>.</p>
