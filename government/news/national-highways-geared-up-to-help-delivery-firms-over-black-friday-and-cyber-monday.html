<p>Almost 98 per cent of England’s major A-roads and motorway network will be free from roadworks between 8pm on Sunday 28 November through to 6am on Friday 3 December.</p>

<p>With many orders being processed after Black Friday, the removal of roadworks on major routes coincides with expected delivery dates to customers.</p>

<p>National Highways is also encouraging motorists heading out on the roads in search of a bargain to think about checking their vehicle before setting off.</p>

<p>National Highways Customer Services Director, Melanie Clarke said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We know that many people will be purchasing goods on both Black Friday and Cyber Monday and that’s why we’re doing our bit to help.</p>

  <p>We’ve worked hard to lift and complete as many roadworks as it’s safe to do so to help make journeys as smooth as possible and that’s why we’re keeping around 98 per cent of the road network we manage free from roadworks.</p>

  <p>And we’re asking drivers to be prepared as well. We know from experience that almost half of breakdowns can easily be avoided if motorists carry out simple vehicle checks before their journeys.</p>

  <p class="last-child">So, before you set off, check traffic conditions, check your vehicle, and make sure you’re aware of the signs and signals on motorways.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The removal of roadworks has been welcomed by the haulage sector. Mark O’Doherty, Director UK Linehaul, DHL Express UK said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">At this exceptionally busy time, we welcome the suspension of almost 400 miles of roadworks to support us in keeping our network running efficiently, enabling swift delivery for our customers. This approach is something we would like to see more often going forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Natalie Chapman, Head of Policy – South at Logistics UK said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">For the logistics sector, the run up to Christmas is always our busiest trading period. After such a challenging year, the removal of roadworks, and the delays they can cause  – which can slow the passage of vehicles and the goods they are transporting to their destination – is much appreciated, and will provide much needed reassurance for our sector.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Things to consider include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check fuel: Make sure you have enough to get to your destination</li>
  <li>Check tyres: check your tyre pressure and the condition of your tyres, including the spare. Look out for cuts or wear and make sure the tyres have a minimum tread depth of 1.6mm, which is the legal limit</li>
  <li>Check engine oil: Use your dipstick to check oil before any long journey, and top up if needed - take your car back to the garage if you’re topping up more than usual</li>
  <li>Check water: To ensure you have good visibility, always keep your screen wash topped up so you can clear debris or dirt off your windscreen</li>
  <li>Check your lights: If your indicators, hazard lights, headlights, fog lights, reverse lights or brake lights are not functioning properly, you are putting yourself at risk. In addition, light malfunctions can be a reason for your vehicle to fail its MOT</li>
</ul>
