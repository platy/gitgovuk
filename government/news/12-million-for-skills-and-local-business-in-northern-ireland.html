<p>More than 30 projects across Northern Ireland are set to receive a share of over £12 million to help people into work, boost productivity and grow local economies, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove announced today (3rd November).  </p>

<p>The Community Renewal Fund will pilot new programmes that invest in people, boost skills and support local business – to build more communities that people are proud to call home.  </p>

<p>The Fund is supporting around 500 projects in towns, villages and coastal communities across the whole United Kingdom to ensure that no place is left behind as the Government delivers on its commitment to level up the country.  </p>

<p>Many of the successful projects are also supporting the UK’s path to net zero carbon emissions, giving businesses creating clean technology a boost and ensuring that jobs are future proof. For example, £426,000 will help small businesses in Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon innovate and reduce their carbon footprint.   </p>

<p>Other projects being funded include:  </p>

<ul>
  <li>£310,000 to build skills for learning, life and work in Belfast, providing opportunities for young people who have struggled in mainstream education.</li>
  <li>£73,000 will support neurodiverse people with conditions such as Tourette’s, OCD, ADHD and Dyslexia in Antrim and Newtownabbey to secure employment and prepare for the world of work.</li>
  <li>£458,210 to support the creation of a pilot programme targeting the Mid South West region, focussing on economic development and Net Zero projects.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Secretary of State for Levelling Up Michael Gove said:</h4>
<p>“The UK Government is determined to help local communities across Northern Ireland realise their full potential.</p>

<p>“Awards from the UK Community Renewal Fund announced today will support projects which create jobs, provide new opportunities for young people and help us to achieve net zero carbon emissions.”</p>

<h4>Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis said:</h4>
<p>“With £12million to support more than 30 projects, this is an exciting time for Northern Ireland. The Community Renewal Fund will support voluntary groups, businesses and social enterprises across Northern Ireland to deliver innovative new programmes.</p>

<p>“This fund shows how the UK Government is committed to unlocking the true potential of Northern Ireland, investing in its skills, creating jobs and backing local projects.”</p>

<p>Local authorities were invited to bid for funding from the Community Renewal Fund in May.  </p>

<p>The £200 million funding through the UK Community Renewal Fund will help local areas prepare for the launch of the UK Shared Prosperity Fund in 2022, the scheme that will see UK-wide funding at least match EU money, reaching around £1.5 billion a year.  </p>

<p>In last week’s Budget, the UK Government announced investment of more than £49 million directly into communities in Northern Ireland, through the Levelling Up and Community Ownership funds, for big regeneration projects and smaller community initiatives. </p>

  <li>Investment from EU Structural Funds will continue to be spent by local areas until 2023 and the Government has committed to at least matching EU receipts through the new UK Shared Prosperity Fund, on average reaching around £1.5 billion a year. This new Fund, to be launched in 2022, will operate throughout the UK and play a part in uniting and levelling up the whole country. </li>
