<p>The two gas fitters appeared at Bradford Crown Court on 21 March 2022 for sentencing after they pleaded guilty to offences against the Insolvency Act 1986.</p>

<p>Colin Richard Marsh (52) received an 8-month sentence, suspended for 2 years, 250 hours of unpaid work and was disqualified from being a director for 5 years.</p>

<p>His business partner, Robert Farrell (52), received an 18-month community order, 120 hours unpaid work and was also banned from being a director for 3 years.</p>

<p>During proceedings, the court heard that Colin Marsh and Robert Farrell were directors of Direct Laundry Installations Limited before the company was placed into creditors voluntary liquidation in October 2015.</p>

<p>The liquidation triggered an investigation by the Insolvency Service into the conduct of the two gas fitters before investigators uncovered a series of offences.</p>

<p>Prior to Direct Laundry Installations’ liquidation, the two gas fitters incorporated a second company in July 2015 called Direct Laundry and Steam Installations Limited.</p>

<p>The second company, however, breached insolvency law as it had a similar name, traded from the same address, and carried out the same activities as the liquidated company.</p>

<p>Further inquiries uncovered that during the insolvency proceedings of the first company, Colin Marsh and Robert Farrell repeatedly failed to deliver up the company books and records to the liquidators.</p>

<p>The pair also failed to properly explain why £68,000 was transferred out of Direct Laundry Installations’ bank accounts, while providing a falsely backdated invoice in the name of the second company to justify the payment.</p>

<p>Investigators also uncovered the first company, Direct Laundry Installations, was fined £12,000 for a dangerous gas installation whilst unlicensed but the fine was never paid.</p>

<p>In October 2017 the two gas fitters signed disqualification undertakings and agreed not to act as company directors for 7 seven years. Colin Marsh and Robert Farrell, however, failed to resign from the second company for nearly 5 months and continued to run Direct Laundry and Steam Installations behind the scenes which was illegal.</p>

<p>Colin Marsh was charged with one offence for reusing a prohibited company name. Robert Farrell was charged with one offence for failing to co-operate with the office holder and one offence of falsely backdating an invoice contrary to the Theft Act 1968.</p>

<p>Julie Barnes, Chief Investigator for the Insolvency Service, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The law is clear that when a company is insolvent, the directors are strictly not allowed to start a new company with a similar sounding name before continuing as they had before with no consequences. This is to protect businesses and customers from being duped by directors who fail to run a business in a proper and professional manner.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Colin Marsh and Robert Farrell, however, totally abused the insolvency regime when they incorporated a near-identical second company while they were in the throws of winding-up the first failed business. Their conduct was totally reckless and their sentences should serve as a warning that we will prosecute company directors who break the law.</p>
</blockquote>
