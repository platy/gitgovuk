  <li>
    <p>Report published as UK-Taiwan Trade Talks affirm collaboration on renewable energy, pioneering offshore wind power for generations to come.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>On 20 October 2021, the British Office Taipei supported the British Chamber of Commerce in Taipei to launch a new report on the representation of women in Taiwan’s offshore wind industry. The report was produced by the British Chamber of Commerce in Taipei’s Women in Business Committee and the UK Renewables Committee.</p>

<p>Attending the launch event, Natalie Black, Her Majesty’s Trade Commissioner for Asia Pacific welcomed the new study highlighting the proportion of women working in Taiwan’s offshore wind sector, including many in leadership roles setting the future direction of the industry.</p>

<p>The survey results show a higher proportion of women working in offshore wind in Taiwan (26% women) compared with the global wind average (21% women) and the Asia Pacific wind average (15% women). 
The survey also revealed that Taiwan’s offshore wind industry has a high level of female representation at management level. 95% of offshore wind companies have women line managers and 60% have female directors, many of whom are exercising significant influence over their companies and the industry.</p>

<p>The insight interviews indicate that Taiwan offshore wind’s progressive status is due to high levels of social acceptance of women in leadership positions, a pool of strong female talent and the motivation of these women to work in a sector that benefits society.</p>

<p>Although there is a higher proportion of women in offshore wind in Taiwan than in other markets, it is still some way behind most other industries in Taiwan. Women are still underrepresented in the wind industry and action is required.</p>

<p>The report identified three key areas for the industry to address barriers to gender equality: the education of women in technology and engineering subjects; the promotion of careers in offshore wind for women; improved policies to support women with families.</p>

<p>Welcoming the report, Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs issued a statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Taiwan has been actively developing offshore wind power and positively responding to climate change in recent years. We are pleased to see high participation of women in this field, making Taiwan’s offshore wind industry more diverse and innovative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Natalie Black, Her Majesty’s Trade Commissioner for Asia Pacific, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I am delighted that the British Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan has shone a light on the immense opportunities in offshore wind. As the world focusses on tackling climate change, it is more important than ever to turn words into action and support not only this important sector but also the people who are ensuring we realise its potential. I am inspired by the women who are leading this crucial sector at every level.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marina Hsu, Chairperson of Taiwan Offshore Wind Industry Association said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">A decade ago Taiwan’s offshore wind industry was just burgeoning and was widely dominated by men. Up until today, many still perceived it as an unsuitable sector for women. We are proud to say that all the TOWIA member companies are dedicated to support and encourage more women to join the wind sector. Today, many prominent leaders in the Taiwanese offshore wind industry are women. There has been a sea change in women’s representation in Taiwan, but we shall not be complacent, we shall know there is always work to be done to inspire, attract and retain more women in this sector.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maya Malik, Offshore Wind Project Director &amp; BCCT Women in Business advisor said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">During my 20 year career in energy, I have quite often been the only woman in the room. The higher level the meeting, the fewer women. In the early days of Taiwan offshore wind I went to several cross-industry meetings where half the room were women, and many of the speakers were women. I was pleasantly surprised, as were many others. Something special is happening in Taiwan.</p>
