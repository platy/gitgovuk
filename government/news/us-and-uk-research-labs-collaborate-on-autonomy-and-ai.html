<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory (<abbr title="Air Force Research Laboratory">AFRL</abbr>), in partnership with the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (<abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>), have demonstrated for the first time the ability for the US and the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to jointly develop, select, train, and deploy state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in support of the armed forces of each of the 2 nations.</p>

<p>This research is designed to support adjacent collaborating US and <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> brigades with enduring wide-area situational awareness. It aims to improve decision-making, increase operational tempo, reduce risk to life, and reduce manpower burden.</p>

<p>The dual in-person and virtual demonstration was hosted jointly at <abbr title="Air Force Research Laboratory">AFRL</abbr>’s Information Directorate in Rome, New York, and at <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>’s site near Salisbury on 18 October 2021. The demonstration highlighted integrated artificial intelligence (<abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>) technologies across the 2 nations, showcasing the ability to share data and algorithms through a common development and deployment platform to enable the rapid selection, testing, and deployment of artificial intelligence capabilities.</p>

<p>The event was made possible by a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and US Partnership Agreement concerning autonomy and artificial intelligence collaboration, established in December 2020. This was the first of a rotational series of events to be hosted by the joint and international signatories of the Autonomy and Artificial Intelligence Collaboration (<abbr title="Autonomy and Artificial Intelligence Collaboration">AAIC</abbr>) Partnership Agreement.</p>

<p>Leadership participants from both the US and the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> attended in person, with virtual participation by attendees from all services and the United States Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (<abbr title="Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering">OUSDR&amp;E</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Autonomy and Artificial Intelligence Collaboration">AAIC</abbr> Partnership Agreement effort is led by the United States Department of the Air Force (with <abbr title="Air Force Research Laboratory">AFRL</abbr> as the lead agency for the US Air Force) in partnership with <abbr title="Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering">OUSDR&amp;E</abbr>, the US Navy and Army, and the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>.</p>

<p>Dr Robert W Sadowski, US Army <abbr title="U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command">DEVCOM</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are dedicated to getting robotics and autonomous systems capability into the hands of the warfighters.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Advances in robotics and autonomy will make our formations more capable and mission-ready while providing protection to our warfighters through unprecedented stand-off while enabling enhanced lethality on the battlefield.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 4-year partnership agreement includes objectives to accelerate joint <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>/US development and sharing of <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> technology and capabilities. It spans from foundational research in test verification and validation, to <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> algorithm research and development, to joint experiments advancing the joint all-domain command and control capabilities of both nations.</p>

<p>Dr Lee M Seversky, <abbr title="Air Force Research Laboratory">AFRL</abbr> lead for the demonstration and the US Project Agreement, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The October 18 event demonstrated how the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and US can integrate <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> technology to create the first end-to-end machine learning research, development, and deployment ecosystem, enabling rapid data sharing, algorithm development, evaluation, and deployment.</p>

  <p class="last-child"><abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> will play a critical role in accelerating decision making to meet the pace and scale of the future battlespace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During the demonstration, the simulated scenario focused on how the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and US can cooperate and share <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> capabilities to support the ‘close’ fight. Where both countries operate in adjacent areas, they are able to share data, <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> algorithms and capability tightly during mission execution.</p>

<p>The demonstration brought together key technologies from both nations. The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s Model Cards are able to present to a commander the ability to quickly understand, explore, and select appropriate machine learning (<abbr title="machine learning">ML</abbr>) models to deploy in mission. The US StreamlinedML is a government-owned, extensible open platform to quickly build <abbr title="machine learning">ML</abbr> workflows, train and evaluate <abbr title="machine learning">ML</abbr> models, and deploy them regardless of the source or <abbr title="machine learning">ML</abbr> software stack use – taking advantage of the best of breed <abbr title="machine learning">ML</abbr> technology spanning commercial, academia and government.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>’s Todd Robinson heads up the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> element to the project, and said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This collaboration with <abbr title="Air Force Research Laboratory">AFRL</abbr> and the US services is crucial to drive the very latest <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> technology into military operations and innovative research in both nations.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The demonstration is just the first step toward our ambition of deploying novel <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> that can learn in the field into an experimental trial environment, something that hasn’t been done before and is only possible due to this collaboration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The demonstration successfully showed the integration of 15 state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, 12 <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and US datasets, 5 automated <abbr title="machine learning">ML</abbr> workflows for training and retraining models based on mission needs, and the ability deploy the models as a service to target end users and platforms.</p>

<p>This is the first of a series of joint technical and operation experiments planned under the 4 year partnership agreement.</p>
