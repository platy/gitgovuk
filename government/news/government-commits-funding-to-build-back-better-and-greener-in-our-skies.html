</div>

<p>Faster, quieter and greener journeys&nbsp;by air&nbsp;are one step closer today (21 January 2022) thanks to a further £3.7 million&nbsp;investment in&nbsp;redesigning the UK’s motorways in the sky, the government has confirmed.</p>

<p>The funding will support&nbsp;our programme&nbsp;to modernise the UK’s airspace&nbsp;for the first time since the 1950s, helping the aviation industry build back better from the COVID-19 pandemic and create a&nbsp;resilient,&nbsp;efficient&nbsp;airspace&nbsp;that is&nbsp;fit for&nbsp;the future.</p>

<p>It will support airports to develop new, more efficient flight routes that make use of&nbsp;modern&nbsp;technology,&nbsp;such as performance-based navigation, which will enable aircraft to fly more precise routes.</p>

<p>Today’s&nbsp;£3.7 million&nbsp;in&nbsp;new funding&nbsp;brings the total funding to £9.2 million, after an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/55-million-to-drive-improvements-to-uks-motorways-in-the-sky" class="govuk-link">initial round of&nbsp;investment in March 2021</a>, and is being provided on an exceptional basis while the sector recovers from the impacts of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Aviation Minister Robert Courts announced&nbsp;the&nbsp;funding&nbsp;boost from London City Airport,&nbsp;one of the&nbsp;airports to receive a share of the initial funding last year.</p>

<p>Aviation Minister Robert Courts said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By redesigning our skies, we are creating a modern UK airspace that is fit for future generations and makes journeys quicker, quieter and greener.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This £3.7 million funding will support the industry&nbsp;in upgrading our airspace, allowing the&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;sector&nbsp;to&nbsp;continue to grow while we build back greener,&nbsp;cut carbon emissions&nbsp;and&nbsp;deliver on our ambitious plans to reach jet zero.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mark Swan, Head of the Airspace Change Organising Group (ACOG), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The announcement of today’s funding enables the industry to move on confidently to the next stage of modernising the UK’s airspace.</p>

  <p>This programme is a critical national infrastructure project for the UK and will deliver benefits across the country – from increasing efficiencies in the routes aircraft fly to supporting the industry to deliver its net zero targets.</p>

  <p>With airspace not updated since the 1950s, it remains a programme that is long overdue.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Today’s additional funding maintains momentum behind the programme following its remobilisation and we look forward to our continued engagement with the government, <abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr> and airspace change sponsors in delivering airspace modernisation for the country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The airport sponsors of the programme will resume responsibility for funding future stages, as the sector continues its recovery.</p>

<p>Britain’s airspace is made up of a complex network of flight paths that have seen little development since they were designed 70 years ago, despite a surge in demand on our airspace from commercial planes to private aircraft, the military and drones.</p>

<p>In recent years, this has led to increased flight delays, noise and pollution. Without action, our congested airspace could have meant that passengers would have seen 30-minute delays on 1 in 3 flights by 2030.</p>

<p>Redesigning our airspace&nbsp;will enable&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;to fly more direct, precise routes, with faster climbs and a reduced need for holding patterns – cutting up to an approximate 600,000 tonnes of <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> annually, according to early analysis.</p>

<p>Alongside moving to best-in-class aircraft and more efficient aviation operations, airspace modernisation could help to deliver up to 36% of <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> savings by 2050.</p>

<p>Plans to modernise the UK’s airspace are just one of a number of&nbsp;measures that will make up the UK’s strategy to deliver net zero aviation by 2050, or jet zero, which is&nbsp;set to be published this year.</p>

<p>Today’s £3.7 million in&nbsp;funding will support airports to continue progressing through the second stage of the airspace change process, which involves developing and evaluating potential designs for changes to our airspace.</p>

<p>In the next stage,&nbsp;airports will launch public consultations on their proposed airspace changes.</p>
