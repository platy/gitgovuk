<p>The UK HPI is based on completed housing transactions. Typically, a house purchase can take 6 to 8 weeks to reach completion. The price data feeding into the September 2020 UK HPI will mainly reflect those agreements that occurred after the government measures to reduce the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) took hold.</p>

<h2 id="uk-house-prices">UK house prices</h2>

<p>UK house prices increased by 4.7% in the year to September 2020, up from 3.0% in August 2020. On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, average house prices in the UK increased by 1.7% between August 2020 and September 2020, compared with a rise of 0.1% during the same period a year earlier (August 2019 and September 2019).</p>

<p>The UK Property Transactions Statistics showed that in September 2020, on a seasonally adjusted basis, the estimated number of transactions of residential properties with a value of £40,000 or greater was 98,010. This is 0.7% lower than a year ago. Between August 2020 and September 2020, UK transactions increased by 21.3% on a seasonally adjusted basis.</p>

<p>House price growth was strongest in England where prices increased by 4.9% in the year to September 2020. The highest annual growth within the English regions was in the South West where average house prices grew by 6.4%. The lowest annual growth was in the North East, where prices increased by 3.3% in the year to September 2020.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The UK House Price Index (HPI) is published on the second or third Wednesday of each month with Northern Ireland figures updated quarterly. The October 2020 UK HPI will be published at 9.30am on Wednesday 16 December 2020. See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/about-the-uk-house-price-index/about-the-uk-house-price-index#uk-house-price-index-release-dates">calendar of release dates</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have made some changes to improve the accuracy of the UK HPI. We are not publishing average price and percentage change for new builds and existing resold property as done previously because there are not currently enough new build transactions to provide a reliable result. This means that in this month’s UK HPI reports, new builds and existing resold property are reported in line with the sales volumes currently available.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The UK HPI revision period has been extended to 13 months, following a review of the revision policy (see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/about-the-uk-house-price-index/about-the-uk-house-price-index#calculating-the-uk-hpi">calculating the UK HPI</a> section 4.4). This ensures the data used is more comprehensive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sales volume data is also available by property status (new build and existing property) and funding status (cash and mortgage) in our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/uk-house-price-index-data-downloads-september-2020?utm_medium=GOV.UK&ut">downloadable data tables</a>. Transactions involving the creation of a new register, such as new builds, are more complex and require more time to process. Read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/about-the-uk-house-price-index/about-the-uk-house-price-index#monthly-revision">revisions to the UK HPI data</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Revision tables have been introduced for England and Wales within the downloadable data. Tables will be available in csv format. See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/about-the-uk-house-price-index/about-the-uk-house-price-index#introduction">about the UK HPI</a> for more information.</p>

    <p>Data for the UK HPI is provided by HM Land Registry, Registers of Scotland, Land & Property Services/Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and the Valuation Office Agency.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The UK HPI is calculated by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Land & Property Services/Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency. It applies a hedonic regression model that uses the various sources of data on property price, in particular HM Land Registry’s Price Paid Dataset, and attributes to produce estimates of the change in house prices each month. Find out more about the methodology used from the <a rel="external" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/developmentofasingleofficialhousepriceindex">ONS</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.finance-ni.gov.uk/publications/lpsnisra-ni-house-price-index-methodology-report">Northern Ireland Statistics & Research Agency</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/monthly-property-transactions-completed-in-the-uk-with-value-40000-or-above">UK Property Transaction statistics</a>are taken from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) monthly estimates of the number of residential and non-residential property transactions in the UK and its constituent countries. The number of property transactions in the UK is highly seasonal, with more activity in the summer months and less in the winter. This regular annual pattern can sometimes mask the underlying movements and trends in the data series so HMRC also presents the UK aggregate transaction figures on a seasonally adjusted basis. Adjustments are made for both the time of year and the construction of the calendar, including corrections for the position of Easter and the number of trading days in a particular month.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>UK HPI seasonally adjusted series are calculated at regional and national levels only. See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/uk-house-price-index-data-downloads-september-2020?utm_medium=GOV.UK&ut">data tables</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first estimate for new build average price (June 2016 report) was based on a small sample which can cause volatility. A three-month moving average has been applied to the latest estimate to remove some of this volatility.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Work has been taking place since 2014 to develop a single, official HPI that reflects the final transaction price for sales of residential property in the UK. Using the geometric mean, it covers purchases at market value for owner-occupation and buy-to-let, excluding those purchases not at market value (such as re-mortgages), where the ‘price’ represents a valuation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Information on residential property transactions for England and Wales, collected as part of the official registration process, is provided by HM Land Registry for properties that are sold for full market value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The HM Land Registry dataset contains the sale price of the property, the date when the sale was completed, full address details, the type of property (detached, semi-detached, terraced or flat), if it is a newly built property or an established residential building and a variable to indicate if the property has been purchased as a financed transaction (using a mortgage) or as a non-financed transaction (cash purchase).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Repossession sales data is based on the number of transactions lodged with HM Land Registry by lenders exercising their power of sale.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For England, this is shown as volumes of repossession sales recorded by Government Office Region. For Wales, there is a headline figure for the number of repossession sales recorded in Wales.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The data can be downloaded as a .csv file. Repossession sales data prior to June 2016 is not available. Find out more information about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/about-the-uk-house-price-index/about-the-uk-house-price-index#repossessions">repossession sales</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Background tables of the raw and cleansed aggregated data, in Excel and CSV formats, are also published monthly although Northern Ireland is on a quarterly basis. They are available for free use and re-use under the Open Government Licence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>HM Land Registry’s mission is to guarantee and protect property rights in England and Wales.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>HM Land Registry is a government department created in 1862. Its ambition is to become the world’s leading land registry for speed, simplicity and an open approach to data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>HM Land Registry safeguards land and property ownership worth in excess of £7 trillion, including over £1 trillion of mortgages. The Land Register contains more than 25 million titles showing evidence of ownership for some 87% of the land mass of England and Wales.</p>
