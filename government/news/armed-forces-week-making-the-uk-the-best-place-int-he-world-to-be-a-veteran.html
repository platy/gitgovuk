<p>Throughout my childhood and teenage years, it was rare to see individual military personnel out and about on the streets in their uniforms in a way that we do today.</p>

<p>The terror threat to our service men and women from the IRA meant that the camouflage fatigues - a visual symbol of national pride, unity and belonging for those who serve – were often banned from being worn outside of military bases.</p>

<p>My first real memory of our armed forces and the significant sacrifice they make on our behalf therefore didn’t come until I was 10 years old.</p>

<p>Margaret Thatcher had just dispatched a Royal Navy taskforce to the Falkland Islands and each evening I would crouch in front of the living room TV to watch the news reports filed by the attached press corps.</p>

<p>I remember the striking footage of the Harrier jump jets scrambling from HMS Hermes to the now infamous words of BBC war correspondent Brian Hanrahan: “I counted them all out, and I counted them all back.”</p>

<p>And of course, the jubilant scenes of the aircraft carrier’s safe return to Portsmouth 108 days after she left, the dockside flanked by thousands of people waving Union Jacks.</p>

<p>It is those early childhood memories of sacrifice, pride and duty that came through so clearly on our TV screens - coupled with the lived experiences of those veterans I meet on a weekly basis – that underpin my ambition to make the UK the best place in the world to be a veteran.</p>

<p>But if we talk the talk of that ambition, we must walk the walk.</p>

<p>So that’s why, as we move towards the national celebration of Armed Forces&nbsp;Day this coming weekend, we are investing in a new digital identification service for veterans. This will enable government services and our fantastic charity sector to better identify and prioritise our veterans.</p>

<p>Coming on top of Operation Courage, the more than £18m investment to get veterans access to better mental&nbsp;healthcare, the ID service will deliver real change, giving us the capability to identify veterans and get help more quickly to those who need targeted support in health, housing or employment.</p>

<p>We are also taking steps to maximise the employment opportunities for the veterans’ community, recognising that the unique skills they have make them ideal recruits for a range of jobs in areas such as cyber security and logistics.</p>

<p>All government departments now offer a scheme that guarantees veterans progress to the next recruitment stage, with 800 ex-military personnel so far being offered a variety of roles across the Civil Service.</p>

<p>And we know the positive impact veterans can have on those who have strayed from the straight and narrow, which is why we have launched a scheme to recruit them as prison officers.</p>

<p>For every veteran I meet, for every individual story I hear, access to support and employment services are the most pressing issues that they want to see resolved.</p>

<p>Nearly six months on from the launch of our Veterans Strategy Action Plan, backed by £70m of funding, we can be encouraged that we have already delivered over a fifth of the 60 commitments we made.</p>

<p>We must now harness that progress and I am committed to keeping veterans at the heart of this Government’s agenda so that those who have given so much for us do not feel invisible or left behind.</p>
