  <p class="last-child">I am delighted that Frances has chosen to join our Board. She brings a very experienced practitioner view and will have much to contribute to framing and ensuring a positive impact of the ambitious change agenda planned for the Service over the next few years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incoming board member, Frances Coulson, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am delighted to have been appointed to the Insolvency Service Board as a non-executive Director. Insolvency is a vital component in even the strongest economy and serves to encourage good corporate behaviour, while ensuring fair competition and fair treatment amongst creditors, the taxpayer and business employees.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Insolvency is in the spotlight following recent world events and the Insolvency Service’s role in ensuring economic confidence and a robust system is vital. I look forward to working with the Insolvency Service’s senior leadership and my fellow non-executive Board Members to constructively help the agency deliver its objectives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Insolvency Service’s Chief Executive, Dean Beale, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am very pleased to welcome Frances to the Insolvency Service Board. As the country continues to recover from the economic impacts of the pandemic the Insolvency Service has a vital role to ensure the insolvency framework and insolvency practitioners are well placed to support businesses and individuals.</p>
