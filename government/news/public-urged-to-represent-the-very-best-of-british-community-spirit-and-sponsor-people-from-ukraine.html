<p>As the people of Ukraine celebrate their Independence Day, the UK government is calling for more people to come forward to help house Ukrainians fleeing the war.</p>

<p>Thanks to the good will and generosity of tens of thousands of people, more than 115,000 Ukrainians have been given safety in the UK so far through both the family and sponsorship schemes. This huge collective and community effort represents the UK’s biggest offer to shelter for people fleeing war since 1946. But with the Putin’s barbaric invasion continuing, many Ukrainians are still looking for a place of safety in homes right across the UK.</p>

<p>Those interested in becoming sponsors for the Homes for Ukraine scheme can find out more information and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/register-interest-homes-ukraine">record their interest online</a>.</p>

<p>Those interested in finding somebody to host can contact <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/recognised-providers-organisations-who-can-help-uk-citizens-become-sponsors">recognised providers listed online</a> who help provide support and guidance on becoming a sponsor, and can help people safely find a match. A record of interest will also be shared with the local authority who may make contact to discuss where there is a need for sponsors in the area.</p>

<p>Alison Edwards, host said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We are delighted to have met our lovely Ukrainian guest, even though the opportunity arose for the worst reasons. We feel so grateful that our guest has joined us; by chance we share many interests and our children have so enjoyed spending time with our guest. We feel we have a new honorary family member from Ukraine. Our lovely guest has brought warmth and humour. Our thoughts are with her relatives in Ukraine and we have so many hopes for our guest’s future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This country has committed to providing Ukrainians with a home while they are here in the UK. Some guests may need a new place to stay after 6 months and new sponsors who step forward will help local authorities ensure people have somewhere to plant roots in the community.</p>

<p>The government is providing £10,500 per person under the Homes for Ukraine Scheme to councils to enable them to provide support to families to rebuild their lives and plant roots in the community. Within the £10,500 is a one-off £200 payment that councils will provide to each Ukraine guest upon arrival plus the £350 ‘thank you’ monthly payment for sponsors for costs associated with helping out.</p>

<p>Around 3 out of 4 existing hosts say they want to continue supporting their Ukrainian guests but where people cannot continue hosting new offers of places to live are needed for Ukrainians already in the UK.&nbsp;In these cases councils are offering a rematching service to find a new sponsor in cases under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.</p>

<p>Refugees Minister Lord Harrington said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today marks two sombre and important chapters in Ukraine’s rich history – 31 years since the proud nation declared independence and 6 months since Russian tanks rolled across the border.</p>

  <p>The United Kingdom has been unwavering in its support and we continue to stand shoulder to shoulder as more than 115,000 people arrive from Ukraine, our biggest offer of sanctuary to people fleeing war since 1946.</p>

  <p>Those who have chosen to sponsor Ukrainians represent the very best of British community spirit and generosity and I would urge anyone who has the room to come forward and join thousands of others in providing a safe haven for people forced to leave their country.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The ONS recently surveyed sponsors about their experiences with the Homes for Ukraine Scheme and the results show the vast majority of people want to provide support for longer than 6 months, which is a testament to the goodwill and generosity of the British people. They will of course continue to receive £350 ‘thank you’ payments up to 6 months and the Ukrainians they sponsor have the right to work and to access benefits and public services, including education and healthcare, from day one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Devolved governments, charities, faith groups, businesses, councils and communities have all worked in lock step to provide much needed support to those arriving from Ukraine.</p>

<h2>Further information</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If you want to get started immediately on finding someone to host, you can contact one of our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/recognised-providers-organisations-who-can-help-uk-citizens-become-sponsors">Recognised Providers</a>.</li>
  <li>A record of your interest will also be shared with your local authority who may contact you to discuss where there is a need for sponsors in your area.</li>
  <li>The government has established 3 new visa schemes to support those fleeing Putin’s war: the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-ukraine-family-scheme-visa">Ukraine Family Scheme</a>, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-visa-under-the-ukraine-sponsorship-scheme">Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-to-stay-in-the-uk-under-the-ukraine-extension-scheme">Ukraine Extension Scheme</a>.</li>
  <li>Ukrainians who have arrived in the UK and were given 6 months leave should ensure they take action to extend their stay to up to 3 years if they have not already done so. They can do this on GOV.UK, though Ukrainians who have already enrolled their biometrics, and collected their biometric residence permit (BRP) do not need to take any further action.</li>
