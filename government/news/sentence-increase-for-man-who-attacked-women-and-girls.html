<p>A County Durham man has had his sentence increased following a referral to the Court of Appeal by the Solicitor General, Alex Chalk QC MP.</p>

<p>On 10 September 2021, Liam Hall, 33, attacked his partner and two 13-year old girls at his partner’s home, without any apparent motive. Hall punched the first girl so that she struck a wall and was rendered unconscious. He then strangled and pinned the other girl to the floor, punching her repeatedly until she lost consciousness. When she regained consciousness, Hall stamped on her face, leading to her again losing consciousness. Hall also assaulted his partner, who is unable to recall the assault but who was left with several injuries.</p>

<p>Having pleaded guilty, on 21 December 2021, Hall was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 8 years at Newcastle Crown Court.</p>

<p>Hall had previously served prison terms for manslaughter and other violent offences and was on licence for another violent crime when he carried out his assault.</p>

<p>In light of the seriousness of the offending, and the fact that Hall was on licence at the time, the Solicitor General chose to refer his sentence to the Court of Appeal under the Unduly Lenient Sentence (ULS) scheme because he considered it to be too low.</p>

<p>On 24 February 2022 the Court of Appeal found his original sentence to be unduly lenient and increased his minimum sentence to 10 years and 8 months.</p>

<p>Speaking after the hearing, the Solicitor General, Alex Chalk QC MP, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Liam Hall’s criminal record shows a history of extreme violence, including manslaughter. This motiveless and inexcusable attack on three defenceless women and girls was shocking, taking place while Hall was on licence for yet another violent crime. I am glad that the Court of Appeal decided to increase the minimum term he must serve, given the serious danger Hall poses to the public.</p>
