<h2>UEFA Champions League Group Stage – Villarreal CF vs Manchester United FC</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Date: Tuesday 23 November 2021</li>
  <li>Kick off time: 6:45pm (local time)</li>
  <li>Venue: Ceramica Stadium (formerly El Madrigal), Villareal</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as this advice, read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/spain" class="govuk-link">travel advice for Spain</a> for information on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/spain/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">COVID-related entry requirements to Spain</a> and local restrictions, as well as information on completing the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.spth.gob.es/">Health Control Form</a> before you travel.</p>

<h3>Passports and visas</h3>

<p>The rules for travelling to European countries changed on 1 January 2021. British nationals can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.</p>

<p>Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it. Make sure your passport is valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave Spain, or any other Schengen country.</p>

<p>Remember your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/global-health-insurance-card">European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</a> but also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance" class="govuk-link">take out travel insurance</a>, even if you are travelling for for 1 night only. It could save you a lot of money if you get into difficulties.</p>

<p>At Spanish border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport is usually stamped on entry and exit unless you can demonstrate that you are resident of Spain.</p>

<p>You may also need to show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a return or onward ticket</li>
  <li>enough money for your stay</li>
  <li>proof of accommodation for your stay, for example, a hotel booking confirmation</li>
  <li>proof of address if visiting your own property (eg. second home), or an invitation from your host or proof of their address if staying with a third party, friends or family</li>
</ul>

<p>You must provide ID, for example, your passport, if a a police officer asks for it. The police have the right to hold you at a police station until your identity is confirmed.</p>

<p>Always take care of your passport, as getting a replacement is costly and time-consuming. Remember to keep a photocopy or scanned copy of your passport somewhere safe.</p>

<p>If you lose your passport, you’ll need to apply for an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/emergency-travel-document" class="govuk-link">Emergency Travel Document online</a>.</p>

<h3>Getting to the stadium</h3>

<p>Stadium address:</p>
<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Estadio Ceramica (formerly El Madrigal)
<br>Calle Blasco Ibáñez, no 2
<br>12540 Villarreal (Vila-Real)
<br>Castellón
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>The stadium is located in central Villarreal. The club is called Villarreal, but the town is known as Vila-Real, and that many street names in Vila-Real, Castellón and Valencia will be in the local language of Valenciano.</p>

<p>There are some rail services between Villarreal and Castellon and between Villarreal and Valencia. Timetables and ticket prices care on the <a href="https://www.renfe.es" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Renfe website</a>.</p>

<p>A taxi from Villarreal to Valencia should cost approximately 80 Euros and from Villareal to Castellon approximately 20 Euros. We advise pre-booking return taxis to Valencia, as availability may be limited.</p>

<h3>At the match</h3>

<p>Access to the stadium can be slow. There will be ticket checks at various checkpoints before getting to the stadium including body searches and after getting through the turnstiles. To avoid a last-minute bottleneck you should get to the stadium early. Doors will be open for visiting supporters 90 minutes to 2 hours before kick-off.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Police and stewards may ask to see the ID of ticket holders to prevent ticket fraud. You should carry photo ID with you</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Manchester United fans should enter the stadium through gate 25</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>fans should follow Spanish police instructions and avoid physical contact of any type, including requests to take photos etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>current COVID restrictions in Spain require all fans in football stadiums to wear a mask at all times. Fans are not allowed to smoke, eat or drink inside the stadium. You are only permitted to drink water (under 500ml) with no bottle top. Food and drink will be available outside the stadium before the match</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>anyone who is obviously drunk or bearing racist insignia will not be allowed into the stadium. Banners with political slogans will not be permitted inside the stadium</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>flares, fireworks, alcohol, cans, glass, bottle tops or containers over 1/2 litre are not allowed in the stadium</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>visiting supporters may be kept behind for around 20 to 30 minutes after the match to allow the home fans to leave the stadium</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>pickpockets operate in large crowds so be careful with your valuables</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in Castellon, Valencia and, as in any other city, beware of pickpockets and bag snatchers at airports, railway stations, around the town centre and when using public transport. Only carry what you need, leave spare cash and valuables in hotel safety deposits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>drinking in the streets in some parts of Spain is illegal, and you can be arrested for doing so.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>police officers have the right to stop people from taking photos or filming if they consider that their personal security or that of a police operation or secured area could be compromised as a result.  Doing so can be met with severe penalties.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>carry a print out of your COVID vaccine QR Codes in case you lose or don’t have access to your mobile phone whilst in Spain, to help your return to the UK</p>
  </li>
</ul>
