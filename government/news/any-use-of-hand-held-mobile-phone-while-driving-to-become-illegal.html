  <li>government strengthening existing laws making it illegal to use a hand-held mobile phone while driving under virtually any circumstance</li>
  <li>follows public consultation which found that 81% of people supported such a move</li>
  <li>highway code will change making it clear that hand-held phone use at traffic lights or in traffic jams is illegal</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Police will soon be able to more easily prosecute drivers using a hand-held mobile phone at the wheel after the government strengthens existing laws to further improve road safety.</p>

<p>It is already illegal to text or make a phone call (other than in an emergency) using a hand-held device while driving. Next year, laws will go further to ban drivers from using their phones to take photos or videos, scroll through playlists or play games.</p>

<p>This will mean anyone caught using their hand-held device while driving will face a £200 fixed penalty notice and 6 points on their licence.</p>

<p>Drivers will still be able to continue using a device ‘hands-free’ while driving, such as a sat-nav, if it’s secured in a cradle. They must, however, always take responsibility for their driving and can be charged with an offence if the police find them not to be in proper control of their vehicle.</p>

<p>Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Too many deaths and injuries occur while mobile phones are being held.</p>

  <p>By making it easier to prosecute people illegally using their phone at the wheel, we are ensuring the law is brought into the 21st century while further protecting all road users.</p>

  <p class="last-child">While our roads remain among the safest in the world, we will continue working tirelessly to make them safer, including through our award-winning <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.think.gov.uk/">THINK! campaign</a>, which challenges social norms among high-risk drivers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This follows a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/expanding-the-offence-of-using-a-hand-held-mobile-phone-while-driving-to-include-non-connected-mobile-application-actions" class="govuk-link">public consultation</a> that found 81% of respondents supported proposals to strengthen the law and make it easier for culprits to be prosecuted.</p>

<p>Following the public consultation, the government will revise <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/driving/highway-code-road-safety">The Highway Code</a> to explain the new measures. It will also be more precise about the fact that being stationary in traffic counts as driving, making it clear that hand-held mobile phone use at traffic lights or in motorway jams is illegal except in very limited circumstances.</p>

<p>There will be an exemption to the new law for drivers making a contactless payment using their mobile phone while stationary to ensure the law keeps pace with technology.</p>

<p>This exemption will cover, for example, places like a drive-through restaurant or a road toll, and will only apply when payment is being made with a card reader. It will not allow motorists to make general online payments while driving.</p>

<p>Mary Williams <abbr title="Order of the British Empire">OBE</abbr>, Chief Executive of Brake – the road safety charity, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Driver distraction can be deadly and using a hand-held phone at the wheel is never worth the risk. This important road safety decision by government, coinciding with <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.brake.org.uk/road-safety-week">Road Safety Week</a>, is very welcomed.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This news is particularly welcomed by families suffering bereavement and catastrophic injury due to drivers being distracted by phones. The theme for Road Safety Week is road safety heroes – we can all be road safety heroes by giving driving our full attention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Department for Transport has also today published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/research-on-the-use-of-mobile-phones-while-driving">study by Ipsos Mori about drivers who use mobile phones while driving</a>.</p>

<p>Among other findings, the research reveals younger motorists are more likely to have used a handheld device at the wheel, supporting the focus of the government’s award-winning THINK! campaign, which works to boost road safety by targeting higher-risk, younger motorists and road-users.</p>
