  <li>Temporary road surface to be put in place</li>
  <li>Initial costs estimated to be between £3.5 million and £5 million</li>
</ul>

<p>Matlock Bridge will be closed to all traffic (pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles) from 7am on Monday 13 June 2022 until early August 2022 to enable preparations for essential flood prevention work to be carried out.</p>

<p>The next stage of work is to alter the road in order to temporarily allow 2-way traffic over Matlock Bridge. This temporary highway surfacing will be built on top of the existing road surface and pavement and is expected to be in use by vehicles for up to 18 months.</p>

<p>Once this work on the bridge is complete, the A6 at Derwent Way will be closed so a large crane can be situated on the A6 to carry out the necessary work on reinstating the flood defences. All traffic going north and south will then be able to use Matlock Bridge.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency, Derbyshire County Council and Derbyshire Dales District Council are working together to manage the risk of flooding from the River Derwent following the collapse of a wall behind businesses in Crown Square, Matlock, following the February storms.</p>

<p>Whilst the temporary highway work is done pedestrians should use the footbridge in Hall Leys Park for alternative access across the River Derwent.</p>

<p>Naomi Doughty, Project Manager for the Environment Agency said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Following on from a well-attended community drop-in event on 19 May, we’re pleased to announce the next phase of essential flood prevention work will begin from Monday 13 June.</p>

  <p>With Matlock Bridge being a scheduled monument, care has been taken to liaise with national and local heritage stakeholders in order to preserve and protect the historic value of the bridge.</p>

  <p>We’ve listened to local feedback and we will do everything we can to make sure the temporary highway is as aesthetically pleasing and in keeping with the local character of Matlock.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We apologise in advance for any disruption caused by these works and we’re grateful for the patience and support of the local community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Derbyshire County Council’s Cabinet Member for Highways Assets and Transport, Councillor Kewal Singh Athwal, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We realise that the work will mean some disruption to traffic in the town, but this work needs doing as soon as possible to protect homes and businesses.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Whilst the temporary highway work is done pedestrians should use the footbridge in Hall Leys Park for alternative access across the River Derwent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tim Braund, director of regulatory services at Derbyshire Dales District Council, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Through signage and regular messaging we will be prompting residents and visitors that Matlock will remain open on both sides of the river, and that businesses will be trading throughout this period.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The footbridge over the river into our Hall Leys Park will be open throughout the essential works to access Matlock’s facilities and make the most of the award-winning park at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Further information:</h2>

<p>The initial cost estimates are between £3.5 million to £5 million.</p>

<p>Following the collapse of a privately owned wall in February this year, the Environment Agency instructed Jackson Civil Engineering to complete an immediate repair.</p>

<p>This meant placing over 50 rock-filled bags in the River Derwent using a large crane situated on the A6.</p>

<p>These emergency works were completed within 24 hours of the wall collapsing due to a forecast of further high-water levels on the River Derwent.</p>

<p>Further flood prevention work was carried out in April which involved lifting an additional 100 2-tonne rock-filled bags by a large crane situated on the A6 into the River Derwent to reduce erosion and limit damage to an Environment Agency flood wall that sits next to the privately owned wall that has collapsed.</p>

<p>At the same time, a survey team gathered valuable geological information to inform the longer-term engineering solution.</p>
