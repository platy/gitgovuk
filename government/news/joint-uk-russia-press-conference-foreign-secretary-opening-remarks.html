<p>Good morning. Minister Lavrov and I have discussed some very serious issues today that have a bearing on the future peace and stability of Europe.</p>

<p>As I have said, there is still time for Russia to end its aggression towards Ukraine and pursue the path of diplomacy. But NATO is very clear – if that path is not chosen, there will be severe consequences, for Russia, Ukraine and the whole of Europe.</p>

<p>Russia is a country with a rich and deep history. It has extraordinary prowess in fields like science and mathematics. There could be huge opportunities ahead for the people of Russia.</p>

<p>However, the aggression by the Russian Government and attempts to re-litigate the past are seriously undermining Russia’s international standing. In particular, the claim that the “indivisibility of security” means that countries on Russia’s borders can’t defend themselves or join defensive alliances like NATO simply isn’t true. Russia’s actions in attempting to destabilise Ukrainian democracy and the ability of Ukrainians to determine their own future, including through hybrid warfare and amassing over 100,000 troops on the border in a threatening manner, have actually had the effect of strengthening NATO’s resolve and turning the Ukrainian people further away from Russia. There are also serious implications for energy supplies at a time of rising gas prices.</p>

<p>We believe fundamentally in the self-determination of the Ukrainian people. If there were to be a Russian incursion into Ukraine, the Ukrainians will fight. This would be a prolonged and drawn-out conflict. The UK and our allies would put in place severe sanctions targeting individuals and institutions. The United States has been clear that Nord Stream 2 would not go ahead.</p>

<p>But today I’m here to talk about the alternative path that Russia can take. As a fellow Permanent member of the Security Council, Russia can stick by its commitments to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity – as agreed in the 1994 Budapest memorandum, when Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons. Russia can work through the NATO-Russia Council to improve trust and transparency on issues like force posture. NATO have put forward positive proposals which we want to discuss with Russia. And also we can work with other P5 nations to stop Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon, which Minister Lavrov and I also discussed.</p>

<p>Russia has a choice which can result in a better future for Europe, Russia and the Russian people. Thank you.</p>
