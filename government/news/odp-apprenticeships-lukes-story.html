<p>After successfully finishing internship at the Department for Transport (DfT), I knew I wanted to work within the Civil Service. I made it my quest to work there and be one of the 16% of autistic people in full-time employment. After the internship I returned to Sixth Form, where it did not go unnoticed how much I had grown in confidence and determination.</p>

<p>The following year I was invited back to the programme to give a speech to the 2019 interns, at the opening ceremony of the internship. It was great to be back and I got lots of positive feedback from the Autism Exchange, people at the Civil Service and the interns. That gave me so much ambition, confidence and determination to make sure that I found a role for myself within the Civil Service.</p>

<p>A few weeks after my speech a role came up for an apprenticeship within Cabinet Office working in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel (OPC). As soon as I saw this position it instantly appealed to me. Also, the role had many similarities to the job I did whilst on my internship. So, for those reasons I decided to apply.</p>

<p>There was an online application followed by tests to complete. As they were mainly competency based, the experience I gained on the internship was invaluable for completing these. I got through to the interview stage for the role. When I attended the interview, I felt that this was my chance to accomplish my dream of both becoming one of the 16% of autistic people in full-time employment and to get into the Civil Service. Even though I was very nervous attending the interview I knew that it was my opportunity to shine and show who I am. I made sure that I locked the nerves away and I tried my hardest to get the role, using the knowledge and experience I had gained.</p>

<p>A few days after the interview I received an email about the outcome. I was very nervous when I saw the email in my inbox. I opened it, only to see the word saying ‘Congratulations’. I jumped for joy as I knew I was one step closer to my dream.</p>

<p>I started last September (2020) and ever since then I have really enjoyed my time at the OPC. I have got involved with so many interesting and unique things that I am forever grateful for. Also, within the OPC everyone has been very supportive and welcoming to me and I really enjoy working here.</p>

<p>Recently I have also become part of the Cabinet Office Apprentice Network (COAN) and taken on the role of Intranet Team Lead. This is a great opportunity to network with other apprentices and work together on a project. Everyone is friendly and supportive and we enjoy collaborating with each other.</p>

<p>I am forever grateful of the opportunities that the Civil Service, OPC, DfT, Ambitious about Autism and COAN have given me. I highly encourage departments to sign up to the Autism Exchange Programme and make other autistic peoples dreams come true.</p>

<p>The Future plans for myself as an apprentice is to complete my Business Administration Level 3 Apprenticeship to a high standard and after that I am hoping to build a career in the Civil Service as I have really enjoyed my experiences here and loads of people have welcomed me and made me feel part of a team straight away.</p>
