<p>At the recent Diverse Cumbria Awards, Sellafield Ltd’s Alan Rankin received a lifetime achievement award in recognition of his work in promoting diversity and inclusion, and his additional work in the community.</p>

<p>The Diverse Cumbria Awards were set up to celebrate and award those who strive to make a difference&nbsp;in ‘equality, diversity and inclusion’ within Cumbria.</p>

<p>There are 7 different categories, and the lifetime achievement award is given out to anyone from the shortlists who particularly stood out to the judges.</p>

<p>Alan said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I learned that I’d been given the award I was genuinely speechless, which is unusual for me. Never in a million years would I have considered myself getting an award such as this.</p>

  <p>Since learning of the award, I’ve reflected about what I think has been important about the work that I’ve done over my career and outside of work, and what the judging panel may have considered.</p>

  <p>I’ve worked in human resources for 30 years, with over 20 of these at Sellafield and in whatever role I have done, I’ve always been driven by trying to do the right things, for the right reasons, and supporting, encouraging and empowering all those around me to do the same.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The work I have been doing for the last 5 or so years specifically on inclusion and diversity at Sellafield have been the most rewarding of my whole career, and while its challenging, massive progress is being made.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>While there is still much more to do, I’m encouraged and driven on by the passionate advocates, colleagues and people I see doing brilliant work every day across our business who are all making a difference.</p>

  <p>I’ve volunteered as a school governor for nearly 20 years, with a special interest in safeguarding, mental health and wellbeing, and that has given me a tremendous insight into education as well as huge respect for those in the teaching profession.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Prior to being a governor, I also volunteered working with 6th form students in the Young Enterprise organisation for 8 years, leading activity in West Cumbria and across the county. This was a great experience working with organisations and business who were supporting students gain skills and knowledge that enable them to develop in the world of work.</p>

  <p>The work I’ve done for the last 7 years with Cumbria Police is also really interesting and enables me to make a difference in another area.&nbsp;The work of the Ethics and Integrity Panel and the Independent Assurance Groups that I’m part of, helps improve things, embed learning and provide feedback.</p>

  <p class="last-child">For me, I’m incredibly humbled by this award, and think that it is a recognition that if we all try and do our best, in whatever way we can in our workplace and in our community, to make a positive difference, then we really can deliver change and make an impact, which will matter to someone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sadia Samas, co-chair of the Black Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) network at Sellafield Ltd said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alan has been the biggest supporter of the BAME network from day one and he’s a great supporter of all our networks.</p>

  <p>I can’t think of a time we have asked Alan for something whether it’s guidance or practical help and he has said no.</p>

  <p>Behind the scenes when we’ve had issues that need resolving Alan has always freed up his calendar and listened, approached people on our behalf and made sure we get the right outcome.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Alan is the definition on an ally, and I couldn’t think of anyone more suited of receiving the lifetime award.</p>
