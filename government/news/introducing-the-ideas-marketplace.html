<p>The Ideas Marketplace connects industry to stakeholders. Once a user has signed up, they can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>list abstracts on project hubs and collaborate with other innovators</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>get updates on funding opportunities from across the defence and security community</p>

<h2>How does the Ideas Marketplace work?</h2>

<p>The Ideas Marketplace functions similarly to an online forum. Once a user has created an Ideas Marketplace profile, they can upload an abstract of their idea or challenge area that they need help with. Like-minded innovators with the same interests will easily be able to find each other through the abstract and specialism search functions, and foster collaboration opportunities.</p>

<p>To help find collaborators, users can also follow areas of interest, specialisms, write posts and spark conversation by sending messages.</p>
