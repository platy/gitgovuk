<p>The app allows easy access to coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination status for travel and wider NHS services. Over 11,000 people have registered their preference for organ donation via the app in 4 days, 10 times more than average for that time. 90,000 people have ordered repeat prescriptions, saving clinicians and patients valuable time</p>

<p>Over 1.3 million new people have registered to use the NHS App since the addition of COVID-19 vaccine status was announced on 7 May.</p>

<p>The app, which now has over 4.8 million registered users, is one of the first internationally compliant systems in the world to demonstrate vaccine status. The COVID-19 vaccine status service allows users easily to show their proof of vaccine, if required for international travel, and has been designed in line with World Health Organisation (WHO) interim guidance.</p>

<p>As well as accessing COVID-19 vaccine status, people can use a wide range of personalised services, including GP appointment booking, ordering repeat prescriptions, and viewing GP and hospital records.</p>

<p>Since Monday 17 May, people have logged into the NHS App more than 4 million times. The boost in downloads will have life-saving benefits as over 11,483 additional people registered their preference for organ donation via the NHS App in just 4 days.</p>

<p>People are also accessing services more easily, with nearly 90,000 people since Monday using the app to order repeat prescriptions, saving clinicians and patients valuable time.</p>

<p>Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The strides in technology and innovation we’ve made throughout the pandemic are having real consequences beyond fighting this virus - they’re making treatment, diagnosis and care better for patients.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I want to thank all my colleagues at NHSX and NHS Digital who helped us to deliver the COVID -19 vaccine status service so quickly. The pace we’ve brought this to fruition is unparalleled and it is bringing immediate benefits to our wider health service. I encourage everyone to download the NHS app, it will help you access a host of services.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For anyone in England who has had 2 doses of any approved vaccine, and does not use the app or are unable to access digital services, they can call 119 and request a letter. The first 20,000 letters were delivered across England on Saturday.</p>

<p>Minister for Innovation, Lord Bethell, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s great to see so many more people using the NHS app - it allows people to easily access their COVID-19 vaccine status, as well as easier access to NHS services.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It’s prime example of how technology is making the health service faster and easier to use.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Matthew Gould, Chief Executive of NHSX, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This has been stood up in a matter of weeks, by a team working every hour to ensure we delivered a user-friendly service on time.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We are really pleased with how it’s been received, and even more pleased to see it get so many people using the online services of the NHS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Between 17 May and 20 May:</p>

<ul>
  <li>11,483 users registered an organ donation preference via the NHS App, a daily average of 2,870. This is almost ten times the number of new registrations in April of around 300 per day.</li>
  <li>89,422 prescriptions were ordered via the NHS App, a daily average of 22,355. In April the daily average of prescriptions ordered was around 13,000.</li>
  <li>8,091 appointments were booked via the NHS App, a daily average of 2,002. This is double the daily average of appointments booked in April of around 1,000.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes to editors</h2>

<p>Since 10 May there have been 1,410,386 downloads of the NHS App and 1,302,611 new registered users.</p>
