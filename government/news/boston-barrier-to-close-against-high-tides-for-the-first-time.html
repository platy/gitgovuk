          <p>It is the first time the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/boston-barrier-flood-gate-fully-operational">£100 million flood defence</a> has been closed to defend against the threat of rising waters.</p>

<p>Raising the 300 tonne barrier gate should take just 20 minutes, and will be done at 4.45am – to protect Boston from tidal flooding.</p>

<h3>Reducing risk to 13,000 homes</h3>
<p>The closure will reduce the risk of flooding to more than 13,000 homes and 800 businesses in the area. It will also help record data that can be used to further improve its use in the future.</p>

<p>While test closures have taken place every month since the barrier became fully operational in December last year. This is the first time it has been closed for defensive purposes.</p>

<p>Adam Robinson, Boston Barrier project director for the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency">Environment Agency</a>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the first time, the barrier – and the team operating it – will be brought into action against the real threat of flooding. We are prepared and ready.</p>

  <p>Of course, it’s impossible to completely eliminate the risk of flooding, but we can manage that risk, as the barrier will do here in Boston.</p>

  <p class="last-child">People should always make sure they plan for the worst and sign up to receive warnings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Environment Agency urges people to plan ahead for flooding by finding out if their property is in an at-risk area; signing up for free flood warnings; and knowing in advance what to do. Further information is available on all these steps – and more – at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/environment-countryside/flooding-extreme-weather">GOV.UK/Flood</a> and by calling Floodline on 0345 988 1188.</p>

<h3>Ready to act</h3>
<p>Boston Barrier’s closure is in response to stormy conditions forecast, resulting in large waves moving down the east coast of England on Sunday morning. People are advised to avoid using low lying coastal footpaths near beaches or promenades and plan driving routes to avoid low lying roads, as sea spray and waves could be dangerous.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency adds that the forecast water level is “currently not expected to reach the upper extremes that can occur when there is a combination of high tides and low pressure” but that they are “prepared, vigilant and ready to act”.</p>

<p>Note to editors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Boston Barrier is part of the government’s long-term investment in flood and coastal defences. This programme of defences resulted in better protection to 314,000 homes across the country between 2015 and 2021. We are now working to reduce risk for a further 336,000 by 2027 with a record £5.2 billion investment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Boston lies entirely within a floodplain. The town is at risk of flooding from tidal surges and has a history of tidal flooding. It was flooded in 1953, 1978 and during the tidal surge of 5 December 2013, when more than 800 properties across 55 streets were flooded.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The £100 million Boston Barrier scheme has already significantly reduced the risk of tidal flooding in the town. Once the scheme is fully completed, more than 14,000 homes and 800 businesses will be better protected. This gives the town 1 of the best standards of defence outside of London and generating an estimated £1 billion of economic benefits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Port of Boston has notified mariners of the closure.</p>
  </li>
