<h3 id="world-class-analysis">World-class analysis</h3>
<p>The work of the Government Analysis Function, in bringing together all in the analytical profession, has long been essential to inform decision-making and monitor the delivery of the government’s priorities.  Every day, our community delivers data, evidence, analysis, research and evaluation, which is vital to make critical decisions.
In 2020, our work has never been more important.  We have put world-class, innovative analysis in the hands of decision-makers in order to answer government’s most important questions at pace.</p>
