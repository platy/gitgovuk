<p>Four experts have been appointed to support an external review of the UK’s advanced computing capabilities, as part of plans to turn the country into a science and technology superpower.</p>

<p>The Future of Compute Review, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-digital-strategy-to-make-uk-a-global-tech-superpower">launched</a> during London Tech Week, is being led by the Professor of Information Engineering at the University of Cambridge, Professor Zoubin Ghahramani, who is a world-leading expert in the field of machine learning.</p>

<p>The four experts, who combine a range of expertise from research, business and finance, will form a panel to support Professor Ghahramani and explore what is needed to ensure the UK has the computing capacity needed to remain at the forefront of innovation.</p>

<p>The panel will oversee the evidence submitted to support the review’s findings, which will inform the government’s approach in this important area.</p>

<p>The panellists are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Professor Anne Trefethen, FREng, Pro-Vice Chancellor and Professor of Scientific Computing, University of Oxford</li>
  <li>Dr Graham Spittle CBE, Dean of Innovation at Edinburgh University</li>
