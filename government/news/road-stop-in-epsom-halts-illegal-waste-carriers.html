<p>Environment Agency officers, working with the Epsom and Ewell Borough Council and the Surrey and Sussex Road Traffic Police Unit, were out in Epsom. They were checking vehicles carrying waste or vehicles that routinely carry waste as part of their business, to make sure their paperwork was in order.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency and Epsom and Ewell Borough Council were inspecting vehicles to check they had a valid waste carrier’s licence. They also checked that they had a required waste transfer note describing what waste they were carrying, where they picked the waste up from and where they were taking it to.</p>

<p>15 vehicles carrying waste were stopped. There were a number of issues with the drivers’ ‘duty of care’ paperwork, which will be followed up. The Environment Agency is considering appropriate enforcement action for the businesses or individuals that weren’t compliant with the regulations.</p>

<p>Matt Higginson, Environment Manager for the Environment Agency, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This should serve as a warning to those who would flout the law that we and our partners are still fighting to put a stop to waste crime and we won’t hesitate to take action.</p>

  <p class="last-child">To help avoid giving your waste to an illegal waste carrier and your waste ending up at an illegal waste site, we encourage you to ask for your waste collector’s waste carrier’s registration number and ask to see their waste transfer note - they must be able to produce both. We also encourage people to avoid paying in cash.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Joint investigations will continue with the Environment Agency and if convicted, those responsible could face extensive fines and even prison sentences.</p>

<p>Anyone who suspects illegal waste activity is reminded to report it to the Environment Agency’s 24 hour hotline by calling 0800 80 70 60, or anonymously contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://environment.data.gov.uk/public-register/view/search-waste-carriers-brokers" class="govuk-link" rel="external">check your waste collectors waste carriers registration</a> or call 03708 506 506.</p>

<p>This month saw the first anniversary of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/clock-is-ticking-for-waste-criminals-as-new-taskforce-launched" class="govuk-link">Joint Unit for Waste Crime</a>. The Unit was formed by the Environment Agency and partners, aiming to stop serious and organised crime in the UK waste industry.</p>

<h2>Further information</h2>
<p>Everyone involved made sure the operation was conducted with social distancing rules in place with correct PPE to ensure everyone involved was safe.</p>
