<p>Housebuilders will soon find it easier than ever to access Homes England land, following a revamp in the Government’s delivery agency’s approach to land disposals.</p>

<p>On 1 September Homes England will launch its new Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS), marking a significant shift in the way the agency procures housebuilders, as well as increasing flexibility and accessibility.</p>

<p>For the first time, housebuilders will be able to join the agency’s list of preferred developers whenever they choose. The Delivery Partner DPS is replacing the existing Delivery Partner Panel (DPP3), which housebuilders and developers are currently only able to join when it is renewed, once every four years.</p>

<p>The Delivery Partner DPS will also be available to our public sector partners to help them procure a developer or contractor to build homes on sites they own.</p>

<p>Stephen Kinsella, Chief Land and Development Officer at Homes England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This new digital system marks a huge step forward, making it much easier for developers to bid for our land. I’d encourage our current partners, as well as those we haven’t worked with before, to get their applications in so we can work together to create great places to live. We are one of the largest vendors of residential land with sites for tens of thousands of homes being disposed over the next 3 years being channeled through this new approach.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Applications are being sought from housebuilders who share Homes England’s ambitions to build more sustainably, and for high-quality design and placemaking. By switching from a framework to a DPS, Homes England is also simplifying access for smaller developers and new entrants, helping to further diversify the market.</p>

<p>The application process will also take the size of the developer into account. For example, SMEs bidding to deliver smaller sites will benefit from simpler entry criteria whereas the entry criteria for developers bidding to deliver larger strategic sites will be proportionately more testing.</p>

<p>Today marks the opening of the application phase for this new Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS). This initial application phase will run from 24 May 2021 to 25 June 2021 and the official launch of the new system will follow shortly afterward on 1 September 2021.</p>

<p>Successful applicants will become members of the DPS when it launches on 1 September 2021 and applications will then re-open on an ongoing basis enabling new market entrants to join at any time.</p>

<h4>Notes to editors</h4>

<p>More information about the application process and requirements to join will be listed on a guidance page on gov.uk and linked to the gov.uk press release once live.</p>

<p>Developers are encouraged to monitor Homes England’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/d33eab0621814ab194c936aba2d5d1fc" rel="external">Land Hub,</a> its interactive tool to advertise sites that are coming to market, and apply to join the Delivery Partner DPS as and when they see sites that are of interest.</p>

<p>The Delivery Partner DPS will introduce different categories of membership to meet different partner needs – e.g. simpler criteria for SME developers.</p>

<p>Housebuilders will be able to tailor their membership to express interest in specific locations or types of development to give the agency the ability to more effectively target opportunities to interested parties. </p>

<p>The Delivery Partner DPS will also be available to other public sector bodies, including local authorities and Registered Providers, to procure a housebuilder or contractor to build homes on their land. </p>

<p>Other public sector bodies made very significant use of the Delivery Partner Panel and we will continue to encourage and support their use of the Delivery Partner DPS.</p>
