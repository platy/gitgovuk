          <p>Dr Coscelli joined the CMA as an Executive Director when it was created in 2013 and he has held the position of Chief Executive since July 2016. In March 2020 he was re-appointed as CEO for a further term of two years.</p>

<p>CMA Chair Jonathan Scott said:</p>

<p>“Andrea has given outstanding leadership to the CMA during a period of unprecedented change for the UK competition and consumer protection regime.</p>

<p>“As an Executive Director, he was integral to the creation of the CMA in 2013. Subsequently, as Chief Executive, he has led the organisation through a period of transformation, as we took on substantial new responsibilities after the UK’s departure from the EU along with new functions including the Office for the Internal Market and the Digital Markets Unit.</p>

<p>“I know I speak for the Board and for colleagues across the organisation when I say we are immensely grateful for Andrea’s contribution and leadership, domestically and internationally, and for the significant and lasting impact he has had on the organisation.”</p>

<p>CMA Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli said:</p>

<p>“By July I will have served for almost nine years as an Executive Director at the CMA, including six as Chief Executive. I feel now is the right time to confirm I will not be seeking another term.</p>

<p>“There is still a huge amount of work to do over the next six months and my focus will be on delivering the organisation’s objectives and enabling a smooth transition.</p>

<p>“I am grateful to everyone at the CMA for their dedication to consumers and for all the support they have shown me.”</p>

<p>Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said:</p>

<p>“I am extremely grateful to Andrea Coscelli for the leadership he has provided as Chief Executive of the CMA through the last six years.</p>

<p>“We will continue to work closely with the CMA to promote competition for the benefit of consumers and enable businesses to make the most of the many opportunities on the horizon.”</p>

<h2>Notes to editors</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Andrea Coscelli has held the position of Chief Executive of the CMA since July 2016 and has been an Executive Director at the CMA since 2013. Prior to joining the CMA, Dr Coscelli was the Director of Economic Analysis at Ofcom, the regulatory and competition authority of the telecommunications, postal and broadcasting industries. He was previously a Vice President at Charles River Associates where he represented many different businesses on competition and regulation matters in various European countries. Dr Coscelli was awarded a CBE for services to Competitive Markets in the 2020 New Year Honours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The CMA is an independent non-ministerial government department. The Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy (BEIS) is the CMA’s ministerial sponsor government department, and it sets the wider framework for competition and consumer policy to deliver the government’s objectives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the terms of <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1012206/CMA_BEIS_Framework_Agreement.pdf" rel="external">the Framework Agreement</a> between the CMA and BEIS, the Secretary of State for BEIS appoints the CMA Chief Executive and sets the terms and conditions according to which he/she holds and vacates their appointment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The appointment process for the role of CMA Chief Executive is therefore a matter for BEIS and will be set out in due course.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
