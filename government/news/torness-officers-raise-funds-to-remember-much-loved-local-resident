<p>John Hubball ran the village shop in Cockburnspath before sadly passing away in 2019 at the age of 58. John was a well-known and much-respected member of the community and Torness officers frequently interacted with him during their patrols.</p>

<p>PC Stuart Boyd, community liaison at Torness <abbr title="Operational Policing Unit">OPU</abbr>, organised a fundraiser for John’s wife Sandra so that a bench, which had sat outside his shop for many years, could be dedicated to his memory.  Thanks to their fundraising efforts, a plaque has now been added to the bench in John’s memory, with the local community council and Torness <abbr title="Civil Nuclear Constabulary">CNC</abbr> also mentioned on it in thanks for their fundraising.</p>

<p>The plaque was unveiled on 29 October 2020 and PC Boyd attended on behalf of the <abbr title="Civil Nuclear Constabulary">CNC</abbr>. He said: “I was proud to have attended the unveiling on behalf of the officers and staff from the Torness <abbr title="Operational Policing Unit">OPU</abbr> who all supported this worthy cause of remembrance.</p>

<p>“John was a much loved and respected member of this community who went about his work with skill, diligence and always had a laugh and a joke along the way.  It is our pleasure to support the communities of Cockburnspath, Innerwick and Dunglass in whatever way we can and we are pleased that there is now a permanent memorial to John.  Our deepest condolences remain with his wife Sandra and his surviving family.</p>

<p>“Community policing is a very important aspect of our role in protecting the public and the nuclear site. With good community relations comes co-operation, trust and respect and I am proud to be our local community liaison officer.”</p>
