        <h2>Latest update</h2>

<p>The main points from this week’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a> are:</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that at a national level COVID-19 activity remained stable in week 19.</p>

<p>Case rates in week 19 were highest in those aged 10 to 19, with a case rate of 43.9 per 100,000 population, a slight decrease on the previous week.</p>

<p>The lowest case rates continued to be in those aged 80 and above, with a rate of 3.8 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 fell across all regions except for the North West.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 were highest in the North West, at 38.5.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 are lowest in the South West, with a rate of 8.9.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) in England was 257 in week 19, compared to 162 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for COVID-19 has fallen – it was 0.73 per 100,000 in week 19, compared to 1.02 per 100,000 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 in week 19 were highest in London with a rate of 1.09.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and above.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While it is hugely encouraging that the prevalence of the virus is currently stable with hospitalisations and deaths continuing to fall, we are concerned about the variant first detected in India and are constantly monitoring the situation. Until we know more it’s vital we don’t let our guard down too soon and remain cautious. We do not want to undo the huge progress we’ve made so far.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We still need to carry on with the actions that we know control this virus and that includes isolating when unwell.&nbsp; Whilst we enjoy the freedom from the latest easing of restrictions, we must make sure we keep ourselves and our loved ones safe. Get a PCR test if you show any symptoms and if you do travel abroad you absolutely must get tested on return and isolate as required.</p>

<h3>Thursday 13 May 2021</h3>

<p>The main points from this week’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a> are:</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 have remained stable in the majority of age groups, ethnic groups and regions.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) in England was 162 in week 18, compared to 145 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Case rates continue to be highest in those aged 10 to 19, with a case rate of 51.5 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The lowest case rates were in those aged 80 and above, with a rate of 4.1 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 have increased slightly across most regions.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 remain highest in Yorkshire and the Humber, at 40.5, but they have fallen in the region compared to the previous week.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 are lowest in the South West, with a rate of 13.1.</p>

<p>Seroprevalence data indicates around 70.0% of the population have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from either infection or vaccination, compared to 16.4% from infection alone.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for COVID-19 has fallen – it was 0.85 per 100,000 in week 18, compared to 1.02 per 100,000 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the Yorkshire and the Humber, with a rate of 1.48.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and above.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our surveillance shows&nbsp;case rates have remained stable in the majority of age groups around England, although hospitalisations continue to fall, which shows the vaccine is working. This, along with the concern about cases of the variant VOC-21APR-02 which was first detected in India, should keep us cautious and remind everyone that this is not yet over.</p>

  <p class="last-child">On Monday more restrictions will lift, but don’t jump the gun this weekend. Every day that we limit mixing is another day that we help reduce infections.&nbsp;Only socialise in groups of 6 or in 2 households outside, remember ‘hands, face, space, fresh air’ even when the next restrictions ease and accept the vaccine when offered.</p>

<h3>Thursday 6 May 2021</h3>

<p>The main points from this week’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a> are:</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that at a national level COVID-19 activity decreased in week 17 of 2021.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 have fallen in all age groups apart from those aged 5 to 9 which has seen a slight increase with a rate of 16.1 compared to 14.7 in the previous week. Positivity rates have remained level and fallen slightly for girls in Pillar 1 (NHS and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> testing) in this age group.</p>

<p>Case rates continue to be highest in those aged 10 to 19, with a case rate of 41.5 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The lowest case rates were in those aged 80 and above, with a rate of 4.8 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 have fallen across all regions except for the North West which has seen a slight increase with a rate of 24.9 compared to 24.1 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 remain highest in Yorkshire and the Humber, at 41.7.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 are lowest in the South West, with a rate of 11.9.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) in England was 145 in week 17, compared to 106 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Seroprevalence data indicates around 67.4% of the population have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from either infection or vaccination, compared to 16.6% from infection alone.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for COVID-19 has fallen – it was 1.04 per 100,000 in week 17, compared to 1.27 per 100,000 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the West Midlands, with a rate of 1.64.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and above.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Case rates have continued to fall across most age groups and regions, with only very small increases in those aged 5 to 9 and the North West. The gradual easing of restrictions is going well but we must all remain alert as the more opportunities we have to meet with others, the more chances the virus has to spread. We should not become complacent.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We can all play our part to keep the virus under control. If you have symptoms, no matter how mild, come forward for a PCR test and everyone can order free rapid tests to their home. This will help break chains of transmission. Continue to follow the simple guidelines by practising ‘hands, face, space, fresh air’ and get the vaccine as soon as you are offered.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and above.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The overall rate of hospital admissions continues to fall and the level of COVID-19 in the community is similar to last week. Our actions are working but we need to keep driving down cases and cannot become complacent as restrictions gradually lift.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We now know the vaccine reduces the risk of passing the virus on to others. Therefore, the simplest way you can help is to get the vaccine as soon as possible when offered and by following the ‘hands, face, space, fresh air’ guidance at all times.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our efforts over many months have helped to suppress the virus, but I want to stress how even more vital it is to follow guidance as we go back to doing the things we have missed for so long. Many countries, including those on our doorstep, are facing another dangerous wave. Following guidance continues to be a matter of high protection for us all.</p>

  <p class="last-child">About half of us do not yet have protective antibodies from either recent infection or vaccination, so when you are offered the vaccine, do not delay. It has already saved more than 10,000 lives.</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that at a national level COVID-19 activity remained stable across week 12 of 2021.</p>

<p>Overall case rates decreased slightly, however slight increases were seen in case rates in the 10 to 19 year age group in the past 3 weeks, mostly among children of younger secondary age. This is likely to reflect the impact of schools reopening which occurred in week 10 and the mass testing programme in secondary schools.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are now highest in the West Midlands, with a rate of 4.04.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and above.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This long weekend many of us will be out and about, seeing friends and family for the first time in months. Case rates are still high in certain places.&nbsp; Whatever you are doing, I urge you to continue the good practise of washing your hands, wearing a face covering where needed, keeping your distance and staying outside when mixing with others.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Advice to shield has now relaxed. You can mix outside with 5 others or in 2 households, keep to these guidelines, they are there to protect us and you could be saving someone’s life by reducing transmission.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Case rates have plateaued in most parts of the country, and in younger age groups infections have begun to rise once again. We must not drop our guard now after so much effort by so many. We need only look to Europe to see how easy it is for things to take a turn for the worse.</p>

  <p class="last-child">From Monday, people are able to meet outside in private gardens in groups of 6 from multiple households or an unlimited number from 2 households. We are all looking forward to being able to see loved ones. However, please remember that this virus spreads through contact.

<blockquote>
  <p>The very last thing we want is for people to become complacent as rates of COVID fall. This virus is very much still here and with it the risk of serious illness and death. We have been here before and we do not want rates to go up again, which we are seeing in some areas of the country. Dropping our guard now could lead to another dangerous wave.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The vaccine does not give you a pass; even if you have had it, you must continue to follow all the guidelines. Please continue to play your part by reducing unnecessary contact, washing your hands, keeping your distance and covering your nose and mouth.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re seeing the impact of staying at home, following the current guidance and the lifesaving vaccines. When you are offered a vaccine make sure to take it.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The last thing we want now is for rates, deaths and hospitalisations to go back up. We are still in a precarious situation and it would not take much for a dangerous new wave to take off. So even if you have had the vaccine, keep contacts to a minimum, keep your distance and keep washing your hands regularly and thoroughly.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We should all be encouraged that case and hospitalisation rates continue to fall across all age groups and regions, this is down to everyone’s hard work. From next week the slow and gradual unlocking begins, therefore more than ever it is vital you follow the guidelines. The virus has not gone away, and as we have seen in the past has the potential to return.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The simplest way to keep infection rates down is to reduce your contacts but if you are seeing people from outside your household keep your distance, wear a face covering if you are in a small space and wash your hands regularly. I urge you to keep going for the time being, it will save lives.</p>

  <p>Evidence suggests that the lockdown has been successful in bringing down rates of infection. This in turn has led to fewer people going into hospital and reduced the strain on the NHS. However, there is still significant pressure on our health service and case rates need to continue to fall.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The roadmap has been set out, but for now we must remain vigilant. The return to normality will be a slow process and increasing your number of contact now could cost lives. It is vital that you continue to follow the rules and stay home; it will save lives.</p>

This could increase very quickly if we do not follow the current measures. Although it is difficult, we must continue to stay home and protect lives.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Each day more and more people are becoming vaccinated – when you are offered an appointment, please do take it.

<h3>COVID-19</h3>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that at a national level COVID-19 case rates continued to decline in week 3 of 2021 between 18 and 24 January, while there was indication that hospital and <abbr title="intensive care unit">ICU</abbr> admissions began to stabilise or decline slightly.</p>

<p>Case rates have decreased across all age groups, with the highest rate 488.3 per 100,000 population seen in those aged between 30 to 39 years old.</p>

<p>The 20 to 29 year old age group has seen the biggest fall in case rates per 100,000 population, from 669.9 in the previous week to 466.3 in Week 3.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and above.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are some initial signs that the current measures are bringing infection rates down but there is still a long way to go. The rate of hospital admissions continues to rise in the East Midlands, West Midlands and Yorkshire and The Humber. We should expect deaths to remain high for some time.</p>

  <p>By reducing our contacts and staying at home we will continue to see a fall in infection rates and in time this will lead to a reduction in hospitalisations and deaths.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This situation is tough on all of us and I know many feel anxious and worry about the pandemic – this is only natural. Looking after our mental wellbeing is incredibly important so chat to those close to you, find time to relax and do the activities you enjoy at home.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Case rates are falling in all age groups and regions, but it is important to remember that infections remain extremely high across the country.</p>

  <p>Admissions to hospital and critical care remain worrying and are still rising in some parts of the country. This will inevitably lead to more deaths. The need for continued vigilance cannot be stressed enough – we must all continue to follow the rules to help ease the burden on the NHS.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Please be aware that even if you’ve had a vaccine, or believe you’ve had COVID-19 in the past, you may still be able to carry the virus and pass it on to others. It is crucial all of us act as though we’re infected to slow the spread of disease.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rate that people are being admitted to hospital is now higher than at any point during the pandemic. We are still seeing thousands of people having to go to hospital each day. Worryingly, these numbers are likely to continue to get worse before we see the benefits of our efforts to protect the NHS, which will mean more pressure for our health service than ever before.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Please act as though you have the virus. Around 1 in 3 of us won’t show symptoms but can still infect others who could become very unwell. This is why we all need to stay at home, so we can protect our NHS and save lives.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to pay tribute to staff across the health service who are working flat out to manage this virus and care for patients. The data bring into focus the huge pressure the health service is under. Sadly, we are seeing more deaths each day and these numbers will continue to rise before we see the impact of the nationwide lockdown.</p>

  <p>We saw a sharp acceleration in infection rates last week to the highest levels since mass testing began. It is of particular concern that rates are high in those in older age groups who are at risk of more serious illness as well as people in their twenties and thirties.</p>

  <p class="last-child">There is one simple and critical thing we can all do to help control the virus and reduce infection. Stay at home, it will protect the NHS and save lives. We have done this before to great effect and must do so again as we vaccinate the most vulnerable.</p>

<h3>Influenza</h3>

<p>Flu activity, including <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> consultations and hospital admissions, remains low.</p>

<p>Flu vaccine uptake is higher in all groups compared to this time last year.</p>

  <li>70.6% in healthcare workers (as of 30 November)</li>
</ul>

<p>Dr Vanessa Saliba, Head of Flu at Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The flu vaccine saves lives. It is therefore very encouraging to see record-high uptake rates this season, especially among the groups most vulnerable to flu, who are also most at-risk from COVID-19.</p>

  <p class="last-child">There is still time to get vaccinated against flu and we urge anyone who is eligible to take up the offer to help protect yourself, your family and the NHS.</p>

  <p>Case and hospital admission rates have increased across most of the country and the number of new daily infections are rising. This is deeply concerning and should make us all consider our plans to see loved ones at Christmas.</p>

  <p class="last-child">A smaller, shorter and local Christmas is safest for you and your loved ones. It is crucial to remember that about 1 in 3 people may never experience any symptoms so could pass this virus on unwittingly. Remember to keep your distance, wear a face covering in enclosed spaces, and wash your hands regularly.</p>

<h3>Thursday 10 December 2020</h3>

<p>The main points from this week’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a> are:</p>

<h3>COVID-19</h3>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that COVID-19 activity at a national level has plateaued during week 49 between 30 November and 6 December 2020.</p>

<p>Case rates have remained at a similar level in week 49 compared to the previous week across all age groups. The highest case rates were seen in those aged 40 to 49, with a rate of 195.8 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 have continued to fall across the West Midlands, North East, and Yorkshire and the Humber.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 are now highest in London with a rate of 191.8 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Case rates have fallen most in the West Midlands. In week 49 they were 158.4 per 100,000 population, compared to 196.8 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Positivity rates through Pillar 1 (NHS and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> testing) have stayed at the same level and through Pillar 2 (community testing) have slightly decreased.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents in England was 786 in week 49, compared to 855 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for COVID-19 was 13.70 per 100,000 in week 49, compared to 14.70 per 100,000 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates for COVID-19 were observed in the North East, but this has fallen from the previous week from 23.81 to 21.03.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone’s sacrifices over the past few weeks means cases have reduced significantly in many parts of the country. However, the decline has started to stall and overall, infection rates remain high so we must all stay vigilant.</p>

  <p class="last-child">About 1 in 3 people who have coronavirus have no symptoms and will be spreading it without realising it. Whatever your plans over the next few weeks, remember to keep your distance, wear a face covering in enclosed spaces, and wash your hands regularly. It’s also a good idea to think about reducing your contacts prior to Christmas to reduce the risk to you and your loved ones.</p>

<h3>COVID-19</h3>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that COVID-19 activity at a national level has decreased during week 48 between 23 and 29 November 2020.</p>

<p>Case rates have fallen across all age groups. The highest case rates were seen in those aged 40 to 49, with a rate of 190.3 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Case rates have fallen the most in those aged 20 to 29. In week 48 they were 171.9 per 100,000 population, compared to 240.9 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 have fallen across all regions. They were highest in the West Midlands, North East, and Yorkshire and the Humber.</p>

<p>Case rates have fallen most in the North East. In week 48 they were 181.7 per 100,000 population, compared to 286.6 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates have fallen in all regions except the South East, which had a slight increase.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and over but this has fallen.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is very positive that cases have declined for yet another week in all age groups and all regions whilst hospitalisations are also falling. But it is important to remember that we are still seeing high infection rates and COVID-related deaths across the country.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We now have a vaccine and hope is on the way, but we must not drop our guard. Please keep your distance, wear a face covering in enclosed spaces, and wash your hands regularly. This will help to control the virus and save lives.</p>

<h3>COVID-19</h3>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that coronavirus (COVID-19) activity at a national level has decreased during week 47, between 16 and 22 November 2020.</p>

<p>Case rates have fallen across all age groups. The highest case rates were seen in those aged 40 to 49, with a rate of 242.62 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Case rates have fallen the most in those aged 20 to 29. In week 47 they were 239.6 per 100,000 population, compared to 333.8 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 have fallen across all regions. They were highest in the North East, Yorkshire and the Humber and West Midlands.</p>

<p>Positivity rates through Pillar 1 (NHS and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> testing) and through Pillar 2 (community testing) have both decreased.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents was 1,173 in week 47, compared to 1,331 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for COVID-19 was 15.50 per 100,000 in week 47, compared to 16.88 per 100,000 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates for COVID-19 were observed in the North East.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates have fallen overall. Significant falls were observed in the North West, Yorkshire and the Humber and East Midlands, but rises were seen in all other regions, with the steepest rises in the North East, South West and London.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and over.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That this virus continues to claim an increasing number of lives is a tragedy, but there are now reasons for hope in the data. Case rates have fallen across every age range and in all regions, and positivity in both pillars has also decreased. Over time we can expect that to lead to fewer hospitalisations and deaths. The huge efforts people have made over the past few weeks are starting to pay off.</p>

  <p class="last-child">However, we must not be complacent and squander the gains we have made, even when some measures are eased. By mixing with fewer people, we can help to slow the spread of COVID-19 and bring down the number of infections. This is what will help us to control the virus and protect our family and friends.</p>

<h3>COVID-19</h3>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that coronavirus (COVID-19) activity at a national level has remained high during week 46, between 9 and 15 November 2020.</p>

<p>Case rates have fallen among those aged 20 to 69 years old. The highest case rates were seen in those aged 20 to 29, with a rate of 362.1 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Case rates for those aged 80+ are 245.3 per 100,000 population in week 46, compared to 235.5 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 were highest in Yorkshire and the Humber, North East and West Midlands.</p>

<p>Positivity rates through Pillar 1 (NHS and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> testing) have increased slightly and decreased slightly through Pillar 2 (community testing).</p>

<p>Positivity rates were highest among those aged 80 and over tested through Pillar 1 (NHS and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> testing) and in 10 to 19-year-olds tested through Pillar 2 (community testing).</p>

<p>COVID-19 hospital and critical care admission rates continued to increase.</p>

<p>The hospitalisation rate for COVID-19 was 16.74 per 100,000 in week 46 compared to 14.23 per 100,000 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates for COVID-19 were observed in Yorkshire and the Humber and the North East</p>

<p>By age group, the highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and over.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The highest rate of infections from the last week continues to be seen in the younger generations. Whilst it is encouraging that case rates amongst those aged between 20 to 69 have fallen, they continued to rise in those over 70 who are more at risk of a bad outcome from the virus. The hospital admission rate also increased and was highest in those over 85.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The effect of the current measures does not yet appear in the data, but we should begin to see the impact soon. By mixing with fewer people, we can help to slow the spread of COVID-19 and bring down the number of infections. This in turn will help us to control the virus and save lives.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 are highest in the North East, North West and Yorkshire &amp; Humber.</p>

<p>COVID-19 hospital and critical care admission rates continued to increase.</p>

<p>The hospitalisation rate for COVID-19 was 7.74 per 100,000 in week 42 compared to 5.55 per 100,000 in the previous week.</p>

<p>We are concerned by the disproportionate impact that COVID-19 continues to have on Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. Almost 4 in 10 (39.9%) new critical care admissions have involved people from these backgrounds over the course of the pandemic.</p>

<p>By NHS regions, the highest hospital admission rate for COVID-19 were observed in the North West. By age group, the highest hospital admission rates were in those aged 85 and over.</p>

<p>The overall number of acute respiratory infection incidents reported to Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) Health Protection Teams reduced slightly from 1,140 in the previous week to 1,125 in week 42 in England. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the majority of these incidents.</p>

<p>The number of COVID-19-related deaths increased further.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Hospital admissions and deaths continue to climb right across the country, and there are signs in the data that increasing numbers of older people are now getting seriously ill.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This virus continues to have a disproportionate impact on our Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities, who represent nearly 40% of admissions to intensive care.</p>

<h3>Friday 15 October 2020</h3>

<p>The main points from the weekly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a> for week 42 (data up to week 41) are:</p>

<h3>COVID-19</h3>

<p>Highest case rates continue to be observed among those aged 10 to 29, with a rate of 245.2 per 100,000 population for the 10 to 19 age group and 252.6 per 100,000 for those aged 20 to 29.</p>

<p>Positivity rates were highest in those aged between 10 to 19; this was mainly in those in the upper end of the age group.</p>

<p>Incidence and positivity rates remained highest in the North West, North East and Yorkshire and Humber.</p>

<p>COVID-19 hospital and critical care admission rates continued to increase.</p>

<p>Hospitalisation rates for COVID-19 were 5.55 per 100,000 in week 41, compared to 3.60 per 100,000 in the previous week.</p>

<p>By region, the North West had the highest weekly rate of hospital admissions. By age group, rates were highest among those aged 75+.</p>

<p>The overall number of acute respiratory infection incidents reported to <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> Health Protection Teams increased from 885 in the previous week to 1140 in week 41 in England. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the majority of these incidents.</p>

<p>The number of COVID-19-related deaths increased further.</p>

<h3>Influenza</h3>

<p>Flu activity, including <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> consultations and hospital admissions, remains low.</p>

<p>Flu vaccine uptake is higher in all groups compared to this time last year.</p>

<p>Provisional data suggests uptake rates are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>47.5% in 65+ year olds</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>12.0% in under 65 years in a clinical risk group</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>13.0% in pregnant women</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>19.5% in 2 year olds</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>21.0% in 3 year olds</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The first uptake rates for school age children (Reception to Year 7) and healthcare workers will be published in November.</p>

<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director for Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We’re now seeing about 40 per cent of positive cases among young adults in their late teens and early twenties, which is causing the disease to spread rapidly throughout the community and older people. And while there are fewer cases among older people, they are far more likely to get seriously ill. That means we are also seeing a worrying increase in people aged over 75 being admitted to hospital. We must be prepared for the number of deaths to rise rapidly as a result.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This picture is particularly acute in the North of England, with the North West the region worst affected.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I cannot stress enough how vital it is that everyone follows the guidelines as they are there to help protect you and your loved ones. Wash your hands regularly, use a face covering and keep your distance.</p>
