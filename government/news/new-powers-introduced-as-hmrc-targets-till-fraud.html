<p>Businesses involved in making, supplying or promoting Electronic Sales Suppression (<abbr title="Electronic Sales Suppression">ESS</abbr>) systems that help users hide or reduce the value of till sales, now face fines of up to £50,000 and criminal investigations. Users also face fines as <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> increases efforts to target the tax evasion practice.</p>

<p>On 18 May 2022, 30 businesses were visited, including shops, takeaways and restaurants, across 9 counties to tackle <abbr title="Electronic Sales Suppression">ESS</abbr> and 2 men and a woman were arrested in Nottinghamshire as part of a criminal investigation into the alleged supply of <abbr title="Electronic Sales Suppression">ESS</abbr> software.</p>

<p>The men, aged 43 and 58, were arrested along with a 56-year-old woman on suspicion of fraud offences and cheating the revenue.</p>

<p>A search warrant was executed by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> officers at 3 addresses and computers, digital devices and paperwork was seized. All 3 suspects have been released under investigation.</p>

<p>Financial Secretary to the Treasury, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/lucy-frazer">Lucy Frazer</a> said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The overwhelming majority of businesses are paying their taxes and rightly want to see <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> stepping in where needed to ensure a level playing field for all.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Tax crime does not stand still and neither do we - the new powers available to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> allow them to clamp down on <abbr title="Electronic Sales Suppression">ESS</abbr> and help recover tax revenues to fund our vital public services.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marc Gill, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Director of Individuals &amp; Small Business Compliance, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Electronic Sales Suppression gives the appearance a business is trading legitimately, when in fact they’re really just stealing money from taxpayers.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We encourage anyone using, supplying, making or promoting <abbr title="Electronic Sales Suppression">ESS</abbr> to report via our disclosure facility. Making a disclosure is not only the right thing to do it could also lead to a reduction in financial penalties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><abbr title="Electronic Sales Suppression">ESS</abbr> users will either have access to specialist software or will configure their Electronic Point of Sale (EPOS) device in a specific way that allows them to consciously hide true sales and the resulting tax that is due.</p>

<p>Sales processed through the till give the impression they have been recorded as normal, however the end of day report is deliberately manipulated behind the scenes to reduce reported takings.</p>

<p>As part of investigations into <abbr title="Electronic Sales Suppression">ESS</abbr> <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> can also recover tax evaded and launch investigations that could result in criminal convictions.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has a voluntary disclosure facility and would encourage anyone using, making, supplying or promoting <abbr title="Electronic Sales Suppression">ESS</abbr> to contact them. By making a disclosure now those using or benefitting from <abbr title="Electronic Sales Suppression">ESS</abbr> could see their financial penalties reduced.</p>

<p>Disclosures can be made on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/admitting-tax-fraud-the-contractual-disclosure-facility-cdf?&amp;utm_source=pn&amp;utm_medium=po&amp;utm_campaign=fis">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> also encourages anyone with information on <abbr title="Electronic Sales Suppression">ESS</abbr> to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/report-fraud-to-hmrc">report it online</a>.</p>
