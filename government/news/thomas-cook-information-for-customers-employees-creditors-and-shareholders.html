<h2>Information for customers</h2>

<p>All Thomas Cook bookings, including flights and holidays, have now been cancelled. All of Thomas Cook’s retail shops will close with immediate effect.</p>

<p>The Government is working with the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to help passengers return to the UK. Depending on your location, this will be either on CAA-operated flights or by using existing flights with other airlines. This will apply to both ATOL protected passengers and those who are not protected.</p>

<p>If you are already abroad you will find all the information you need about your arrangements to return to the UK on the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://thomascook.caa.co.uk">CAA website</a>.</p>

<p>If you are due to depart from a UK airport with Thomas Cook Airlines, please do not travel to your UK airport as your flight will not be operating and you will not be able to travel. Further information is available on the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://thomascook.caa.co.uk">CAA’s website</a>.</p>

<p>If you have paid the Thomas Cook companies in liquidation for goods or services that you haven’t received, you will need to register as a creditor in the liquidation.</p>

<h4>Claiming refunds</h4>

<p>If you have unredeemed Thomas Cook gift cards, please <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/claim-money-back-from-a-bankrupt-person-or-company-in-compulsory-liquidation-guidance-for-creditors">register as a creditor</a>.</p>

<p>Further information on claiming a refund for an ATOL protected holiday is available on the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://thomascook.caa.co.uk">CAA’s website</a>.</p>

<p>If you have booked Thomas Cook flights only and are not ATOL protected, you may be able to get your money back by claiming a refund from your card issuer. Please contact your card issuer as soon as possible and further information, including time limits that apply, is available from the UK Cards Association’s <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://www.theukcardsassociation.org.uk/wm_documents/Credit%20and%20debit%20cards%20-%20A%20consumer%20guide%20June%202016%20FINAL.pdf">Credit and debit cards: A consumer guide</a>.</p>

<h4>Unsolicited refund approaches</h4>

<p>The Official Receiver is aware that Thomas Cook customers are being offered refunds in exchange for an upfront payment and bank details. Do not engage with any such approaches and report them immediately to the Official Receiver via <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ThomasCook.Liquidator@insolvency.gov.uk">ThomasCook.Liquidator@insolvency.gov.uk</a> and <a href="https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Action Fraud UK</a>.</p>

<h2>Information for employees</h2>

<p>If you have been told that you are being made redundant, the information in this section provides advice about claiming money you’re owed and where you can seek support.</p>

<h4>Who is eligible?</h4>

<p>You can apply to the Insolvency Service for redundancy and other payments if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you worked for these companies under an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/employment-status/employee" class="govuk-link">employment contract</a>
</li>
  <li>you live in England, Scotland or Wales</li>
</ul>

<p>You can’t apply to the Insolvency Service if you live in Northern Ireland. Find out about <a href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/your-rights-if-your-employer-insolvent" rel="external" class="govuk-link">your rights in Northern Ireland if your employer is insolvent</a>.</p>

<p>If you live outside of England, Scotland and Wales, and also spent the majority of your employment outside of England, Scotland, and Wales, you will need to apply to the redundancy scheme in that jurisdiction.</p>

<h4>How to apply</h4>

<p>The Special Managers will give you details about how to apply and will also give you a case reference number (for example CN12345678).</p>

<p>Once you have this information you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-redundancy" class="govuk-link">apply online</a>.</p>

<h4>What you can apply for</h4>

<p>What you can apply for depends on your circumstances. The Insolvency Service can pay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>redundancy pay:  if you’ve worked for Thomas Cook for at least 2 years</li>
  <li>pro rata holiday pay (known as ‘holiday pay accrued’): the leave you were entitled to take between the start of your leave year and the date you were made redundant</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you have already taken the leave you are entitled to, you will not be due a holiday pay accrued (HPA) payment</p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>holiday pay taken (HPT): if Thomas Cook hasn’t paid you for annual leave you took before being made redundant</li>
  <li>money you’re owed by Thomas Cook, for example unpaid wages, overtime and commission</li>
  <li>statutory notice pay: if you’ve worked for Thomas Cook for at least 1 month</li>
</ul>

<p>There are caps on what we can pay you for each type of claim. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/redundancy-payments-from-the-insolvency-service" class="govuk-link">Find out how much we can pay you</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>More information about holiday pay</h4>
<p>We process and pay HPT and HPA payments separately, so you may receive two separate letters at different times about these payments.</p>

<p>Some employees have received a letter telling them that they will not be paid holiday pay. This may be because the information we have so far received from Thomas Cook doesn’t say that you are owed holiday pay.  Claims rejected for this reason are being individually reviewed, without the need for re-submission and will be paid as soon as we can verify what is owed.</p>
</div>

<h4>Paying your claim</h4>

<p>On average the Insolvency Service’s redundancy payments service pays redundancy and related claims within 14 days of receipt of information.</p>

<p>Special arrangements are being put in place to pay sooner if practicable to do so.</p>

<h2>Thomas Cook Aircraft Engineering Ltd</h2>

<p>Thomas Cook Aircraft Engineering Ltd is being wound-down as part of the liquidation of the group and will close. The Special Managers will provide staff with the information they will need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/thomas-cook-information-for-customers-employees-creditors-and-shareholders#Information-for-employees" class="govuk-link">make a claim for the redundancy and other related payments</a> that are due when they are made redundant.</p>

<h2>Income protection insurance</h2>

<p>Thomas Cook employees not able to work on a long-term basis due to illness or incapacity who had been off work for more than six months and in receipt of income protection insurance payments were made redundant on 23 September 2019. Affected employees have been contacted by the Special Managers with information about the consequences of the liquidation for their payments.</p>

<p>The Official Receiver is aware that some employees have not received the insurance payment they were expecting for September and is looking into this with insurers. Former employees who have not received their September payment are advised to claim for outstanding payments from the Redundancy Payments Service. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/redundancy-payments-from-the-insolvency-service/explaining-your-redundancy-payment">Claims are subject to statutory limits</a>.</p>

<p>As Thomas Cook is now in liquidation no further income protection payments will be made by the company. Enquiries about future payments should be directed to the relevant insurance companies.</p>

<h2>Information for creditors</h2>

<p>You will need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/claim-money-back-from-a-bankrupt-person-or-company-in-compulsory-liquidation-guidance-for-creditors" class="govuk-link">register as a creditor</a> in the liquidation if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have unredeemed Thomas Cook gift cards</li>
  <li>you haven’t been paid for goods or services you’ve supplied to the Thomas Cook companies in liquidation</li>
  <li>you have paid the Thomas Cook companies in liquidation for goods or services that you haven’t received</li>
  <li>you are a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employment-status/worker">worker</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employment-status/selfemployed-contractor">self-employed contractor</a> who provided services to any of the Thomas Cook companies in liquidation</li>
</ul>

<p>To register as a creditor you will need to complete a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rule-144-proof-of-debt-general-form">Proof of Debt form</a> which you should then email to the Special Managers.</p>

<p>Creditors of Thomas Cook’s airline and tour operator companies will need to complete a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rule-144-proof-of-debt-general-form" class="govuk-link">Proof of Debt form</a> and submit to AlixPartners. Further information can be found on AlixPartners’ <a href="https://www.tcuk-information.co.uk" rel="external" class="govuk-link">dedicated website</a>.</p>

<p>Creditors of Thomas Cook’s retail and aircraft maintenance companies will need to complete a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rule-144-proof-of-debt-general-form" class="govuk-link">Proof of Debt form</a> and submit to Interpath Advisory. Further information be found on the <a href="http://www.thomascook.insolvency-kpmg.co.uk" class="govuk-link" rel="external">dedicated website</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have registered and the Special Manager receives your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rule-144-proof-of-debt-general-form">Proof of Debt form</a> they will add you to the list of creditors and include you on future correspondence about the case.</p>

<h2>Outstanding personal injury claims</h2>

<p>Thomas Cook was managing a large number of personal injury claims from former customers. Generally these claims are not covered by insurance and they will be treated as unsecured creditors in the liquidation. It is very unlikely that sufficient funds will be realised from the sale of assets to make payments against these claims.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-plans-to-set-up-exceptional-thomas-cook-compensation-scheme" class="govuk-link">The government has announced</a> that it intends to develop a statutory compensation scheme to provide for those customers facing the most serious hardship as a result of injuries or loss of life. Further details of the scheme, including eligibility, will be announced when Parliament returns after the general election.</p>

<h2>Information for shareholders</h2>

<p>Thomas Cook Group plc’s listing with the London Stock Exchange has been suspended. At the present time Thomas Cook shares cannot be traded on the exchange.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as a result of the liquidation appointments, there is no prospect of a return to Thomas Cook’s shareholders.</p>

<p>Shareholders should be aware of any approaches in the form of third parties offering to dispose of their shares, in exchange for the up-front payment of fees. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers" rel="external">FCA website</a> has information about how to avoid and report share scams.</p>
