<p>Public Sector Research Establishments (<abbr title="Public Sector Research Establishments">PSREs</abbr>) play an important role in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s science, research, development and innovation landscape. Principally, they support government by providing science advice to policymakers, by acting as a strategic capability in policy delivery and by delivering critical science services for government business and society. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-science-capability-review">Science Capability Review 2019</a> recognised that <abbr title="Public Sector Research Establishments">PSREs</abbr> represent a significant public asset that is currently under-utilised and not well understood across government.</p>

<p>The Government Chief Scientific Adviser (<abbr title="Government Chief Scientific Adviser">GCSA</abbr>) Sir Patrick Vallance visited 2 key <abbr title="Public Sector Research Establishments">PSREs</abbr> in July – Fera Science (Fera) and the Centre of Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (<abbr title="Centre of Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science">Cefas</abbr>).</p>

<h2>Centre of Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Government Chief Scientific Adviser">GCSA</abbr> recently visited <abbr title="Centre of Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science">Cefas</abbr> in Weymouth, along with the Chief Scientific Adviser at the Food Standards Agency, Robin May. <abbr title="Centre of Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science">Cefas</abbr> provides world-class science for the marine and freshwater environment. During their visit, the <abbr title="Government Chief Scientific Adviser">GCSA</abbr> and <abbr title="Chief Scientific Adviser">CSA</abbr> gave a talk, and engaged in a Q&amp;A with <abbr title="Centre of Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science">Cefas</abbr> scientists on the importance of <abbr title="Public Sector Research Establishments">PSREs</abbr>, science capability in government, and ensuring policy is evidenced by science.</p>

<p>The visit was predominantly focused on the work of the Animal and Human Health Science Theme at <abbr title="Centre of Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science">Cefas</abbr>, and how <abbr title="Centre of Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science">Cefas</abbr> is aligning its deep specialisms in hazard identification and control around a broader concept of One Health Surveillance. For example, <abbr title="Centre of Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science">Cefas</abbr> is taking the lead on a new <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> international programme aimed at bringing together methods for assessing specific risks throughout the aquatic food supply chain and targeting controls at points within that chain where they can have most impact. This approach enhances both safe and sustainable food supply, and can also positively impact biodiversity and climate-efficiency of whole food systems.</p>

<p>During the laboratory tour the <abbr title="Government Chief Scientific Adviser">GCSA</abbr> and <abbr title="Chief Scientific Adviser">CSA</abbr> heard about <abbr title="Centre of Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science">Cefas</abbr>’ national and international programme work, spanning aquatic animal pathology, accredited diagnostics, all gene profiling, bioinformatics, natural biotoxins, chemicals, food-borne pathogens, and antimicrobial resistance (<abbr title="Antimicrobial resistance">AMR</abbr>). <abbr title="Centre of Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science">Cefas</abbr>’ work at its laboratory in Weymouth includes looking at the risks of <abbr title="Antimicrobial resistance">AMR</abbr> and assessing the potential impacts of chemicals in the aquatic environment, responsibility for delivering the official controls that help ensure that shellfish across the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> is safe to eat for consumers and control of outbreaks of fish and shellfish diseases in England and Wales. This helps to maintain high standards of biosecurity and animal welfare. All these capabilities help to inform policy and the operational responses both nationally and internationally.</p>

<p>Recent internal investments in cutting edge-technologies for chemical, microbial, and genomic profiling were also discussed during the visit, in relation to emerging opportunities for their application – including in the development of wastewater-based surveillance. This surveillance allowed the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> group to help support the government’s COVID-19 response by testing wastewater samples. This supported effective decision making for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace to identify how the virus was moving across communities, including new and emerging variants, before being picked up in clinical test data.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Government Chief Scientific Adviser">GCSA</abbr> and <abbr title="Chief Scientific Adviser">CSA</abbr> also had a series of talks with bacteriologists, toxicologists, shellfish-hygiene experts amongst others to understand how pathogens and toxins are identified and reduce risk for humans, shellfish and molluscs. They were also told about the work of <abbr title="Centre of Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science">Cefas</abbr> in other countries to support capacity to identify bacteria and do toxicology on shellfish and molluscs. These activities help support a more sustainable and reliable food source and Ghana and Bangladesh are just 2 of the countries where this work is taking place.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Government Chief Scientific Adviser">GCSA</abbr> said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">It was really great to discuss the importance of science capability in government, and ensure policy is evidenced by science, with the students and early career scientists I met at <abbr title="Centre of Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science">Cefas</abbr>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Fera Science</h2>

<p>Fera are experts in safety, biosecurity and sustainability across the agri-food-environment chain. The <abbr title="Government Chief Scientific Adviser">GCSA</abbr> visited the York site recently and was informed about Fera’s ongoing <abbr title="Research and Development">R&amp;D</abbr> activities in support of its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.fera.co.uk/our-science" rel="external">Science Strategy</a> and its future growth plans.</p>

<p>Fera is a unique member of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> PSRE network, in that it operates as a public-private sector partnership under a joint venture business model established by <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> in 2015. This hybrid status has enabled Fera to continue to serve public-sector needs at a much lower cost by being more freely able (and incentivised) to deliver expert scientific services to industry customers and partners on a fully commercial basis. This has enabled Fera to fully finance several of the new infrastructure assets and expert services expansion which were presented on the <abbr title="Government Chief Scientific Adviser">GCSA</abbr>’s tour of the Fera site.</p>

<p>Just one such example is Fera’s work on land use and natural capital assessments which the <abbr title="Government Chief Scientific Adviser">GCSA</abbr> was introduced to on the tour. Fera’s work in this area supports new environmental land management schemes which aim to deliver national net zero carbon goals, and improve biodiversity and its measurement.</p>

<p>The Fera team also gave a presentation on Fera’s work to assess, improve and certify the proficiency of government and commercial-sector labs internationally. This work, for example, enables the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to have confidence that the data produced by trading partner countries in support of their food and commodity exports are to a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-equivalent standard.</p>

<p>This was followed by a brief talk on Fera’s food safety work at the main Thomson Laboratory location on site which houses over £30m of leading-edge analytical instrumentation which operates 24/7 to provide the analytical results supporting a wide range of Fera’s work; examples include statutory testing of maximum pesticide-residue levels in foods, assessing the safety for food contact of packaging materials, through to determining the origin and authenticity of food products which are at high risk of fraud and substitution.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Government Chief Scientific Adviser">GCSA</abbr> also saw the research and testing being conducted for public-sector bodies and commercial agro-chemical and veterinary-medicine companies to evaluate the safety of such chemicals in the natural environment, and their environmental fate. This featured a tour of Fera’s new state-of-the-art aquatic toxicology laboratories and the unique <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.fera.co.uk/chemical-regulation/ecotoxicology/mesocosm-studies" rel="external">e-Flows Mesocosm</a> which was built with the support of the Crop Health and Protection (CHAP) agri-tech centre and Innovate <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. This is a ‘world first’ large-scale outdoor field-test laboratory with 66 precisely metricated flowing-water channels which can accurately simulate the impact of chemical and biological interventions in the environment (such as pesticide application) upon the health of aquatic and invertebrate species.</p>

<p>Other experts in the Fera team moved on to talk the <abbr title="Government Chief Scientific Adviser">GCSA</abbr> through their work on <abbr title="Research and Development">R&amp;D</abbr> for assays, molecular detection and genomic sequencing to assess whether plants have been genetically altered, and the measurement and regulatory challenges ahead in detecting the quality and safety of gene-editing processes.</p>

<p>In another example of some of Fera’s ‘breakthrough’ or pioneering work, the <abbr title="Government Chief Scientific Adviser">GCSA</abbr> viewed its insect research facilities. Fera’s insect research has recently been expanded under a £1m investment made by Fera for a new pilot-scale production facility to support research programmes to evaluate and optimise the application of insect bioconversion at scale. Insect bioconversion is the process of feeding insects organic biomass waste to create additional materials, such as protein (for livestock feed) or bio-fertiliser. The technology can reduce waste, provide alternative (sustainable) sources of protein for animal feed and reduces the environmental impact of sourcing protein from already depleted areas (such as fishmeal and soy).</p>

<p>Reflecting on the visit, the <abbr title="Government Chief Scientific Adviser">GCSA</abbr> said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child"><abbr title="Public Sector Research Establishments">PSREs</abbr> such as Fera are really important to help the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> increase its science and technology capability. It was fantastic to visit Fera and learn more about their leading work in agri-food-environmental science.</p>
