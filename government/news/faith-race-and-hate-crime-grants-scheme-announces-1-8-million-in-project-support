<ul>
  <li>Funding has been announced today for 9 projects as part of the government’s Faith, Race and Hate Crime Grants scheme</li>
  <li>The scheme supports organisations that tackle discrimination and champion social cohesion</li>
  <li>Initiatives include workshops from the Anne Frank Trust and the English Football League Trust</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The Faith, Race and Hate Crime Grants scheme invited established community groups and civil society organisations across England to apply for funding for projects that champion the government’s commitment to building a diverse and tolerant society for all faiths and races.</p>

<p>Today (17 November 2020) Faith Minister Lord Greenhalgh has announced the projects which will receive funding.</p>

<p>The 9 projects receiving funding are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Communities United</li>
  <li>Unified Action</li>
  <li>The R project</li>
  <li>It’s Not as Simple as Black and White</li>
  <li>Back Together, Stronger Together</li>
  <li>The Faith and Belief Forum</li>
  <li>Building Bridges Bradford</li>
  <li>United As One</li>
  <li>Pathway of Understanding</li>
</ul>

<p>Anne Frank Trust UK will receive a grant of £204,000 to run ‘Back Together, Stronger Together’ projects in the North West and the East of England.</p>

<p>School workshops, peer education and in-school ambassadors will directly address antisemitism and anti-Muslim hatred, enabling young people to discover shared values across different communities of faith, race, and social groups.</p>

<p>Another grant of £287,000 will be given to ‘Communities United’ and will be delivered by 6 English Football League Trust Club Community organisations in the North West.</p>

<p>The project will bring families from different backgrounds together, increasing understanding and awareness of social and cultural differences, challenging stereotypes and uniting them through common interests and social action.</p>

<p>The grants will address existing community issues, as well as pressures increased by the pandemic, such as isolation.</p>

<p>Faith Minister Lord Greenhalgh said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this country we believe in freedom within the rule of law. We are all free to love and not to hate. This government will not tolerate hate towards anyone because of who they are.</p>

  <p>We stand full square in support of all communities that suffer from prejudice and discrimination and we must build a shared future in this country.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The pandemic has hit faith communities hard with the closure of communal worship during the two lockdowns. This funding is part of our comprehensive support for them. Our faith communities instinctively love their neighbours.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Chief Executive of the Anne Frank Trust, Tim Robertson said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are delighted with the support from MHCLG, which will enable young people to lead the change in pushing back on prejudiced discriminatory ideologies based on race and faith. This will be a real step forward in building community cohesion, especially during the disruption and uncertainties of the Covid pandemic.</p>

  <p>In Anne Frank we have a unique and powerful role model young people find easy to connect with which can help them explore themes such as stereotyping and hate speech.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Our school workshops and peer education project will equip and empower thousands of young people to speak out against prejudice. They will inspire their communities to reject hateful narratives and instead welcome and celebrate diversity – creating a safer, fairer society for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Head of Community and Participation at EFL Trust, Loo Brackpool said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is of great importance for the EFL Trust and our Club Community Organisations to be part of this vital project and use the power of the club badge to unite people by demonstrating common interests, increasing understanding and bridging differences.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We will be working with family groups to help facilitate understanding across generations, as well between those from different backgrounds, cultures and faith groups. Despite the current Covid restrictions, we will find ways to deliver this project and use the learning to inform other areas of our existing community activities nationwide.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="further-information">Further information</h2>

<p>Organisations will receive funding to deliver a suite of interventions to encourage greater integration in their local communities and to tackle discriminatory behaviour.</p>

<p>Some organisations will deliver COVID-19 related projects whilst the remaining will continue to work to address existing community issues.</p>

<p>All grant recipients have been required to provide details of how they will adapt their delivery under Covid restrictions.</p>

<p>We will ensure that grant recipients continue to work to deliver interventions that take account of the coronavirus restrictions and the safety of those participating in the scheme.</p>

<p>The final portfolio includes a diverse set of projects – including community engagement and support, performing arts, sports, training and awareness raising – across a range of ages, communities and geographical locations.</p>

<p>The following organisations have been awarded funding under the scheme:</p>
