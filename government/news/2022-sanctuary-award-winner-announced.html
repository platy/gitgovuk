<p>Celebrating their 30th anniversary this year, the Sanctuary Awards are organised by the Defence Infrastructure Organisation (<abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr>) and aim to showcase sustainability efforts across Defence, both in the UK and overseas.</p>

<p>Nigel Linge has won this years’ prestigious Silver Otter trophy. This award is for the best conservation group-led project or individual conservation effort on the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> estate. Nigel has worked on the balance of military training requirements with public access provision across Salisbury Plain Training Area (<abbr title="Salisbury Plain Training Area">SPTA</abbr>) for 15 years. Since his retirement from the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> in 2014, he continues to work tirelessly to devise and support new plans to improve access management.</p>

<p>The Sustainable Business Award is presented to the best commercial project which delivers sustainable solutions for the Armed Forces to live, work or train. It was won by Op CORDED with special commendation to deployment 7, the 1st Battalion Irish Guards. Op CORDED support rangers in their fight to counter the illegal wildlife trade efforts in sub-Saharan Africa, deploying infantry, military medics and military police to provide training and partner patrolling.</p>
