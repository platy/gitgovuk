<p>323,700 customers are yet to renew their tax credits ahead of the deadline, with HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) reminding them to do so by 31 July – or their payments will stop.</p>

<p>Tax credits help working families with targeted financial support – so it’s important that customers renew before the deadline to ensure they don’t miss out on money they’re entitled to.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Customers can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/manage-your-tax-credits">renew their tax credits</a> for free via GOV.UK or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-official-hmrc-app/the-free-hmrc-app">HMRC app</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Renewing online is quick and easy. Customers can log into GOV.UK to check on the progress of their renewal, be reassured it’s being processed and know when they’ll hear back from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Myrtle Lloyd, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Director General for Customer Services, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">There’s just one month to go for our tax credits customers to renew. It’s easy to do online or on the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> app – search ‘tax credits’ on GOV.UK.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Customers choosing to use the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> app on their smartphone can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>renew their tax credits</li>
  <li>make changes to their claim</li>
  <li>check their tax credits payments schedule, and</li>
  <li>find out how much they have earned for the year</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has released a video to explain how tax credits customers can use the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> app to view, manage and update their details.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H-h-HqVnMI" rel="external">How do I use the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> app to manage my tax credits?</a></p>

<p>If there is a change in a customer’s circumstances that could affect their tax credits claims, they must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/changes-affect-tax-credits">report the changes to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr></a>. Circumstances that could affect tax credits payments include changes to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>living arrangements</li>
  <li>childcare</li>
  <li>working hours, or</li>
  <li>income (increase or decrease)</li>
</ul>

<p>The UK Government has recently announced a Cost of Living Payment of £650, payable in two separate lump sums of £326 and £324, for households receiving certain benefits or tax credits, to help with the cost of living. If tax credits only, they are eligible for each payment. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will contact them and issue payments automatically, with the first being made by the autumn. Customers do not need to contact <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or apply for the payment.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>More information on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cost-of-living-payment">Cost of Living Payment</a>, including eligibility, is available on GOV.UK.</p>
</div>

<p>Tax credits are ending and will be replaced by Universal Credit by the end of 2024. Many customers who move from tax credits to Universal Credit could be financially better off and can use an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/benefits-calculators">independent benefits calculator</a> to check. If customers choose to apply sooner, it is important to get independent advice beforehand as they will not be able to go back to tax credits or any other benefits that Universal Credit replaces.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is urging customers never to share their <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> login details. Someone using them could steal from the customer or make a fraudulent claim in their name. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is also warning people that if someone contacts them saying that they are from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and wants the customer to transfer money urgently or give personal information, they should never let themselves be rushed.&nbsp;The department urges people to take their time and check <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s advice about scams on GOV.UK.</p>
