        <p>Today Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) has submitted a <a rel="external" href="https://khub.net/documents/135939561/430986542/Early+effectiveness+of+COVID+vaccines.pdf/ffd7161c-b255-8e88-c2dc-88979fc2cc1b?t=1614617945615">pre-print of a real-world study</a> that shows that both the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines are highly effective in reducing COVID-19 infections among older people aged 70 years and over. Since January, protection against symptomatic COVID, 4 weeks after the first dose, ranged between 57 and 61% for one dose of Pfizer and between 60 and 73% for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.</p>

<p>The pre-print article:</p>

<ul>
  <li>compares the rate of vaccination in symptomatic people aged over 70 years of age who test positive for COVID-19, compared to those who test negative</li>
  <li>compares the rate of hospitalisation in confirmed COVID-19 cases aged over 80 who were vaccinated more than 14 days before testing positive, compared to unvaccinated cases</li>
  <li>compares the rate of deaths in confirmed COVID-19 cases aged over 80 who were vaccinated with Pfizer vaccine more than 14 days before testing positive, compared to unvaccinated cases</li>
</ul>

<p>In the over 80s, data suggest that a single dose of either vaccine is more than 80% effective at preventing hospitalisation, around 3 to 4 weeks after the jab. There is also evidence for the Pfizer vaccine, which suggests it leads to an 83% reduction in deaths from COVID-19.</p>

<p>The data also shows symptomatic infections in over 70s decreasing from around 3 weeks after one dose of both vaccines.</p>

<p>The new analysis adds to growing evidence that the vaccines are working and are highly effective in protecting people against severe illness, hospitalisation and death.</p>

<p>Dr Mary Ramsay, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> Head of Immunisation, said:</p>

<p>“This adds to growing evidence showing that the vaccines are working to reduce infections and save lives.</p>

<p>“While there remains much more data to follow, this is encouraging and we are increasingly confident that vaccines are making a real difference.</p>

<p>“It is important to remember that protection is not complete and we don’t yet know how much these vaccines will reduce the risk of you passing COVID-19 onto others.</p>

<p>“Even if you have been vaccinated, it is it is really important that you continue to act like you have the virus, practise good hand hygiene and stay at home.</p>

<p>From this week, the NHS has started to deliver second doses to those people vaccinated first, which will provide higher and longer lasting protection.</p>

<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3790399" rel="external">Separate studies</a> in healthcare workers show that one dose of the vaccine is preventing people from catching asymptomatic COVID-19 by at least 70%. This will help to reduce the spread of infection in hospitals and care homes, ultimately offering more protection to these vulnerable populations.</p>
