<p>Environmental performance of regulated industries in England remains high, supporting the creation of climate resilient places, according to a new official report released today.</p>

<p>Some 97% of industrial sites overseen by the Environment Agency comply with environmental rules, based on a five-year moving average, providing protection to nature and communities in the face of increasing risks from climate change.</p>

<p>The data is revealed in the EA’s Regulating for People, Environment and Growth report (RPEG), which shows many improving trends in environmental compliance, pollution incidents, crime, and emissions.</p>

<p>Since 2010, emissions of greenhouse gases from sites regulated under the Environmental Permitting Regulations have decreased by 50%. Methane emissions from regulated sites also decreased by 45% during this time.</p>

<p>The EA also delivered over 98% compliance in the five major energy efficiency and emissions trading schemes it administers. These cover over 40% of the UK’s carbon emissions from industry, business and the public sector.</p>

<p>Sir James Bevan, chief executive of the Environment Agency, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the international community prepares to discuss the climate emergency at COP26, we must acknowledge the importance of good regulation in protecting communities and nature against growing climate risks.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It is reassuring that most companies in England are playing their part by meeting their environmental obligations. Their compliance includes reducing emissions of pollutants and improving resource efficiency – and many businesses are looking beyond basic compliance, exploring how they can contribute to adapting and building England’s resilience to climate change and meeting net zero.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The RPEG report, comprising data from regulatory activities in 2020, also reveals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2020 was a challenging year. The COVID-19 pandemic affected businesses, people, the environment and the work of the Environment Agency.</li>
  <li>Through changing, reviewing and revoking abstraction licences we removed the risk of the over-abstraction of more than 600 billion litres of water from the environment.</li>
  <li>Over the last five years we’ve recorded an average of around 500 serious pollution incidents each year. Despite a slight declining five-year moving average trend, the number of annual incidents remains high.</li>
  <li>The EA found 621 new illegal waste sites and stopped illegal waste activity at 722 sites. At the end of March 2021, 470 known illegal waste sites were still active.</li>
  <li>Since 2010, emissions of air pollutants have fallen significantly (nitrogen oxides by 69%, sulphur oxides by 86%, PM10 particulates by 47%).</li>
  <li>Over the past five years environmental groups, such as county wildlife and river trusts, have received over £13 million as a result of Enforcement Undertakings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sir James added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Covid restrictions that were in place during much of 2020 posed some challenges to our regulatory teams who needed to balance the benefits of on-site activities against social distancing rules. We prioritised industries which presented the highest risks to communities and nature, and also innovated to carry out more desk-based and remote auditing and monitoring.</p>

  <p class="last-child">During the pandemic we also agreed more Enforcement Undertakings as an alternative to other enforcement tactics. These are hugely effective at bringing into line activities that are having a detrimental impact on the environment, while at the same time raising important funding for environmental charities.</p>
