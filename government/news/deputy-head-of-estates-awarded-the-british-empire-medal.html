<p>Mrs Catherine Spiller, of Newport, has been given the honour for services to the Reserves and Cadets Forces and the community in Monmouth.</p>

<p>Mrs Spiller, 53, joined <abbr title="The Reserve Forces’ and Cadets’ Association">RFCA</abbr> for Wales on leaving school nearly 40 years ago.</p>

<p>She said,</p>

<blockquote>

  <p class="last-child"><abbr title="The Reserve Forces’ and Cadets’ Association">RFCA</abbr> has come a long way since I joined when I was 16 as the office junior. I am so glad that it was later decided that girls could wear trousers instead of skirt and blouse and the silver tray was no longer required to carry the tea!</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Over nearly 4 decades, she has risen to her present position and has stepped in numerous times to deliver change over the past 15 years when there was no department head.</p>

<p>Mrs Spiller says she enjoys her work and has lost none of her enthusiasm over the years.</p>

<p>During the first lockdown, she worked to improve the Army Reserve and Cadet Training Centre accommodation for use by the servicemen and women who were aiding during the pandemic – all from her dining room table.</p>

<p>However, she was keen to play down her role, saying:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p class="last-child">It was a bit of a strange time as it was for everybody across the country. I just had to get on with it really.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Despite her exemplary work, Mrs Spiller was shocked to hear she was receiving the <abbr title="British Empire medal">BEM</abbr>, saying,</p>

<blockquote>

  <p class="last-child">I was surprised to be honest, but I’m delighted. It’s such an honour and I am very proud to receive it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Chief Executive of <abbr title="The Reserve Forces’ and Cadets’ Association">RFCA</abbr> for Wales, Colonel Dominic Morgan OBE said,</p>

<blockquote>

  <p class="last-child">Huge congratulations to Cath on her award. It’s a richly deserved recognition of her many years of service to the Reserves and Cadet Forces in Wales. Well done from everyone at <abbr title="The Reserve Forces’ and Cadets’ Association">RFCA</abbr> for Wales!</p>
