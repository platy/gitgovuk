        <p>A popular section of footpath, which is part of the Trans Pennine Trail, is re-opening after an upgrade to flood defences on Hull’s Victoria Dock Village western frontage.</p>

<p>The majority of the path will open this week so that people can walk along the estuary front from The Deep up to the corner at the Half Tide Basin.
These improvements are part of the £42 million tidal flood defence scheme for Hull. The new defences will improve tidal flood protection for 113,000 homes and businesses.</p>

<p>Led by the Environment Agency, the Humber Hull Frontage scheme is upgrading seven kilometres of flood defences along the estuary frontage through the city of Hull.</p>

<p>This work is being carried out at eight locations including St Andrew’s Quay Retail Park, Victoria Pier and Victoria Dock Village. Work on the scheme is scheduled to be completed by Spring 2021.</p>

<p>Project manager Helen Tattersdale, from the Environment Agency, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">To progress with our construction work, we had to temporarily close a section of the Trans Pennine Trail along the frontage promenade and divert pedestrians along South Bridge Road. We appreciate this has been inconvenient for local people and visitors and we’re delighted that we can re-open this popular route again.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Even though we are working hard to improve the flood defences to protect this area of Hull, we can never completely prevent flooding. I do urge residents and businesses to check they are signed up to our free flood warning service and look into the practical steps they can take to protect themselves by having their own flood plan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Councillor Mike Thompson, portfolio holder for neighbourhoods, communities and environment at Hull City Council, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Since this area of the city underwent a significant amount of regeneration, it has seen a huge increase in footfall. As well as attracting visitors to the Marina and docks, it also forms part of the TransPennine Trail walking route.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Hull has strong links to the water and estuary but we obviously need to be aware of the challenges this brings, particularly relating to climate change.  This scheme is just one of the many steps we can all take to reduce flood risk and become a resilient city.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Whilst making these significant improvements to flood protection for Hull, we want to increase awareness of this riverside walking route and make it attractive and enjoyable for residents and visitors alike.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Victoria Dock Village – West, a new concrete flood defence wall has been constructed and flood gates have been installed at Camilla Close, Ocean Boulevard and Plimsoll Way.</p>

<p>Original paving stones have been used to re-lay the footpath. Glazed panels are due to be installed in some locations to ensure the new wall does not obscure views of The Humber. There is also some landscaping yet to take place.</p>

<p>There is a small section of footpath on the western edge of the Half Tide Basin which will remain closed in the short term. This is to allow the flood glass to be fitted into the flood defence wall when it is received from the manufacturer.</p>

<p>This critical work is essential to maintaining and improving Hull’s flood defences, and is being carried out in accordance with government guidelines for safe working due to the Covid-19 outbreak.</p>

<p>Contractor BMM-JV (a joint venture between BAM Nuttall & Mott MacDonald) was employed by the Environment Agency to started at Victoria Dock Village in May 2019 The work is being carried out in two sections: Victoria Dock Village – West which  extends from the Half Tide Basin towards The Deep and Victoria Dock Village – East which extends from the Half Tide Basin towards Corinthian Way.</p>

<p>All sections of the Humber Hull Frontages flood defence improvements scheme are expected to be completed in spring next year.</p>

Environment Agency flood schemes protected almost 130,000 properties during the winter 2019/20 flooding. However, there are 5.2 million homes and businesses in England at risk of flooding. The average cost of flooding to a home is £30k and the mental health-impacts long-lasting.</p>

<p>Today starts the Environment Agency’s Flood Action Week (9 – 15 November) – an annual flood awareness campaign aimed at providing essential advice about what people can do to better protect themselves.</p>

<p>Taking some simple steps to prepare and knowing what to do in a flood can not only save lives but significantly reduce the damages to a home and possessions by around 40 percent.</p>
