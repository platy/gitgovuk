  <li>Chancellor doubles Brexit funding for this year, announcing £2.1 billion to prepare for no deal.</li>
  <li>New immediate cash boost of £1.1 billion to prepare critical areas for EU exit on 31 October.</li>
  <li>A further £1 billion available to enhance operational preparedness this year if needed.</li>
  <li>Funding will accelerate preparations at the border, support business readiness and ensure the supply of critical medicines.</li>
</ul>

<p>An immediate cash boost to help get the UK ready for Brexit on 31 October has been announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sajid Javid.</p>

<p>The move sees Brexit funding for this year double, with £1.1 billion being provided to departments and the devolved administrations immediately, and a further £1 billion made available, should it be needed. This will ensure government departments step up vital operational preparations across the country as the UK leaves the EU on 31 October.</p>

<p>Funding announced today will be used for border and customs operations, critical medical supplies, support for UK nationals abroad, and an awareness campaign to ensure the public and businesses are ready to leave the EU.</p>

<p>In total the Treasury has now made available £6.3 billion to prepare for EU exit, including £4.2 billion funding this financial year alone.</p>

<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sajid Javid, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With 92 days until the UK leaves the European Union it’s vital that we intensify our planning to ensure we are ready.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We want to get a good deal that abolishes the anti-democratic backstop. But if we can’t get a good deal, we’ll have to leave without one. This additional £2.1 billion will ensure we are ready to leave on 31 October - deal or no deal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Targeted funding allocated today will support critical operations, including:</p>

<p>o £344 million to help get new border and customs operations ready. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>An extra 500 border force officers, meaning we will have added up to 1,000 more officers this year.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Boosting capacity to process UK passport applications this year, helping avoid delays.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Doubling the support made available for customs agents to train new staff or invest in better IT so businesses can get the support they need to complete customs declarations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improving transport infrastructure around ports and additional funding for ‘Operation Brock’ to manage traffic disruption in Kent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enhancing support available on government helplines.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>o £434 million made available to help ensure continuity of vital medicines and medical products, including through freight capacity, warehousing and stockpiling.</p>

<p>o £108 million available to promote and support businesses to ensure they are ready for Brexit, including a national programme of business readiness and helping exporters to prepare for, and capitalise on, new opportunities.</p>

<p>o £138 million to boost public communications, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A new information campaign to help people and businesses get ready to leave on 31 October.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increasing consular support and information for Brits living abroad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Support for local areas including Northern Ireland.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the £1.1 billion immediate funding, the Chancellor has also committed today that a further £1 billion will be available for all departments and the devolved administrations to enhance operational preparedness for the UK’s departure from the EU on 31 October. Departments will be invited to submit bids to the Treasury if they require additional funding, and the devolved administrations can submit bids where they face disproportionate pressures compared to England.</p>

<p>Notes for Editors</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to this announcement, the Government had allocated £4.2 billion to prepare for a range of Brexit scenarios. Details on allocations by department can be found in Table E.6 (page 77) of <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/814387/190618_HMT_2018_Annual_Statement_on_European_Finances_print.pdf">this report</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This funding will only be used to prepare for no deal in 19/20. The immediate allocation of funding is focussed on critical areas of operational planning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Barnett will apply in the usual way to all new funding given to UK government departments in devolved areas. In addition, the devolved administrations can bid for access to the £1 billion unallocated pot where they face disproportionate pressures compared to England, as they can with the existing reserve.</p>
