<p>Deadline for submitting project bids is 27 September 2021</p>
</div>

<p>This project is part of a wider British Embassy portfolio of projects which seeks to support the Romanian government and civil society in reducing the drivers of serious and organised crime (<abbr title="serious and organised crime">SOC</abbr>) and the ability of organised crime groups to exploit vulnerabilities and re-traffic <abbr title="modern slavery and human trafficking">MSHT</abbr> victims.</p>

<p>Addressing human trafficking and <abbr title="serious and organised crime">SOC</abbr> requires international cooperation, as the nature of these crimes is transnational and criminal networks frequently operate across borders. This is a priority policy area for the British government and the British Embassy Bucharest, as Romania is a source, transit and destination country for <abbr title="modern slavery and human trafficking">MSHT</abbr>. In 2020 only, the British referral mechanism registered 368 Romanian victims of trafficking. Proposals should focus on delivery in Romania but with the potential to link to activities and strategies in neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>Although the Romanian authorities are currently developing strategies to support the reintegration of <abbr title="modern slavery and human trafficking">MSHT</abbr> victims at the moment there this is an area which depends heavily on <abbr title="non-governmental organisations">NGOs</abbr> and shelters, to offer the necessary support to victims. These organisations have been badly affected by the pandemic.</p>

<p>In the absence of clear strategies and with largely underfunded <abbr title="non-governmental organisations">NGOs</abbr>, <abbr title="modern slavery and human trafficking">MSHT</abbr> victims returning to Romania do not have a consistent support system to rely on upon their return. There is also a high level of societal stigma for <abbr title="modern slavery and human trafficking">MSHT</abbr> victims, especially for victims of sexual exploitation, which makes the re-integation process a long and difficult one. All of these factors create real obstacles in the victims’ attempts at reintegration and building an independent life, leaving them vulnerable to re-trafficking.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>The main objective for this project is to work with the government, civil society and other stakeholders to support the drafting and implementation of re-integration strategies and mechanisms that facilitate an independent life and prevent re-trafficking of <abbr title="modern slavery and human trafficking">MSHT</abbr> victims.</p>

<h2>Scope of work</h2>

<p>The project should have a national reach, while also paying special attention to vulnerable communities, which have been identified as hotspots for trafficking.</p>

<h2>Activities</h2>

<p>Activities financed under this project could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>policy development workshops with the government on reintegration strategies</li>
  <li>developing and providing resources to support development or implementation of re-integration strategies, where appropriate</li>
  <li>providing support for reintegration centres/shelters to contribute to the development and later implementation of the strategy</li>
  <li>training social workers and other community leaders on supporting re-integration</li>
  <li>support for those with lived experience of <abbr title="modern slavery and human trafficking">MSHT</abbr> to engage with policy makers on the development of the strategy and its implementation plan</li>
  <li>encouraging partnerships with the private sector to develop support and opportunities for victims to be financially independent</li>
  <li>supporting development (working with government or other organisations) of communications campaigns or strategies to help reduce stigma for victims</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list and the British Embassy welcomes innovative proposals from potential implementing partners which suggest additional or alternative activities to deliver the key objectives.</p>

<h2>Project approach</h2>

<p>Bidders are asked to submit a project proposal which will be approved by the British Embassy Bucharest and will form the basis for project planning. The proposal should set out how the implementing partner will deliver activities to support the objectives set out above with an implementation plan and supporting budget. The British Embassy Bucharest will oversee the project planning and provide the necessary contacts to the implementers.</p>

<p>The project implementer will manage project logistics, including travel plans, lodging, car hiring etc. and is expected to consider the pandemic context and its possible impact on the project implementation when submitting the bid.</p>

<p>The embassy will provide contact persons and focal points for UK institutions or experts that might be needed in the process.</p>

<h3>How to bid</h3>

<p>Our process will consist of a one-stage full bid proposal.</p>

<p>Bids should be completed in English using the <span class="attachment-inline"><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1017405/Project-Proposal-Bid-Form-For-Implementers-Romania.odt" class="govuk-link">Project Proposal Bid Form For Implementers</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="OpenDocument Text document">ODT</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">48.3KB</span>)</span> an <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1017423/Activity-Based-Budget-Template-Romania.ods">Activity based budget template</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="OpenDocument Spreadsheet">ODS</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">10.4KB</span>)</span> should be submitted alongside it.</p>

<p>Activity based budgets should list the activities needed to deliver the outcomes (results) of the project and all costs should be in Romanian Lei (RON).</p>

<p>Deadline for submitting project bids is 27 September 2021.</p>

<p>Email completed forms to <a href="mailto:rsvp.bucharest@fcdo.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">rsvp.bucharest@fcdo.gov.uk</a> and <a href="mailto:andrada.petrache@fcdo.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">andrada.petrache@fcdo.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Please specify in the subject of the email: Name of implementing organisation and title of the project</p>

<h2>Reporting</h2>

<p>The reports to be produced during the course of this project are to be delivered in English:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an inception note detailing approach and proposed activities. This should also set out key stakeholders who will be engaged, a proposed schedule of activities, risks, safeguarding approach and any additional details</li>
  <li>a draft report</li>
  <li>three-monthly financial reports</li>
  <li>the final report, following a facilitated process of commenting</li>
</ul>

<h2>Composition of the project teams:</h2>

<p>A Project Director, from the part of British Embassy Bucharest (Tanya Collingridge, Deputy Head of Mission) and a Project Manager, from the embassy will oversee the project delivery.</p>

<p>Project proposals should demonstrate that the implementing partner’s staffing levels are appropriate to delivery the project and that the staff have relevant expertise and experience in <abbr title="modern slavery and human trafficking">MSHT</abbr> victim support, as well as detailed knowledge of the <abbr title="modern slavery and human trafficking">MSHT</abbr> situation in Romania.</p>

<h2>Timing and scope of input</h2>

<p>The bidding round is an open and competitive process, assessed by the British Embassy in Bucharest. Results will be issued by early October. When a bid is approved, a Grant Contract will be signed with the successful bidders. In the documents section you will find an example of a Grant Contract. Your organisation will be expected to sign the contract within one week of the funds being awarded. Failure to do so will result in the funds being re-allocated. The implementing organisation will be required to submit report updates and a final evaluation of the project.</p>

<p>There are no pre-payments. Reimbursements will be completed once activities have taken place and all receipts submitted. Implementing organisations will request repayments using an invoice (including receipts and a financial report of spend) and the repayments will be carried out during those dates agreed upon in the respective contract.
The budget should be presented in Romanian Lei. All payments will be made in RON to a bank account held in Romania.</p>

<p>Email any questions regarding the call for bids to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:rsvp.bucharest@fcdo.gov.uk">rsvp.bucharest@fcdo.gov.uk</a> and <a href="mailto:andrada.petrache@fcdo.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">andrada.petrache@fcdo.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>It is expected that the project will be carried out from October 2021 to February 2022. However, this project has the potential to be financed again in Financial tear 2022 to 2023 subject to results and availability of funding.</p>

<p>The crucial milestones will be the submission of the draft report (February 2022) and the final report (March 2022).</p>

<h2>Budget</h2>

<p>Project proposals must include an estimated budget of up to RON 242,500. Depending on the quality of the proposals, the British Embassy reserves the right not to grant all or part of the available funds. The embassy also reserves the right to award a grant of  less than the amount requested by the applicants. In such a case, applicants will be asked to increase the amount that they co-finance, to propose other co-financing means or to decrease the total costs without altering the substance of the proposal.</p>
