<p>Taking place on the same day that the UK announced an uplift in Pakistan flood relief funding, taking the total amount pledged to £16.5m, the scholarships will provide future Pakistani leaders with the skills necessary to tackle global challenges.</p>

<p>Minister for School Education, Punjab, Dr Murad Raas, and UK Representative to Punjab, Alex Ballinger, attended as chief guests along with British alumni, Chevening, Commonwealth and GREAT scholars, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) officials and dignitaries from across Pakistan.</p>

<p>Alex Ballinger in his address acknowledged the significant contribution of Pakistan’s Chevening alumni in the flood relief efforts, from carrying out fund raising to distribution of essential items. While addressing the audience he also reiterated the UK’s commitment to support Pakistan:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We are with the people of Pakistan at this terrible time. We have all witnessed the devastating impact of these floods which have displaced millions of people and left much of Pakistan submerged.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I’m pleased that on the same day the UK has pledged a total of £16.5m in flood relief funding, we can also announce 75 new UK scholarships which will play a vital part in allowing Pakistan to rebuild by investing in its people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This year the UK, we will be awarding 63 Chevening scholarships and fellowships along with 12 GREAT scholarships. As with all UK scholarship programmes, the British High Commission will be aiming for gender parity, with at least 50% of the scholarships being awarded to female candidates.</p>

<p>The British High Commission will continue to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of UK-Pakistan relations with a series of events and activities through the rest of the year. The application window for Chevening’s one-year master’s scholarship is open until 01 November 2022.</p>

<h4>Notes to editors</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Chevening Scholarships are the UK Government’s global scholarship programme, funded by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), partner organisations, and partner universities. The scholarships support study at UK universities – mostly one year taught master’s degrees – for individuals with demonstrable potential to become future leaders, decision-makers, and opinion formers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chevening began in 1983 and has developed into a prestigious international awards scheme. Chevening Scholars come from over 160 countries and territories worldwide, and over the past five years we have awarded almost 10,000 scholarships. There are over 50,000 Chevening Alumni around the world who comprise an influential and highly regarded global network.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The name ‘Chevening’ comes from Chevening House in Sevenoaks, Kent – currently the joint official residence of the UK’s Foreign Secretary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The British High Commission supports inclusion, education and opportunity for all. Anyone who has the ambition, curiosity, a clear vision for the future and the ability to achieve their goals should apply for a Chevening Scholarship. Selected scholars will join a community of over 50,000 alumni worldwide with over 2,000 of these in Pakistan alone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prominent Chevening female alumni include: Amna Zamir Shah, the first female judge in Gilgit-Baltistan High Court; Abia Akram, Chairperson Special Talent Exchange Programme (STEP); Fifi Haroon, a senior journalist; and former parliamentarians Yasmeen Rehman, Asiya Nasir and Nafeesa Shah.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The UK has pledged a total of £16.5m to assist with flood relief efforts in Pakistan. The money will be utilised by international NGOs to provide support to those affected by the floods. The total amount pledged is equivalent of 10% the UN flash appeal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The £16.5m total is made up of an initial £1.5m pledged made by the UK last week, plus an additional £15m pledged on Thursday 1 September. Of this £15m, £5m will go the DEC’s ‘Pakistan Appeal’ and be matched, pound for pound, against public donations. This money will then fund leading UK aid charities (including Islamic Relief) who are providing emergency relief on the ground. The remaining £10m will go to international aid agencies on the ground to help them respond to people’s immediate needs, including through providing water, sanitation, shelter and protecting women and girls. It will also be utilised to support families repair their homes and maintain their livelihoods.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At COP26, the UK pledged over £55 million to partner with Pakistan to fight climate change, manage water more sustainably and unlock climate investment.</p>
