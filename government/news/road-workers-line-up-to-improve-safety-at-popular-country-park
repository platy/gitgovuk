<p>At peak times, cars are often parked by visitors along the driveway and around the entrance to Stanwick Lakes in Northamptonshire, backing up along the busy A45 creating a safety hazard.</p>

<p>Double yellow lines along the length of the road and at the entrance have long since faded so the Rockingham Forest Trust turned to the project team at the A45/A6 Chowns Mill roundabout improvements scheme for help.</p>

<p>And their plea was answered when workers from the project turned up to repaint the double yellow lines which will deter the unauthorised parking.</p>

<p>Materials and manpower were all donated by contractors involved with the Chowns Mill project: WJ (North) Ltd, Chevron TM, and Carnell Group.</p>

<p>Highways England Project Manager, Dean Holloway, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Safety is always our number one priority so we were happy to be able to help tackle the parking issues which have been causing problems for Stanwick Lakes and posed a potential hazard on our road network.</p>

  <p class="last-child">These double yellow lines will send a very clear message to drivers that it is simply not safe to park on the driveway and entrance. Now all visitors can safely enjoy their trip to this beautiful park.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alyson Allfree, from Rockingham Forest Trust, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We are very grateful and would like to thank everyone who was involved for their advice, generosity, and support with this initiative delivered during National Customer Service week, which will help keep our many visitors and other divers safe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The work was carried out on Thursday, during National Customer Service Week. Highways England championed National Customer Service Week by running an ‘Everything you do matters’ campaign. The event celebrated the importance of customer service and the people who serve and support customers every day.</p>
