<p>The virtual <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.smarterworkinglive.com/conference/">Smarter Working Live conference</a> is taking place from 16 to 18 November where you will hear from experts from the UK’s public sector.</p>

<p>Smarter working is about transforming the workplace experience and ways of working. So, what can smarter working offer us?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-property-agency/about" class="govuk-link">Government Property Agency</a> (GPA) is creating great places to work in the form of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-hub-network">government hubs</a>. These hubs are shared spaces, which will encourage greater collaboration, creativity, community and productivity for civil servants and government departments.</p>

<p>On the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uks-experts-coming-together-for-smarter-working-live-conference">first day</a>, Steven Boyd, CEO at the GPA will take us through how the Agency is working with government bodies to design, build, manage and evolve workplaces and working environments for civil servants. Rupert McNeil, Government Chief People Officer, and Helen Lederer, Deputy Director Corporate Services at No 10 and Cabinet Office Diversity and Inclusion Champion will discuss the people, culture and leadership elements of smarter working. And Andrew Nelson and Leah Jones from the GPA will present the updated Government Workplace Design Guide.</p>

<p>On the second day, Jane Hamilton, Chair of NHS Property Service and one of GPA’s Non-executive Directors, will be opening the conference. Jane will talk us through how the GPA is maximising it’s property expertise to provide the right environments for civil servants to deliver excellent public services. You will also learn about modern workspaces that promote collaboration, community, creativity, caring and wellbeing.</p>

<p>Sara Edwards, GPA’s Smarter Working and Engagement Manager, will lead us through how smarter working supports creative working environments. Sara will also showcase some of the practical tools that we can use to work effectively every day, including the Productivity and Creativity Playbook.</p>

<p>As day two comes to an end, you’ll hear from Stuart Watts, GPA’s Smarter Working Programme Lead and Kate Jackson, Senior Reform Partner of the Modernisation and Reform Unit at the Cabinet Office. They will talk you through how the GPA is delivering a modern civil service that is equipped for the future.</p>

<p>On the final day, Kate Guthrie, Deputy Director Workplace Experience and Smarter Working Programme Director, will be providing an overview of the Smarter Working programme. Kate will discuss how GPA is leading the way on providing the spaces for people to work and setting the standard for workplace experience.</p>

<p>Our Customer Experience Project Leads Laura Chapman and Ruth Smethurst will deep dive into how the GPA is creating and harnessing working communities across boundaries within the Civil Service. They will cover what the GPA is doing to create communities in government hubs across the UK.</p>

<p>Across all three days, Dominic Brankin, Director of Workplace Services will be hosting a live panel discussion. The live panel will consist of plenary speakers from each day. This will be the audience’s chance to get their burning smarter working questions answered by the exciting lineup of speakers.</p>

<p>The conference is a virtual event that is free to attend. There are plenty of opportunities to interact with speakers and learn from industry experts.
