<p>The British Consulates in Palma and Ibiza have reinforced the messages of their annual campaign, now in its third year, encouraging young British holidaymakers to “Stick With Your Mates” and have a holiday to remember, rather than one to forget. This comes ahead of what is expected to be a record-breaking season: Majorca was named as the world’s top destination for 2022 by travel website TripAdvisor and, at Easter, bookings to the Balearics by British visitors were already up by 12% on 2019. But it is also a season in which one British national has already tragically lost their life after falling from a seventh-floor balcony of a hotel in Magaluf on 12 May.</p>

<p>The Stick With Your Mates campaign was developed in response to a number of tragic accidents involving young British tourists visiting the Balearic Islands – many involving falls. Investigations by the British Consulate in Palma found that the vast majority of serious incidents took place when the individuals were on their own, having been separated from friends.</p>

<p>The campaign began in 2019 – giving young people tips and advice on how to look after each other and help avoid serious accidents on holiday. For example, to head back to your accommodation together, to stay in touch on a group chat and to watch each other’s drinks. As a result, during the 2019 season there were 61% fewer serious falls and 50% fewer fatalities (compared to 2018).</p>

<p>UK Ambassador Hugh Elliott said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We know how excited young people will be about what may be their first holiday abroad for at least two years. The Balearics are a fantastic and safe destination, but we want to make sure that our visitors are aware of the local rules and know how to stay safe on a night out.</p>

  <p>We are working closely with the Balearic Government whose new measures include limiting excessive consumption of alcohol and anti-social behaviour. We all have a responsibility to know the rules, stick to them and ensure a great holiday for ourselves, and those around us.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The best way to do that is to make sure that you look after your mates – stick together on a night out. We have already seen one tragic death this season. My thoughts are with the family – I hope no other families have to go through what they have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>British holidaymaker, Jack Jenkins, suffered serious injuries after falling from a balcony in Magaluf in June 2018. He said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">It’s taken me over three years to recover from my fall and I’m still not 100%. I spent a long time in hospital and had over five different operations. I don’t want anyone else to have to go through what I went through and what my family went through. That’s why I’m supporting this campaign encouraging people to stick with their mates. Don’t let your mate walk back to the hotel on their own, keep an eye on your drinks and keep it together. And have a great holiday!</p>

<p>You should also get a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance">travel insurance policy</a> and make sure you know what cover it provides. If you do not have appropriate insurance before you travel, you could be liable for emergency expenses, including medical treatment, which may cost thousands of pounds.</p>
