<p>Linda said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am humbled and delighted to be included in the top fifty inspirational women and honoured to work alongside so many other trailblazers in <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> who will undoubtedly be contending for a place on this list in the future.</p>

  <p><abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>&nbsp;has undertaken talent management for some time, and rather like a football scout spotting talent of the future, I was one of those people who was spotted 10 years ago as a future leader.</p>

  <p>I think it is important for women to have a role model within their senior leadership, and I take my responsibility of being that role model for our female staff in&nbsp;<abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>&nbsp;very seriously.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Senior roles in any organisation should represent society at large. I like to think I can be my true self at work at a senior level, and I hope that it inspires women to have confidence in being themselves too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Linda has been working in defence, science and technology for 28 years.</p>

<p>After gaining a MSc in analytic chemistry she started her career at the Royal Navy Scientific Service as a forensic chemist in the organisation’s aircraft material lab.</p>

<p>Linda then went on to work for the Defence Research Agency which later became the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency – a predecessor to the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (<abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>).</p>

<p>More recently she was capability leader in <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>’s Platform Systems Division - a role in which she led about 1,000 scientists and engineers.</p>

<p>She was also responsible for developing key strategic relationships and providing thought leadership in science and technology.</p>

<p>Since her senior leadership potential was identified she has undertaken <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> leadership development courses and been involved in mentoring and coaching.</p>

<p>Last year Linda was promoted to her current role in which she oversees innovation in ‘over the horizon’ ideas and generation after next technology.</p>

<p>This latest award comes after she was, last year, recognised in the top 50 female tech leaders in the UK for her work in transforming the industry.</p>

<p>Former <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> Secretary of State – one-time First Lady and later presidential candidate - Hillary Clinton was among the speakers at this event.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> Chief Executive Paul Hollinshead said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are all extremely proud of Linda and delighted that her talents and achievements are being recognised at an international level.</p>

  <p>She is an inspirational leader who has made a huge contribution to the world of science and technology and continues to do so.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Our people are world class and with Linda as a role model I hope more women will look at <abbr title="science, technology, engineering and maths">STEM</abbr> and <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> as a promising and rewarding career option.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Linda received the award this evening (13 June 2022) at a ceremony in Westminster Abbey to mark the start of London Tech Week.</p>
