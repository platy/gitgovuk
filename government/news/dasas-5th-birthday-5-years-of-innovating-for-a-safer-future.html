<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-and-security-accelerator" class="govuk-link">Defence and Security Accelerator</a> (DASA) was formed in 2016 with one mission: delivering innovation for a safer future. We look to the UK’s best and brightest minds to help us deliver the future we want to see, and in the past five years DASA has seen <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/innovation-case-studies">extraordinary solutions</a> from our innovators.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/138561/DASA_5_-_gov_uk_version.png" alt=""></div></figure>

<p>On our social media channels, we celebrated our 5th birthday by sharing five achievements we are proud of each day, for five days. In case you missed it, we’ve included a re-cap of how DASA has sought to overcome defence and security challenges to protect UK prosperity.</p>

<h2>Day 1: 5 Quotes from the individuals behind the success</h2>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/138560/DASA_5_-_Quotes_Nick_-_gov_uk_version__2_.png"></div></figure>

<p>Looking back on how far DASA has come, we are proud to be where we are today and couldn’t have done it without an incredible team. Here are some thoughts, about DASA’s journey, from our longest standing team members:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“Having been with DASA for 5 years I can honestly say the time has flown by - in a good way! A mix of interesting work and fantastic colleagues has made it easy to stay.” Becky Varney,
Programme Support Team Leader</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“After 7-government departments, I can say that DASA’s team work is second to none. It’s a pleasure being in an agile, dedicated and driven team.” Dudley Hewlett, Operations Team Lead</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“DASA has grown in size, reputation and credibility. It really is an inspiring team to belong to.” Lisa Dawson, Outreach Manager</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“It has been an absolute pleasure working with the people in DASA. They have been inspirational, caring, friendly and very hardworking. Where has that time gone!!” Sharon Lousley, Associate Delivery Manager</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Day 2: 5 Key facts and figures that show how far DASA has come</h2>

<p>DASA aims to accelerate innovative solutions and ensure we give SMEs the best opportunity to bring defence and security innovations to market. We are proud to announce that, since 2016, we have invested £166.8 million in innovative technologies to help enhance UK defence and security – with 40% of recipients being SMEs that are new to DASA.</p>

<p>In addition, since 2016, DASA has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>agreed to 983 contracts</li>
  <li>hosted 512 events</li>
  <li>launched 23 market explorations</li>
  <li>launched 83 themed competitions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Day 3: 5 big DASA campaigns that made a difference</h2>

<p>DASA is always searching for new ways to help innovators bring their solutions to market. Here are five campaigns that we introduced to take innovation to the next level:</p>

<h4>Access to Mentoring and Finance (A2MF)</h4>

<p>DASA is not only focused on finding and funding innovation, we also help innovators increase the pull through of their ideas towards commercialisation. We introduced the A2MF team to help build the business behind innovators ideas, to help commercialise their product and become market ready. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/introducing-the-access-to-mentoring-finance-team-a2mf">Read more here</a>.</p>

<h4>Space Pitch Day</h4>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-science-and-technology-laboratory">Defence Science and Technology Laboratory</a> (Dstl) and DASA piloted a new approach to accelerate the development of commercial space technology, to rapidly provide solutions to defence problems. At the Space Pitch Day, ten tech start-ups successfully secured same-day contracts worth up to £53,000 ($66,000) to fast-track the development of their innovations after pitching directly to UK, US and NATO military leaders.</p>

<p>This marked the first time two nations anywhere in the world, have come together to award defence contracts based around a pitch-style event, similar to Dragon’s Den/Shark Tank. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/winners-of-international-space-pitch-day-revealed" class="govuk-link">Read more here</a>.</p>

<h4>Rapid sanitising technology improves ambulance cleaning times and standards</h4>

<p>A rapid call, launched in response to COVID-19, has trialled and installed a new method which cuts costs and cleaning times across the Welsh Ambulance Service. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/rapid-sanitising-technology-improves-ambulance-cleaning-times-and-standards">Read more here</a>.</p>

<h4>New defence clusters</h4>

<p>On 4 November 2020, the first pan-defence and security cluster was launched in the UK. We are proud to be involved in this initiative and look forward to seeing its future growth. <a rel="external" href="https://southwestrdsc.co.uk/" class="govuk-link">Get involved here</a>.</p>

<h4>Launch of the Security Open call</h4>

<p>DASA was pleased to launch a new open call that focuses on tackling security challenges in the UK. The Security Rapid Impact Innovations seeks ideas that could enhance UK security and relates to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office">Home Office</a> (HO), <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport" class="govuk-link">Department for Transport</a> (DfT) and other Government Security Departments. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dasa-launches-new-open-call-security-rapid-impact-innovations" class="govuk-link">Learn more here</a>.</p>

<h2>Day 4: Innovation case studies that help solve key defence challenges</h2>

<p>On day 4, we highlighted innovation case studies that show how DASA’s proactive approach can help solve key challenges within the defence and security sector, and enable innovators to develop their products and services to their full potential.</p>

<h4>VR technology takes training to the next level</h4>

<p>Software development company, SimCentric demonstrated their DASA-funded VR gaming technology on BBC Click. The trials took place with RAF Regiments and that showed how Immersive Reality technologies have the potential to transform training within the UK MOD.</p>

<h4>Swarming drones concept flies closer to reality</h4>

<p>Unmanned systems supplier and research organisation, Blue Bear Systems Research, completed the largest collaborative, military focused evaluation of swarming UAVs in the UK. The exercise was the culmination of the Dstl’s ‘Many Drones Make Light Work’ competition.</p>

<h4>Experimental development of new gap crossing capability</h4>

<p>DASA supported specialist military access organisation, Easibridge, in the development of new gap crossing capabilities. The innovative solution offers a truly portable, long-span rescue bridge which is 85% lighter, 80% more compact, and 20 times cheaper than existing options. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/emerging-innovation-in-portable-user-friendly-bridging-technique" class="govuk-link">Learn more here</a>.</p>

<h4>A game-changer in hardware validation, threat and anomaly detection</h4>

<p>NWPRO won funding from our ‘Finding Explosives Hidden in Electrical Items’ call to develop a whole object detection system. Their solution, DeeperScan uses AI and X-ray to scan airline baggage and identify electronic contents, with results in just 15 seconds. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/deeper-scan-a-game-changer-in-hardware-validation-threat-and-anomaly-detection">Learn more here</a>.</p>

<h4>Sharing your success stories</h4>

<p>We’ve worked with hundreds of amazing innovators over the years, with 983 contracts awarded across 83 competitions since 2016! If you have a success story about your DASA funding, we’d like to hear about it. <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://ow.ly/W8MC50H56Ii">Please fill in our survey</a> and a member of our team will be in touch.</p>
