<p>This is an important milestone both for the US Air Force personnel stationed at the Suffolk base, and for the Defence Infrastructure Organisation (<abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr>), which has been working to prepare the infrastructure that the state-of-the-art aircraft and their crews will require.</p>

<p><abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Lakenheath, home of the US Air Force’s 48th Fighter Wing, will boast two squadrons of F-35s as well as its existing F-15s, a familiar sight in the skies of Suffolk for a number of years. The 495th Fighter Squadron, nicknamed “Valkyries” was reactivated in October and will have approximately 60 personnel.</p>

<p>To allow for the increase in people and aircraft, the infrastructure at the base is being upgraded. This includes resurfacing the aircraft aprons for the F-15s as well as a new apron for the F-35s, building maintenance hangars, training facilities, storage areas and more.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> awarded the contract for the upgrade works to a joint venture of Kier and VolkerFitzpatrick, collectively known as KVF35, in November 2018, with construction beginning in July 2019.</p>

<p>A number of facilities have been completed, with others nearing completion or under construction. A project of this size requires a large and specialist workforce and on average there are between 500 and 600 people working on the project every day. Safety is a key priority for <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> and its contractors and the project recently reached the impressive milestone of 1 million hours worked without a reportable accident or injury under the RIDDOR (reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences) procedures.</p>

<p>The work has generated £83m of social value, far exceeding the £1m target. Of this, £39m social value has been generated over the last 12 months alone, despite the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, members of the programme have volunteered at events for the local community, ranging from tree planting to providing insight on working in construction at school careers events.</p>

<p>There has also been a benefit to the local area, with 36% of project costs being spent with local small and medium enterprises, surpassing the target of 30%.</p>

<p><abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Lakenheath will be the first permanent international site for US Air Force F-35s in Europe and continues the base’s long and proud history of supporting US Air Force capability in the UK. Co-locating US and UK F-35 capability in the UK will help strengthen the historic military ties between the two nations, as well as the partnership between the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> and US Air Force.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr>’s Programme Director Steve Rix said:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>The arrival of the first US F-35 at <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Lakenheath is an exciting point for all involved at the base. This is a very large and complex programme, which has continued construction through Covid-19 while ensuring workers stayed safe, so it’s great to see this very visible sign of progress.</p>

  <p>Today we are seeing the first glimpse of the future of <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Lakenheath when this project is complete and all of the F-35s are here.</p>

  <p class="last-child">However, our job is not yet done and we look forward to continuing to work with our American partners on this important project.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>James Hindes, Managing Director for Strategic Projects &amp; Growth, Kier Construction London, South &amp; Strategic Projects, said:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>We are extremely proud of our ongoing relationship with <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> and we’re delighted to have been trusted to deliver the crucial infrastructure to create the first international base for the cutting-edge F-35 aircraft.</p>

  <p class="last-child">In addition to delivering this highly complex project, I’m delighted that we’ve also taken the opportunity to build a lasting legacy in the local area through actively supporting the local economy as well as volunteering in the wider community and we look forward to continuing our work at <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Lakenheath.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Deon Scholtz, Operations Director for VolkerFitzpatrick, said:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p class="last-child">It is fantastic to see the project reach this key milestone, with the arrival of the first F-35 aircraft. Improvements to the base’s infrastructure are progressing well and the team is also undertaking regular social value initiatives, within the local community. I am delighted that VolkerFitzpatrick is able to support this significant moment at <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Lakenheath.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The project is the first in a wider programme of work to support US Air Force operations in the UK, with more than US $1-billion expected to be invested in the UK over the next seven to ten years.</p>
