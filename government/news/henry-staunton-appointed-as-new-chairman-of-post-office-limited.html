  <p class="last-child">I would also like to thank Tim Parker for his leadership and commitment over the past 7 years and wish him well for the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Incoming Chair of Post Office Limited Henry Staunton</strong> said:</p>

<blockquote>

My priority is to ensure that there is a sustainable, commercially viable Post Office network that meets the needs of its Postmasters and its customers for generations to come.</p>
