<p>Today, 17 March 2022, the British High Commission in Accra, in partnership with the Australian and Canadian High Commissions and the French Embassy, will announce the 4 winners of the illustrious Ambassador for a Day competition.</p>

<p>Launched at the start of March, in partnership with CAMFED, Girls Education Challenge (GEC) and Plan Ghana, the competition asked applicants to submit an essay and a video explaining what being an ambassador for a day would mean for them.</p>

<p>Selected from hundreds of women aged between 16 to 19 years, the 4 winners will spend a day with high commissioners and ambassadors from the UK, Australia, Canada and France to understand what it’s like to work in and lead a diplomatic mission.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/145357/embassies_2.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>An independent judging panel made up of representatives from the UK, Australia and Canada High Commissions and French Embassy, assessed the entries and selected the winners.</p>

<p>Later today the winners will be formally announced at a ceremony at the British High Commissioner’s residence in Accra.</p>

<p>Congratulating the winners, British High Commissioner to Ghana Harriet Thompson said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Africa Gender Month is a chance to spotlight the gender challenges across the continent, but to spotlight also the champions and changemakers who are overcoming those challenges. Ambassador for a Day gives a unique opportunity to some of Ghana’s future leaders and I am really looking forward to spending a day with one of the impressive winners.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The UK is committed to upholding the rights of women and girls around the world, working to transform lives through prosperity and stability.  We’ll have much greater impact working together, so it’s been fantastic to run the Ambassador for a Day competition together with Ghana, Australia, Canada and France.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Speaking ahead of the award ceremony, winner of the competition Ibrahim Barikisu from Kumasi said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I will call this a dream come true. I was overwhelmed with joy when my entry was selected. I am looking forward to spending a day with the Ambassador in order to learn and share this life-changing experience with other young people.</p>

</blockquote>
