There are a lot of initiatives we have put in place to support members, from monthly webinars to an annual conference, awards and a career framework. But I know there is a lot more we can do! This includes supporting members with mentoring opportunities and creating a members directory, but also focusing on entry routes into the profession to bring in new and diverse talent, and to start thinking around guidance and standards.</p>
