<p>CERTIFICATION OFFICE RECOGNISED AS INVESTOR IN PEOPLE</p>

<p>Investors in People has awarded the Certification Office it’s Silver accreditation. Achieving this internationally-recognised standard demonstrates the Certification Office’s commitment to excellence through quality people management.</p>

<p>Sarah Bedwell, the Certification Officer, said:</p>

<p>“I’m really proud of everyone for achieving this award – it recognises how well we all work together and our commitment to providing a good service. We will build on our success by continuing to develop together and deliver improvements for our customers and stakeholders.  The award, recognises a highly empowered workforce, supportive management and an embedded commitment to developing individuals. Silver is a fantastic achievement and something only 20% of the organisations that IIP assess achieve.”</p>

<p>Investors in People (IIP) aims to make work better through investing in the right blend of talent, motivation and leadership. The IIP framework assesses organisations in three areas:</p>

<p>•	Leading: Inspiring people ; living the organisation’s values and behaviours; and empowering and involving 
        people
•	Supporting: Managing performance; rewarding and recognising high performance; and structuring work 
•	Improving: Building capability; delivering continuous improvement; and creating sustainable success</p>

<p>These are some of the things the assessor said:</p>

<p>“The Certification Office works as a team aiming to provide an open, accessible and efficient service… [P]eople confirmed they have clear direction, guidance and support from managers. People believe they are trusted and have been encouraged to get involved and/or participate in projects and initiatives. Partnerships with ACAS and BEIS have strengthened. Business as usual continues and there is now a focus on conducting virtual hearings.”</p>

<p>“Daily meetings have been embraced and people believe this has created greater cohesion across the team. Telephone conversations are encouraged to help minimise emails. Remote working has been a positive experience, and everyone will have a choice about when and how they return to the office. This will be a blended approach with plans in place to work with different colleagues each week.”</p>

<p>“The Certification Office welcomes feedback. It has continued to improve systems, processes and how it manages and develops people. The team are optimistic about future developments and are keen to capture the positives on how they have worked during the pandemic. Increased delegation has created a greater level of trust and improved accountability. This has been instrumental in helping to achieve a higher level of accreditation as an Investors in People organisation”</p>

<h3>Coronavirus (COVID-19) – Impact on Trade Unions and Employers’ Associations</h3>

<p>The Certification Officer recognises that  trade unions and employers’ associations may find it difficult to comply with some of the  requirements set out in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 (“the Act”) because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>The Certification Officer is clear that the priority for trade unions must be to comply with the government’s guidance on dealing with the pandemic, and that the safety of their staff and members is paramount.</p>

<p>Where a trade union believes that it cannot comply with the Act, that it will miss any deadlines set for it by the Certification Officer, or that it must breach its rules relating to any of the matters set out in Section 108A of the Act, it should seek to notify the Certification Officer at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>The Certification Officer will consider any representations made to her relating to any of these issues on a case-by-case basis, and she will seek to accommodate any requests made in those representations. The health and safety of Union Members, staff and the general public will be her primary concern.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the Certification Officer and her staff will be working away from the office for the foreseeable future.  If you need to contact us please do so by email. It would be helpful if you could copy all emails to info@certoffice.org to ensure that we can deal with your issue if your contact is not available.</p>

<p>It is possible that, whilst our premises are closed,  we may not be able to offer our full range of service or to reply to you as quickly as usual. You should, however, continue to contact us as normal and we will get back to you as soon as you can.</p>
