<p>The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has announced that Ian Funnell has been appointed as the organisation’s new Chair, succeeding Sir Andrew Mathews, whose second term as Chair ends on 25 January 2022.</p>

<p>Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Kwasi Kwarteng MP, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) plays a key role in the UK and global nuclear industry. It provides the technical knowledge and capability to ensure that the country’s civil nuclear energy programmes are delivered safely and in a cost-effective way.</p>

  <p>I am delighted by Ian’s appointment as the new Chair of NNL. Ian is ideally suited to provide NNL with the leadership to build its capabilities and deliver on its mission.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I would also like to thank Sir Andrew Mathews for his 8 years of service (including 6 as Chair) to NNL and all the work he has done during his tenure to transform NNL into the organisation it is today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ian Funnell said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am honoured to accept this role. I have been fortunate to work in some very innovative companies in the UK and internationally, in sectors such as energy, automation, engineering and digital.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I will use that experience to support NNL’s work as it deals with some of the world’s most complex challenges. It is an organisation with a clear vision and strong strategy. I relish the chance to take its mission forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sir Andrew Mathews said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">It has been both a great privilege and a joy to be the Chair of the NNL for the last 6 years and to have spent nearly 8 years on the board. I am delighted that I leave the business in such safe hands, and wish Ian well as he helps to take forward NNL’s new and exciting strategy; harnessing Nuclear Science to Benefit Society with a focus on clean energy, medical and health, environmental restoration and security. I will miss working with such a strong team and a hugely talented group of people and wish them every success in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paul Howarth, NNL CEO, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I’m delighted that Ian is joining NNL as Chair. This is a really exciting time for the organisation and I believe that Ian’s experience will be invaluable in helping NNL as it looks to fulfil its purpose. I’d also like to recognise Sir Andrew’s contribution and thank him for the role he has played during his involvement with NNL over 8 years. I’ve very much enjoyed working with Sir Andrew. He’s helped enormously to shape the organisation and support myself, and the whole of NNL, on this journey.</p>
</blockquote>
