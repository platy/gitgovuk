<p>Simon Thurley said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is a great privilege to be appointed as Chair at a critical time for the heritage sector. The National Lottery Heritage Fund will play a vital role in helping organisations rebuild and thrive following the COVID-19 pandemic and I look forward to playing a part in that.</p>

  <p>I also look forward to learning more about the extraordinary breadth of work The National Lottery Heritage Fund supports, from conserving natural habitats to protecting and celebrating heritage at the heart of our communities.</p>

  <p class="last-child">My career has been shaped by a strong belief in the power of the UKs heritage to positively contribute to people’s lives and the places where they live, work and visit. To have the opportunity to chair The National Lottery Heritage Fund which shares this vision is an honour.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ros Kerslake, CEO of The National Lottery Heritage Fund, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am delighted to welcome Simon Thurley as our new Chair.</p>

  <p>Simon will join us at a pivotal time as the UK’s heritage sector emerges from one of the greatest crises it has ever faced. Heritage has the potential to make a substantial contribution to the UK’s post-COVID recovery, making communities better places to live, boosting local economies, creating jobs and supporting personal wellbeing.</p>

  <p>Through his depth of knowledge and leadership experience in our sector, he will make a major contribution to helping us deliver on our ambitious agenda to support the heritage sector through this to a stronger and more resilient future. Investing in our heritage is for the benefit of everyone in the UK.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I would like to extend grateful thanks to René Olivieri who as interim Chair since December 2019 has played a critical role in steering the Fund over the last challenging year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>René Olivieri said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am proud to have held the role of interim Chair since December 2019. My time in this position has been defined by the coronavirus pandemic and the incredible response that my colleagues at The National Lottery Heritage Fund have coordinated to support the heritage sector at this crucial time.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Within a short space of time we delivered a £50 million Heritage Emergency Fund that helped struggling heritage organisations when they needed it most, as well as distributing significant government funding. I offer my congratulations to Simon Thurley and look forward to seeing the Fund lead the heritage sector’s recovery under his guidance.</p>
</blockquote>
