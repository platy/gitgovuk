<p>The partners are celebrating the appointment of their second key delivery partnership contract, as part of a pioneering new way of awarding long-term work packages at the Sellafield site.</p>

<p>NG Bailey Ltd and Balfour Beatty Kilpatrick Ltd have been appointed to deliver the electrical and instrumentation (E&amp;I), a framework agreement worth £485 to £600 million over the life of the programme – the largest framework to date.</p>

<p>The E&amp;I package is the second of several to be awarded by the partners over the coming months as part of a major framework spanning the next 18 years. The previous award announced was the heating, ventilation and air conditioning work package.</p>

<p>The framework has been procured under a new Multi Project Procurement (MPP) model which encourages long-term collaboration throughout the supply chain, enhanced project delivery, and paves the way for greater economic and social impact in the West Cumbria region.</p>

<p>The MPP model will see the appointment of key delivery partners to deliver work packages covering everything from building fit out, groundworks and general civils to steelwork and cladding.</p>

<p>Craig Jowett, on behalf of the Programme and Project Partners, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the largest MPP framework to be awarded to date, the responses from all tenderers were of the highest calibre and the level of commitment shown by the successful companies and those who have supported this package during the last 9 months shows the enthusiasm this framework model is creating.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We now move forward into the construction phase and start delivering against the critical success factors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Will Smith, managing director, Balfour Beatty Kilpatrick, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a leading mechanical and electrical engineering provider, Balfour Beatty Kilpatrick is perfectly positioned to support in the decommissioning of Sellafield over the next 18 years.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Having been appointed to both the heating, ventilation and air conditioning and electrical and instrumentation frameworks, we will strive to leave a lasting positive legacy across the region, providing numerous employment and local supply chain opportunities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Matt Hare, operations director (North West) at NG Bailey, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NG Bailey is incredibly excited about becoming a key delivery partner within the Sellafield Programme and Project Partners.</p>

  <p>The opportunity to deliver works that will assist the decommissioning programme over the next 20 years while also contributing to the local economy and increasing employment opportunities in the West Cumbrian area is remarkable.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The team looks forward to working with all project stakeholders to ensure that Sellafield Ltd’s mission is successful and recognised in the industry as leading the way in adopting Project 13 principles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Programme and Project Partners will work closely with all key delivery partners to deliver its ambition to create a clean and safe environment at the Sellafield site for future generations, improve sustainability and better outcomes for the local economy and communities.</p>

<p>As part of its pioneering approach to project delivery and local impact, Programme and Project Partners has engaged with the ‘Swimming with the Big Fish SME Matchmaker Service’, which brokers introductions and develops relationships between those bidding to become key delivery partners and high performing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) willing to invest in West Cumbria.</p>

<p>These SMEs plan to create additional jobs, recruit apprentices and invest to expand/create new facilities in the West Cumbria as a result of the work they do with their respective key delivery partners.</p>
