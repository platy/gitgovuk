<p>For the first time, Ministers and representatives from some of the world’s largest and
most progressive car markets have come together to form a new Zero Emission
Vehicle Transition Council.</p>

<p>Hosted by the COP26 President, Alok Sharma, the Council met to discuss how to
accelerate the pace of the global transition to zero emission vehicles.</p>

<p>These Ministers and representatives have agreed to collectively address some of the
key challenges in the transition to ZEVs, enabling the transition to be faster, cheaper,
and easier for all.  </p>

<p>The Council was made up of Ministers and representatives from California, Canada,
Denmark, European Commission, France, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands,
Norway, Spain, South Korea and Sweden, the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The following joint statement was released after the Council meeting.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A rapid global transition to zero emission vehicles is vital to meet the goals of the
Paris Agreement on climate change. Road transport accounts for over 10% of global
greenhouse gas emissions, and these emissions are rising. We need to dramatically
increase the pace of the global transition to meet our Paris Agreement goals. This
will also offer huge opportunities for jobs and growth, cleaner air, improved public
health, and could also boost energy security and help balance electricity grids as we
make the transition to clean power.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In response to this global challenge and historic opportunity, we met today as the
Zero Emission Vehicles Transition Council to discuss how to increase the pace of
the transition. As ministers and representatives from governments whose markets
collectively account for around half of all new vehicle sales globally, we have a
unique responsibility. The actions we take, in dialogue with industry, and also with
businesses, cities and regions, and wider civil society, will determine the pace of the
global transitions to zero emission vehicles. While our national contexts and policy
approaches may differ, the transition will be faster, easier and lower cost for all if we
work together.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will use this forum to coordinate our efforts. We will act together to overcome
strategic, political and technical barriers, accelerate the production of zero emission
vehicles, and increase economies of scale. We will boost investment, bring down
costs and increase the uptake of zero emission vehicles and the many economic,
social and environmental benefits it brings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will explore specific opportunities for collaboration in areas including:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a) aligning the future of the road transport sector with Paris Agreement
goals, focusing on the role of zero emission technologies and key
policies, while also considering the roles of alternative technologies in
the transition,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>b) ensuring the transition to zero emission vehicles is truly global, leaving
no country or region behind,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>c) ensuring the lifecycle (from production to scrapping) of zero emission
vehicles is sustainable and inclusive,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>d) ensuring the enabling infrastructure is in place, including electric
vehicle chargepoints and hydrogen vehicle re-fuelling, in the context of
decarbonising the power sector and growing the hydrogen economy,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>e) coordinating our innovation efforts.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>5.As we work to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, we recognise that the
decisions we make today will be critical for laying the foundations for sustainable and
inclusive growth. As such, we commit to ensuring our recovery plans support an
accelerated transition to zero emission vehicles as part of broader efforts to boost
growth and employment, while promoting cleaner and more sustainable economies.</p>
