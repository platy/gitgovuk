<p>The main points from this week’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2021-to-2022-season">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a> are:</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that at a national level, COVID-19 activity decreased in most indicators of week 4 of 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>COVID-19 hospitalisations decreased in most age groups, though have increase slightly in those aged 0 to 4 and 5 to 14.</p>

<p>The overall number of reported acute respiratory incidents decreased in the past week, in England.</p>

<p>Case rates were highest in those aged 5 to 9, with a weekly rate of 1,925.5 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The lowest case rates were in those aged 70 to 79, with a weekly rate of 301.3 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Weekly case rates per 100,000 population were highest in the South East, at 1,199.8.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 were lowest in the North West, with a weekly rate of 745.5.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) in England was 995 in week 4, compared to 1,351 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for week 4 was 15.41 per 100,000 population, in the previous week it was 16.67 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and above.</p>

<p>Professor Steven Riley, Director General of Data, Analytics and Surveillance at the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This week we have incorporated data on reinfections to improve our understanding of how the virus and its impact has changed. Whilst the pandemic is not over, it is promising that we are no longer seeing rapid rises in incidents of infection and hospitalisation.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We urge everyone to get their vaccine and booster jab as soon as they are eligible, to test regularly with <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFDs</abbr> before meeting anyone who is vulnerable and to take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test if they have symptoms. &nbsp;Please keep playing your part to reduce the spread of COVID-19.</p>

  <p>Although rates of serious illness from Omicron infections remain low, we are still seeing large numbers of cases, especially in primary-aged children.</p>

  <p>We encourage everyone to get vaccinated or a booster jab as soon as they are eligible, to continue testing regularly with <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFDs</abbr> – particularly before meeting anyone who is vulnerable – and to take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test if you have symptoms.</p>

The overall number of reported acute respiratory incidents decreased in the past week, in England.</p>

<p>Case rates were highest in those aged 5 to 9, with a weekly rate of 1,935.7 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The lowest case rates were in those aged 70 to 79, with a weekly rate of 336.0 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and above.</p>

<p>Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor for the UK Health Security Agency, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The recent decline in community case rates and individuals requiring hospitalisation is encouraging and it’s thanks to the public, who have taken up vaccination and followed the Plan B measures closely, that we’ve got to this point. However, we should not be complacent. The pandemic is not over yet and we will need to remain cautious to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. I encourage everyone to get the vaccine as soon as they can, to continue testing regularly with <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFDs</abbr> – particularly before periods of high risk and before seeing anyone who is vulnerable – and to take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test if they have symptoms.</p>

<p>Dr. Alicia Demirjian, COVID-19 Public Health Incident Director at the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Overall daily case rates and hospital admissions continue to be high.

  <p class="last-child">Please wear a mask in crowded places, in shops and on public transport, wash your hands, and ventilate rooms well.&nbsp; If you have any COVID-19 symptoms stay at home and get a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test as soon as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rates of COVID-19 continue to increase in younger age groups. While the booster program is protecting many of our friends and relatives, there are still people out there who had not yet taken up their offer of a booster. So as the holiday season approaches and average levels of social mixing go up, please do come forward if you are eligible for a vaccine or a booster, and take up the jab as soon as you are offered.</p>

  <p>Older people and those with weaker immune systems&nbsp;are more vulnerable to infection. Always take a rapid lateral flow test before visiting anyone at higher risk of getting seriously ill from the virus.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Small changes can make a big difference in the risk of passing on the infection. Help protect yourself and loved ones by opening windows and doors to increase the air flow when meeting people inside. Please wear a mask in crowded places, wash your hands and, if you have any COVID-19 symptoms, stay at home and get a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test as soon as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rates of COVID-19 remain high across the country and hospitalisations are increasing. The high death figures recorded this week act as a timely reminder that we all need to play our part to drive down infections, hospitalisations and deaths – the pandemic is far from over. Vaccines remain the best defence against catching COVID-19 and passing it on – please come forward if you haven’t already and if you are eligible for a booster vaccine, please take up the jab as soon as you are offered.</p>

  <p class="last-child">As winter approaches, help protect yourself and loved ones by washing your hands regularly and wearing a mask in crowded places.

<blockquote>
  <p>Cases of COVID-19 remain high across the country, especially among 10 to 19 year olds.</p>

  <p>The best way to protect yourself and others is to get a vaccine. While vaccination offers excellent protection against COVID-19, there are things you can do to prevent the spread of the virus.</p>

  <p>When meeting people inside, ventilate the room by opening windows and doors. Wear a face covering in crowded places and wash your hands regularly throughout the day.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Avoid mixing with others if you feel unwell for any reason and if you have any symptoms of COVID-19, get a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test as soon as possible.</p>
