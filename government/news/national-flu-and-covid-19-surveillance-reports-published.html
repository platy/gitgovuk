<p>The main points from this week’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2021-to-2022-season">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a> are:</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that at a national level COVID-19 activity has decreased in some indicators such as case rates for those aged 5 to 9 and the number of acute respiratory infection incidents in England in week 47 of 2021.</p>

<p>Case rates were highest in those aged 5 to 9, with a weekly rate of 873.8 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The lowest case rates were in those aged 80 and above, with a weekly rate of 51.8 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Weekly case rates per 100,000 population were highest in the South East at 517.7.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 were lowest in Yorkshire and Humber with a weekly rate of 308.9.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) in England was 582 in week 47, compared to 630 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for week 47 was 6.02 per 100,000 population, in the previous week it was 6.80 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 were highest in the North East, with a rate of 8.10 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and above.</p>

<p>Professor Steven Riley, Director General of Data, Analytics and Surveillance at <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As we observe the Omicron variant emerging, the Delta variant continues to circulate at high levels across all age ranges, and is still causing substantial infection and hospitalisation in older people.&nbsp; Getting vaccinated, or a booster if you are eligible, is an essential step to prevent the spread of COVID in our communities.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Please wear a mask in crowded places, in shops and on public transport, wash your hands, and ventilate rooms well.&nbsp; If you have any COVID-19 symptoms stay at home and get a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The main points from this week’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2021-to-2022-season">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a> are:</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that at a national level COVID-19 activity has increased in some indicators such as case rates for those aged 5 to 9 and 10 to 19 and the number of acute respiratory infection incidents in England in week 46 of 2021.</p>

<p>Case rates were highest in those aged 5 to 9, with a weekly rate of 932.3 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The lowest case rates were in those aged 80 and above, with a weekly rate of 63.6 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Weekly case rates per 100,000 population were highest in the South East at 530.5.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 were lowest in London with a weekly rate of 318.1.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) in England was 630 in week 46, compared to 554 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for week 46 was 6.49 per 100,000 population, in the previous week it was 7.65 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 were highest in the North East, with a rate of 9.37 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and above.</p>

<p>Professor Steven Riley, Director General of Data, Analytics and Surveillance at the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rates of COVID-19 continue to increase in younger age groups. While the booster program is protecting many of our friends and relatives, there are still people out there who had not yet taken up their offer of a booster. So as the holiday season approaches and average levels of social mixing go up, please do come forward if you are eligible for a vaccine or a booster, and take up the jab as soon as you are offered.</p>

  <p>Older people and those with weaker immune systems&nbsp;are more vulnerable to infection. Always take a rapid lateral flow test before visiting anyone at higher risk of getting seriously ill from the virus.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Small changes can make a big difference in the risk of passing on the infection. Help protect yourself and loved ones by opening windows and doors to increase the air flow when meeting people inside. Please wear a mask in crowded places, wash your hands and, if you have any COVID-19 symptoms, stay at home and get a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that at a national level COVID-19 activity has increased in some indicators in week 45 of 2021.</p>

<p>Case rates were highest in those aged 5 to 9, with a weekly rate of 722.9 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Weekly case rates per 100,000 population were highest in the South West at 485.3.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and above.</p>

<p>Professor Steven Riley, Director General of Data, Analytics and Surveillance at the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rates of COVID-19 continue to increase in those from younger age groups, and hospitalisations remain highest in those aged 85 and over.&nbsp;Following the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) announcement on Monday, more people than ever are eligible for second and booster doses – and it is as important as ever to get vaccinated or receive a booster jab as soon as you are offered one.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Socialising indoors in places with poor ventilation increases the risk of infection. Help protect yourself and loved ones by opening windows and doors to ventilate the room when meeting people inside. Wash your hands regularly and wear a mask in crowded places. If you have any COVID-19 symptoms, stay at home and get a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Professor Steven Riley, Director General of Data, Analytics and Surveillance at the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rates of COVID-19 remain high across the country, and we all need to play our part to drive down infections, hospitalisations and deaths. Vaccines are the best defence against catching COVID-19 and passing it on – so please come forward if you are eligible for a vaccine or a booster, and take up the jab as soon as you are offered.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The risk of infection increases as winter approaches and people spend more time indoors. Help protect yourself and loved ones by washing your hands regularly and wearing a mask in crowded places. When meeting people inside, open windows and doors to ventilate the room.

<p>Professor Steven Riley, Director General of Data, Analytics and Surveillance at UK Health Security Agency, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rates of COVID-19 remain high across the country and hospitalisations are increasing. The high death figures recorded this week act as a timely reminder that we all need to play our part to drive down infections, hospitalisations and deaths – the pandemic is far from over. Vaccines remain the best defence against catching COVID-19 and passing it on – please come forward if you haven’t already and if you are eligible for a booster vaccine, please take up the jab as soon as you are offered.</p>

  <p>The best way to protect yourself and others is to get a vaccine. While vaccination offers excellent protection against COVID-19, there are things you can do to prevent the spread of the virus.</p>

  <p>When meeting people inside, ventilate the room by opening windows and doors. Wear a face covering in crowded places and wash your hands regularly throughout the day.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Avoid mixing with others if you feel unwell for any reason and if you have any symptoms of COVID-19, get a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test as soon as possible.</p>
