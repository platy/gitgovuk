          <h2>Latest update</h2>

<p>The main points from this week’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2022-to-2023-season">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a> are:</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has remained stable in most indicators in week 37 of 2022.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) increased in England in week 37 to 133 compared to 131 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 37 was 4.6 per 100,000 population, a slight decrease from 5.1 in the previous week. There were small increases in those aged over 80.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for week 37 was 4.91 per 100,000 population, a slight decrease from 5.94 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the North East, with a rate of 7.19 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Our latest data, available through the <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/" rel="external">COVID-19 dashboard</a>, is updated weekly on Thursdays at around 4pm and is the focus of the below quote.</p>

<p>Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor at the UK Health Security Agency, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While COVID-19 rates are still low, the latest data for the last 7 days indicate a rise in hospitalisations and a rise in positive tests reported from the community.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>For those eligible, the time to get your autumn booster is now. Getting a booster will give your immune system time to build up your protection against being severely ill from COVID-19 as we move into winter.</p>

  <p>All of the available boosters provide good protection against severe illness from COVID-19 and getting your booster sooner rather than later is crucial.</p>

  <p class="last-child">As it gets colder and we head towards winter, we will start to see respiratory infections pick up – please try to stay at home if you are unwell and avoid contact with vulnerable people.</p>

<h3>Thursday 8 September 2022</h3>

<p>The main points from this week’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2022-to-2023-season">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a> are:</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in most indicators in week 35 of 2022.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) increased in England in week 35 to 116 compared to 111 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 35 was 3.7 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 4.1 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for week 35 was 5.33 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 6.17 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the North East, with a rate of 6.71 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, consultant epidemiologist for immunisation and countermeasures at the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The latest COVID-19 indicators provide more positive news, as COVID-19 case rates and hospitalisations continue to decline.</p>

  <p>However, with respiratory viruses increasing in circulation in the winter months we can expect to see growing cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. We urge all who are contacted to come forward and accept their booster when called for their jab. The NHS booking system is now open for immunosuppressed people and those aged over 75.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We also encourage everyone to keep helping to reduce the spread of the virus – meeting in well-ventilated spaces, washing hands regularly and staying away from others where possible if you have symptoms of a respiratory illness.</p>

<p>The main points from this week’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2022-to-2023-season">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a>&nbsp;are:</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has decreased in most indicators in week 34 of 2022.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) decreased in England in week 34 to 111 compared to 124 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 34 was 3.8 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 5.1 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for week 34 was 5.88 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 7.17 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 are highest in the West Midlands, with a rate of 8.23 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccine-weekly-surveillance-reports">latest evidence</a> shows that vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation is similar for the BA.4/5 variants as it is for BA.2.</p>

<p>​In somebody who received their second dose around 6 months previously, a booster dose increases protection against hospitalisation by 50 to 60%.&nbsp;This is the most comprehensive analysis of vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation for BA.4/5 undertaken to date.</p>

<p>Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, consultant epidemiologist for immunisation and countermeasures at the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The latest COVID-19 indicators provide more positive news, with continued low levels of COVID-19 case rates and hospitalisations and a sustained downward trend.</p>

  <p>The latest evidence shows vaccine effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against hospitalisation with the BA.4 and BA.5 variant is similar to the protection given for BA.2. The latest analysis shows getting a booster dose 6 or more months after your first 2 jabs increases protection against hospitalisation by around 60%.</p>

  <p>The autumn booster will provide the best protection against COVID-19 this winter and we urge all those eligible – people aged 50 and over and those with underlying health conditions – to come forward when called for their jab.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We also encourage everyone to keep up the actions that are helping to reduce the spread of the virus – meeting in well-ventilated spaces, washing hands regularly and staying away from others where possible if you have symptoms of a respiratory illness.</p>

  <p>We are now seeing decreases in COVID-19 case rates and hospitalisations.

  <p>We urge anyone who is not up to date with their jabs to come forward to give themselves the best possible protection.</p>

  <p>To help prevent the spread of COVID-19, try to meet up outdoors or in well ventilated spaces and remember to keep up good hand hygiene and cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing. It is also sensible to wear a face covering if you are in crowded, enclosed spaces.</p>

  <p>We continue to see COVID-19 case rates and hospitalisations rise in all age groups, with the largest increases in hospitalisations and <abbr title="intensive care unit">ICU</abbr> admissions in those aged 75 and older.</p>

  <p>There is likely to be a substantial amount of waning immunity in older people who have not taken up the booster on schedule, so we can expect these rises to continue over the coming weeks and throughout July.</p>

  <p>It’s reassuring that 79.8 per cent of people aged 75 and over in June have had a vaccine in the past 6 months but we urge the remaining 16 per cent to get their spring booster as soon as possible to help protect against serious illness – preliminary analysis shows that the vaccine is continuing to protect against severe illness and remains the best defence against severe disease and hospitalisation. This includes anyone who had their last vaccine more than 6 months ago, as well as those living in care homes or who are clinically vulnerable.</p>

  <p>Vaccination remains the best defence against severe disease and we urge anyone who’s eligible for the spring booster to take it up. Remember that COVID-19 has not gone away and we should all keep up good hand and respiratory hygiene.</p>

<p>The main points from this week’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2021-to-2022-season">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a>&nbsp;are:</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has increased in several indicators in week 24 of 2022.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) increased in England to 261 in week 24, compared to 170 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 24 was 4.2 per 100,000 population, a slight increase from 3.9 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for week 24 was 8.20 per 100,000 population, an increase from 6.11 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 remain highest in the North East, with a rate of 12.45 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Clinical Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We continue to see increases in COVID-19 outbreaks within care homes and hospitalisations among those aged 75 years and over.</p>

  <p>Our data also shows that 17.5 per cent of people aged 75 years and over have not had a vaccine within the past 6 months, putting them more at risk of severe disease.</p>

  <p>“We urge everyone in this age group, as well as those living in a care home or who are clinically vulnerable, to ensure they get their spring booster for protection against serious illness.</p>

  <p class="last-child">COVID-19 has not gone away and we should all remember to keep up good hand and respiratory hygiene. It is also sensible to wear a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces. If you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection, and a high temperature or feel unwell, try to stay at home or away from others – especially elderly or vulnerable people.</p>

<p>Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Clinical Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After a period of low case rates, we are now seeing increases in outbreaks within care homes and in hospitalisations among those aged 80 years and over.</p>

  <p>It is encouraging that we are not seeing an increase in intensive care unit (<abbr title="intensive care unit">ICU</abbr>) admissions but we are monitoring data closely and assessing the possible impact of subvariants BA.4 and BA.5.</p>

  <p>As we enter summer, it’s still important to remember that COVID-19 has not gone away and to get vaccinated to reduce the risk of becoming seriously ill with the virus. If you’re not yet up to date with your jabs please come forward now – it’s not too late to get protected.</p>

<p>Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, consultant epidemiologist for immunisation and countermeasures at the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>COVID-19 case rates continue to decline, but it remains important to get vaccinated to reduce the risk of serious illness. If you’ve yet to take up the offer of a vaccine or have missed your latest jab please come forward now.</p>

  <p>Recent data has shown a small rise in positivity rates and in hospitalisations with COVID-19. These small increases should be interpreted with caution as data may be subject to delays due to the Jubilee bank holiday.</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that at a national level coronavirus (COVID-19) there were increases in some COVID-19 indicators but others decreased, suggesting that the rate of increase in activity seen in recent weeks may be slowing in week 13 of 2022.</p>

<p>Case rates remain highest in those aged 30 to 39, with a weekly rate of 820.0 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The lowest case rates remain in those aged 0 to 4, with a weekly rate of 196.4 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Professor Steven Riley, Director General of Data, Analytics and Surveillance at the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>High case rates and increasing numbers of hospitalisations remind us that the pandemic is not over and COVID-19 still poses a real risk to vulnerable people. As people mix more, we have also seen increasing levels of common infections such as flu and norovirus.</p>

  <p>If you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection such as a high temperature try to stay at home or away from other people – especially those who you know are vulnerable.</p>

  <p>While people will be looking forward to catching up with friends and family over the Easter period, it’s important to keep indoor spaces well ventilated, wash your hands regularly and wear a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces or when visiting people at highest risk of severe illness with COVID19.</p>

<p>Dame Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The pandemic is not over and how the virus will develop over time remains uncertain. COVID-19 still poses a real risk to many of us, particularly with case rates and hospitalisations on the rise. That is why it is sensible to wear a mask in enclosed spaces, keep indoor spaces ventilated and stay away from others if you have any symptoms of a respiratory illness, including COVID-19.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Vaccination remains the best way to protect us all from severe disease and hospitalisation due to COVID-19 infection. If you have not yet come forward for your primary or booster I would urge you to do so straight away.

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and over.</p>

<p>Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor at the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rate at which we’re currently seeing cases increasing is a reminder to us all that the pandemic is not over. Hospital admissions and cases of COVID-19 have continued to rise and we can expect to see further increases before we start to see a decline.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Vaccination is the key to staying safe from serious illness and it’s vital that everyone gets all of their recommended doses. Wearing a face covering in crowded or enclosed spaces, socialising outside where possible, and always observing good hand hygiene will also help to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Anyone with symptoms or a positive tests should limit their contact with others as much as possible.</p>

<p>The main points from this week’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2021-to-2022-season">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a> are:</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that at a national level COVID-19 activity has decreased in some indicators such as case rates for those aged 5 to 9 and the number of acute respiratory infection incidents in England in week 47 of 2021.</p>

<p>Case rates were highest in those aged 5 to 9, with a weekly rate of 873.8 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The lowest case rates were in those aged 80 and above, with a weekly rate of 51.8 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Weekly case rates per 100,000 population were highest in the South East at 517.7.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 were lowest in Yorkshire and Humber with a weekly rate of 308.9.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) in England was 582 in week 47, compared to 630 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for week 47 was 6.02 per 100,000 population, in the previous week it was 6.80 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 were highest in the North East, with a rate of 8.10 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and above.</p>

<p>Professor Steven Riley, Director General of Data, Analytics and Surveillance at <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As we observe the Omicron variant emerging, the Delta variant continues to circulate at high levels across all age ranges, and is still causing substantial infection and hospitalisation in older people.&nbsp; Getting vaccinated, or a booster if you are eligible, is an essential step to prevent the spread of COVID in our communities.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Please wear a mask in crowded places, in shops and on public transport, wash your hands, and ventilate rooms well.&nbsp; If you have any COVID-19 symptoms stay at home and get a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and above.</p>

<p>Professor Steven Riley, Director General of Data, Analytics and Surveillance at the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rates of COVID-19 continue to increase in younger age groups. While the booster program is protecting many of our friends and relatives, there are still people out there who had not yet taken up their offer of a booster. So as the holiday season approaches and average levels of social mixing go up, please do come forward if you are eligible for a vaccine or a booster, and take up the jab as soon as you are offered.</p>

  <p>Older people and those with weaker immune systems&nbsp;are more vulnerable to infection. Always take a rapid lateral flow test before visiting anyone at higher risk of getting seriously ill from the virus.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Small changes can make a big difference in the risk of passing on the infection. Help protect yourself and loved ones by opening windows and doors to increase the air flow when meeting people inside. Please wear a mask in crowded places, wash your hands and, if you have any COVID-19 symptoms, stay at home and get a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test as soon as possible.</p>
