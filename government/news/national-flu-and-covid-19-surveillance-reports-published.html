<p>The main points from this week’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2021-to-2022-season">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a> are:</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that at a national level COVID-19 activity had increased in some instances in week 40 of 2021.</p>

<p>Case rates were highest in those aged 10 to 19, with a weekly rate of 1120.8 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The lowest case rates were in those aged 80 and above, with a weekly rate of 110.8 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Weekly case rates per 100,000 population were highest in the East Midlands at 488.7.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 were lowest in London with a weekly rate of 214.2.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) in England was 579 in week 40, compared to 543 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for week 40 was 6.03 per 100,000 population, in the previous week it was 5.74 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 were highest in the North East, with a rate of 9.98 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and above.</p>

<p>Dr William Welfare, Incident Director at the UK Health Security Agency, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Case rates of COVID-19 remain high across the country and have been slowly rising.</p>

  <p>As winter approaches, help protect yourself against COVID-19 and flu by washing your hands regularly and wearing a mask in crowded places. When meeting people inside, open windows and doors to ventilate the room.</p>

  <p class="last-child">If you are offered a vaccine for either COVID-19 or flu, please take it. If you have any COVID-19 symptoms, get a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test.</p>

<p>The main points from this week’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2021-to-2022-season">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a> are:</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that at a national level COVID-19 activity remained stable in most indicators in week 39 of 2021.</p>

<p>Case rates were highest in those aged 10 to 19, with a weekly rate of 1047.7 per 100,000 population, although cases are now falling.</p>

<p>The lowest case rates were in those aged 80 and above, with a weekly rate of 86.0 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Weekly case rates per 100,000 population were highest in the East Midlands at 442.4.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 were lowest in London with a weekly rate of 197.3.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) in England was 543 in week 39, compared to 622 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for week 39 was 5.60 per 100,000 population, in the previous week it was 5.44 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and above.</p>

<p>Dr Mike Gent, Incident Director at UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cases of COVID-19 remain high across the country, especially among 10 to 19 year olds.</p>

  <p>The best way to protect yourself and others is to get a vaccine. While vaccination offers excellent protection against COVID-19, there are things you can do to prevent the spread of the virus.</p>

  <p>When meeting people inside, ventilate the room by opening windows and doors. Wear a face covering in crowded places and wash your hands regularly throughout the day.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Avoid mixing with others if you feel unwell for any reason and if you have any symptoms of COVID-19, get a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test as soon as possible.</p>
