          <h2>Latest update</h2>

<p>The main points from this week’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2021-to-2022-season">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a>&nbsp;are:</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity has increased in several indicators in week 24 of 2022.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) increased in England to 261 in week 24, compared to 170 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 24 was 4.2 per 100,000 population, a slight increase from 3.9 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for week 24 was 8.20 per 100,000 population, an increase from 6.11 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 remain highest in the North East, with a rate of 12.45 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Clinical Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We continue to see increases in COVID-19 outbreaks within care homes and hospitalisations among those aged 75 years and over.</p>

  <p>Our data also shows that 17.5 per cent of people aged 75 years and over have not had a vaccine within the past 6 months, putting them more at risk of severe disease.</p>

  <p>“We urge everyone in this age group, as well as those living in a care home or who are clinically vulnerable, to ensure they get their spring booster for protection against serious illness.</p>

  <p class="last-child">COVID-19 has not gone away and we should all remember to keep up good hand and respiratory hygiene. It is also sensible to wear a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces. If you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection, and a high temperature or feel unwell, try to stay at home or away from others – especially elderly or vulnerable people.</p>

<p>The main points from this week’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2021-to-2022-season">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a>&nbsp;are:</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that, at a national level, COVID-19 activity (including case rates) has increased in week 23 of 2022.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) increased in England to 170 in week 23, compared to 78 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 23 was 3.3 per 100,000 population, a slight increase from 3.0 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for week 23 was 6.10 per 100,000 population, an increase from 4.65 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 remain highest in the North East, with a rate of 10.70 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Clinical Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After a period of low case rates, we are now seeing increases in outbreaks within care homes and in hospitalisations among those aged 80 years and over.</p>

  <p>It is encouraging that we are not seeing an increase in intensive care unit (<abbr title="intensive care unit">ICU</abbr>) admissions but we are monitoring data closely and assessing the possible impact of subvariants BA.4 and BA.5.</p>

  <p>As we enter summer, it’s still important to remember that COVID-19 has not gone away and to get vaccinated to reduce the risk of becoming seriously ill with the virus. If you’re not yet up to date with your jabs please come forward now – it’s not too late to get protected.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Remember to observe good hand and respiratory hygiene. It is also sensible to wear a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces. If you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection, and a high temperature or feel unwell, try to stay at home or away from others – especially elderly or vulnerable people.</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that at a national level, COVID-19 activity (including case rates) have decreased in week 22 of 2022.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) increased slightly in England to 78 in week 22, compared to 69 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Positivity for pillar one laboratory confirmed cases for week 22 was 2.50 per 100,000 population, a slight increase from 2.40 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 were highest in the North East, with a rate of 8.30 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and over.</p>

<p>Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, consultant epidemiologist for immunisation and countermeasures at the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>COVID-19 case rates continue to decline, but it remains important to get vaccinated to reduce the risk of serious illness. If you’ve yet to take up the offer of a vaccine or have missed your latest jab please come forward now.</p>

  <p>Recent data has shown a small rise in positivity rates and in hospitalisations with COVID-19. These small increases should be interpreted with caution as data may be subject to delays due to the Jubilee bank holiday.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Remember to observe good hand and respiratory hygiene. If you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection, and a high temperature or feel unwell, try to stay at home or away from others – especially elderly or vulnerable people.</p>

<h3>Thursday 7 April 2022</h3>

<p>The main points from this week’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2021-to-2022-season">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a> are:</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that at a national level coronavirus (COVID-19) there were increases in some COVID-19 indicators but others decreased, suggesting that the rate of increase in activity seen in recent weeks may be slowing in week 13 of 2022.</p>

<p>Case rates remain highest in those aged 30 to 39, with a weekly rate of 820.0 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The lowest case rates remain in those aged 0 to 4, with a weekly rate of 196.4 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Weekly case rates per 100,000 population remain highest in the South West, at 804.5.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 remain lowest in the London, with a weekly rate of 483.2.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) in England was 952 in week 13, compared to 851 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for week 13 was 20.46 per 100,000 population, in the previous week it was 20.08 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 were highest in the North East, with a rate of 31.14 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and over.</p>

<p>Professor Steven Riley, Director General of Data, Analytics and Surveillance at the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>High case rates and increasing numbers of hospitalisations remind us that the pandemic is not over and COVID-19 still poses a real risk to vulnerable people. As people mix more, we have also seen increasing levels of common infections such as flu and norovirus.</p>

  <p>If you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection such as a high temperature try to stay at home or away from other people – especially those who you know are vulnerable.</p>

  <p>While people will be looking forward to catching up with friends and family over the Easter period, it’s important to keep indoor spaces well ventilated, wash your hands regularly and wear a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces or when visiting people at highest risk of severe illness with COVID19.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It’s important to catch up on any primary or booster jabs, so if you’re not up to date, please make sure you get a jab.</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that at a national level coronavirus (COVID-19) activity remained stable in most indicators of week 12 of 2022. Case rates increased in some age groups, regions and ethnic groups, remaining stable or decreasing in others.</p>

<p>Case rates remain highest in those aged 30 to 39, with a weekly rate of 1,123.7 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The lowest case rates remain in those aged 0 to 4, with a weekly rate of 295.1 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Weekly case rates per 100,000 population remain highest in the South West, at 1,190.5.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 remain lowest in the London, with a weekly rate of 650.3.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) in England was 851 in week 12, compared to 1173 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for week 12 was 19.48 per 100,000 population, in the previous week it was 18.55 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 were highest in the South West, with a rate of 28.61 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and over.</p>

<p>Dame Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The pandemic is not over and how the virus will develop over time remains uncertain. COVID-19 still poses a real risk to many of us, particularly with case rates and hospitalisations on the rise. That is why it is sensible to wear a mask in enclosed spaces, keep indoor spaces ventilated and stay away from others if you have any symptoms of a respiratory illness, including COVID-19.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Vaccination remains the best way to protect us all from severe disease and hospitalisation due to COVID-19 infection. If you have not yet come forward for your primary or booster I would urge you to do so straight away. The NHS vaccine programme is there to help you and the sooner you are vaccinated the sooner you and your family and friends will be protected.</p>

<p>This week we publish the 100th <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2021-to-2022-season">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a>.</p>

<p>The main points from this week’s report are:</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that at a national level COVID-19 activity increased in most indicators of week 11 of 2022.</p>

<p>Case rates remain highest in those aged 30 to 39, with a weekly rate of 1,122.1 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The lowest case rates remain in those aged 0 to 4, with a weekly rate of 332.8 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Weekly case rates per 100,000 population remain highest in the South West, at 1,269.1.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 remain lowest in the North East, with a weekly rate of 647.9.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) in England was 1,173 in week 11, compared to 842 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for week 11 was 17.89 per 100,000 population, in the previous week it was 14.07 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 were highest in the South West, with a rate of 28.71 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and over.</p>

<p>Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor at the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rate at which we’re currently seeing cases increasing is a reminder to us all that the pandemic is not over. Hospital admissions and cases of COVID-19 have continued to rise and we can expect to see further increases before we start to see a decline.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Vaccination is the key to staying safe from serious illness and it’s vital that everyone gets all of their recommended doses. Wearing a face covering in crowded or enclosed spaces, socialising outside where possible, and always observing good hand hygiene will also help to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Anyone with symptoms or a positive tests should limit their contact with others as much as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rates of COVID-19 continue to increase in younger age groups. While the booster program is protecting many of our friends and relatives, there are still people out there who had not yet taken up their offer of a booster. So as the holiday season approaches and average levels of social mixing go up, please do come forward if you are eligible for a vaccine or a booster, and take up the jab as soon as you are offered.</p>

  <p>Older people and those with weaker immune systems&nbsp;are more vulnerable to infection. Always take a rapid lateral flow test before visiting anyone at higher risk of getting seriously ill from the virus.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Small changes can make a big difference in the risk of passing on the infection. Help protect yourself and loved ones by opening windows and doors to increase the air flow when meeting people inside. Please wear a mask in crowded places, wash your hands and, if you have any COVID-19 symptoms, stay at home and get a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test as soon as possible.</p>
