          <h2>Latest update</h2>

<p>The main points from this week’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2021-to-2022-season">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a> are:</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that at a national level, COVID-19 activity (including case rates and hospital admissions) has declined in week 15 of 2022.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) in England was 559 in week 15, compared to 788 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for week 15 was 16.17 per 100,000 population, down from 19.94 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 were highest in the North East, with a rate of 22.79 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and over.</p>

<p>Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Clinical Programmes at the UK Health Security Agency, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is encouraging that COVID-19 hospital admissions and acute respiratory infections continue to fall this week. We should all take action to keep driving this downward trend.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Vaccination provides the greatest protection against severe illness.&nbsp;Please ensure you are up to date with your latest jabs. If you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection, and a high temperature or feel unwell, try to stay at home or away from others – especially those who are elderly or vulnerable.</p>

<h3>Thursday 7 April 2022</h3>

<p>The main points from this week’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2021-to-2022-season">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a> are:</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that at a national level coronavirus (COVID-19) there were increases in some COVID-19 indicators but others decreased, suggesting that the rate of increase in activity seen in recent weeks may be slowing in week 13 of 2022.</p>

<p>Case rates remain highest in those aged 30 to 39, with a weekly rate of 820.0 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The lowest case rates remain in those aged 0 to 4, with a weekly rate of 196.4 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Weekly case rates per 100,000 population remain highest in the South West, at 804.5.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 remain lowest in the London, with a weekly rate of 483.2.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) in England was 952 in week 13, compared to 851 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for week 13 was 20.46 per 100,000 population, in the previous week it was 20.08 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 were highest in the North East, with a rate of 31.14 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and over.</p>

<p>Professor Steven Riley, Director General of Data, Analytics and Surveillance at the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>High case rates and increasing numbers of hospitalisations remind us that the pandemic is not over and COVID-19 still poses a real risk to vulnerable people. As people mix more, we have also seen increasing levels of common infections such as flu and norovirus.</p>

  <p>If you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection such as a high temperature try to stay at home or away from other people – especially those who you know are vulnerable.</p>

  <p>While people will be looking forward to catching up with friends and family over the Easter period, it’s important to keep indoor spaces well ventilated, wash your hands regularly and wear a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces or when visiting people at highest risk of severe illness with COVID19.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It’s important to catch up on any primary or booster jabs, so if you’re not up to date, please make sure you get a jab.</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that at a national level coronavirus (COVID-19) activity remained stable in most indicators of week 12 of 2022. Case rates increased in some age groups, regions and ethnic groups, remaining stable or decreasing in others.</p>

<p>Case rates remain highest in those aged 30 to 39, with a weekly rate of 1,123.7 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The lowest case rates remain in those aged 0 to 4, with a weekly rate of 295.1 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Weekly case rates per 100,000 population remain highest in the South West, at 1,190.5.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 remain lowest in the London, with a weekly rate of 650.3.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) in England was 851 in week 12, compared to 1173 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for week 12 was 19.48 per 100,000 population, in the previous week it was 18.55 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 were highest in the South West, with a rate of 28.61 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and over.</p>

<p>Dame Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The pandemic is not over and how the virus will develop over time remains uncertain. COVID-19 still poses a real risk to many of us, particularly with case rates and hospitalisations on the rise. That is why it is sensible to wear a mask in enclosed spaces, keep indoor spaces ventilated and stay away from others if you have any symptoms of a respiratory illness, including COVID-19.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Vaccination remains the best way to protect us all from severe disease and hospitalisation due to COVID-19 infection. If you have not yet come forward for your primary or booster I would urge you to do so straight away. The NHS vaccine programme is there to help you and the sooner you are vaccinated the sooner you and your family and friends will be protected.</p>

<p>This week we publish the 100th <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2021-to-2022-season">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a>.</p>

<p>The main points from this week’s report are:</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that at a national level COVID-19 activity increased in most indicators of week 11 of 2022.</p>

<p>Case rates remain highest in those aged 30 to 39, with a weekly rate of 1,122.1 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The lowest case rates remain in those aged 0 to 4, with a weekly rate of 332.8 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Weekly case rates per 100,000 population remain highest in the South West, at 1,269.1.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 remain lowest in the North East, with a weekly rate of 647.9.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) in England was 1,173 in week 11, compared to 842 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for week 11 was 17.89 per 100,000 population, in the previous week it was 14.07 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 were highest in the South West, with a rate of 28.71 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and over.</p>

<p>Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor at the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rate at which we’re currently seeing cases increasing is a reminder to us all that the pandemic is not over. Hospital admissions and cases of COVID-19 have continued to rise and we can expect to see further increases before we start to see a decline.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Vaccination is the key to staying safe from serious illness and it’s vital that everyone gets all of their recommended doses. Wearing a face covering in crowded or enclosed spaces, socialising outside where possible, and always observing good hand hygiene will also help to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Anyone with symptoms or a positive tests should limit their contact with others as much as possible.</p>

<p>Dr Mike Gent, COVID-19 Public Health Incident Director at the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>COVID-19 is circulating at increasing levels and while rates of severe disease and death remain low, hospital admissions have risen. As we learn to live with COVID-19, it’s vital that everyone keeps taking the necessary steps to limit the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor at the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>COVID-19 is still circulating at high levels due to the high transmissibility of circulating variants and expected increases in social mixing.</p>

  <p>While rates of severe disease and death due to COVID-19 remain low, hospital admissions have risen and we will therefore continue to monitor this data closely.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This week we have incorporated data on reinfections to improve our understanding of how the virus and its impact has changed. Whilst the pandemic is not over, it is promising that we are no longer seeing rapid rises in incidents of infection and hospitalisation.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We urge everyone to get their vaccine and booster jab as soon as they are eligible, to test regularly with <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFDs</abbr> before meeting anyone who is vulnerable and to take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test if they have symptoms. &nbsp;Please keep playing your part to reduce the spread of COVID-19.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The recent decline in community case rates and individuals requiring hospitalisation is encouraging and it’s thanks to the public, who have taken up vaccination and followed the Plan B measures closely, that we’ve got to this point. However, we should not be complacent. The pandemic is not over yet and we will need to remain cautious to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. I encourage everyone to get the vaccine as soon as they can, to continue testing regularly with <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFDs</abbr> – particularly before periods of high risk and before seeing anyone who is vulnerable – and to take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test if they have symptoms.</p>

So as the holiday season approaches and average levels of social mixing go up, please do come forward if you are eligible for a vaccine or a booster, and take up the jab as soon as you are offered.</p>

  <p>Older people and those with weaker immune systems&nbsp;are more vulnerable to infection. Always take a rapid lateral flow test before visiting anyone at higher risk of getting seriously ill from the virus.</p>

<p>Case rates were highest in those aged 10 to 19, with a weekly rate of 1120.8 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The lowest case rates were in those aged 80 and above, with a weekly rate of 110.8 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Weekly case rates per 100,000 population were highest in the East Midlands at 488.7.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 were lowest in London with a weekly rate of 214.2.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) in England was 579 in week 40, compared to 543 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for week 40 was 6.03 per 100,000 population, in the previous week it was 5.74 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Hospital admission rates for COVID-19 were highest in the North East, with a rate of 9.98 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and above.</p>

<p>Dr William Welfare, Incident Director at the UK Health Security Agency, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Case rates of COVID-19 remain high across the country and have been slowly rising.</p>

  <p>As winter approaches, help protect yourself against COVID-19 and flu by washing your hands regularly and wearing a mask in crowded places. When meeting people inside, open windows and doors to ventilate the room.</p>

  <p class="last-child">If you are offered a vaccine for either COVID-19 or flu, please take it. If you have any COVID-19 symptoms, get a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test.</p>

<p>The main points from this week’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2021-to-2022-season">national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report</a> are:</p>

<p>Surveillance indicators suggest that at a national level COVID-19 activity remained stable in most indicators in week 39 of 2021.</p>

<p>Case rates were highest in those aged 10 to 19, with a weekly rate of 1047.7 per 100,000 population, although cases are now falling.</p>

<p>The lowest case rates were in those aged 80 and above, with a weekly rate of 86.0 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Weekly case rates per 100,000 population were highest in the East Midlands at 442.4.</p>

<p>Case rates per 100,000 were lowest in London with a weekly rate of 197.3.</p>

<p>The number of acute respiratory infection incidents (suspected outbreaks) in England was 543 in week 39, compared to 622 in the previous week.</p>

<p>The hospital admission rate for week 39 was 5.60 per 100,000 population, in the previous week it was 5.44 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and above.</p>

<p>Dr Mike Gent, Incident Director at UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cases of COVID-19 remain high across the country, especially among 10 to 19 year olds.</p>

  <p>The best way to protect yourself and others is to get a vaccine. While vaccination offers excellent protection against COVID-19, there are things you can do to prevent the spread of the virus.</p>

  <p>When meeting people inside, ventilate the room by opening windows and doors. Wear a face covering in crowded places and wash your hands regularly throughout the day.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Avoid mixing with others if you feel unwell for any reason and if you have any symptoms of COVID-19, get a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test as soon as possible.</p>
