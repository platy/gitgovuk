<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Two new programmes to boost women’s climate leadership and support those most vulnerable to climate change.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ministers and representatives from private sector and civil society from across the world will meet at Gender Day at COP26 to announce new commitments which address the links between climate action and gender equality.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>At its COP26 Gender Day on Tuesday 9 November, the UK will announce £165 million to tackle climate change while addressing the inequalities that make women and girls more vulnerable to climate change and empowering them to take climate action.</p>

<p>Around the world, the UN has found that women are more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than men, in part because they constitute a large majority of the world’s poor and often depend on small-scale farming for a livelihood, which is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Women and children can comprise 80% of those displaced by climate-related disaster. But addressing gender inequality has also been proven to advance efforts to tackle climate change.</p>

<p>£165 million in UK funding will drive forward these aims:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>up to £45 million to help empower local communities and grassroots women’s groups in Asia and the Pacific to challenge gender inequalities and adapt to the impacts of climate change.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>£120 million to build resilience, prevent pollution, protect biodiversity, strengthen renewable energy and better manage waste, while also supporting women’s leadership, access to finance, education and skills in Bangladesh.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The chair of the flagship Gender Day event, UK International Champion on Adaptation and Resilience for the COP26 Presidency, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is women, girls and those who are already most marginalised, that will be most severely impacted by climate change. But they also have a critical role to play to address the climate crisis.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The UK is committed to addressing this dual challenge head on, committing new funding to empower communities and women’s groups to take locally-led adaptation action, to build local, national and global resilience. I urge more countries to make commitments to implement the UNFCCC Gender Action Plan and deliver the goals of the Feminist Action for Climate Justice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Through its COP26 Presidency, the UK has been urging countries around the world to put gender equality at the heart of climate action, and will today convene ministers and other actors to discuss new action to tackle gender and climate change. A number of countries and stakeholders will also announce bold new gender and climate commitments today.</p>

<p>The UK will jointly launch a toolkit on gender-smart climate finance. Co-led by CDC, the UK’s Development Finance Institution, the toolkit will improve understanding on the opportunities of gender-sensitive climate investment by providing guidance to the finance community on how to deliver climate outcomes while promoting gender equality and women’s economic opportunities.</p>

<p>Fatou Jeng, Founder, Clean Earth Gambia and Co-Lead YOUNGO Women and Gender working group, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gender inequality creates additional burdens and barriers for women and girls during times of conflict and climate-related crisis which increases their risks of hunger, food insecurity and violence. But women play fundamental roles in local food systems and are carers and activists, which make them uniquely placed to drive longer term climate resilience.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Women should be involved in the policy making, project planning and implementation of climate adaptation projects, and gender equality should be a key portion in climate financing. If gender equality is not taken as a serious issue in our climate decision-making, climate financing and climate adaptation processes, it will undermine opportunities for women in vulnerable communities to drive effective climate change adaptation and mitigation approaches that meet their needs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>COP26 President Alok Sharma and Anne-Marie Trevelyan will host the UK’s Presidency Gender Day event accompanied by Little Amal, the 3.5 metre puppet travelling 8,000km in support of refugees, and Brianna Fruean, a Samoan Climate Change activist.</p>

<p>The First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, will speak along with youth advocate Fatou Jeng, UN Women Deputy Executive Director Asa Regner and Indigenous activist Tarcila Rivera Zea, for a discussion on how to enable gender equality through climate actions. The Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, will also address the event.</p>

<p>Minister for Europe and the Americas, Wendy Morton, will also announce the UK’s new commitment to develop a FCDO girls’ education and climate policy to help secure concerted global action on climate change in the education sector, to prevent climate change disrupting girls’ education and empowering girls to take climate action.</p>

<p>This follows COP26 Youth and Public Empowerment Day last week, where the Prime Minister’s Special Envoy for Girls’ Education Helen Grant announced support for girls’ education in the face of climate change. This includes an £85,000 research grant to support the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre. The Centre will produce better information on the education needs of refugee children to enable a more effective international response.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>New UK funding will address the dual challenge of gender inequality and climate change, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>up to £45 million funding for the Community Resilience Partnership Programme (CRPP) to help empower local communities and grassroots women’s groups in Asia and the Pacific to challenge gender inequalities, and adapt to the impacts of climate change. This funding is part of the UK’s Climate Action for a Resilient Asia (CARA) programme (up to £274 million), <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-announces-274m-boost-to-climate-resilience-across-indo-pacific" class="govuk-link">announced at yesterday’s (Monday 8 November) Adaptation, Loss and Damage Day</a>. The UK is the largest donor to <a href="https://www.adb.org/news/videos/community-resilience-partnership-program" class="govuk-link" rel="external">CRPP, which is managed by the Asian Development Bank.</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>£120million funding for the Bangladesh Climate and Environment Programme to build resilience, prevent pollution, protect biodiversity, strengthen renewable energy and better manage waste, while also supporting women’s access to finance, education and skills in Bangladesh.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The UK has been urging countries around the world to put gender equality at the heart of climate action in line with the Gender Action Plan COP25 agreed in 2019, with a focus on new commitments made under the priority actions of the Generation Equality Forum action coalition on Feminist Action for Climate Justice (FACJ) which the UK joined in June.</p>

<p>Under the 2X Collaborative the 2X Climate Finance Taskforce is launching a toolkit and guidance notes on gender-smart climate finance. The taskforce is led by CDC, the UK’s Development Finance Institution, together with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and will support the finance community to make climate finance investments which close gender gaps across different sectors. These tools will improve understanding on the opportunities of applying a gender-lens to climate investments and so mobilise additional capital that delivers both climate outcomes and promotes gender equality and women’s economic opportunities.</p>

<p>The climate crisis is a major threat to girls’ education, as climate-related disasters disrupt nearly 40 million children’s education every year. But ensuring that girls can access 12 years of quality education supports them to be more resilient to climate shocks and empowers them to lead change, including to help address the climate crisis. Driving progress against the G7-endorsed global targets to get 40 million more girls into school and 20 million more girls reading by 2026 is crucial to the global climate response.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.walkwithamal.org/about-us/little-amal" class="govuk-link">Little Amal</a> is a giant 3.5 metre-tall puppet created by a young Syrian refugee child. In 2021 she will walk 8,000 km across Turkey, Greece, Italy, France, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and the UK to focus attention on the urgent needs of young refugees. Little Amal will be joining this event to shed light not only on the ways in which young women and girls are disproportionately impacted by climate change, but also the important role they have to play as agents of change in climate action.</p>
