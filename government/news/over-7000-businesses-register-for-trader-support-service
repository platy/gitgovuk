<p>More than 7,000 traders have registered for Trader Support Service, with hundreds of new sign-ups every day.</p>

<p>Contact centre support is now live, creating 150 jobs in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Businesses are being urged to <a rel="external" href="https://www.tradersupportservice.co.uk/tss" class="govuk-link">sign up to the Trader Support Service</a> as Brexit transition period ends next month.</p>
</div>

<p>More than 7,000 businesses have now signed up to the new Trader Support Service (<abbr title="Trader Support Service">TSS</abbr>), which will support traders moving goods under the Northern Ireland Protocol from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>In the past 10 days alone, registrations to the <abbr title="Trader Support Service">TSS</abbr> have increased by around 50%, but with fewer than 50 days to go until the end of the Brexit transition period, more traders are being urged to register now and take advantage of the scheme’s wide-ranging package of customs support and guidance.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Trader Support Service">TSS</abbr> launched on 28 September, providing a free-to-use digital platform to help businesses and traders of all sizes navigate the upcoming changes to the way goods move.</p>

<p>The comprehensive service will complete digital processes on behalf of all businesses moving goods into Northern Ireland under the Northern Ireland Protocol and is backed by up to £200 million in funding.</p>

<p>As part of the government’s investment in the <abbr title="Trader Support Service">TSS</abbr>, a new contact centre went live on 2 November, creating 150 jobs in Northern Ireland. The contact centre is now available to support traders over the phone with the registration process.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Trader Support Service">TSS</abbr>, which is already providing guidance and training to help businesses prepare for 1 January, will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enable traders to complete declarations without needing to purchase specialist software</li>
  <li>save traders significant time in completing declarations</li>
  <li>reduce traders’ declaration costs as the service is free-to-use</li>
</ul>

<p>Traders who sign up before 23 November will also be automatically issued a unique identifying number that will be required from January to move goods to or from Northern Ireland. Those who register later may need to apply separately to be issued with this number.</p>

<p>Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove MP, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s very encouraging that over 7,000 businesses have signed up to the new free-to-use Trader Support Service, which will provide crucial support and guidance to firms moving goods under the Protocol.</p>

  <p>Backed by up to £200 million of UK government funding, the <abbr title="Trader Support Service">TSS</abbr> reflects our deep commitment to support the Northern Ireland economy and protect the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement.</p>

  <p class="last-child">With fewer than 50 days to go until the end of the Brexit transition period, it is vital that traders sign up and take advantage of the scheme, so that they can continue to trade seamlessly and seize new opportunities on 1 January 2021.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis MP, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While it is good news to see more than 7,000 businesses signing up to the Trader Support Service, I really would encourage more traders to act now and take advantage of this free-to-use service.</p>

  <p>Creating 150 jobs in Northern Ireland, the Trader Support Service contact centre will directly assist businesses with queries on the movement of goods and provide guidance on what steps they need to take to prepare for the end of the Brexit transition period.</p>

  <p class="last-child">There will be changes to the way goods move between Great Britain and Northern Ireland in fewer than 50 days - that’s why I urge more traders to sign up to this service and get ready.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since the <abbr title="Trader Support Service">TSS</abbr> website launched at the end of September:</p>

<ul>
  <li>7,267 companies have registered (4,052 Great Britain, 3,079 Northern Ireland, 136 other)</li>
  <li>10,336 training guides have been downloaded</li>
  <li>2,506 individuals have received training, with 1,013 signed up for future training sessions</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="further-information">Further information</h2>

<p>As of 16 November 2020, 7,267 business had registered for the Trader Support Service.</p>

<p>Traders can <a rel="external" href="https://www.tradersupportservice.co.uk/tss" class="govuk-link">sign up for the Trader Support Service</a>. They will receive full guidance and support on the next steps to take ahead of 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>Under the Northern Ireland Protocol, all Northern Ireland businesses will continue to have unfettered access to the whole UK market.</p>

<p>Led by Fujitsu, the consortium delivering the <abbr title="Trader Support Service">TSS</abbr> has expertise across the range of services needed to make the Trader Support Service effective and successful. This includes the Institute of Export & International Trade, an existing provider of customs education, and the Customs Clearance Consortium, an established customs intermediary.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021 traders will need an Economic Operators Registration and Identification (<abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>) number number that starts with XI to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>move goods between Northern Ireland and non-EU countries</li>
  <li>move goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain</li>
  <li>make a customs declaration or get a customs decision in Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>this new XI <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> will be issued to all traders who sign up to <abbr title="Trader Support Service">TSS</abbr> before 23 November using their existing GB <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
