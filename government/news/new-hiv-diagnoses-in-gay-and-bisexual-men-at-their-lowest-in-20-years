        <p>The number of gay and bisexual men (<abbr title="gay and bisexual men">GBM</abbr>) with newly diagnosed <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> fell to the lowest point in 20 years, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hiv-annual-data-tables">according to a new report</a> from Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) published today.</p>

<p>The report shows there were 1,700 new <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> diagnoses in <abbr title="gay and bisexual men">GBM</abbr> in 2019 compared to 1,500 in 2000.</p>

<p>Overall, the number of people with a new <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> diagnoses fell by 10% (from 4,580 in 2018 to 4,139 in 2019). There was also a 34% decline from a peak of 6,312 new diagnoses in 2014.</p>

<p>There were 1,700 new <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> diagnoses in gay and bisexual men (<abbr title="gay and bisexual men">GBM</abbr>) in 2019 compared to around 1,600 cases in heterosexual adults. This is the lowest number of new <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> diagnoses in <abbr title="gay and bisexual men">GBM</abbr> since the year 2000 (1,500) and since 1998 in heterosexual adults (1,600).</p>

<p><abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> transmission in <abbr title="gay and bisexual men">GBM</abbr> has fallen by 80%; newly acquired <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> infections fell from an estimated peak of 2,700 cases in 2011 to an estimated 540 in 2019 (see background information).</p>

<p>While the proportion of people diagnosed late remained high at 42%, the overall number decreased from around 1,900 in 2015 to 1,300 in 2019. People diagnosed late in 2019 had an eight-fold risk of death compared to those diagnosed promptly.</p>

<p>The decline in <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> transmission in <abbr title="gay and bisexual men">GBM</abbr> can be directly linked to the increase in combination prevention, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the use of condoms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pre-exposure prophylaxis (<abbr title="pre-exposure prophylaxis">PrEP</abbr>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>frequent <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> testing in a wide range of settings</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>starting antiretroviral therapy (<abbr title="antiretroviral therapy">ART</abbr>) as soon as possible after diagnosis</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Treatment is now so effective that 97% of people receiving <abbr title="antiretroviral therapy">ART</abbr> have undetectable levels of virus, which means it is impossible to pass the virus on, even if having sex without condoms. Undetectable = untransmittable (U=U).</p>

<p><abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> testing is vital for preventing <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>-related illness and death and to achieve the goal of ending <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> transmission in the UK by 2030. The UK continues to meet the United Nations Programme on <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> and AIDS (UNAIDS) <a rel="external" href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/909090">90-90-90 targets</a> for the third consecutive year – however, there are opportunities to improve uptake of testing and support those testing positive to continue their treatment.</p>

<p>Almost 300,000 people declined to have an <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> test when they attended a specialist sexual health service. Black African heterosexual women attendees were more likely to decline a test than Black African heterosexual men (20% versus 9% declined testing) but less likely than heterosexual women and men overall (25% versus 13%). More focused conversations on <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>, testing, prevention and treatment in schools and clinical settings can help to combat high rates of declined tests.</p>

<p>By comparison, only 4% of <abbr title="gay and bisexual men">GBM</abbr> attending specialist sexual health services declined an <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> test – this is the group in which greatest declines in <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> transmission have been achieved.</p>

<p>Dr Valerie Delpech, Head of <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> Surveillance at <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the UK, we have made great progress towards eliminating <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> transmission by 2030. Frequent <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> testing, the offer of <abbr title="pre-exposure prophylaxis">PrEP</abbr> among those most at risk of <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>, together with prompt treatment among those diagnosed, remain key to ending <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> transmission by 2030.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Further progress can only be achieved if we also address the inequalities in reducing <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> transmission that exist around sexuality, ethnicity and geography.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most common way of getting <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> in the UK is through sex with a person who is unaware of their <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> infection.</p>

<p>You can protect yourself from <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> by consistent and correct condom use with new and casual partners, by using <abbr title="pre-exposure prophylaxis">PrEP</abbr>, or if your partner is on treatment and is undetectable if they are living with <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>. Correct and consistent condom use will also stop you getting or transmitting other sexually transmitted diseases (<abbr title="sexually-transmitted infections">STIs</abbr>).</p>

<p>People can get tested through free tests available from sexual health clinics, <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> surgeries, as well as through a self-sampling service or by using a self-testing kit.</p>

<h3 id="background-information">Background information</h3>

<p>Those at risk of <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> and <abbr title="sexually-transmitted infections">STIs</abbr> can still access services through sexual health clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many clinics offer online testing, which means people can order tests using clinic websites, take them in the privacy of their own home, return by post and receive results via text, phone call or post.</p>

<p>New <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> diagnoses reflect diagnoses that occurred within a year. Since people can live with <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> for many years without being aware of their <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> infection, trends in diagnoses do not necessarily reflect trends in newly acquired infections. We use models to estimate newly acquired infections (infections acquired recently) for gay and bisexual men only.</p>
