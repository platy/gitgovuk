  <li>Government funds new independent body to set standards and define career and learning paths for the cyber security sector</li>
  <li>UK Cyber Security Council to be a simple one-stop shop for information for people looking to enter or further their career</li>
  <li>The Council will actively pursue opportunities to attract more talent and increase diversity in the cyber security workforce</li>
</ul>

<p>The new DCMS-funded UK Cyber Security Council will provide a single governing voice for the industry to establish the knowledge, skills and experience required for a range of cyber security jobs, bringing it in line with other professions such as law, medicine and engineering.</p>

<p>The Council will boost skilled job prospects around the country by giving budding and existing workers a clear roadmap for building a career in cyber security and focus on increasing the number and diversity of people entering the profession.</p>

<p>The body will work with training providers to accredit courses and qualifications, and give employers the information and confidence they need to recruit effectively to ensure their cyber capability.</p>

<p>Digital Infrastructure Minister Matt Warman makes the announcement on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.saferinternetday.org/" rel="external">Safer Internet Day</a> which promotes more responsible use of online technology around the world and comes as the £8.3 billion cyber security sector <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uks-booming-cyber-security-sector-worth-83-billion">continues to grow</a> despite the pandemic and with it the demand for more talent, particularly from underrepresented groups.</p>

<p>Digital Infrastructure Minister Matt Warman said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fact we are launching an independent professional body for cyber security shows just how vital this area has become – it makes a huge contribution to our thriving digital economy by safeguarding our critical national infrastructure, commerce and other online spaces.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The UK Cyber Security Council will ensure anyone interested in an exciting career tackling online threats has access to world-class training and guidance. It will also champion diversity and inclusion, driving up standards while helping the nation to build back better and safer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This latest move comes after a feedback from a 2018 DCMS public consultation looking at the issues facing the profession, which showed overwhelming support for a new body.</p>

<p>Working closely with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the Council will strongly support the Government’s £1.9 billion National Cyber Security Strategy to make the UK the safest place to live and work online.</p>

<p>Chris Ensor, the NCSC’s Deputy Director for Cyber Growth, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cyber security is a growing industry in the UK and it’s vital for high standards of practice and technical expertise to be at the heart of the profession as it develops.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We look forward to working with the Council to help ensure that future generations of cyber security professionals have the skills and support they need to thrive and make the UK the safest place to live and work online.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The council has appointed its inaugural Board of Trustees to guide the organisation as it establishes itself over the coming years. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chair: Dr. Claudia Natanson - a Global Cyber Security expert who was previously CSO at DWP, MD at BT Secure Business Service and CISO at Diageo Plc</li>
  <li>Vice-Chair: Jessica Figueras - Tech market strategist, Chair of NCT, previously Chief Analyst at GlobalData</li>
  <li>Trustee: Carla Baker - Senior Director, Policy &amp; Government Affairs UK &amp; Ireland, Palo Alto Networks</li>
  <li>Treasurer: Mike Watson - Chief Financial Officer, Marston Holdings, previously with Dell, HP and BAE Systems cyber security division</li>
</ul>

<p>UK Cyber Security Council Chair Dr. Claudia Natanson said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Having spent many years in cyber security, I’m very aware of the excellent work done by many varied organisations – but I’m also conscious that the time for an umbrella organisation has come in order to drive the profession forward in a unified way.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It’s a privilege and a challenge to be part of the leadership of the Council, knowing that the future security and prosperity of the UK depends in part on the Council succeeding in its mission to develop the profession.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Council will be formally launched on March 31.</p>

<p>Notes to editors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The council was developed following a 2018 consultation on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/developing-the-uk-cyber-security-profession">Developing the UK cyber security profession</a> which showed strong support for the government’s proposals to define objectives for the profession to achieve and to create a new, independent UK Cyber Security Council to coordinate delivery.</li>
  <li>In September 2019, DCMS commissioned a consortium of cyber security professional bodies known as the Cyber Security Alliance to work on establishing the council. The Institution of Engineering and Technology led the consortium that created this new organisation over an approximately 18 month period.</li>
  <li>The work is part of the government’s five year £1.9 billion <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-cyber-security-strategy-2016-to-2021">National Cyber Security Strategy</a> to make the UK the safest place to live and work online.</li>
