<p>The Ministry of Defence’s (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>) Chief Scientific Advisor (<abbr title="Chief Scientific Advisor">CSA</abbr>) Professor Dame Angela McLean has awarded the latest <abbr title="Chief Scientific Advisor">CSA</abbr> Commendations at a special ceremony which took place at the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s headquarters, in London.</p>

<p>The awards recognise exceptional contributions made by individuals and teams working in science and engineering across defence.</p>

<p>While there were numerous awards across the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>, the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (<abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>) was presented a significant number of awards for 2020 and 2021, with a special Organisational Award recognising hundreds of individuals across <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> who had been involved in supporting the COVID-19 pandemic effort.</p>

<p>Colleagues provided support to defence, the health services, and partners across government who sought out <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>’s scientific expertise and advice to lead and help combat coronavirus and protect the health of <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> citizens.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>’s Chief Executive Paul Hollinshead said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I’m delighted <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>’s support has been recognised in this way. <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>’s scientific excellence helped to maintain defence outputs, support the nation’s health response and the government’s decision-making, as well as increase the fundamental scientific understanding of the virus itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More than 350 scientists worked specifically on a wide variety of projects to support the fight against COVID-19, from home, on-site, or deployed into partner organisations across the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s <abbr title="Chief Scientific Advisor">CSA</abbr> Professor Dame Angela McLean said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I’m delighted to see <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> so well represented at the <abbr title="Chief Scientific Advisor">CSA</abbr> awards both this year and last year. I was particularly pleased that <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>’s many important contributions to the COVID response were recognised. It was my own personal experience that their work was essential.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were a number of individual presentations including to <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>’s Sally Davies who received an award for her work in diversity and inclusion, and <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>’s Jim Maltby for his work in communicating science and engineering.</p>

<p>Sally’s citation highlighted how she worked tirelessly with others to create a diverse and inclusive environment and remains determined to make change happen, remaining professional and committed to the cause of acceptance for all.</p>

<p>Jim initiated and led the delivery of the Virtual Reality <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.forces.net/news/mod-time-machine-preparing-military-leaders-future" rel="external">Museum of the Future</a> and other tools, from having the bright idea in the first place, to working closely with industrial partners and games designers to make it a reality.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> represents one of the most significant sources of science and engineering expertise in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. Our science and engineering community is a significant asset to <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> and provides vital contributions to <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> defence and security in supporting operations, <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> prosperity and developing affordable, winning-edge capability.</p>
