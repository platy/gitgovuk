<p>It is with the greatest of regret that we inform you of the death of the Chairman of the Civil Nuclear Police Authority (CNPA) Vic Emery OBE on Saturday afternoon (18/12/21).</p>

<p>Mr Emery died following a collision on the A74(M) southbound at Ecclefechan.</p>

<p>Vic’s family have released the following tribute:</p>

<p>“It is with great sadness that the family announce that Vic Emery, a cherished husband, devoted father and grandfather and respected businessman passed away Saturday, 18th December 2021.</p>

<p>His wife, Dianne, and daughters, Lucy, Juliet and Victoria and three beloved grandchildren are utterly devastated, their hearts shattered, and request privacy at this time.</p>

<p>Given the unexpectedness of the event, no further details have been determined but will be advised at the appropriate time.”</p>

<p>CNC Chief Constable Simon Chesterman said:</p>

<p>“I was deeply shocked and saddened to hear of the sudden and unexpected death of Vic on Saturday. Vic was passionate about the CNC and our officers and staff; he has been an extremely supportive and knowledgeable Chairman who has made a real difference to the CNC and the authority. He bought a wealth of experience and energy to the role and will be much missed not just by the CNC and CNPA but by me personally.</p>

<p>I will be speaking to Vic’s family and will pass on my condolences on behalf of the Constabulary and will stay in close contact with them during this extremely difficult time.”</p>

<p>Prior to joining the CNPA Board in September 2016, Vic served three terms of public service to policing in Scotland - as Chair of the Scottish Police Services Authority (SPSA) and of the Scottish Police Authority (SPA).</p>

<p>In the private sector, Vic was formally Group Managing Director of BAE Systems warship building and sustainment business for over 10 years, across five operational facilities in the UK with a turnover of £800 million and a workforce of 7,500. Vic sat on the Operational Board of BAE Systems Plc from 2003 until 2008 and was awarded an OBE in May 2008 for services to warship building.</p>
