<p>UKAEA is pleased to welcome two new Non-Executive Directors to the UKAEA Board.</p>

<p>Sir Stephen Hillier and Richard Hookway will both join the Board for three years after being appointed by Kwasi Kwarteng, Secretary of State at the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).</p>

<p>UKAEA Chair, Professor David Gann, said: “I am delighted to welcome Richard and Sir Stephen to the UKAEA Board. They bring a wide range of capability and knowledge that complements and strengthens the existing team. I know they will have a lot to offer the organisation now and in the coming years as we continue on our exciting journey to realise sustainable fusion energy.”</p>

<h3>Richard Hookway</h3>

<p>Mr Hookway joins UKAEA with an extensive background in the energy industry, centred on business, strategy, finance, and technology.</p>

<p>He held a range of senior leadership positions during a 35-year career at BP, including CFO of BP Downstream and COO of BP Global Business Services and Procurement. From 2018 to 2021, Mr Hookway was CEO of Centrica Business and a member of the main Board, which included Board representation at the EDF Energy Nuclear Generation Group – responsible for all current nuclear power generation in the UK.</p>

<p>Mr Hookway now holds a range of non-executive and advisory roles, including Board positions at Royal Vopak and Parkland Corp. He also serves as Chair of Swim England and as a member of the Board of Trustees of the British Council in the not-for-profit sector.</p>

<p>Mr Hookway said: “It is an honour to join the board of UKAEA. I have always been fascinated with cutting edge science, especially how its application can help solve climate change, the world’s most pressing existential challenge. The UKAEA is an exemplar of what can be achieved, and I look forward to rising to this challenge to help the organisation deliver its strategy.”</p>

<h3>Sir Stephen Hillier</h3>

<p>Sir Stephen Hillier is currently Chair of the Civil Aviation Authority and a property development company. He also holds roles in several charities, supporting service veterans, inspiring young people and encouraging social mobility.</p>

<p>He previously had a long career in the RAF, rising to Chief of the Air Staff, the head of the service, from 2016 to 2019. In these and other roles, Sir Stephen has successfully delivered many large, complex, and high-profiles programmes within tightly-regulated sectors.</p>

<p>Sir Stephen said: I’m delighted to have been appointed to the Board of UKAEA. I’m excited by this opportunity to support the UKAEA strategy and to use my experience to benefit the development and delivery of game-changing fusion power.”</p>
