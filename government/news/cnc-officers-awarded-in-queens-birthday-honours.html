<p>The HM Queen’s Birthday honours list for 2022 recognises the achievements of a wide range of extraordinary people and is extra pertinent this year coming just prior to the Platinum Jubilee celebrations this weekend, recognising an extraordinary 70 years’ service to her subjects.</p>

<p>Chief Constable Simon Chesterman (pictured left) has worked in policing for nearly 40 years, serving 23 of those at Thames Valley Police before moving to West Mercia as deputy chief constable. He joined the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (<abbr title="Civil Nuclear Constabulary">CNC</abbr>) in January 2014 as deputy chief constable and was promoted to chief constable on 1 April 2019. As chief constable he is responsible for overseeing the 1,600 strong constabulary, responsible for operational performance of the <abbr title="Civil Nuclear Constabulary">CNC</abbr>, the Accounting Officer for the Civil Nuclear Police Authority and the <abbr title="Civil Nuclear Constabulary">CNC</abbr>, and improves, develops and maintains effective strategic partnerships with the&nbsp;Civil Nuclear Police Authority (<abbr title="Civil Nuclear Police Authority">CNPA</abbr>), site license companies, the Office for Nuclear Regulation (Civil Nuclear Security), Home Office and Police Scotland forces and the Ministry of Defence Police. In 2012 he was awarded the Queen’s Police Medal.</p>

<p>Simon has been the National Police Chief’s Council lead for armed policing for nearly 15 years, responsible for national policy and practice.</p>

<p>Supt Tim Needham (pictured right) has over 26 years’ service with the Civil Nuclear Constabulary and has previous service in the UK military. He has been an operational firearms officer and is a qualified Tactical Firearms Commander specialising in the command of nuclear material transport escort operations. During Tim’s service he has undertaken operational, intelligence and corporate headquarters roles and was the head of the UK’s Strategic Escort Group where he managed escort operations including the largest ever international shipment. His current role is Divisional Commander for N Division.</p>

<p>Speaking after the announcement Chief Constable Simon Chesterman said: “I am humbled and feel very privileged to have been recognised in Her Majesty’s birthday honours. I would also like to congratulate Tim on his richly deserved <abbr title="Queens Police Medal">QPM</abbr>.</p>

<p>“I am fortunate to have spent nearly four decades working with so many incredible people across the police service. I have a particular affinity with armed police officers and those that support, train and command them operationally. I am immensely proud of UK armed policing and of the men and women of the Civil Nuclear Constabulary and the vital work we do in keeping critical national infrastructure and the general public safe.”</p>

<p>Supt Tim Needham said: “I was completely shocked and speechless to discover I’d been nominated for a Queens Police Medal - in fact, when I received the initial call from the Home Office informing me of the nomination, I was convinced it was an elaborate prank! Once I discovered It wasn’t a prank it took a long time for the news to sink in and for a few days I was walking around in a bit of a daze.</p>

<p>“This is a fantastic honour for the whole of the <abbr title="Civil Nuclear Constabulary">CNC</abbr> and gives recognition at the highest level to the specialist work all our officers and staff do, often quietly and without fanfare, protecting the public by safeguarding nuclear material both within the UK and in transit internationally.</p>

<p>“In my time with the <abbr title="Civil Nuclear Constabulary">CNC</abbr> I’ve been fortunate to work with, and learn from, some brilliant and dedicated people, many of whom have become good friends. I’ve had the privilege of working closely with many colleagues from within the <abbr title="Civil Nuclear Constabulary">CNC</abbr> as well as colleagues from wider policing, the military, other government agencies and from within the nuclear industry across the UK and overseas in a very interesting and varied career.&nbsp;Receiving this award is a reflection on the hard work of all our officers and staff and also on my family who have supported me while I’ve spent lots of time ‘away with work’.</p>

<p>“I’m truly honoured, humbled, and delighted to receive the <abbr title="Queens Police Medal">QPM</abbr>. It’s been really difficult keeping the award secret for the last few months and I’m now looking forward to celebrating this great news with family and friends.”</p>

<p>Sir Craig Mackay, interim Chair of the <abbr title="Civil Nuclear Police Authority">CNPA</abbr>, said: “I am immensely proud of Simon and Tim, who both thoroughly deserve these prodigious awards. Both have dedicated years of service to keeping us safe and they have both made a real and significant contribution to public protection and the safety and security of the UK. Congratulations to them both.”</p>
