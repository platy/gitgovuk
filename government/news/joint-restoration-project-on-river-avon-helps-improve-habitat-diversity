<p>The project, which was partly funded by the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> and designed by <abbr title="Wiltshire Wildlife Trust">WWT</abbr>’s Water Team in consultation with the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> and <abbr title="Services Dry Fly Fishing Association">SDFFA</abbr>, continues work undertaken by <abbr title="Wiltshire Wildlife Trust">WWT</abbr> in the area in 2016 to improve the condition of the River Avon Site of Special Scientific Interest (<abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>).</p>

<p>The restoration work, which was completed last month by a team of Defence Infrastructure Organisation (<abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr>) environmental specialists and <abbr title="Wiltshire Wildlife Trust">WWT</abbr> staff, took place at tank crossing Charlie which is located on the River Avon just north of Durrington near the village of Milston. The work involved installing permeable wooden structures within the river at several points to narrow the channel and speed up the flow of the river. This will reduce silt deposition and create areas of exposed gravel for fish to spawn.</p>

<p>Oliver Howells, <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr>’s Senior Ecologist, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> has over 80,000 <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> and it has a responsibility to manage these sites to maintain them in what is called Favourable condition. This project is a great example of how we have worked with one of our key partners to achieve that.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The <abbr title="Wiltshire Wildlife Trust">WWT</abbr> Water Team are highly skilled and well equipped to carry out this work. Thanks to their ongoing hard work, and the contribution from a team of <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> volunteers, we have been able to improve this stretch of the river, which is widely known as one of the best chalk streams in the UK. It was also a fantastic opportunity for some of <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr>’s environmental specialists to get their hands dirty and better understand the ecology of the river and the pressures affecting it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In total 6 large wooden structures were installed into the channel. The wood was sourced on site by coppicing and pollarding trees along the bank and cutting back overhanging vegetation. This has the additional benefit of allowing more light to get down to the river and improving access for anglers.</p>

<p>Alice Baker, <abbr title="Wiltshire Wildlife Trust">WWT</abbr>’s Water Team Manager said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This project contributes to over 20 years of ongoing work by <abbr title="Wiltshire Wildlife Trust">WWT</abbr> to restore and protect the River Avon. Thanks to the support of the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> we were able to enhance this 400m stretch of river, connecting previously restored reaches upstream and downstream of the crossing.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">A huge thank you to the <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> volunteers for their hard work; the woody structures we built will add to the flow and habitat diversity of the river, providing marginal habitat for species such as water vole and kingfisher and cover for small and juvenile fish.</p>
