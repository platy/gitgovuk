<p>The <abbr title="submarine escape, rescue, abandonment and survival">SMERAS</abbr> is a unique and modern facility which will give the Navy the capability to carry out essential on shore training for personnel in vital escape, rescue, abandonment and survival techniques using a unique, controllable training environment.</p>

<p>The Navy has funded the <abbr title="submarine escape, rescue, abandonment and survival">SMERAS</abbr> facility as a significant investment in the training of its personnel. <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> delivered the project, working with its contractor Kier Graham Defence Ltd.</p>

<p>The building will house a simulator in which trainees can experience a range of realistic weather conditions and sea states including wind, rain and storms, so that they can practise in a safe and low risk environment before they board a real submarine.</p>

<p>An internationally-renowned training resource, the simulator, will replace the Submarine Escape Training Tank at Fort Blockhouse, Gosport, and has been recognised by Navies throughout the world for its cutting-edge technology and equipment.</p>

<p>The construction work was completed pre-<abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">Covid-19</abbr>.</p>

<p>Charles Hoskins, <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Programme Director, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> is proud to have delivered this world-class facility to the Royal Navy.</p>

  <p>The <abbr title="submarine escape, rescue, abandonment and survival">SMERAS</abbr> demonstrates <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr>’s expertise in completing complex and one-of-a-kind projects to enable our Navy to access the most modern training available.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It also affirms our commitment to support <abbr>HMNB</abbr> Clyde in becoming a centre of excellence for submariners.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>John Thomson, Royal Navy Command Assistant Head of Infrastructure, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Royal Navy was proud to provide the funding for this excellent facility delivered by <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> and their contractors.</p>

  <p>The purpose-built <abbr title="submarine escape, rescue, abandonment and survival">SMERAS</abbr> training facility at <abbr>HMNB</abbr> Clyde provides a critical and world leading experiential training facility for the Royal Navy and replaces the Submarine Escape Training Tank at Fort Blockhouse, Gosport.</p>

  <p>The facility provides class specific high-fidelity escape towers and escape compartments, a training pool capable of replicating the environmental conditions that submarine escapes may need to be carried out in and supporting classrooms, offices, workshops, plant rooms and changing areas.</p>

  <p class="last-child"><abbr title="submarine escape, rescue, abandonment and survival">SMERAS</abbr> is a key element in the development of HM Naval Base Clyde as the Royal Navy Submarine Centre of Specialisation and base port for all UK submarines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cdr D McClement RN, Fleet Operational Sea Training (Submarines), <abbr>HMNB</abbr> Clyde, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <abbr title="submarine escape, rescue, abandonment and survival">SMERAS</abbr> Training Facility is a fantastic new and world-leading escape and surface abandonment capability that enhances the training benefit for Royal Navy submariners.</p>

  <p>The Royal Navy, as the customer for this new facility, is justifiably proud that we are delivering high-levels of experiential training to our submarine personnel and on track to reach Full Operating Capability in March 2021.</p>

  <p>The facility fulfils a significant gap for the Royal Navy in delivering realistic experiential training for surface abandonment in addition to submarine escape.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The Royal Navy’s reputation for submarine escape training has been significantly enhanced by this impressive capability that combines both escape and surface abandonment training.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gary Holmes, Managing Director Building North at John Graham Construction Ltd, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re proud to have delivered this critical facility for the Clyde Naval Base on behalf of the Kier Graham Defence Ltd joint venture.</p>

  <p class="last-child">After three years of design and construction, working collaboratively with the Royal Navy and <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr>, we’re proud to provide this new purpose-built environment which will play a vital role in improving the skills of submariners, ensuring their ongoing support and training can be conducted within this highly realistic, scenario-based training facility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As part of the UK, Scotland benefits from billions of pounds of <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> contracts placed directly and indirectly with hundreds of companies, which sustain thousands of jobs.</p>

<p>The UK government is firmly committed to the future of defence in Scotland and of Scotland’s continued vital role in defence.  The major investment in the future of <abbr>HMNB</abbr> Clyde is a testament to this.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> is investing £1.6-billion in total to develop infrastructure at <abbr>HMNB</abbr> Clyde to make it a centre of excellence for submariners.</p>

<p>Further information on the new submarine training building at <abbr>HMNB</abbr> Clyde can be viewed on YouTube.</p>
