<p>Former footballer and Soccer AM star Jimmy Bullard is urging the public to give fishing a try as part of the Environment Agency’s latest angling campaign.</p>

<p>With football fans eagerly awaiting this weekend’s FA Cup Final between Liverpool and Chelsea, Jimmy uses the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrGoxwh1OMI" rel="external">campaign video</a> to predict the score whilst fishing with two of his friends. The footage sees keen angler Jimmy refereeing a fishing ‘match’ between his two friends and warning that he will dish out yellow cards for anyone fishing without a licence. Jimmy predicts that Liverpool will win the Cup with the final score 2-1 to the Reds.</p>

<p>The film launches the Environment Agency’s latest campaign, which promotes the multiple benefits of fishing to encourage anglers to get back into the sport or try it for the first time. It shows the opportunities fishing offers to spend time with family and friends and relax in nature, highlighting the positive impacts it can have on mental health.</p>

<p>Jimmy Bullard joined the campaign to remind anglers of the joys of fishing. He commented:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Football and fishing are two of my all-time favourite sports so I was thrilled to take part in the video with my two pals Rob and Brian. I’ve been a keen angler since the age of seven and I get out to fish as often as I can. Not only do I love the sport, but it’s really important to get away from it all and enjoy the peace and quiet, enjoy being outdoors. And it’s great for your mental health.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Supporting the sport of fishing by renewing your licence is a must as the money goes back into the sport and helps replenish fish levels, improves the environment we fish in and of course avoids a fine! It’s so easy to do, you can renew it online, and having a digital copy on your phone means you don’t have to worry about leaving it at home. I can’t wait to watch the match this weekend to see if the score from our match guessed the FA Cup score or not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Heidi Stone, Environment Agency Fisheries Partnerships Manager, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As an accomplished and mad-keen angler with his previous career as a professional footballer, Jimmy was the perfect candidate to act as referee in this unique game of fishing and to remind people on the range of benefits the sport can offer. Fishing provides a great opportunity to get out into nature, be social and boost your mental wellbeing.</p>

  <p class="last-child">All of the money from rod licence sales is put towards work to improve our fisheries and river habitats. These efforts contribute to supporting the wider environment and maintaining the sport.</p>
