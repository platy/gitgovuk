<p>Following the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/technical-advisory-group-on-alternative-arrangements-to-the-backstop-established">launch</a> last week of an expert advisory group looking at alternative arrangements to the Northern Ireland backstop, the Government has convened a second group made up of businesses and trade unions to ensure their experience and on-the-ground knowledge informs developments.</p>

<p>The group includes cross-sector representatives from Ireland, Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, and will ensure the views of businesses and their employees are represented in this process.</p>

<p>The new Business and Trade Union Alternative Arrangements Advisory Group will complement the work of the recently-established Technical Alternative Arrangements Advisory Group, which comprises trade and customs experts tasked with considering workable solutions to the backstop.</p>

<p>They will consider processes associated with the movement of goods across borders and options for simplifying them, such as trusted trader programmes and advanced use of data and IT systems.</p>

<p>The UK and EU have a shared desire to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements to ensure there is no hard border — and both sides have committed to prioritising the development of these in the next phase of talks.</p>

<p>The business and trade union group is one of three domestic advisory groups that the Government <a rel="external" href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Lords/2019-03-07/HLWS1359/">announced earlier this year</a> to help inform its negotiations with the EU on this important issue.</p>

<p>The first meeting of the business and trade union group will take place today (Wednesday 26th June). It will be co-chaired by Brexit minister Robin Walker and BEIS minister Andrew Stephenson.</p>

<p>Robin Walker, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Exiting the European Union, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The development of alternative arrangements to replace the backstop has been recognised as a priority by both the UK Government and the EU Commission. Accordingly, we have a highly-informed group of experts in trade and customs focused on developing and testing workable solutions.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">But it is vital that any possible alternatives to the backstop are informed by the views of those on the ground, whose goods cross the border every single day. So I am delighted to chair this important group, which will ensure that the voices of business and trade union representatives are heard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Members of the business and trade union group have been chosen based on their comprehensive backgrounds in cross-border supply chains. The group includes large companies who can represent the views of themselves and their suppliers, as well as smaller companies who rely on cross-border “just in time” supply chains.</p>

<p>The Government has made available £20 million of funding to support the development, testing or piloting of any ideas that emerge from the advisory groups.</p>
