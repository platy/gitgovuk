  <li>A special one-off addition to the annual Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service created in honour of Her Majesty The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee</li>
</ul>

<p>The Government has today announced a special one-off addition to the annual Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service (QAVS), in honour of Her Majesty the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee.</p>

<p>Her Majesty has displayed a life-long commitment to public service throughout her 70-year reign, and the annual QAVS is the highest award given to small volunteer groups across the UK. Awardees cover a wide range of activities such as dementia support clubs, community theatres and therapeutic garden projects.</p>

<p>The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee Award for Volunteering will now shine a spotlight on 20 national charities working to empower young people aged 16-25. The number 20 has been chosen to reflect 20 years of QAVS.</p>

<p>A special judging panel has been convened for the award, comprising civil society sector experts and youth representatives including Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, Fionnuala Jay O’Boyle and Ndidi Okezie.</p>

<p>Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since The Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service was set up 20 years ago to commemorate the Golden Jubilee, thousands of hard working local volunteer groups across the UK have been recognised for benefiting their communities.</p>

  <p>We’re delighted to be extending our recognition this year to some outstanding national charities through this special Queen’s Platinum Jubilee Award for Volunteering.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We want to celebrate the important work done by national charities to empower young people with the skills they need to develop and grow. This is a fitting way to recognise the 70 years of selfless service Her Majesty has given to this country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sir Martyn Lewis CBE, the QAVS Chair said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Her Majesty’s faithful service to the nation over 70 years has been an inspiration to us all and is mirrored by countless acts of volunteering happening each day across the UK.</p>

  <p class="last-child">For this special Jubilee Award we are looking forward to celebrating outstanding work with young people, helping them to flourish and be the best they can be. It’s a theme that’s important to all of us and is close to Her Majesty’s heart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Platinum Jubilee Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-queens-platinum-jubilee-volunteering-award">now open for applications</a> until 17 June. Nationally registered charities helping young people (aged 16-25), who have had a national impact either on a UK-wide, or England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland basis are invited to apply.</p>

<p>A judging panel including sector experts and young people will select 20 winners to be announced in The Gazette in October. Winners will be presented with this special award at a ceremony in November.</p>
