<p>The scheme encompasses Bronze, Silver and Gold awards for employer organisations that pledge, demonstrate and advocate support to defence and the armed forces’ Community, and align their values with the Armed Forces’ Covenant.</p>

<p><abbr title="south-east Reserves Forces Cadets Association">SE RFCA</abbr> are proud to announce, 28 employers have been awarded the prestigious Silver Award. The Award Ceremony should have taken place aboard the historic ship HMS Victory Portsmouth in early September. Despite the current restrictions of COVID-19, <abbr title="south-east Reserves Forces Cadets Association">SE RFCA</abbr> will continue to host a virtual ceremony congratulating the awardees.</p>

<p>The Lord-Lieutenant of Hampshire, Nigel Atkinson Esq will virtually present 28 businesses (21 private, 3 public and 5  not for profit organisations) with their Silver Employer Recognition Award.</p>

<p>Lord-Lieutenant of Hampshire, Nigel Atkinson Esq said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I would like to congratulate each of the 2020 Silver Employer Engagement Award winners. The quality of nominations was again extremely high this year and to make the final selection is a real testament to their company’s dedication, enthusiasm and hard work to support and advocate for the Armed Forces community. As President of the south-east Reserve Forces’ & Cadets’ Association, I am sorry that I was unable to thank these individuals in person due to covid-19, however it should not steer away from the importance of the positive and tangible help these businesses give to the armed forces family and their wonderful support to defence.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I am the Managing Director of <abbr title="Mobile Broadband Network Limited">MBNL</abbr> and empathise with many of my ex-Military colleagues that the transition from being a member of the armed services into a civilian job and life can be hard for some.
