<p>The UK Prime Minister has hosted a festive food and drink market at Downing Street today (30 November) to showcase British businesses who are making the most out of our international trade policy, ahead of Small Business Saturday.</p>

<p>He was joined by Cabinet Ministers including, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, Food and Agriculture Secretary George Eustice, Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan as well as Minister for Exports Mike Freer to support businesses who are seizing opportunities for growth by exporting their goods internationally.</p>

<p>Twelve businesses held market stalls in Downing Street to showcase their finest products including Snowdonia Cheese, a Welsh cheese company; Tayto, a Northern Irish snack company; Loch Fyne Oysters, a Scottish seafood company; and Montezuma’s, an English chocolate company.</p>

<p>Those invited to the event also include the co-founder of Fever-Tree Drinks, the homegrown premium soft drinks company established in 2004, which is now the world’s leading premium mixer brand, exporting to over 80 countries worldwide and selling more than 500 million bottles in 2020.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister also spoke to the owner of Wilkins and Sons, who have been making quality preserves since 1885. Wilkins and Sons now export to over 60 countries across the world and brought in a turnover of £49 million in 2019 alone.</p>

<p>UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s great to see the best of British food and drink here in Downing Street, especially in the run up to Christmas.</p>

  <p>We currently export to 207 countries but this government is supporting British food and drink exporters to sell even more of their brilliant produce abroad.</p>

  <p class="last-child">As it’s St Andrew’s Day, I’m looking forward to sampling a Clootie McToot dumpling, some Loch Fyne Oysters and a winter warmer from the Isle of Harris Distillery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are committed to ensuring that food and drink from all four corners of the UK can be and will continue to be loved across the globe.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Today’s announcement of new agri-food and drink attachés in key markets will help to further unlock barriers to trade. They are one of the many ways we are helping to open up new exporting opportunities around the world and are part of our plans for a truly Global Britain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Environment Secretary, George Eustice, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We want people at home and abroad to be lining up to buy British.</p>

  <p class="last-child">What we have announced today will further unlock the potential of new and existing markets, enabling our farmers and food and drink producers to take advantage of new opportunities and fly the flag for UK produce around the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Businesses from all four corners of the UK are benefiting from international exports and putting their world class products on the global market. One example is Isle of Harris, an award-winning Scottish gin business who took part in the event. Isle of Harris export their products to over 20 different countries, supporting the UK as the world’s biggest exporter of gin.</p>

<p>We’ve also created new trade and investment teams in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Northeast, with dedicated teams to ensure every business, everywhere in the UK, gets our full support. Exports will support highly paid jobs and by sending our products abroad we will secure growth and jobs at home across the Union.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the government launched an Export Strategy which will help businesses across the UK double exports and sell their world-class products around the globe. The 12-point export strategy will give businesses the tools they need to become a nation of exporters and reap the benefits of our free trade deals.</p>

<p>The Government will create a network of agriculture, food and drink attachés in priority markets to further unlock barriers to trade and open up new exporting opportunities around the world. As well as posts in China, USA, India, Canada and Mexico, the attachés will be covering growth markets in the Gulf, Africa, South America and the Asia-Pacific region. There will also be additional capacity and resource in Europe.</p>

<p>Unlocking the UK’s exporting potential will help level up the country and boost the UK’s economy, with government-led research estimating that exports currently support 6.5 million jobs across the UK and showing that exporters pay higher wages and are on average 21 percent more productive.</p>
