<p>This includes one Malaysian who received a Chevening Fellowship to complete a short course at the Oxford Centre of Islamic Studies.</p>

<p>The Chevening award is the UK Government’s global scholarship programme, funded and administered by the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office. This is complemented by generous sponsorships by Malaysian corporate partners including CIMB Group Holdings Berhad, Yayasan Khazanah and the Jeffrey Cheah Foundation. British universities also provide additional funding in support of the Chevening programme.</p>

<p>His Excellency Charles Hay MVO, British High Commissioner to Malaysia, hosted a pre-departure briefing and reception for the scholars this evening. At the reception, he said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Malaysia’s growing appetite for higher education in the UK is reflected in the increase in Chevening Scholarships applications. We received a total of 748 applications for the 2022/23 compared to 620 applications in the preceding year. I am pleased to announce that the UK is awarding 39 Chevening Scholarships to Malaysia. This is just one example of how education remains the most enduring aspects of the UK-Malaysia relationship.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The 2023/24 Chevening application cycle is now open and I encourage more Malaysians from every state to apply. The Chevening programme provides leaders of tomorrow with a 360 educational experience which includes exploring UK’s diverse culture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Malaysians who wish to get a scholarship to pursue a post-graduate degree in the UK should apply by 1 November 2022. More information is available on <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.chevening.org/malaysia" rel="external">the Chevening website</a>.</p>

<p>The current batch of scholars will be heading to the UK as early as September this year to pursue a wide range of postgraduate programmes at top UK universities, including subjects such as climate change, law, public policy, public health and filmmaking.</p>

<p>Scholar Shimri Lim who is attending University of Birmingham to study Trauma Science MSc said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I am extremely excited about the opportunity to learn from leading experts in Trauma Care at the University of Birmingham which has a joint civilian &amp; military trauma centre based in Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham. The one year with Chevening is an unparalleled platform to build professional relationships which I am determined to utilise to the fullest for the benefit of Malaysia and the UK. The Masters in Trauma Science will equip me with the necessary knowledge to further improve the Health Services of the Malaysian Armed Forces. Chevening has enabled me to be one step closer to my goal of providing state-of-the-art trauma care for the Malaysian soldiers and our allies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sarawakian scholar Nur Afifah Binti Ismail said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Being a Chevening scholar this year, I look forward to receiving a world-class education and gaining a wider perspective from like-minded people from around the world. Exchanging ideas and building networks is a must while achieving my long-time dream to watch Formula 1 at the Silverstone in England. My focus is on Digital Media and Communication at the University of Stirling. I hope that the various aspects of digital communication skill I learn will allow me to educate youngsters to speak up for justice and against inequality through digital platforms. I hope my contribution in Malaysia when I return can kickstart more opportunities and an inclusive future for youths in Sarawak.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sabahan scholar Russell Rohny who will be attending the University of Edinburgh to study Global Mental Health and Society said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">My heart is accelerating for the growth that I will experience during the upcoming Chevening journey, especially in making friends with diverse individuals from around the world, challenging my wisdom by diving deeper into interdisciplinary studies, and immersing into the British culture in the heart of Scotland. As someone of Iban, Murut and Dusun heritage from Tambunan, Sabah, I will carry my indigenous values with me throughout this one year. Driven by passion and resilience, I want to raise awareness about mental health among the multi-ethnic communities of Sabah. I want to contribute towards formulating sustainable approaches to this issue, nationally and internationally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scholar Charina Pria Sivayogam who will be attending University of Kent to study Conservation and International Wildlife Trade said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I am grateful to be awarded the Chevening scholarship as it allows me to grow my skillset and explore other innovative approaches to countering wildlife crime at University of Kent. This illicit issue does not only impact wildlife population but also our livelihood, national security, emerging zoonotic diseases, and more. It is exciting to have the opportunity to learn from experts and study at the institute that is at the forefront of multidisciplinary research in conservation that examines these issues from all angles. With this, I look forward to contributing to Malaysia’s ongoing efforts in protecting our natural heritage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Malaysia is the second largest recipient of Chevening awards in ASEAN and there are already over 1,700 Chevening alumni in Malaysia.</p>
