          <p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hiv-annual-data-tables">report shows</a> there were 2,630 new diagnoses in 2020 compared to 3,950 in 2019. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic changed patterns of sexual behaviour, affected <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> testing and limited access to sexual health and <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> services, all of which will have impacted on the number of <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> diagnoses.</p>

<p>The decline in new <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> diagnoses in England was sharpest in gay and bisexual men, which fell by 41% between 2019 and 2020. The drop in testing was not as pronounced in gay and bisexual men, suggesting that the year-on-year reductions in transmission we have seen in this group have continued.</p>

<p>There is also evidence gay and bisexual men had fewer partners in 2020 and accessing pre-exposure prophylaxis (<abbr title="pre-exposure prophylaxis">PrEP</abbr>) continued. However, the decline in new <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> diagnoses were not seen across all gay and bisexual men, and was steepest in white men, men living in London and younger men.</p>

<p>The 23% reduction in new <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> diagnoses in heterosexuals is likely due to declines in testing; the number of heterosexuals having an <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> test fell by 33% between 2019 and 2020.</p>

<p>In 2020, the <abbr title="Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS">UNAIDS</abbr> 95-95-95 targets were met across the UK for the first time with 95% of all people diagnosed, 99% of those in care on treatment and 97% of those on treatment virally suppressed, meaning that 91% of all people living with <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> in care were virally suppressed in England and the UK.</p>

<p>However, the total number of people with diagnosed <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> infection who accessed <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> services in 2020 was lower than in 2019. An estimated 97,740&nbsp;people were living with <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> in England in 2020 and of these, an estimated 4,660 were unaware of their infection.</p>

<p>Detecting <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> early allows effective treatment to start sooner and people diagnosed can expect to have a normal life expectancy. In addition, people living with <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> who are treated and maintain an undetectable level of virus cannot pass <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> even if having sex without condoms or <abbr title="pre-exposure prophylaxis">PrEP</abbr>, known as Undetectable = Untransmissible (U=U).</p>

<p>Tests are free and available through GP surgeries, local hospitals and sexual health clinics, as well as by using a self-testing kit.</p>

<p>The overall risk of dying with <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> infection remains low. There were 620 deaths among people with <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>. Of the 99 COVID-19 deaths that occurred in people with <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> during the first wave, almost all occurred in people with co-morbidities associated with COVID-19. It is likely that the vaccine programme and social distancing measures reduced the risk of severe COVID-19 infection among people with <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>.</p>

<p>The annual report demonstrates the importance of testing as part of a combination prevention approach – as set out in <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> Action Plan (2022 to 2025) for England, also published today. Designed to meet a commitment to end <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> transmission and <abbr title="acquired immunodeficiency syndrome">AIDS</abbr>, to decrease the number of <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>-related deaths and to end <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>-related stigma by 2030, it sets out a combination approach focussed on prevent, test, treat and retain. A monitoring and evaluation framework will be published in 2022.</p>

<p>Dr Valerie Delpech, Head of&nbsp;<abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>&nbsp;Surveillance at <abbr title="UK Security Health Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The continued decline in <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> diagnoses made in England is encouraging, but last year’s data needs to be considered in the context of a COVID-19 pandemic which saw prolonged and unprecedented public health restrictions, coupled with intense pressure on health services resulting in a decline in <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> testing overall.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It is now crucial that we continue to ramp up testing and start people on treatment at the earliest possible opportunity. We must address inequalities and find creative ways to achieve a reduction in transmission across all populations. We welcome the <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> Action Plan and expanding of <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> testing to provide greater opportunities for people to be offered an <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> test throughout the NHS .</p>
