<p>Highways England is working with the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) on updated guidance for the code to help drivers making journeys on the roads, as well as what they should do in an emergency.</p>

<p>Highways England has today launched a four-week consultation for members of the public to give their thoughts on the proposed changes.</p>

<p>Developing The Highway Code to include extra information about smart motorways is part of the Department for Transport’s 18-point action plan to improve safety on England’s roads.</p>

<p>Jeremy Phillips, Highways England’s Head of Road Safety, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Highway Code is the go-to guide for road users to help make journeys as safe, efficient and sustainable as possible.</p>

  <p>We know more needs to be done to help motorists understand exactly how modern motorways and high-speed roads operate.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The updated edition of The Highway Code will help inform the next generation of road users as well as giving important updates to those with many miles under their belt, to help us all stay safer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Among the proposed updates are explanations of the availability, appearance and safe use of emergency areas, clearer information on the use of the red X sign to close lanes and provide safer areas for those involved in incidents or where people are working on the motorway, and how road users can help keep themselves safe in the event of a breakdown or emergency.</p>

<p>The update includes new guidance on the use of variable speed limits to manage congestion, how safety cameras are used to ensure compliance with speed limits and lanes closed with a red X, including the hard shoulder.</p>

<p>The guidance is also being updated on key factors that contribute to safety-related incidents, including driving while tired, unroadworthy vehicles, safe towing, tailgating and driving in roadworks.</p>

<p>It is vital that all road users are aware of The Highway Code, are considerate to other road users and understand their responsibility for their own safety and that of others.</p>

<p>The consultation runs until 23.59 on Monday 29 March 2021. To have your say, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/review-of-the-highway-code-to-improve-safety-on-motorways-and-high-speed-roads" class="govuk-link">visit the consultation webpage.</a></p>
