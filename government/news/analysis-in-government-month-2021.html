<ul>
  <li>Connect people with the Analysis Function and the analytical work being done across government</li>
  <li>Connect analysts working across government, both central and local, with each other and encourage collaborative working by bringing the analytical community together</li>
  <li>Connect analysts within the Analysis Function and those in councils who may doing work on similar topics locally.</li>
</ul>

<h2>About Analysis in Government Month 2021</h2>

<p>You will be invited to a programme of events, talks and activities covering a range of interesting and useful content.</p>

<p>You’ll get the chance to connect with analysts from all different departments, grades and professions.
