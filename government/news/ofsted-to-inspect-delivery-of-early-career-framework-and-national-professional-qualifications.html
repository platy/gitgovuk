          <div class="govspeak">
<p>Ofsted has today published its new framework and handbook for inspecting lead providers of the Department for Education’s two new flagship professional development programmes for teachers, the early career framework (<abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>) and the reformed suite of national professional qualifications (<abbr title="national professional qualifications">NPQs</abbr>).</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework-and-national-professional-qualification-inspection-framework-and-handbook">early career framework and national professional qualification inspection framework and handbook</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>These new inspections will look at the quality of professional development and training and the effectiveness of leadership and management to determine the overall effectiveness of the lead provider.</p>

<p>The launch of these two programmes completes the golden thread of professional development for teachers, starting with effective initial teacher education (ITE) and then developing high-quality teachers and leaders at all stages of their careers.</p>

<p>Ofsted has worked closely with the sector to develop the approach to this new area of work. Inspections will give confidence to early career teachers and <abbr title="national professional qualification">NPQ</abbr> participants, school leaders and the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> about the quality of the training and professional development offered.</p>

<p>Inspections will begin in summer 2022, with monitoring visits to check that early implementation is on track. Monitoring visits will judge whether leaders are taking effective action to establish the new courses. From spring 2023, Ofsted will then carry out full inspections of each lead provider, a minimum of once every two academic years.</p>

<p>Chief Inspector Amanda Spielman said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These two new programmes have the potential to transform the quality of training and professional development for teachers. They will support the government’s plans to recruit, train and retain the highly skilled workforce needed to give pupils the best experience in education.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Our inspections of lead providers of the <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr> and <abbr title="national professional qualifications">NPQs</abbr> will make sure the programmes are of the highest quality and that teachers and school leaders are getting the best possible support.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>How will these inspections work?</h2>

<p>In the first year of a lead provider’s operation, Ofsted will conduct a lead provider monitoring visit (<abbr title="lead provider monitoring visit">LPMV</abbr>) to judge whether leaders are taking effective action to establish the new courses.</p>

<p>For full inspections, which will follow, Ofsted will judge providers on the quality of professional development and training and leadership and management.</p>

<p>Inspectors will use the following 4-point scale to grade the key judgement areas and the overall effectiveness judgement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>grade 1: outstanding</li>
  <li>grade 2: good</li>
  <li>grade 3: requires improvement</li>
  <li>grade 4: inadequate</li>
</ul>

<p>Ofsted inspectors will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>only inspect <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>-funded lead providers</li>
  <li>visit a sample of delivery partners, <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> and/or <abbr title="national professional qualification">NPQ</abbr> participants, mentors, induction tutors, and trainers to inform our assessment of a lead provider</li>
  <li>report on any failure to comply with the statutory requirements of the <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>
</li>
  <li>comment on the quality of the mentor training programme</li>
</ul>

<p>Ofsted inspectors will not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make judgements about individual <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>, <abbr title="national professional qualification">NPQ</abbr> participants, delivery partners or mentors</li>
  <li>inspect <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr> training in schools that deliver their own <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based induction (whether using the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> accredited materials, or the <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr> to design a school-based programme)</li>
  <li>make a judgement on the content of the <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>/<abbr title="national professional qualification">NPQ</abbr> programmes of education, which are set by the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>, and approved by the <abbr title="Education Endowment Foundation">EEF</abbr>
</li>
  <li>grade individual lessons taught by <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> or <abbr title="national professional qualification">NPQ</abbr> participants, or sessions led by trainers or mentors</li>
  <li>consider the accuracy of <abbr title="national professional qualification">NPQ</abbr> summative assessments.</li>
</ul>
