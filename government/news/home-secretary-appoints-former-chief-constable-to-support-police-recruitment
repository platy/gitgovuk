<p>A former Chief Constable with more than 30 years’ experience in front-line policing has been appointed by Home Secretary Priti Patel to challenge and support the Home Office as it recruits 20,000 extra officers, tackles violent crime and restores public confidence in the criminal justice system.</p>

<p>Michael Fuller, who has been appointed as a non-executive director of the Home Office, is also keen to help the department increase diversity in the police and to implement the recommendations of the Wendy Williams Lessons Learned Review following Windrush.</p>

<p>Mr Fuller QPM became the first black officer to be appointed Chief Constable when he took over Kent Police in 2004. As a police officer, he was instrumental in setting up the Racial and Violent Crime Task Force, drew up the Metropolitan Police action plan in response to the Macpherson Inquiry, and established and led Operation Trident, successfully reducing gun crime in London. Mr Fuller, a qualified barrister, later served as HM Chief Inspector of the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>

<p>He is one of five new non-executive directors who will work closely with ministers and officials to support the delivery of the department’s commitments. The appointees have a vast amount of private sector and commercial experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Phil Swallow had a 32 year career at multinational professional services company Accenture</li>
  <li>John Paton has served as chief executive of several media companies across four countries</li>
  <li>Tim Robinson is chief executive of international life sciences company LGC</li>
  <li>Jan Gower is a former Vice President at IBM UK and was also a Partner at PwC</li>
</ul>

<p>Home Secretary Priti Patel said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our new non-executive directors will have an important role to play in helping the Home Office deliver for the public - from recruiting 20,000 extra police officers and tackling serious violence to righting the wrongs of Windrush and implementing a new points-based immigration system.</p>

  <p class="last-child">They bring with them a wealth of experience and expertise from outside government, including careers in frontline policing and leading multinational companies, and I am looking forward to working with them all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Permanent Secretary Matthew Rycroft said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I’m delighted to welcome our new non-executive directors to the Home Office. Their experience, insight and knowledge will be of great value to the department as we work together to achieve our objectives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Michael Fuller QPM said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I know first-hand the challenges the police face in their difficult task of keeping the public safe. I hope to use my operational experience and knowledge of the criminal justice system to scrutinise the Home Office and help the department deliver its commitments, which includes recruiting extra officers, ensuring forces better represent the communities they serve and making sure the police have the support they need.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Non-executive directors are an essential part of the board as they bring constructive challenge and advice to the department’s work through a fresh, independent, and external perspective. NEDs will have experience of managing large or complex organisations and projects.</p>
