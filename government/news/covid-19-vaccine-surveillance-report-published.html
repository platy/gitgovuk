          <h2>Latest</h2>

<p>Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) has published its latest weekly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccine-surveillance-report">COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report</a>.</p>

<h3>230,800 hospitalisations prevented by COVID-19 vaccines in those over 45</h3>

<p>The latest&nbsp;<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>&nbsp;estimates suggest that 230,800 hospitalisations have been prevented in those aged 45 years and over in England as a result of the COVID-19 vaccination programme, up to 5 September.</p>

<p>The latest report included hospitalisations averted in those aged 45 to 64 years for the first time. Around 51,900 hospitalisations have been prevented in this age group, which includes healthy individuals and at-risk groups, the latter prioritised earlier in the campaign.</p>

<p>Approximately 46,500 admissions were prevented in those aged 65 to 74, 73,800 in those aged 75 to 84, and 58,600 in those aged 85 and over.</p>

<p>The indirect effects of the vaccination programme are not included in this analysis. There is evidence that vaccines prevent infection and transmission. Therefore, the figure of 230,800 hospitalisations prevented is likely to be an underestimate.</p>

<p>The number of hospitalisations averted by vaccination can be estimated by considering vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation, vaccine coverage and observed hospitalisations, as well as through modelling.</p>

<p>Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at&nbsp;<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is encouraging to see such high numbers of hospitalisations prevented, including a large number in younger age ranges. These figures show the vital role that vaccines play in protecting against severe disease and reducing pressure across the NHS.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The vaccine helps protect you and those around you. To gain maximum protection, it is important that you get 2 doses of the vaccine.</p>

<h3>Thursday 2 September 2021</h3>

<p>Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) has published its latest weekly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccine-surveillance-report">COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report</a>.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 vaccines prevent over 143,000 hospitalisations in England</h3>

<p>The latest <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> estimates suggest that 143,600 hospitalisations have been prevented in those aged 65 years and over in England as a result of the COVID-19 vaccination programme, up to 22 August.</p>

<p>For the latest report, the estimates used in the model were updated to use more recent vaccine effectiveness estimates. Therefore, an increase in the number of hospitalisations averted was seen in this report compared to previous reports.</p>

<p>Approximately 36,100 admissions were prevented in those aged 65 to 74, 58,800 in those aged 75 to 84, and 48,700 in those aged 85 and over.</p>

<p>The indirect effects of the vaccination programme are not included in this analysis. There is increasing evidence that vaccines prevent infection and transmission. Therefore, the figure of 143,600 hospitalisations prevented is likely to be an underestimate.</p>

<p>The number of hospitalisations averted by vaccination can be estimated by considering vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation, vaccine coverage and observed hospitalisations, as well as through modelling.</p>

<p>Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, Consultant Epidemiologist at <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These figures show the vital role that vaccines play in preventing hospitalisations and in turn reducing the pressure on the NHS.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The vaccine helps protect you and those around you. To gain maximum protection, it is important that you get 2 doses of the vaccine.</p>

<h3>Thursday 26 August 2021</h3>

<p>Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) has published its latest weekly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccine-surveillance-report">COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report</a>.</p>

<h3>Estimated deaths prevented by COVID-19 vaccines rise to over 100,000</h3>

<p>The latest estimates suggest that 105,900 deaths and 24,088,000 infections have been prevented as a result of the COVID-19 vaccination programme, up to 20 August.</p>

<p>The results were produced using the real-time pandemic surveillance model from&nbsp;<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>&nbsp;and Cambridge University’s&nbsp;<abbr title="Medical Research Council">MRC</abbr>&nbsp;Biostatistics Unit, looking at the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 vaccination programme on infections and mortality.</p>

<p>The total was calculated by comparing the estimated impact of vaccination on infection and mortality against a worst-case scenario where no vaccines and no additional non-pharmaceutical interventions (<abbr title="non-pharmaceutical interventions">NPIs</abbr>) were in place to reduce infections and mortality.</p>

<p>Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today’s new data showing that vaccines have saved more than 100,000 lives in England is phenomenal and testament to the UK’s vaccination programme.</p>

  <p>The vaccines have made a life-changing difference to so many of us and continue to help us build a stronger wall of defence every day. With over 24 million infections prevented, vaccines are keeping people safe from harm and helping us reclaim our freedoms so we can return to normal life.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Getting the vaccine has never been easier, thanks to sites being made available across a variety of sites including places of worship, festivals, and sporting grounds so please ensure you get your jab as soon as possible to ensure yourself, your loved ones and the people around you are protected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is remarkable that the vaccine programme may now have prevented over 100,000 deaths in England alone. Everyone that has come forward for their vaccine has played a part in this vital effort.</p>

  <p class="last-child">To build on this success it remains important that everyone gets 2 doses of the vaccine, to protect you and those around you from COVID-19. You must get 2 doses to gain maximum protection.</p>

<h3>Thursday 19 August 2021</h3>

<p>Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) has published its latest weekly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccine-surveillance-report">COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report</a>.</p>

<h3>Data shows increase in number of pregnant women vaccinated</h3>

<p>The latest <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> data shows that 62,311 women, who reported they were pregnant or could be pregnant at the time of receiving the vaccine, have come forward and received their first dose of COVID-19 vaccination, up to 31 July. This is an increase of 10,587 from 51,724 as of 18 July.</p>

<p>Of the latest total, 43,737 have received their second dose.</p>

<p>Severe illness due to COVID-19 is more likely in later pregnancy, although it is still uncommon.</p>

<p>As evidence about the safety of vaccination in pregnancy and the risks of COVID-19 to pregnant women and their babies has increased, the NHS has been working hard with partners such as the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) to encourage pregnant women to come forward.</p>

<p>Pregnant women who have already received their first dose of vaccine are recommended to come forward for their second dose of vaccine 8 weeks after their first dose.</p>

<p>The latest estimates also suggest that the vaccination programme has prevented over 82,100 hospitalisations in those aged 65 and over in England. Further data suggests that it has also prevented 95,200 deaths and 23,957,000 COVID-19 infections more widely.</p>

<p>Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Sajid Javid said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The UK’s phenomenal vaccination programme has made a life-changing difference to tens of millions of people across the country, and we’re quickly closing in on 100,000 lives being saved in England alone.</p>

  <p>With 82,100 hospitalisations prevented in over-65s and almost 24 million infections prevented across England, the vaccines are continuing to keep all of us safe. It’s also hugely encouraging to see over 62,000 pregnant women taking up the offer and ensuring they and their babies are protected from this dangerous disease.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The vaccines are free and available at hundreds of locations around the UK – please get your jabs to secure this protection for yourself and your loved ones and help us reclaim our lost freedoms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisations at&nbsp;<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is encouraging that thousands of women have now benefitted from the vital protection of a COVID-19 vaccine. However, many more may remain unvaccinated and we urge them to take up the offer.</p>

  <p>The COVID-19 vaccines are safe for both you and your unborn baby and they are the best way to protect against COVID-19 related complications in pregnancy which can be serious, especially in your third trimester.</p>

  <p class="last-child">If you are pregnant and haven’t yet had your vaccine, make sure to book it in. It’s also vital that health professionals continue to talk to women about the benefits of vaccination and help to answer any questions they may have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Pat O’Brien, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist and Vice President at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We want to encourage all pregnant women to come forward for their vaccinations. It is very positive to see that the number of pregnant women who have been vaccinated is rising, but many more remain unvaccinated.</p>

  <p>There is growing evidence that the vaccine is safe in pregnancy, and we want to reassure women that there is no link to an increased risk of harm to the baby, such as miscarriage, premature birth, growth problems, or stillbirth when having the vaccine.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We are seeing more unvaccinated pregnant women become seriously ill from COVID-19, and an increased number of women admitted to hospital and intensive care. The vaccine will help to protect both the mother and their baby from the potential effects of COVID-19.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jessica Read, Deputy Chief Midwifery Officer for England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mums-to-be naturally want what’s best for their baby and we know that many have been worried about getting vaccinated, but we also know that the vaccine is safe for pregnant women – with hundreds of thousands of expectant mums around the world having had the vaccine with no ill effects.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Pregnant women who catch COVID-19 are more at risk of becoming seriously ill, which can cause problems in pregnancy, so it’s vital they take up the ongoing NHS offer of a COVID-19 vaccination – protecting themselves and their babies from the virus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gill Walton, Chief Executive of the Royal College of Midwives, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s positive to see more pregnant women are getting vaccinated. Getting the vaccine is the best way to protect you and your baby against COVID-19. It really is that simple.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of thousands of pregnant women worldwide have been vaccinated, safely and effectively protecting themselves against COVID-19 and dramatically reducing their risk of serious illness or harm to their baby.</p>

  <p class="last-child">If you have questions please talk to your midwife, obstetrician or GP. Get the answers you need and get the jab.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is preferable for pregnant women in the UK to be offered the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines where available, as these vaccines have been given to over 140,000 pregnant women in the US and the data has not raised any safety concerns.</p>

<p>Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) has published its latest weekly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccine-surveillance-report">COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report</a>.</p>

<h3>Infections prevented by COVID-19 vaccines rise to over 23 million and deaths prevented to over 84,000</h3>

<p>The latest estimates suggest that 84,600 deaths and 23,395,000 infections have been prevented as a result of the COVID-19 vaccination programme, up to 6 August.</p>

<p>The results were produced using the real-time pandemic surveillance model from <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> and Cambridge University’s <abbr title="Medical Research Council">MRC</abbr> Biostatistics Unit, looking at the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 vaccination programme on infections and mortality.</p>

  <p>As cases have increased, the true scale of protection from the vaccine programme has become clear. Everyone that has come forward for their vaccine has played a part in this vital effort.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It’s important that people under 30 years of age continue to take up the offer of the vaccine. Infection rates are highest in this age group and COVID-19 can be serious for some.</p>

<p>Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) has published its latest weekly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccine-surveillance-report">COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report</a>.</p>

<h3>Infections prevented by COVID-19 vaccines double to 22 million and deaths prevented rise to 60,000</h3>

<p><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>&nbsp;estimates that 60,000 deaths and 22,057,000 infections have been prevented as a result of the COVID-19 vaccination programme, up to 23 July. This is based on modelling analysis from&nbsp;<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>&nbsp;and Cambridge University’s <abbr title="Medical Research Council">MRC</abbr> Biostatistics Unit.</p>

<p>The estimated number of deaths prevented has increased significantly since the most recent estimates were published, with the estimated number of infections prevented doubling in just 2 weeks. It was previously estimated that up to 9 July, around 37,000 deaths and 11,000,000 infections were prevented.</p>

<p>The methods used to estimate deaths and infections prevented is based on direct and indirect effects of the vaccination programme.</p>

<p>Health and Social Care Secretary, Sajid Javid, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These new figures are fantastic to see – 22 million infections have now been prevented across the country and 60,000 lives have been saved.</p>

  <p>That’s hundreds of thousands of people whose loved ones have been protected thanks to the vaccines’ remarkable protection.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Day by day, jab by jab, we are building a wall of defence which is protecting our nation against the threat of this virus. Make sure to get the jab if you haven’t already and play your part in this historic effort.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Minister for COVID-19 Vaccine Deployment, Nadhim Zahawi, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over 84 million vaccinations have now been administered since our world-class vaccination programme began in December, by thousands of NHS workers and volunteers at thousands of vaccination sites.</p>

  <p>We can see the fantastic results of their efforts – 22 million infections prevented and 60,000 lives saved, an achievement we can all feel proud of.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Play your part in the UK’s COVID-19 response – it couldn’t be easier to go to a pop-up vaccination site this weekend or book through the NHS website, and get the jab.</p>

<h3>Thursday 8 July 2021</h3>

<p>Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) has published its latest weekly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccine-surveillance-report">COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report</a>.</p>

<h3>30,300 deaths, 46,300 hospitalisations and 8,151,000 infections prevented by COVID-19 vaccines</h3>

<p><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> estimates that 30,300 deaths and 8,151,000 infections have been prevented as a result of the COVID-19 vaccination programme, up to 25 June. This is based on modelling analysis from&nbsp;<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>&nbsp;and Cambridge University’s <abbr title="Medical Research Council">MRC</abbr> Biostatistics Unit.</p>

<p><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> also estimates that 46,300 hospitalisations have been prevented in people aged 65 or older in England up to 27 June (approximately 7,000 admissions in those aged 65 to 74, 18,000 in those aged 75 to 84, and 21,300 in those aged 85 and over).</p>

<p>The methods used to estimate deaths and infections prevented is based on direct and indirect effects of the vaccination programme. The indirect effects of the vaccination programme will not be incorporated into the analysis of hospitalisations prevented, which only takes into account the direct impact of first and second doses. Therefore the figure of 46,300 hospitalisations averted is likely to be an underestimate.</p>

<p>Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, Consultant Epidemiologist at&nbsp;<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The vaccines are very safe and very effective, and they are the best way to protect you and those around you from becoming seriously ill with COVID-19.</p>

  <p>With restrictions easing, it is absolutely vital that everyone gets 2 doses of the vaccine, to protect you and those around you from the COVID-19 variants currently circulating in the UK.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Remember, you must book your second jab when invited, to gain maximum protection.</p>

<h3>Thursday 1 July 2021</h3>

<p>Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) has published its latest weekly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccine-surveillance-report">COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report</a>.</p>

<h3>Vaccine effectiveness in under 40s published for the first time</h3>

<p>For the first time, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> estimates vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease in adults under the age of 40.</p>

<p>Early estimates suggest a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine is 61% effective against symptomatic disease and a single dose of the Moderna vaccine is 72% effective against symptomatic disease.</p>

<p>This is the first time that <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> has published estimated vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease for the Moderna vaccine.</p>

<p>Offer of the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines to adults aged under 40 years began on 10 May 2021. Both vaccines have been preferentially offered to under 40s in line with advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>).</p>

<p>For the first time, the report also includes vaccine effectiveness against mortality after 2 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine is estimated to provide 94% protection against death from COVID-19 in people aged 65 and over.</p>

<p>The report highlights that the COVID-19 vaccination programme has so far prevented an estimated 7.2 million infections and 27,000 deaths in England alone. This is based on modelling analysis from <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> and Cambridge University’s <abbr title="Medical Research Council">MRC</abbr> Biostatistics Unit.</p>

<p>Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, Consultant Epidemiologist at&nbsp;<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This data gives us even more confidence that the vaccines offer high levels of protection against COVID-19 across all age groups.</p>

  <p>Getting 2 doses of the vaccine is absolutely vital to protect you and others against the variants in circulation in the UK. Remember that you must book your second jab when invited, to gain maximum protection.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The vaccines are very safe and very effective, and they will protect you and those around you from becoming seriously ill.</p>

<p>Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) has published its latest weekly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccine-surveillance-report">COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report</a>.</p>

<h3>42,000 hospitalisations and 14,000 deaths prevented by COVID-19 vaccine</h3>

<p><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>&nbsp;estimates that 14,000 deaths have now been prevented in people aged 60 years or older in England up to 30 May 2021 (11,800 deaths in individuals aged 80 years and older, 1,800 in individuals aged 70 to 79 and 400 in individuals aged 60 to 69 years).</p>

<p>Estimates also indicate that the vaccination programme has prevented around 42,000 hospitalisations in those aged 65 years and over in England (approximately 5,400 admissions in those aged 65 to 74, 16,300 in those aged 75 to 84 and 20,300 in those aged 85 and over).</p>

<p>The method for analysing the approximate number of deaths and hospitalisations prevented by the vaccine programme takes into account the impact of both first and second doses. However, it does not include the impact of vaccination on transmission, therefore the true impact of the vaccination programme is likely to be even greater.</p>

<p>Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, Consultant Epidemiologist at&nbsp;<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Getting 2 doses of the vaccine is absolutely vital to protect you and others against the variants in circulation in the UK. Remember that you must book your second jab when invited, to gain maximum protection.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The vaccines are very safe and very effective, and they will protect you and those around you from becoming seriously ill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock said:&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every single jab given means one more parent, sibling or loved one protected from this terrible disease.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>All those who have played a part in the efforts to vaccinate the nation can today look at these new figures and feel proud of what they’ve achieved, with 42,000 people kept out of hospital and over 14,000 lives saved.&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="last-child">We’ve had a fantastic response to the opening up of the vaccine programme to over 25s with over a million appointments booked on Tuesday, but the battle isn’t over yet – I urge all those yet to book to join the fight and get the jab.</p>

<h3>39,700 hospitalisations and 13,200 deaths prevented</h3>

<p><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> estimates that 13,200 deaths have now been prevented in people aged 60 years or older in England up to 13 May 2021 (11,200 deaths in individuals aged 80 years and older, 1,700 in individuals aged 70 to 79 and 300 in individuals aged 60 to 69 years).</p>

<p>Estimates also indicate that the vaccination programme has prevented around 39,700 hospitalisations in those aged 65 years and over in England (approximately 4,900 admissions in those aged 65 to 74, 15,600 in those aged 75 to 84 and 19,200 in those aged 85 and over).</p>

<p>The method for analysing the approximate number of deaths and hospitalisations prevented by the vaccine programme now takes into account the impact of both first and second doses, due to more data being available. However, it does not include the impact of vaccination on transmission, therefore the true impact of the vaccination programme is likely to be even greater.</p>

<p>An updated analysis including nearly 3,000 symptomatic cases of B.1.617.2 provides further confidence that 2 doses of either vaccine are highly effective against the variant first identified in India.</p>

<p>Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, Consultant Epidemiologist at <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This analysis gives further confidence that 2 doses of the vaccine provide vital protection against the variants in circulation in the UK, so it is important to book your second jab when invited, to gain maximum protection.</p>

<h3>Thursday 20 May 2021</h3>

<p>Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) has published its latest weekly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccine-surveillance-report">COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report</a>.</p>

<h3>13,000 deaths prevented</h3>

<p><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> estimates that 13,000 deaths have now been prevented in people aged 60 years or older in England up to 9 May 2021 (11,100 deaths in individuals aged 80 years and older, 1,600 in individuals aged 70 to 79 and 300 in individuals aged 60 to 69 years).</p>

<p>Estimates also indicate that the vaccination programme has prevented around 39,100 hospitalisations in those aged 65 years and over in England (approximately 4,700 admissions in those aged 65 to 74, 15,400 in those aged 75 to 84 and 19,000 in those aged 85 and over).</p>

<p>The method for analysing the approximate number of deaths and hospitalisations prevented by the vaccine programme now takes into account the impact of both first and second doses, due to more data being available. Previously, the method only used the impact of the first dose of vaccination on hospitalisations and deaths.</p>

<p>New analysis for the first time estimates that 2 doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine provides around 85 to 90% protection against symptomatic disease.</p>

<p>Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock said:</p>

  <p>This new data shows the vaccine saves lives and protects you from ending up in hospital with COVID-19.</p>

  <p>The 13,000 deaths and the 39,100 hospitalisations that have been prevented are not just numbers. They are our family, our friends, our loved ones and a poignant reminder of the impact the vaccine is having.</p>

  <p class="last-child">With the threat of new variants, it’s never been more important to get the vaccine. We have now extended the call to 34 and 35 year olds, so when you get the offer, please get the jab.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at&nbsp;<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As this data highlights, getting your vaccine is one of the most important ways to beat the spread of this terrible disease, protecting you and those around you. The vaccines are very safe and very effective.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Each vaccine dose delivered helps us prevent lives being lost and people becoming seriously ill, therefore protecting our hospitals. That’s why it’s so important that you get both doses of your vaccine as soon as they are offered to you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vaccines Minister, Nadhim Zahawi said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This new data highlights the incredible impact that both doses of the vaccine can have, with a second dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine providing up to 90% protection.</p>

  <p>There is no better weapon to send this virus into retreat than our life-saving vaccines. A second dose is vital to ensure you have the strongest possible protection so we can return to normality and get back to the things we love.</p>

  <p class="last-child">More than 1 in 3 adults across the country are already fully vaccinated with both doses. I encourage everyone to book their jab as soon as they are offered it and join the millions who are protected from this virus.</p>

<h3>Friday 14 May 2021</h3>

<p>Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) has published its latest weekly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccine-surveillance-report">COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report</a>.</p>

<h3>Analysis shows 33,000 hospitalisations and 11,700 deaths prevented</h3>

<p>New Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccine-surveillance-report">analysis indicates</a> that&nbsp;the COVID-19 vaccination programme prevented 11,700 deaths&nbsp;in those aged 60 and older in England up to the end of April – an additional 1,300 since the previous update.</p>

<p>For the first time, analysis also suggests that at least 33,000 hospitalisations were prevented in those aged 65 and older in England, in the same time period.</p>

<p>The work compared the observed number of deaths with the number of deaths that would have been expected if the vaccine hadn’t been given during this time period.</p>

<p>Using this method,&nbsp;<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>&nbsp;estimates that around 11,700 deaths were prevented by the end of April – 9,900 in those aged 80 and over, 1,500 in those aged 70 to 79 and 300 in those aged 60 to 69.</p>

<p>Expected deaths with COVID-19 were estimated using real-world data on how effective the vaccines are at preventing death and vaccine uptake.</p>

<p>New analysis also shows further evidence that the vaccine is highly effective in preventing hospitalisations, especially in older age.</p>

<p>Up to the end of April, approximately 3,900 hospital admissions were prevented in those aged 65 to 74, 13,100 in those aged 75 to 84 and 16,000 in those aged 85 and older.</p>

<p>The number of hospitalisations prevented can be estimated by considering vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation, vaccine coverage and observed hospitalisations, as well as through modelling.</p>

<p>The work takes into account the direct effects of vaccines. There is now clear and increasing evidence that vaccines help to reduce transmission, therefore it is likely that an even higher number of deaths and hospitalisations have been prevented by the vaccination programme.</p>

<p>Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In only a few short months, our COVID-19 vaccines have saved the lives of over 11,700 people and stopped over 33,000 from being hospitalised. After a heart-breaking and difficult year, that is remarkable.</p>

  <p>That’s tens of thousands of parents, children, siblings, friends and loved ones saved – and millions more who haven’t had to feel the impact of that horrible loss too.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This is further proof that getting a vaccine is one of the most important things you will be asked to do in your lifetime – when offered the jab, don’t hesitate in securing this protection for yourself and others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at&nbsp;<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The vaccine has already saved so many lives and we can now see the huge impact it has had on preventing people becoming seriously ill and therefore also protecting our hospitals.</p>

  <p class="last-child">As these figures highlight, getting your vaccine could save your life or stop you becoming seriously ill from COVID-19. It will also significantly reduce your chances of getting infected and infecting others. It is vital to get both doses of your vaccine when you are offered it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Minister for COVID-19 Vaccine Deployment Nadhim Zahawi said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The COVID-19 vaccination programme continues at its record-breaking pace and it’s fantastic to see the incredible impact it’s having on the country already.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Wherever you come from, whatever your religion, ethnicity or background, make sure to book in your vaccine when the time comes. It’s an easy way in which you can play a part in our journey out of the pandemic once and for all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The data presented is as a result of people receiving their first dose of the vaccine.</p>

<p>Separate analysis indicates that the protection against hospitalisation and death from COVID-19 increases further following the second dose.</p>

<p>As more individuals are vaccinated and develop an immune response to the second dose, future analyses will include the impact of the second dose.</p>
