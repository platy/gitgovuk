        <h2>Latest</h2>

<p>Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) has published its latest weekly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccine-surveillance-report">COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report</a>.</p>

<h3>13,000 deaths prevented</h3>

<p><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> estimates that 13,000 deaths have now been prevented in people aged 60 years or older in England up to 9 May 2021 (11,100 deaths in individuals aged 80 years and older, 1,600 in individuals aged 70 to 79 and 300 in individuals aged 60 to 69 years).</p>

<p>Estimates also indicate that the vaccination programme has prevented around 39,100 hospitalisations in those aged 65 years and over in England (approximately 4,700 admissions in those aged 65 to 74, 15,400 in those aged 75 to 84 and 19,000 in those aged 85 and over).</p>

<p>The method for analysing the approximate number of deaths and hospitalisations prevented by the vaccine programme now takes into account the impact of both first and second doses, due to more data being available. Previously, the method only used the impact of the first dose of vaccination on hospitalisations and deaths.</p>

<p>New analysis for the first time estimates that 2 doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine provides around 85 to 90% protection against symptomatic disease.</p>

<p>Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This new data shows the vaccine saves lives and protects you from ending up in hospital with COVID-19.</p>

  <p>The 13,000 deaths and the 39,100 hospitalisations that have been prevented are not just numbers. They are our family, our friends, our loved ones and a poignant reminder of the impact the vaccine is having.</p>

  <p class="last-child">With the threat of new variants, it’s never been more important to get the vaccine. We have now extended the call to 34 and 35 year olds, so when you get the offer, please get the jab.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at&nbsp;<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As this data highlights, getting your vaccine is one of the most important ways to beat the spread of this terrible disease, protecting you and those around you. The vaccines are very safe and very effective.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Each vaccine dose delivered helps us prevent lives being lost and people becoming seriously ill, therefore protecting our hospitals. That’s why it’s so important that you get both doses of your vaccine as soon as they are offered to you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vaccines Minister, Nadhim Zahawi said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This new data highlights the incredible impact that both doses of the vaccine can have, with a second dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine providing up to 90% protection.</p>

  <p>There is no better weapon to send this virus into retreat than our life-saving vaccines. A second dose is vital to ensure you have the strongest possible protection so we can return to normality and get back to the things we love.</p>

  <p class="last-child">More than 1 in 3 adults across the country are already fully vaccinated with both doses. I encourage everyone to book their jab as soon as they are offered it and join the millions who are protected from this virus.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Previous updates</h2>

<h3>Friday 14 May 2021</h3>

<p>Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) has published its latest weekly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccine-surveillance-report">COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report</a>.</p>

<h3>Analysis shows 33,000 hospitalisations and 11,700 deaths prevented</h3>

<p>New Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccine-surveillance-report">analysis indicates</a> that&nbsp;the COVID-19 vaccination programme prevented 11,700 deaths&nbsp;in those aged 60 and older in England up to the end of April – an additional 1,300 since the previous update.</p>

<p>For the first time, analysis also suggests that at least 33,000 hospitalisations were prevented in those aged 65 and older in England, in the same time period.</p>

<p>The work compared the observed number of deaths with the number of deaths that would have been expected if the vaccine hadn’t been given during this time period.</p>

<p>Using this method,&nbsp;<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>&nbsp;estimates that around 11,700 deaths were prevented by the end of April – 9,900 in those aged 80 and over, 1,500 in those aged 70 to 79 and 300 in those aged 60 to 69.</p>

<p>Expected deaths with COVID-19 were estimated using real-world data on how effective the vaccines are at preventing death and vaccine uptake.</p>

<p>New analysis also shows further evidence that the vaccine is highly effective in preventing hospitalisations, especially in older age.</p>

<p>Up to the end of April, approximately 3,900 hospital admissions were prevented in those aged 65 to 74, 13,100 in those aged 75 to 84 and 16,000 in those aged 85 and older.</p>

<p>The number of hospitalisations prevented can be estimated by considering vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation, vaccine coverage and observed hospitalisations, as well as through modelling.</p>

<p>The work takes into account the direct effects of vaccines. There is now clear and increasing evidence that vaccines help to reduce transmission, therefore it is likely that an even higher number of deaths and hospitalisations have been prevented by the vaccination programme.</p>

<p>Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In only a few short months, our COVID-19 vaccines have saved the lives of over 11,700 people and stopped over 33,000 from being hospitalised. After a heart-breaking and difficult year, that is remarkable.</p>

  <p>That’s tens of thousands of parents, children, siblings, friends and loved ones saved – and millions more who haven’t had to feel the impact of that horrible loss too.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This is further proof that getting a vaccine is one of the most important things you will be asked to do in your lifetime – when offered the jab, don’t hesitate in securing this protection for yourself and others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at&nbsp;<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The vaccine has already saved so many lives and we can now see the huge impact it has had on preventing people becoming seriously ill and therefore also protecting our hospitals.</p>

  <p class="last-child">As these figures highlight, getting your vaccine could save your life or stop you becoming seriously ill from COVID-19. It will also significantly reduce your chances of getting infected and infecting others. It is vital to get both doses of your vaccine when you are offered it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Minister for COVID-19 Vaccine Deployment Nadhim Zahawi said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The COVID-19 vaccination programme continues at its record-breaking pace and it’s fantastic to see the incredible impact it’s having on the country already.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Wherever you come from, whatever your religion, ethnicity or background, make sure to book in your vaccine when the time comes. It’s an easy way in which you can play a part in our journey out of the pandemic once and for all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The data presented is as a result of people receiving their first dose of the vaccine.</p>

<p>Separate analysis indicates that the protection against hospitalisation and death from COVID-19 increases further following the second dose.</p>

<p>As more individuals are vaccinated and develop an immune response to the second dose, future analyses will include the impact of the second dose.</p>
