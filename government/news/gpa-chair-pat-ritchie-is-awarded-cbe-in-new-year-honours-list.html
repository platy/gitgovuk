<p>The Government Property Agency’s (GPA) Chair, Pat Ritchie, was awarded a CBE in the New Year Honours list for her services to Local Government and public service reform.</p>

<p>As the council’s first female Chief Executive, Pat led Newcastle through some of its biggest challenges, including steering the city through the pandemic, while maintaining its reputation as one of the UK’s most innovative and welcoming cities.</p>

<p>Pat received her CBE from Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal at an investiture at Windsor Castle. Speaking of her pride for receiving this recognition, Pat said: “It was a wonderful day, and a real endorsement of how hard the staff at Newcastle City Council have worked, together, for the people of this city.</p>

<p>“I want to say another big thank you to all of the staff in the city who supported people and communities during Covid, especially those on the front line in public health, care services and all those who kept our city clean and safe.</p>

<p>“I’m proud to have worked alongside them, and also proud of the work we have done over the last eight years to regenerate Newcastle and bring jobs to all parts of the city.”</p>

<p>In her time as Chief Executive Pat also built on Newcastle’s reputation for culture and sport, making the city a home for mayor sporting events, including a European rugby cup final and regularly welcoming thousands of fans for Magic Weekend events.</p>

<p>As a former Chief Executive of the Homes and Communities Agency (now Homes England) and former deputy Chief Executive of the One North East Regional Development Agency, Pat continues to influence national housing and economic policy, as well as regeneration projects across the UK as the GPA’s Chair.</p>
