<p>The Security Industry Authority (SIA) prosecuted Adeel Yasin, who is the director of Prime London Services Ltd, after one of their investigators found an unlicensed security guard during checks at a BP garage under renovation in Oxfordshire.</p>

<p>Adeel Yasin was fined £1000 by magistrates on 15 March and ordered to pay court costs of £1400 plus a victim surcharge of £100.  The court also fined Prime London Services £1000 and ordered it to pay court costs of £1541.25 plus a victim surcharge of £100.  Yasin had originally pleaded not guilty but changed his plea when he heard the evidence against him.</p>

<p>Nathan Salmon, of the SIA Criminal Investigation Team, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Adeel Yasin failed to undertake proper checks on the operatives for which he was responsible.  He should have made sure that any staff supplied to him by a subcontractor were correctly licensed and therefore working legally. His negligence has cost him a substantial amount of money.  It may also cost him his career in the security industry and his livelihood.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The SIA investigator found the unlicensed operative working at the BP Garage in Stadhampton, Oxfordshire on 22 October 2019. The guard claimed that he was covering for a friend and that he had left his licence at home.  He left the site when the investigator went back to his car to check SIA licence records.</p>

<p>The SIA contacted Adeel Yasin, whose company Prime London Services had been providing security for the site. Yasin said that the guard had been supplied to Prime by a subcontractor. Yasin told SIA investigators that he had previously checked the licence of the security guard “from a distance” by car headlight during a night-time visit to the garage.</p>

<p>Though the SIA have not been able identify the guard, an inspection of the site signing-in sheets gave investigators reason to believe that he had in fact worked on several previous occasions.</p>
