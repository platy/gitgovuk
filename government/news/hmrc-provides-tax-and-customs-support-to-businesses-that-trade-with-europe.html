<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is offering advice about trading with Europe that will help businesses adapt to the changes to customs and tax rules, and avoid disruption when they move goods between the UK and Europe, or under the Northern Ireland Protocol.</p>

<p>The government department is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/letters-to-businesses-about-importing-and-exporting-goods-between-great-britain-and-the-eu">writing out to all UK based VAT-registered traders</a>, as well as continuing to send weekly email updates to more than 170,000 customers.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/sophie-dean-and-katherine-green">Katherine Green and Sophie Dean</a>, Directors General, Borders and Trade, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We know how challenging it is for businesses to adapt to so many changes, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. And we appreciate how much traders have done already.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Customs and tax rules are complex, and we understand customers working through them for the first time need more support. That’s why we launched the new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/grants-to-help-small-and-medium-sized-businesses-new-to-importing-or-exporting" class="govuk-link">SME Brexit Support Fund</a> that can pay up to £2,000 for training or professional advice about customs and VAT, for businesses that are new to the importing and exporting rules, and we’ve also announced a six-month delay to the introduction of full import border controls, giving our customers more time to prepare and get to grips with the changes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We want our customers to know that <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is here to help. Our Customs and International Trade helpline has been expanded and we’ve extended our operating hours, while continuing to run <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/help-and-support-for-uk-transition">regular live webinars</a> that traders can join.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> also recommend that traders:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>decide if they want to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/delaying-declarations-for-eu-goods-brought-into-great-britain">delay import declarations</a> or duty payments on goods moving between EU into Great Britain</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/list-of-customs-agents-and-fast-parcel-operators">appoint a specialist to deal with import</a> and export declarations. This is important, regardless of the amount or value of trade your business does with Europe. Most companies use a third party such as a freight forwarder or fast parcel operator to deal with this and do not make their customs declarations themselves</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>find out whether they can claim the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-for-preferential-rates-of-duty-and-rules-of-origin" class="govuk-link">preferential rates of duty</a> that were agreed in December’s cooperation and trade agreement between the UK and the EU</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>check what support is available for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/moving-goods-into-out-of-or-through-northern-ireland">moving goods through Northern Ireland</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>
