  <li>Campaign launched to bolster Defence innovation in support of Ukraine’s Armed Forces</li>
  <li>At least £25 million of funding available for successful proposals to tackle specific needs</li>
  <li>Focus on rapidly delivering from innovation to battleground</li>
</ul>

<p>Defence Ministers are calling on UK industry to accelerate the development of equipment for the Ukrainian armed forces, launching a £25 million campaign fund for the design and delivery of equipment to the country across the coming months.</p>

<p>The competition will be focused on bolstering the existing provision for artillery, coastal defence and aerial systems.</p>

<p>The Government believes drawing on UK expertise across the defence industry, including from innovative small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), could provide battle-winning solutions for the Ukrainian forces.</p>

<h3>Defence Procurement Minister, Jeremy Quin said:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since Russia’s brutal invasion UK defence suppliers with active support from MOD and DE&amp;S have taken equipment from desktop ideas to the front line. This £25m plus fund is designed to capture ongoing work and support innovative ideas to meet Ukrainian defence requirements.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Recent months have shown the ingenuity and innovation of the UK defence sector. We want to ensure ongoing creativity is harnessed and directed at key requirements and all companies with a capability that can help are aware of the challenge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Working closely with industry we have already seen innovative ideas quickly reaching Theatre. This includes capabilities such as heavy lift Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and anti-tank loitering munitions, as well as adapting existing weapons systems such as integrating Brimstone for use as a ground launched weapon.</p>

<p>The requirements fall into four categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Artillery - Procurement and manufacturing proposals to support the resupply of ammunition and the maintenance of Soviet calibre 152mm and 122mm weapon systems.</li>
  <li>Coastal defence – Supporting the deterrence of hostile naval forces, persistent surveillance, and delivery of attacks at range, including from autonomous or remotely-controlled vehicles.</li>
  <li>Military logistics and resupply – Maintenance and development of infrastructure for supply lines by sea and land, including waterways, overbridging and general Ukrainian engineering capability.</li>
  <li>Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) – The provision of UAS capabilities across a broad spectrum of capabilities, from lethal effects to surveillance, electronic warfare and heavy lift.</li>
</ul>

<p>The UK has already committed more than £2.8 billion to support Ukraine through humanitarian aid and grants, as well as military kit including 120 armoured vehicles, air defence systems and more than 6,500 anti-tank missiles.</p>

<p>Industry organisations will need to submit proposals by June 10th, when a sift will take place to access the funding, with at least £25 million available.</p>

<p>The initial focus is on equipment that can be sourced and supplied in the next four months, with longer-term capability development in scope where applicable.</p>
