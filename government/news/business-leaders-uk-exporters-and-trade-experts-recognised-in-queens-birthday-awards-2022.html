<h3>Karen Betts, OBE, said:</h3>

<p>“I am delighted to receive this honour. I have had the pleasure to work alongside superb colleagues in the SWA and across the global whisky industry, as well as with committed government officials at home and overseas, and this honour reflects their hard work and creativity as much as my own efforts.”</p>

<h3>Bradley Aspess – awarded an MBE for his services to International Trade and Exports.</h3>

<p>Brad is a devoted businessman founding Rarewaves in 2005 with the aim to source and offer a range of over one million home-entertainment product lines to the world’s biggest marketplaces.

<h3>Bradley Aspess, MBE, said:</h3>

<p>“This is an incredible honour of my working life. It is very humbling. I look forward to working with DIT for years to come.”</p>

<h3>Ameeta Virk - awarded an MBE for her services to the economy.</h3>

<p>Ameeta is being recognised as a top performing Trade Adviser in the Southwest region – spearheading new Levelling Up initiatives and virtual programmes created during the pandemic to help SMEs. She has successfully created the Student Pathways to International Trade Programme with University of Exeter, which has launched the careers of over 100 graduates.

<h3>Ameeta Virk, MBE, said:</h3>

<p>“The moment I learned of this very special honour, I felt surprised and delighted in equal measure. Being recognised for work that I feel so passionate about means more to me than I can put into words and fills me with energy to do even more both locally and internationally.”</p>

<h3>Maggie Kessler and Mordechai Kessler – both awarded OBEs for their services to Industry in North West England.</h3>

<h3>Maggie and Mottie Kessler, OBE, said:</h3>

<p>“As co-founders, we are honoured that this award recognises our continued growth and investment in science, the tireless efforts of our key worker teams, and the vital importance of the UK’s Science Industry. DIT are key partners in our success. With a British HQ, 8 UK sites and 9 international subsidiaries, DIT has helped us reach over 90 export countries and has helped navigate our international journey to bring the magic of chemistry worldwide.”</p>

<h3>Sanjay Vadera – awarded an MBE for his services to International Trade and Exports.</h3>

<p>Sanjay’s innovative growth strategy and commitment to exporting is demonstrated through his role as CEO of The Fragrance Shop, the UK’s largest independent fragrance retailer. His vision aligns with the Government’s ambition to promote trade and investment and serves as an inspiration to other UK companies, especially those from the private sector, to expand beyond the UK and promoting a global, outward looking Britain.</p>

<h3>Sanjay Vadera, MBE, said:</h3>

<p>“I am absolutely thrilled but my true first thoughts related to my team and my customers; everything that happens is a result of a collaborative effort, fuelled by a vision, driven by passion, simplicity and innovation.&nbsp; We want to find a fragrance suitable for everyone, that sparks the emotions, it gives back like we do!&nbsp; This honour makes me even more determined to ‘spray a little happiness’, for my team, my customers, my brand partners and the charities we support”.</p>
