  <li>Deal means the UK has now secured early access to over 400 million total doses of vaccines for 2021 and 2022</li>
  <li>100 million doses of Valneva vaccine have now been secured</li>
  <li>UK Government boosts Scotland vaccine production powerhouse at Valneva’s site in West Lothian, supporting 100 highly-skilled jobs</li>
</ul>

<p>The UK Government has today (Monday 1 February) signed a deal for a further 40 million doses of Valneva’s promising vaccine candidate.</p>

<p>The latest deal will bolster long-term vaccine production in Scotland and brings the total UK vaccine portfolio to 407 million doses over the next two years.</p>

<p>The decision to purchase 40 million extra doses is based on the UK’s strategy to take a wide approach, using different technologies and viral targets to ensure the UK has the best chance of securing access to successful vaccines as quickly as possible. It will also give the UK future flexibility should we need to revaccinate any of the population.</p>

<p>The UK Government has invested a multi-million sum in Valneva’s manufacturing facility in West Lothian, which <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/large-scale-coronavirus-vaccine-manufacturing-begins-in-scotland" class="govuk-link">began manufacturing</a> vaccine doses last week and is already raising Scotland’s profile in the international fight against Covid-19.</p>

<p>The site is already supporting 100 new highly-skilled local jobs for scientists and technicians.</p>

<p>Valneva’s coronavirus vaccine candidate is currently in phase I/II trials and will still need to meet the necessary safety and effectiveness standards and receive regulatory approval from the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) before it is rolled out at the end of the year.</p>

<p>However, if it is approved, manufacturing at risk now will mean that the UK can roll the vaccine out across the country quicker.</p>

<p>Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This latest deal is yet another weapon in our national arsenal against this terrible disease,
and will ensure we have sufficient supplies to protect the British public in 2021 and
beyond.</p>

  <p>Backed with major investment from the UK Government, Valneva’s site in Scotland will be
a vaccine production powerhouse, working flat out to ensure we can quickly deploy jabs
across the UK if their candidate is approved, while supporting top quality, local jobs.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Thanks to our incredible UK Vaccine Taskforce, we have now secured a bumper portfolio
of over 400 million vaccines, putting our country in an exceptionally strong position to
defeat this virus once and for all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This deal provides a further boost to the UK’s already-strong vaccine portfolio, and I am
enormously proud of all the work which has gone in to securing a vaccine for the UK as
soon as possible.</p>

  <p>If approved, Valneva’s vaccine will not only help tackle Covid-19 here in the UK, but aid our
mission to ensure there is a fair supply of vaccines across the globe.</p>

  <p class="last-child">No one is safe till the whole world is safe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Secretary of State for Scotland Alister Jack said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This deal is an endorsement of the UK Government’s strategy of investing in vaccine
development and in the skills of the Scottish life sciences sector.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I pay tribute to the team in Valneva’s new Livingston manufacturing plant.  If the vaccine is
authorised by the health regulator, their expertise will play an important role in making the
world safer from this virus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The UK has developed and invested in some of the world’s most promising vaccines -
supporting global efforts to fight this virus.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The Valneva vaccine showcases the best of Scottish expertise right at the heart of our UK
vaccine endeavour, demonstrating the strength of our union and what the UK can achieve
when it works together. If the vaccine is authorised by the health regulator, it will be rolled
out across the four nations as quickly as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interim Chair of the UK government’s Vaccines Taskforce Clive Dix said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Valneva’s manufacturing site in Scotland is already up and running, ready to supply their
promising vaccine as soon as it has proven to be safe, and effective and is approved by
the MHRA.</p>

  <p>To best ensure we have enough successful candidates to ensure maximum coverage of
the UK population, the Vaccines Taskforce has invested in seven of the most promising
vaccines. The further 40 million doses secured through today’s deal significantly bolsters
our portfolio and gives us future flexibility should we need to revaccinate any of the UK
population.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I want to thank everyone involved in the development of this vaccine  for the hard work
that has helped us reach this point and also to pay tribute to those UK citizens who have
volunteered to take part in the important clinical trials of this vaccine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it is approved, 60 million doses could start to be delivered to the UK by the second half of 2021, with the remaining 40 million being delivered in 2022.</p>

<p>Valneva’s Livingston site will have the capacity to produce up to 250 million doses annually for shipment across the UK and around the world.</p>

<p>The UK Government is committed to supporting equitable access to vaccines worldwide. The UK is the largest donor to the COVAX facility, the global mechanism to help developing countries access a coronavirus vaccine, and has committed £548 million in UK aid to help distribute 1.3 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines to 92 developing countries this year.</p>

<p>To date, the UK government has invested over £300 million into manufacturing a successful vaccine.</p>
