  <li>Projects could secure&nbsp;more than 550 jobs, spur growth across the country and save nearly 27.6 million tonnes of carbon emissions</li>
  <li>Further 19 studies receiving funding could one day secure UK lithium production, fast charging technology and a UK-based battery recycling facility</li>

<p>Electric motorcycles and an all-terrain, 4x4 electric delivery truck designed for emerging markets are among the projects benefiting from more than £43 million of government and industry funding to help develop the latest green automotive technology, while seizing on the economic opportunities of the global transition to cleaner transport.</p>

<p>The 2 projects have been awarded funding through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.apcuk.co.uk" rel="external">Advanced Propulsion Centre (<abbr title="Advanced Propulsion Centre">APC</abbr>)</a> Collaborative Research and Development competition, which supports the development of innovative low carbon automotive technology and will help propel the UK in the global race to secure electric vehicle supply chains. The projects are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Project Zero Emission Norton</strong>, Solihull, West Midlands – £17.2 million (£8.5m funding through the <abbr title="Advanced Propulsion Centre">APC</abbr>) to develop an electric motorbike that delivers a high level of race performance and touring range, not only enhancing workforce capabilities and securing local jobs, but helping to strengthen the UK’s competitive supply chain</li>
  <li>
<strong>OX Delivers <abbr title="Clean Logistics for Emerging African Nations">CLEAN</abbr> (Clean Logistics for Emerging African Nations)</strong>, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire – £17.1 million (£8.5m funding through the <abbr title="Advanced Propulsion Centre">APC</abbr>) to develop an all-terrain electric delivery truck designed for emerging markets and manufactured in the UK that can withstand tough off-road conditions by using long-life, lower cost batteries</li>
</ul>

<p>The projects are set to secure more than 550 jobs and save 27.6 million tonnes of <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> - the equivalent of removing the lifetime emissions of 1.1 million cars from the road.</p>

<p>Minister for Investment Lord Grimstone said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This funding, delivered through the government-backed Advanced Propulsion Centre, will support UK businesses at the cutting edge of the automotive industry to trial the very latest tech, from the development of electric motorbikes to off-road trucks.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Supporting these strategically important technologies lays the path for our electric vehicle sector to compete on a global scale, driving jobs and growth nationwide whilst also creating cleaner, more sustainable modes of transport.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition, 19 early-stage proposals that could bolster the UK electric vehicle supply chain have also been awarded funding to research, prove or enhance the case for their scale up, with the potential to create further jobs throughout the country.</p>

<p>The feasibility studies will be backed with £9.4 million in matched government-industry money through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.apcuk.co.uk/automotive-transformation-fund/" rel="external">Automotive Transformation Fund (<abbr title="Automotive Transformation Fund">ATF</abbr>)</a>. Areas to be investigated include the development of <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> battery components and the viability of using UK-sourced critical minerals.</p>

<p>Studies awarded funding today include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Livista Energy Limited, London - Investigating building Europe’s first standalone lithium refining facility capable of producing battery grade lithium</li>
  <li>Nyobolt Ltd, Cambridge - Assessing scale up of the manufacture of high-power battery technology that enables ultra-fast charging without sacrificing the battery’s lifetime or safety</li>
  <li>LTS Transport Solutions, Queenborough - Exploring the potential of opening a brand-new electric vehicle battery recycling plant in the UK by 2024</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Automotive Transformation Fund">ATF</abbr> was created to accelerate the development of an electric vehicle supply chain, enabling UK-based manufacturers to scale up production in strategically important technologies. The <abbr title="Automotive Transformation Fund">ATF</abbr> is delivered by the <abbr title="Advanced Propulsion Centre">APC</abbr> to support capital and late-stage R&amp;D investments.</p>

<p>Ian Constance Chief Executive at the <abbr title="Advanced Propulsion Centre">APC</abbr> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The projects receiving today’s investment highlight the breadth of technologies needed to help the UK accelerate to net zero emissions. They’re reimagining not just vehicles, but transport in general.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Notes to editors</h2>

<p>This is the nineteenth round of funding coordinated by the Advanced Propulsion Centre (<abbr title="Advanced Propulsion Centre">APC</abbr>) which supports the development of low carbon emission technologies for cars, buses, heavy goods vehicles, and vans. These projects will help further the UK’s ongoing efforts to develop a sustainable supply chain for manufacturing electric vehicles by 2026.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Automotive Transformation Fund">ATF</abbr> funding awards for 6-month projects</h3>

<p>It also includes 19 <abbr title="Automotive Transformation Fund">ATF</abbr> funding awards for 6-month projects that will look to research, prove or enhance the business case for scaling up automotive manufacturing or identify where the UK may have a gap to guide a commercial investment strategy. These projects include:</p>

<h4>Batteries Anode</h4>

<p>Deregallera Ltd – Cardiff, Wales: The <abbr title="Advanced Propulsion Centre">APC</abbr> forecast a significant deficit in locally manufactured anode material over the next decade and Deregallera stand poised to exploit this opportunity by moving to manufacture their sodium-ion anode material at scale in the UK. Large scale investment in chemical plant comes with a high level of risk, that this project reduces by exploring ways to expand the top-down and bottom-up parameters on production quantities, identifying the optimum size of the chemical plant and extending the existing techno-economic study out to 10,000 tonnes-per-annum production.</p>

<p>Echion Technologies – Cambridge, England: Project SHARP (Sprinting towards High-value Anode Roadmap for large-scale UK Production)&nbsp;feasibility study will inform Echion’s high volume anode manufacturing strategy and prepare a roadmap and business case to grow the UK battery manufacturing supply chain and secure the UK’s international competitiveness in the field of advanced battery materials production.</p>

<p>Nyobolt Ltd – Cambridge, England: In this project Nyobolt are defining the requirements for a large-scale manufacturing facility to produce their high-power battery technology for the automotive sector which enables ultra-fast charging without sacrificing lifetime or safety.</p>
