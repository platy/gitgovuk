<p>DVLA is urging drivers aged 70 and over to keep their money in their pocket this Christmas, after the agency revealed that more than 800 drivers had notified them about third-party websites charging hefty premiums for their services.</p>

<p>Many of these sites appear high up in the results on a Google search, resulting in scores of drivers inadvertently using a third-party website, when they believe they are dealing with DVLA. The agency is reminding drivers to always use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-driving-licence-at-70">GOV.UK</a>, the official government website, to prevent being charged additional fees.</p>

<p>New figures released today show that in the last 12 months, DVLA received notifications from 803 drivers who unnecessarily parted with money to renew their driving licence at 70 years old through a third party website. Some of these sites charge up to £81 handling fee, which is £20 more than the cost of a typical weekly family shop.</p>

<p>Third party websites charge a fee to pass a driver’s application to DVLA, but these sites are not affiliated with DVLA, and applications made through third party websites will not be processed any quicker than those made through <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-driving-licence-at-70" class="govuk-link">GOV.UK</a>. This is the only place to access DVLA’s online services where you can be guaranteed not to be charged additional fees on top of any statutory fees that may apply.</p>

<p>Julie Lennard, DVLA Chief Executive said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Drivers looking to renew their licence at 70 and over should use our online service which is secure, free of charge, and also the quickest and easiest way to transact with DVLA. Customers usually receive their driving licence in just 5 days.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Always remember to always use GOV.UK when using any of DVLA’s many online services.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When a driver reaches their 70th birthday, they must renew their entitlement to drive every 3 years. DVLA reminds drivers 90 days before their licence is due to expire, and the quickest and easiest way to renew a licence is to go to GOV.UK where the service is quick, easy to use, available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and is free of charge.</p>

  <li>To renew a driving licence at 70 online or find out more about renewing a licence visit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-driving-licence-at-70">Renew your driving licence if you’re 70 or over</a>
</li>
  <li>When we become aware of sites misleading motorists, we work closely with other government agencies and Netcraft to raise the issue. If we believe a website is operating outside the advertising guidelines we’ll inform the relevant enforcement and controlling bodies. This includes OFCOM or Phone Paid Service Authority (PSA), as well as eBay and Google directly in some instances, to have content removed. Our reporting has seen numerous sites taken down in recent years.</li>
  <li>To renew online, drivers will need to have a valid UK passport and provide addresses of where they’ve lived over the last 3 years. For DVLA to retrieve the photograph from HM Passport Office the customer will need to provide their passport number. If DVLA can retrieve the photograph this can be used to renew the licence. There’s no need to send in original documents.</li>
  <li>Drivers who apply online can expect their licence to be issued within 5 working days, although more complex transactions, including those where medical investigations need to take place, may take longer. Customers can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/track-your-driving-licence-application" class="govuk-link">track the progress of their licence application</a>
