<p>During the pandemic, Working Tax Credit customers have not needed to tell <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> about temporary short-term reductions in their working hours as a result of coronavirus - for example if they were working fewer hours or were furloughed. It is one of several measures <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> introduced to help those facing uncertainty around their hours.</p>

<p>If a Working Tax Credit customer’s hours temporarily fell because of coronavirus, they have been treated as if they were working their normal hours.</p>

<p>Customers do not need to tell <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> if they re-establish their normal working hours before 25 November 2021, but from then, they must do within the usual one-month window if they are not back to working their normal hours shown in their Working Tax Credit claim.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/myrtle-lloyd">Myrtle Lloyd</a>, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Director General for Customer Services, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We introduced this measure last year to help support working families. It is vital that Working Tax Credit claimants who have benefitted from it update <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> with their working hours if they have reduced, and they won’t return to their normal level before 25 November.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Anyone who is no longer eligible for Working Tax Credit due to a change in their circumstances may be able to apply for other UK Government support, including Universal Credit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Customers should continue to tell <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> about any permanent changes to their circumstances within one month – for example if they are made redundant, lose their job or their hours change permanently during this time.</p>

<p>This will ensure only those who are entitled to tax credits receive them, otherwise those ineligible or due a lower rate of payment will have to pay them back later.</p>

<p>Any changes can be <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/changes-affect-tax-credits">easily reported online on GOV.UK</a>, where customers can also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/manage-your-tax-credits" class="govuk-link">check their current Working Tax Credit claim details</a>.</p>

<p>If customers receive tax credits they are not entitled to as a result of a change they will need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-credits-overpayments/repay-your-tax-credits" class="govuk-link">repay this money</a> and may also have to pay a penalty if they do not let us know within one month.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is also reminding claimants that Post Office card accounts are closing. From 30 November 2021 <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will stop making payments of Child Benefit, Guardians Allowance and tax credits into Post Office card accounts.</p>

<p>Child Benefit and tax credits customers who use Post Office card accounts to receive their payments will need to notify <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> of their new bank, building society or credit union account details. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is encouraging customers to act now so they do not miss any payments once their Post Office account closes. They can contact <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s helplines (0345 300 3900 for tax credits or 0300 200 3100 for Child Benefit) or use their Personal Tax Account.</p>
