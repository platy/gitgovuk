<p>On Sunday 13 September Abdul Munim Khan, 29, of Shadwell, was on his way to work in the City of London when he noticed a woman standing on the pavement in distress. Abdul saw that nobody was stopping to help her and went over to check if she was okay.</p>

<p>The woman told Abdul she was giving birth but wasn’t sure she could make it to the hospital in time. He immediately called an ambulance and was told it would take them up to 20 minutes to arrive.</p>

<p>Abdul, who has been a security officer at 52 Lime Street (The Scapel, skyscaper building) for two and a half years, stayed on the phone to the paramedics. They gave him instructions as to how to help the woman safely deliver her baby. Without hesitation Abdul pulled up his work shirt sleeves and delivered the baby on the pavement with the help of another passer-by.</p>

<p>When the ambulance arrived, the paramedics cut the umbilical cord and took the woman and her baby to hospital. Before they left, both the woman who had given birth and the paramedics thanked Abdul for his heroic and selfless action.</p>

<p>After this Abdul headed to work and arrived on time to do his 12-hour shift. He works for Axis Security Services Limited​, an SIA approved contractor.</p>

<p>When we spoke to Abdul he said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I think back on what happened, I can’t believe it. I’ve never experienced anything like that before. She was maybe 10 minutes from the Royal London Hospital - I’m glad I was there to help her.</p>

  <p class="last-child">What was amazing is that when I had finished my shift and was heading home, I saw her just outside the hospital. She called me over and thanked me again – but what was really special is that I was able to meet the baby I had delivered. I also got a short video clip of the mum and her new-born.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ian Todd, our Chief Executive, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">It’s important to remember that many in the security industry are working as critical and key workers during this emergency. Abdul’s story is testament to the fact that despite the challenges, many operatives and businesses are going the extra mile to serve their communities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are promoting the industry’s dedication and commitment through the #SIAHeroes campaign. It is sharing inspiring stories of security operatives who are keeping the public safe and secure at this critical time.</p>
