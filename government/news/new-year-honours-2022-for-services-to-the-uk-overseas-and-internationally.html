  <li>The Queen’s New Year Honours has recognised 122 people for their exceptional service to the UK overseas or internationally</li>
  <li>awards recognise extraordinary people across a range of fields, this year including achievements made by Brits around the world to combat COVID-19</li>
  <li>actor Daniel Craig and songwriter Bernie Taupin among this year’s recipients</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-year-honours-2022-overseas-and-international-list">The Overseas and International New Year 2022 Honours List</a> has been published today, recognising 122 extraordinary people for their services to the United Kingdom and its Overseas Territories. These include contributions made across business, charity, culture, development, education, foreign policy, health, security and sport.</p>

<p>Among those receiving awards this year is actor Daniel Craig, who achieved worldwide fame for playing the role of James Bond. He receives a <abbr title="Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George">CMG</abbr>, the same award that his fictional character possessed, in recognition of his outstanding contribution to film.</p>

<p>Songwriter Bernie Taupin, best known for his long-term collaboration with Sir Elton John, is awarded a <abbr title="Commander of the Order of the British Empire">CBE</abbr> for his exceptional services to music.</p>

<p>This year awards recognise a number of extraordinary achievements made by British nationals who have supported the global fight against COVID-19. Among these are Rod MacKenzie, the Chief Development Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Product Development at Pfizer, Sean Marrett, the Chief Business and Commercial Officer at BioNtech and Melanie Ivarrson, the Chief Development Officer at Moderna for their services to support vaccine development and distribution. Honours are also awarded to those who have given exceptional support to British Nationals overseas during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Sir Philip Barton, Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office and Head of the Diplomatic Service, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I congratulate everyone receiving an honour and thank them for their hard work and years of service. The UK’s impact around the world depends on exceptional people like those recognised in this year’s Queen’s New Year Honours. We are grateful for their outstanding contribution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recipients from this year’s honours list include:</p>

<h2>Robert Stringer</h2>

<p>Chairman, Sony Music Group and Chief Executive Officer, Sony Music Entertainment, receives a <abbr title="Commander of the Order of the British Empire">CBE</abbr> for services to UK creative industries, to social justice and to charity.</p>

<p>Rob Stringer is recognised for an exceptional and sustained contribution to the British music business as well as charity causes and tackling discrimination. A transformational figure in the British music business for over 4 decades, having worked his way through the ranks at Sony, he has nurtured exceptional talent, consistently championed British artists and the British creative industries across the globe and worked tirelessly to support artists from diverse backgrounds.</p>

<p>His recent initiative to tackle racism and social injustice with a £75 million Sony Music fund, which has directly benefitted UK charities working to foster equal rights and help address structural inequality, is recognised as an industry leading model.</p>

<h2>Dr Mary Cusack and Dr Catherine Morris</h2>

<p>Paediatricians, Love the One charity, India, both receive an <abbr title="Officer of the Order of the British Empire">OBE</abbr> for services to Healthcare and Child Welfare in India.</p>

<p>Mary Cusack and Catherine Morris are recognised for their outstanding contribution to vulnerable children and their families in India. Dr Cusack and Dr Morris are former National Health Service Paediatricians. Fifteen years ago, after completing a Diploma in Tropical Medicine &amp; Hygiene at the University of Liverpool together, they took a decision to travel to India with a mission to bring health security, education and advocacy to some of the most deprived and vulnerable children in the country.</p>

<p>After 5 years working with Non-Governmental Organisations and familiarising themselves with Indian culture and tropical medicine on the front line, Dr Cusack and Dr Morris established the Love the One organisation in Berhampur, Odisha. Through their inspirational vision and dedication they have created an integrated community ecosystem comprising of a children’s centre, clinic, 6 early paediatric interventional care centres and a school. Through their work, they have saved and transformed lives and delivered hope through selfless voluntary service and brought great credit to the UK.</p>

<p>On learning of their awards, May Cusack and Catherine Morris said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We are completely shocked and totally humbled to be awarded an <abbr title="Officer of the Order of the British Empire">OBE</abbr>. It is such an honour and we accept this gratefully on behalf of our team that we work with here in Odisha, India, without whom we could not realise the dream of providing health, education and childcare to some of India’s poorest children.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Melvyn Tennant</h2>

<p>Founder/Director of the Oracabessa Bay Sea Turtle Project and Lead Warden, Jamaica, receives an <abbr title="Member of the Order of the British Empire">MBE</abbr> for services to Marine Conservation in Jamaica.</p>

<p>Melvyn Tennant is recognised for an exceptional and long-term contribution to marine conservation in Jamaica. After originally moving to Jamaica to retire in 2003, Melvyn Tennant quickly became aware of the precarious position of turtles on the beach near to his house that were being killed and their eggs stolen. With little support at the time and no previous background in conservation, Mr Tennant decided to take action to protect the turtles and thus the Oracabessa Bay Sea Turtle Project was founded in 2005.</p>

<p>He has since spent the last 16 years educating people as well as confronting poachers to ensure the safety of sea turtles on the beach he now calls home. During the nesting season, he and his team keep a vigilant watch on the beach. Their daily patrols both at night and in the day have helped increase the number of turtle eggs hatching from 37% in 2005 to over 80% today. Each year the project releases around 18,000 critically endangered Hawksbill sea turtles and attracts many thousands of visitors to watch the releases. His work has now expanded and successfully partnered with other conservation projects in the area and with the Jamaican government to promote and preserve the Jamaican coastline and marine environment.</p>

<p>On learning on his award, Melvyn Tennant said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">When I retired from teaching to live in Jamaica the very last thing I thought that I would do is rescue sea turtles. I am grateful for the recognition of the award both for myself and my team and the support given by National Environment Planning Agency that oversee the government response to biodiversity and marine conservation.</p>

<h2>Shirley Wrigglesworth</h2>

<p>Welfare Officer/co-ordinator, The British Association of the Alpes Maritimes and the Var, receives a British Empire Medal (BEM) for services to British Community in South-East France.</p>

<p>Shirley Wrigglesworth is recognised for an outstanding voluntary contribution in support of the British Community in South-East France. She joined the British Association of the Alpes Maritimes and Var over 15 years ago and soon took on the key role of Welfare Co-ordinator for British Association Var.</p>

<p>During her long service within the organisation, Mrs Wrigglesworth has provided crucial and wide-ranging support to members of the British community in times of need, including finding local temporary accommodation for British families in difficult times, arranging financial assistance, and assisting family members living abroad, in dealing with the organisation of funerals of British Nationals who die in France.  Currently working with Riviera Lifeline, Mrs Wrigglesworth also assists other groups helping the British community such as liaising with SunnyBank Association to provide access to accommodation for the elderly.</p>

<p>On learning of her award, Shirley Wrigglesworth said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Surprised, delighted and very honoured to receive the award. I would also say that I have not worked on my own and there are lots of people who have assisted me in making everything happen.  I consider that it is for them also. With special thanks to my husband, Mike.</p>
