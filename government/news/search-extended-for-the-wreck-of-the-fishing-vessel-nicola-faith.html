<p>The <abbr title="Marine Accident Investigation Branch">MAIB</abbr> will extend the search for the fishing vessel Nicola Faith, which went missing off the coast of Colwyn Bay on 27 January. Although three bodies have been recently found, which are thought to be the crew of Nicola Faith, the <abbr title="Marine Accident Investigation Branch">MAIB</abbr> is keen to find the wreck to understand the causes and circumstances of the sinking.</p>

<p>With poor weather forecast in the coming days, additional search assets with enhanced capability will be deployed over the weekend, with plans to continue once the weather improves. In addition, the search area planned to be covered has been expanded.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Marine Accident Investigation Branch">MAIB</abbr>, which has been co-ordinating the search effort, is extremely grateful to Natural Resources Wales which has volunteered their sonar equipment and additional technical expertise to the search. <abbr title="Marine Accident Investigation Branch">MAIB</abbr> is also in discussion with Welsh Government about the use of the Rhodri Morgan, one of their fishery patrol vessels. 
Tomorrow the search will also be joined by David Mearns, whose participation has been paid for by a crowdfunding campaign led by the families. <abbr title="Marine Accident Investigation Branch">MAIB</abbr> has shared detailed information with David Mearns about the most likely areas the vessel could be found to ensure the best use of this extra resource.</p>

<p>Andrew Moll, Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This was a truly tragic accident which has left a community with many unanswered questions. I and my colleagues at the <abbr title="Marine Accident Investigation Branch">MAIB</abbr> share their urgent need for answers and to fully understand what went wrong. The search effort continues with renewed vigour this weekend and we are pleased that David Mearns has joined this effort.</p>

  <p class="last-child">To date more than 30 square miles of seabed have been searched using specialist equipment. We have been able to identify the vessel’s primary operating area and this has been searched with a considerable amount of overlap. The specialist equipment that is being used is extremely sensitive and the search has been hampered by poor weather in recent weeks. We remain hopeful that this immense effort will bring news the families hope for very soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Earlier this month the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/life-raft-for-missing-fishing-vessel-nicola-faith-recovered" class="govuk-link">vessel’s liferaft was found off the coast of Kirkcudbrightshire</a> by HM Coastguard and was identified by the <abbr title="Marine Accident Investigation Branch">MAIB</abbr> as being from the Nicola Faith.</p>

<p>The families have been kept fully updated on the search.</p>
