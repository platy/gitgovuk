<p>The winners of the inaugural International Space Pitch Day were today announced marking several world firsts.</p>

<p>Ten tech start-ups successfully secured same-day contracts worth up to £53,000 ($66,000) to fast-track the development of their innovations after pitching direct to UK, US and NATO military leaders.</p>

<p>Air Vice-Marshal Harvey Smyth, UK Director Space, unveiled the winners following an afternoon of pitches in front of a global audience during the first day of the Defence Space Conference hosted from London.</p>

<p>It is the first time two nations anywhere in the world have come together to award defence contracts based around a pitch-style event, similar to Dragon’s Den/Shark Tank.</p>

<p>It is also the first time two nations have awarded joint defence innovation contracts to an overseas-based enterprise in this way.</p>

<p>And it is the first time same-day contracts have been awarded in this way to industry by the UK Ministry of Defence.</p>

<p>Air Vice-Marshal Smyth said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Congratulations to the winners and all those that took part in the first International Space Pitch Day – it has captured the imagination of innovators and militaries not just across the UK and US, but all over the world.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It has achieved several world firsts and we look forward to building on its success as we seek to fast-track innovation and cutting-edge technology to the front line quicker than ever before with fresh ways of working with industry to make sure we stay ahead of our shared adversaries and the threats they pose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Will Roper, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pitch Days open the government’s aperture to work with commercially-focused companies.</p>

  <p>Competing for technology outside of our fence lines has been a major U.S. Air Force and Space Force theme. Partnering with our allies to compete globally is the natural evolution.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Space is especially exciting with so many ideas brought to the table by these firms, and I’m confident international space cooperation has a bright future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gary Aitkenhead, Dstl chief executive, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>International Space Pitch Day represents an innovative way of working, ensuring that UK and US Defence are able to keep up with the rapid pace of commercial technology development.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We aim to connect world-class space innovation to military end-users at pace, supported by business and commercialisation training.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The winning companies are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>114 AI Innovation Ltd (India)</li>
  <li>Clearbox Systems Pty Ltd (Australia)</li>
  <li>Clutch Space Systems Ltd (UK)</li>

<p>Fifteen proposals from tech start-ups and innovators battled it out to win funding by pitching to UK, US and NATO military leaders after being selected to take part in International Space Pitch Day from scores of entries from across the world.</p>

<h4 id="notes-to-editors">Notes to editors:</h4>

<p>International Space Pitch Day is a joint UK-US initiative that aims to find, fund and fast-track innovation and technology that gives advantage to military personnel and operations in the space domain.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/competition-international-space-pitch-day" class="govuk-link">The competition</a> was open to innovators and entrepreneurs from all over the world delivered through the UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-and-security-accelerator" class="govuk-link">Defence and Security Accelerator (DASA)</a>, assisted by <a rel="external" href="https://starburst.aero/" class="govuk-link">Starburst Accelerator</a>.</p>

<p>It is specifically designed to bolster tech start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and harness the power of their ingenuity and innovation.</p>

<p>The endeavour is jointly funded by the UK’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-science-and-technology-laboratory" class="govuk-link">Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl)</a>, <a rel="external" href="https://www.raf.mod.uk" class="govuk-link">Royal Air Force</a> and the <a rel="external" href="https://www.airforce.com/" class="govuk-link">US Air Force</a>.</p>

<p>A grand coalition of Dstl, DASA, Royal Air Force, UK Strategic Command, the US Air Force, US Space Force, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) has been assembled to find, fund, and fast-track the best ideas from start-up innovators to the front line.</p>

<p>Starburst Aerospace is acting as an industry partner to the International Space Pitch Day and carry out specialist training and mentoring on its behalf through an Allied Defence Accelerator. More details can be found at the International Space Pitch Day <a rel="external" href="https://intlspacepitchday.com/" class="govuk-link">Virtual Learning Environment</a>.</p>

<p>The format is the first of its kind in an international collaboration between two international allies.</p>
