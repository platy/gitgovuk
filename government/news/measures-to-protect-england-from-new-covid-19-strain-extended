<p>The government has tonight extended measures to prevent the potential spread of a variant strain of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>The government yesterday implemented immigration powers which meant all non-British national or resident travellers who had been in or through Denmark in the last 14 days will now be denied entry upon arrival.</p>

<p>Non-<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> resident <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> drivers have now been added to those restrictions, while all passenger vessels and accompanied freight from Denmark will be halted.</p>

<p>The move follows the release of further information from health authorities in Denmark reporting widespread outbreaks of coronavirus in mink farms, with a variant strain of the virus spreading to some local communities.</p>

<p>Denmark was removed from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-travel-corridors" class="govuk-link">travel corridors list</a> list on Friday. Non-British or resident visitors who had come from or through Denmark were banned from arriving in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> from 4am on Saturday. Anyone who has arrived within the last 2 weeks now needs to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-how-to-self-isolate-when-you-travel-to-the-uk/coronavirus-covid-19-how-to-self-isolate-when-you-travel-to-the-uk" class="govuk-link">self-isolate</a> along with their households for 14 days.</p>

<p>Given the significant unknowns regarding the new mutation of COVID-19 originating in Denmark we have moved quickly to protect our citizens and prevent the spread of the virus to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> government is working closely with international partners to understand the changes in the virus that have been reported in Denmark and we are conducting a programme of further research here in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to inform our risk assessments.</p>

<p>British Nationals and residents who are returning from Denmark will be required to show a complete <a href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk" class="govuk-link">passenger locator form</a> on arrival into the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. This is critical in being able to track the virus in case of any local outbreaks.</p>

<p>Yesterday the Home Office announced they would step up Border Force presence to ensure that those arriving to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> from Denmark were compliant with the new restrictions.</p>

<p>The travel ban and expanded self-isolation requirements will be reviewed after 7days.</p>
