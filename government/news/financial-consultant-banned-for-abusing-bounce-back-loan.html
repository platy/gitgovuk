<p>Eunice Gill Dzodzome (32) was appointed sole director of Reach Alive Limited at the same time the company was incorporated in September 2015.</p>

<p>Trading from premises in Bow, East London, Reach Alive provided financial consultancy services but entered into creditors’ voluntary liquidation in July 2021.</p>

<p>Reach Alive’s insolvency, however, triggered an investigation by the Insolvency Service before investigators uncovered that Eunice Dzodzome had submitted a false Bounce Back Loan application.</p>

<p>To be eligible to claim a Bounce Back Loan, businesses were required to have been trading by 1 March 2020 and continuing to trade when submitting the application.</p>

<p>However, at the time Eunice Dzodzome applied for a bounce back loan on 17 August 2020, Reach Alive was not trading and dormant accounts were filed for the year ending September 2020.</p>

<p>On the application, Eunice Dzodzome stated her company had been trading when it was dormant, while also exaggerating a £200,000 turnover when accounts for the year ending September 2019 revealed turnover was closer to £19,000.</p>

<p>Further enquiries found that Eunice Dzodzome’s company Reach Alive Ltd received a £45,000 Bounce Back Loan of which she transferred £40,000 into her personal account, which she invested in cryptocurrency. Of the remaining loan, £2,000 was paid to Eunice Dzodzome as a director’s loan and £3,000 used as an advance payment towards her company’s liquidation.</p>

<p>Investigators concluded that Eunice Dzodzome breached the conditions of the government-backed loan that should have been used to support the business through the pandemic and not for personal use.</p>

<p>On 12 April 2022, the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy accepted an 11-year disqualification undertaking from Eunice Dzodzome.</p>

<p>Effective from 3 May 2022, Eunice Dzodzome is disqualified from acting as a director of a company and from directly, or indirectly, becoming involved in the promotion, formation or management of a company, without the permission of the court.</p>

<p>Lawrence Zussman, Deputy Head of Insolvent Investigations, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eunice Dzodzome blatantly abused the Government’s bounce back loan, which was meant to provide a vital lifeline to businesses during the pandemic so they could bounce back.</p>

  <p class="last-child">11 years is a substantial amount of time to be removed from the corporate area and the severity of Eunice Dzodzome’s disqualification should serve as a stark warning to others that we will tackle those offenders who think they can abuse their responsibilities and ultimately the taxpayer.</p>
</blockquote>
