<p>The SIA is running the exercise in partnership with Derbyshire Constabulary, Chesterfield Borough Council, D&amp;D Security, Inspirations Theatre Company, and Aruba itself.</p>

<p>The training event at Aruba comprises a series of real-time simulations, involving actors, of possible emergency scenarios. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mass stabbing (gang related knife attack)</li>
  <li>invacuation (external marauding terrorist attack)</li>
  <li>corrosive attack (using the three Rs remove, remove remove)</li>
  <li>suspect package</li>
</ul>

<p>Aruba already has its own emergency planning document and this simulated exercise will strengthen their resilience. The security team from D&amp;D Security has recently completed the brand-new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sia-launches-new-counter-terrorism-e-learning-today">Action Counters Terrorism (ACT) Awareness and Security e-learning</a>.</p>

<p>Paul Fullwood, the SIA’s Director of Inspections and Enforcement, referred to tonight’s emergency planning scenario as a practical application of the ACT Security e-learning. He said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The private security industry has an important role in protecting the public. Security operatives can often be the first on the scene in an incident. This exercise at Aruba will provide a learning environment for door supervisors and nightclub staff to respond to a set of simulated exercises with the support of the emergency services.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He added that the common goal of all of the partners is to ensure that going to a nightclub is as safe as possible for customers and those working at the venue.</p>

<p>The purposes of the exercise are to enhance the public’s confidence in the private security industry at Aruba; to showcase best practice by putting the (You Can) ACT Security e-learning package into practice; to demonstrate partnership working within the community; and to run a series of exercises in a real-time environment.</p>

<p>This emergency planning exercise at Aruba continues work that was started at Buxton in October 2019 by Operation Kea, but which was disrupted by the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>

<p>The security company from the Buxton exercise, Leisure Guard Security, found themselves in a real terrorist attack at Manchester’s Arndale Centre shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>The new Action Counters Terrorism (ACT) Security is specialised training for front line security operatives. The free course was designed by government counter-terrorism experts from the National Counter Terrorism Security Office, the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure and the SIA. The custom-built training provides up-to-date counter-terrorism knowledge to help security professionals prepare for, and respond to, terrorist incidents whilst on duty.</p>
