          <p>The ‘Build the Future’ theme returns for its second year,&nbsp;with over 1,200 events taking place across England to showcase the benefits of apprenticeships.</p>

<p>The week aims to celebrate and promote the fantastic benefits which apprenticeships offer both learners and employers, spotlighting businesses who are investing in this life-changing education route.</p>

<p><strong>Secretary of State for Education, Nadhim Zahawi, said</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apprenticeships offer people of all ages the chance to earn while they learn and build a successful career, while also delivering the skilled workforce this country needs to build back stronger.</p>

  <p>National Apprenticeship Week is a fantastic opportunity to celebrate and recognise the achievements of apprentices, their employers and training providers.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It is great to see so many events and activities happening across the country which I hope will inspire even more people to start their apprenticeship journey.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apprentices are leading the charge in building back stronger from the pandemic with over 40% more people starting apprenticeships in the first quarter of 2021/22 than in the same period 2020/21, which is up again from pre-pandemic levels in 2019.</p>

<p>From delivering life-saving care in hospitals, to helping us deliver the skilled workforce this country needs, apprentices are a cornerstone of the government’s plans to level up the country, with over 5 million people starting apprenticeships since May 2010.</p>

<p><strong>Industry Talent Specialist for Channel 4, Laura Boswell, said</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Apprentices have had an amazing impact across our business and bring a fresh perspective to everything we do here at Channel 4. They really challenge the status quo, and we empower them to do just that!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Annie Cook, the&nbsp;NHS Career development coordinator at NHS Cromer Hospital Norfolk,&nbsp;commented</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apprenticeships are a real win-win for businesses, large and small.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The business, the organisation, and our managers here know the value that someone who has gone through an apprenticeship brings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Jannah, a software engineering degree apprentice at KPMG, said</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My apprenticeship allows me to combine my skills and passion for creativity in the digital sector and I get to earn whilst I learn on the job.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I look forward to talking with businesses, apprentices and training providers as part of the National Apprenticeship Week celebrations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The government is committed to supporting apprenticeships through innovation and increased funding.

Government funding for apprenticeships is set to increase by £170 million to £2.7 billion in 2024-25.</p>
