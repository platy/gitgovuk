<p>The day before Christmas Eve last year brought heartbreak for the local charity, as 18 inches of floodwater poured into their HQ, undoing recent renovations to the building overnight.  Uniforms, office equipment, kitchen amenities and a great deal of the training and sporting equipment were ruined, leaving the cadets’ facility just off the newly built Riverbank Avenue unable to open and in need of significant work.</p>

<p>When Trustees from Newport Sea Cadets put out a call for help, staff at the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> jumped at the chance to offer their assistance, initially offering to donate some surplus chairs and desks from the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> premises in Newport.</p>

<p>But that was just the beginning. When the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> staff members learned the full extent of the damage, they seized the chance to help get the building open again and help restore a degree of normality for the cadets, aged from 10 to 18.</p>

<p>It was then ‘all hands on deck’, as a squad of volunteers from the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> grabbed paint-brushes and donned their overalls, helping make things ship-shape again with a full repaint of the building’s exterior.</p>

<p>With the weather fortunately on their side, the team managed to get the whole job done during just one day in September.</p>

<p>Newport Sea Cadets Group Secretary and Treasurer Ann Bowen said:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>We acquired the building in 1953 and trace our history back to 1900, making us one of the oldest - if not the very oldest - Sea Cadet units in the country. Being run entirely by volunteers, we are totally reliant on our own fundraising to cover the costs of maintaining our building and purchasing equipment for the cadets. It was an enormous effort in the first place to secure the funding we need to carry out our renovations. When we suffered such dreadful damage and losses in the flood, we feared our insurance would never cover all of it. It just couldn’t have come at a worse time.</p>

  <p class="last-child">When the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> first got in touch with the kind offer to donate some old office equipment we were naturally delighted.  But they’ve gone so much further than this, and I cannot begin to thank the volunteers from the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> enough - their efforts have been truly amazing. This work has really transformed the way our building looks, so it’s something we can take pride in again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> says that encouraging staff to embrace local volunteering projects is a central part of what helps make a brilliant place to work. Previous volunteering projects have seen <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> staff carry out litter-picks in and around Newport, helping with conservation work in the Brecon Beacons, and doing work to support the Prince’s Trust.</p>

<p><abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> Chief Executive Tim Moss said:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p class="last-child">This is a great example of a project that will make a real difference to wellbeing within the community. Encouraging our people to get involved in projects such as this one and ‘give something back’ is a big part of helping make the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> a brilliant place to work. I am thrilled to see volunteers from the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> making a such a positive impact, and I’d like to congratulate all our people who came to the aid of Newport Sea Cadets at a time of need.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> staff member Julia Appleby, who volunteered on the project said:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p class="last-child">I am proud to have given something back to the local community and so pleased that I had the chance to do this through my job. We’re all very grateful to Ann and the team at Newport Sea Cadets for keeping us stocked up with cups of tea - I’m pretty sure that helped us manage to smash painting the whole building in one day! I’ll definitely be looking for other opportunities to volunteer through work in the future and will encourage my colleagues to do the same.</p>
</blockquote>
