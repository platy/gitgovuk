  <li>Foreign Secretary Liz Truss to host her counterparts from the world’s leading economies in Liverpool</li>
  <li>Meeting in iconic port city takes place following global summits in Glasgow (COP) and Carbis Bay (G7 Leaders’ Summit) earlier this year</li>
  <li>South-East Asian countries, which are members of ASEAN group, invited to G7 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting for first time</li>
</ul>

<p>The UK will host a summit of Foreign and Development Ministers from the G7 next month in the city of Liverpool.</p>

<p>Foreign Secretary Liz Truss will welcome counterparts from the US, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan and the EU over three days, from Friday 10 until Sunday 12 December. The UK is holding the G7 Presidency in 2021 and this is the second in-person gathering of G7 Foreign Ministers this year, following May’s meeting in London.</p>

<p>Countries from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations will also attend the G7 Foreign Ministers’ meetings for the first time, a sign of the UK’s growing Indo-Pacific tilt. This attendance builds on the May meeting, which included representatives from Australia, India, South Korea and South Africa. These nations collectively represent a broader geographic spread of countries committed to reforming and safeguarding the international order in which economies can flourish.</p>

<p>Foreign and Development Ministers will discuss a range of global issues, including economic resilience post-Covid, global health and human rights.</p>

<p>The holding of the meeting in Liverpool comes after a series of global summits around the UK this year, including the COP climate summit in Glasgow this month, and the G7 Leaders’ Summit hosted by the PM in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, in June.</p>

<p>Liverpool has been chosen due to its history as an iconic port city with a global outlook, strong ties around the world, and a thriving cultural, musical and sporting heritage.</p>

<p>Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said:</p>

<p>“The meeting of G7 Foreign and Development Ministers in Liverpool next month is a fantastic opportunity to showcase the city to the world, highlighting the best of British culture, commerce and creativity. I will be hosting our friends and partners to discuss how we build closer economic, technology and security ties globally and deliver for the British people. I want us to build a worldwide network of liberty that advances freedom, democracy and enterprise and encourages like-minded countries to work together from a position of strength.</p>

<p>“I was deeply saddened by the awful attack in Liverpool this month, but the resolve of the people of this great city will never waver in the face of such atrocities.”</p>

<p>Mayor of Liverpool, Joanne Anderson, said:</p>

<p>“Liverpool is proud to have been chosen to host this global event on behalf of the UK government.</p>

<p>“We are a fitting choice given our cultural significance, musical importance and sporting greatness which attracts visitors from around the world, as well as our scientific and architectural innovation.”</p>

<p>Steve Rotheram, Mayor of the Liverpool City Region said:</p>

<p>“Liverpool is often described as ‘the world in one city’, so I can think of no more fitting city to host the G7 Foreign and Development Ministerial meeting. We are an outward-facing and welcoming region - and nation - known around the world as a global leader in sport, culture, music, heritage and so much more.</p>

<p>“Where we were once leaders of the First Industrial Revolution, we are pioneers of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, leading the world in digital and green innovation. From the recently launched Pandemic Institute to revolutionary projects like HyNet and our own Mersey Tidal Power scheme, there is nowhere that better embodies the best of our country’s past and an exciting vision for the future.</p>

<p>“The eyes of the world will be on the Liverpool City Region during this summit, and we have a fantastic story to tell. While they’re here, I’m sure that the Foreign and Development Ministers and the world’s press – like the many, many tourists we attract every year - won’t be afraid to spend a few pounds in the local economy!”</p>

<p>Assistant Chief Constable Rob Carden, who is the Gold Commander in charge of policing the event, said:</p>

<p>“Merseyside Police is committed to ensuring the safety of the G7 conference delegates and the residents of Merseyside. A robust policing plan has been put in place to ensure that delegates can enjoy the conference and the city during their visit.</p>

<p>“The force will continue to provide an effective and professional policing service across Merseyside during the conference.”</p>

<p>The G7 Foreign Ministers will experience first-hand some of Liverpool’s world-class cultural sites during their visit.</p>

<p>The Museum of Liverpool, on the city’s famous waterfront, will be the main location for the talks.</p>

<p>Among the ASEAN Foreign Ministers due to attend are those from Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, which the Foreign Secretary visited earlier this month.</p>
