<p>The exercise saw the club’s security operatives challenged by four realistic scenarios under the guidance of Leicestershire Police, Leicester Fire and Rescue Service, and National Counter Terrorism Security Office. The initiative, which is part of the UK-wide Operation SENTRY, was led by the Security Industry Authority (SIA). Its purpose is to ensure preparedness in the unlikely event of a mass casualty event at a Leicester club.</p>

<p>The emergency exercise is designed for front line security operatives to enable them to put into practice <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.protectuk.police.uk/group/2" rel="external">ACT Awareness e-learning</a> as well as the newer <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ct.protectuk.police.uk/sia" rel="external">ACT Security e-learning</a>. This free e-learning course was designed by government counter-terrorism experts from the National Counter Terrorism Security Office, the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure and the SIA. The custom-built training provides up-to-date counter-terrorism knowledge to help security professionals prepare for and respond to terrorist incidents whilst on duty. The counter-terrorism e-learning features specific drills that were showcased yesterday:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mass stabbing (gang related knife attack)</li>
  <li>a marauding terrorist attack taking place outside the club</li>
  <li>acid attack</li>
  <li>a suspect package</li>
</ul>

<p>This event is aimed to strengthen the resilience of Mosh Nightclub staff and to enable them to test their emergency plan.</p>

<p>Ronnie Megaughin, Head of Compliance and Inspections, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Putting Mosh Nightclub’s security operatives into realistic terror scenarios is one of the best ways to prepare them in the event of a real-life incident. Security operatives may be the first people on the scene in an incident. Yesterday’s staged terror incidents enabled security operatives to take part and deal with the scenario, and then receive an instant debrief from counter-terror experts. We know from experience that operatives, and their managers, really appreciate what they learn from these events and find them worth their while. Any of these security staff could find themselves as the first responder at a serious incident, and this exercise could literally be the difference between life and death.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Inderjit Singh, the SIA’s Regional Investigator for the East Region, who is leading on the event, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We’re really pleased with the commitment that Mosh’s security staff put into yesterday’s exercise . The main aim of exercises like this is to enhance public safety in Leicester’s night-time economy by working with venues and security staff. It’s also to showcase best practice by putting the Action Counters Terrorism (ACT) awareness e-learning package, which we’ve been recommending to all licensed operatives, into practice. I’d like to thank all of our partners and especially Mosh Nightclub for hosting yesterday’s exercises to enhance public protection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The emergency planning exercise at Mosh Nightclub continues a programme of similar exercises and follows on from events in Chesterfield and London in autumn 2021 and Glasgow in April this year. A pilot event took place at Buxton in Derbyshire in October 2019.</p>
