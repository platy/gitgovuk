<p>Following an open competition, the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities has announced that Bernadette Conroy has been selected as the preferred candidate for the post of Chair of the Regulator of Social Housing.</p>

<p>Bernadette Conroy is an experienced Chair and Non-Executive Director (NED) operating across a number of sectors. These include financial services regulation, where she is a NED for the Financial Conduct Authority and housing, where she is Chair of Network Homes. She is also the Independent Chair of the Buildings and Estates Committee of Cambridge University with responsibility for the development and maintenance of the University’s estate and its capital build programme and a NED for Milton Keynes Development Partnerships. Prior to taking on a non-executive portfolio, Bernadette held a number of executive roles in financial services, latterly as Global Head of Strategy and Planning for HSBC Corporate, Investment Banking and Markets. She has an MA in Mathematics from Cambridge University and an MBA from INSEAD. In 2020, Bernadette received the Sunday Times Not for Profit Non-Executive Director of the Year award.</p>

<p>Pre-appointment scrutiny by the select committee will follow at its sitting on 21 March. Following this, the committee will publish their recommendations, which the government will consider before deciding whether to finalise the appointment.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/regulator-of-social-housing">Regulator of Social Housing</a> (RSH) is one of DLUHC’s (Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities) key arm’s length bodies. It seeks to promote a viable, efficient, and well governed social housing sector able to deliver homes that meet a range of needs. The RSH is also responsible for regulation of consumer standards, ensuring that existing tenants are provided with homes that are safe, and that landlords deliver good services.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-charter-for-social-housing-residents-social-housing-white-paper">Charter for social housing residents: social housing white paper</a>, published in November 2020, recognised the fundamental role of effective regulation in protecting and empowering social housing tenants, ensuring that landlords are effectively held to account to deliver the services expected of them.</p>

<p>It set out the government’s commitment to significantly expand the Regulator of Social Housing, legislating to remove the ‘serious detriment’ test (where there is evidence of a standards breach at organisational level) and introduce a new, proactive approach to regulation of consumer issues such as quality of homes, landlord services and transparency, while maintaining robust economic regulation of the sector. Regulation of the social rented sector will also support delivery of the commitment made in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/levelling-up-the-united-kingdom">Levelling Up White Paper</a> to reduce non-decency in the rented sectors by 50%.</p>
