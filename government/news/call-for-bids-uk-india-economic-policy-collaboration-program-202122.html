<h2>Background</h2>

<p>India’s economic growth is critical to strengthening the UK-India bilateral partnership. The UK-India 2030 roadmap highlights the importance of collaboration on new priority economic reform areas.</p>

<p>UK and India conceived the Economic Policy and Prosperity Partnership (EPPP) program in 2016 for a period of five years, with the idea of deepening economic policy cooperation between the two countries. As envisaged during its inception, the partnership has been a comprehensive, demand driven, multi-year relationship whose priorities and outputs have spanned the range of economic policymaking with the objective of a long-term positive impact on India’s growth prospects.</p>

<p>For 2021/22, the UK intends to deliver a program in India that will examine shared economic challenges and provide evidence-based policy inputs on India’s key economic reform areas, to ultimately strengthen UK-India economic cooperation. The programme will focus on economic issues that directly impact UK interests in India. Given new policy priorities that have emerged in the wake of Covid-19, the emphasis will be on evidence based policy advice and engagement with Indian government and key stakeholders in India and the UK.</p>

<h2>Scope of work</h2>

<p>Set against this background, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office in India, invites proposals from think tanks/not for profits to undertake a programme of activities through an accountable grant. The program’s scope of work will involve planning and executing the Economic Policy Collaboration Program between the UK and India. While specific policy areas will be decided at the inception stage with a scope for future changes, indicative areas include, a) Privatization, b) Digital technologies for social and business goods, c) Private Sector Investments, d) New age manufacturing, e) Emerging Technologies.</p>

<p>The delivery will be through policy papers, policy memos, and engagement with various stakeholders to inform and contribute to India’s economic policymaking processes. The Chief Economic Adviser’s office in the Ministry of Finance will be the nodal point for engagement with Government of India. However, involving other economic agents such as Niti Aayog, Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister and subject-specific ministries will be essential. In the broad realm of policy support through evidence, innovative ideas that drive engagement and collaboration with Government of India will determine the success of this program. The following objectives will be essential to achieve:</p>

<h3>Informing policymakers of global best practices</h3>

<p>Deliver a minimum of /3 to 5 policy dialogues engaging Indian policymakers, UK experts, and globally renowned academics to identify and share best practices on pre-identified economic policy themes. The method of delivery needs to be flexible, in consultation with stakeholders involved and through ways that deliver maximum impact.</p>

<h3>Delivering impact through research and training support</h3>

<p>Development and publication of 4-8 novel research reports/ policy memos and briefs. The themes of the policy products along with the timetable for publishing them will be identified at the inception phase. The research products will identify and analyse specific policy issues and ideas in the Indian context. This will also include formulating ways of disseminating research and driving impact through continuous engagement with the Indian establishment.</p>

<h3>Advancing UK-India Economic Policy Engagement</h3>

<p>Contribute to deepening the UK-India economic policy cooperation through a minimum of 4 closed door roundtables/ seminars/ conferences that bring together UK and Indian policymakers, academics and experts. These platforms should be used to present evidence that can shape the economic reforms agenda in India that discuss common shared UK-India economic challenges further deepen economic cooperation between the two countries.</p>

<h2>Timelines</h2>

<p>The bidder is required to deliver phased outputs against set timelines (subject to confirmation).</p>

<p>The duration of this project is likely to be around six months (September 2021 to March 2022).</p>

<h2>Budget</h2>

<p>The budget available for the service is in the range of £ 80,000 to £ 100,000. The service provider should provide quotation for each component separately. Value for Money will be one of the key evaluation criteria.</p>

<p>In line with FCDO’s policy, all journeys by rail or air will be budgeted by a class of travel that is no more than “standard economy” unless higher travel classes are representative of improved value for money or are required to adhere to specific legislation, for example the Equality Act 2010. Your FCDO representative will confirm if this is appropriate and no travel should be booked in a class higher than “standard economy” without express written permission. First class travel will not be permitted under any circumstances. Alcohol and tobacco are not allowable subsistence items. Travel and living expenses will be paid at a rate consistent with the FCDO’s schedule of rates.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>Working independently: Whilst it is expected that the Supplier checks-in with the FCDO at identified key milestones and that visits and meetings may offer the opportunity for representatives FCDO to join the Supplier if appropriate; the Supplier is nevertheless required to complete this project with minimal draw of the FCDO resources (time and personnel).</p>

<p>The successful tenderer should be in a position to commence the implementation by 7th October 2021 and commit to front-loading project activity to ensure a 100% spend of budget by March 2022.</p>

<p>Tenderers should have a clear understanding of India and International institutions including UK in the requested field, and have good contacts with government agencies, research institutions and business.</p>

<p>Tenderers must submit a fully-costed proposal with specific timelines and if the service provider is FCRA compliant.</p>

<p>FCDO requires supplier to have the necessary legal licenses to operate in time for the start of the grant award. For Indian organisations: only apply if you have a valid FCRA.</p>

<p>Supplier should have sufficient financial resilience and a proven track record of transparently and effectively managing donor funded projects of similar scale.</p>

<p>FCDO will conduct a due diligence assessment on the successful potential partner including reviewing safeguarding measures.</p>

<p>The project will be delivered through a Grant Agreement and therefore the organisation cannot profit from the received grant funding. See further <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/official-development-assistance-oda-fco-programme-spend-guidance-and-templates-2017-to-2018">information/guidance</a> on what that agreement might look like.</p>
