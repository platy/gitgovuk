<p>Head of Communications and Public Diplomacy at the BHC, Fouzia Younis along with British Council’s Director Punjab Michael Houlgate attended the event and presented the awards to alumni from UK universities who have made significant business, scientific or social impact on Pakistani communities. The Alumni Awards celebrate the achievements of outstanding Pakistanis who have studied in the UK and are using their education to make a positive impact in Pakistan.</p>

<p>They also distributed certificates to Chevening alumni who participated in the recently concluded Chevening Mentoring Scheme as mentors, helping mentees through a bespoke training programme. The scheme is designed to support women and minorities in law and entrepreneurship, helping them navigate challenges in their respective professions, particularly on gender rights and inclusion.</p>

<p>Head of Communications and Public Diplomacy, British High Commission, Fouzia Younis, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am delighted that the alumni are using their experience from the UK to give back to society in Pakistan and transform lives. Today’s ceremony recognises their outstanding talent and contribution.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I hope more students especially girls and women will join them in the years to come, including through our flagship Chevening scheme.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second phase of the Chevening mentoring scheme, 80% of the mentees were women, including 33% from minorities. The British High Commission has recently added journalism to the mentoring scheme to support talented female journalists.</p>

<p>12 finalists were selected for the Study UK Alumni Awards 2021-22 in Pakistan from more than 1,200 applicants from around the world, for their outstanding achievements as business professionals, entrepreneurs and community leaders, and for their important contribution to strengthening collaborative ties between the UK and Pakistan. Award winners for three award categories: Business and Innovation, Science and Sustainability, and Social Action will be announced at a ceremony in Lahore, and will also be broadcast online on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/BritishCouncilPakistan/" rel="external">Facebook</a>.</p>

<p>The prestigious international award celebrates UK higher education and the achievements of UK alumni all over the world. Now in its eighth year, international UK alumni applied from more than 140 countries, representing alumni from more than 80 per cent of all UK higher education institutions.</p>

<p>Director Punjab of British Council, Michael Houlgate said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The remarkable individuals selected as finalists for the Study UK Alumni Awards in Pakistan have all taken their UK education as a starting point to excel in their chosen careers and shape the world around them. This year’s finalists are testimony not only to the diversity of UK alumni and their endeavours, but also to the transformative impact of a UK education.</p>
