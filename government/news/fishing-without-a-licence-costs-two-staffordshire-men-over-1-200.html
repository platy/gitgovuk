  <li>The pair were fishing without a licence</li>
  <li>Annual fishing licence would have cost just £30 each</li>
</ul>

<p>A fishing day trip to Carney Pools in Bishton, Stafford on 9 May this year for 2 men from Staffordshire has resulted in them each receiving a penalty of £619 for fishing without a licence.</p>

<p>Their cases were brought to Cannock Magistrates Court by the Environment Agency on Tuesday 7 December where 27-year old Jon Hill of Dunbar Close, Stafford and 20-year old Sean Hill of East Holme, Hilderston, Stone were each ordered to pay a total penalty of £619. An annual fishing licence would have cost them just £30 each.</p>

<p>The penalties include a fine of £440 for fishing without a licence contrary to the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act (1975), costs of £135 and a victim surcharge of £44.</p>

<p>Following the verdict, Nichola Tomlinson, Fisheries Enforcement Team Leader for the Environment Agency, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This case shows how seriously the courts take these offences and we hope the high penalty will act as a deterrent to any angler who is thinking of fishing without a licence.</p>

  <p>Fishing illegally can incur a fine of up to £2,500 and offenders can also have their fishing equipment seized. We inspect rod licences throughout the West Midlands and work 24/7, 7 days a week to check on cases of illegal fishing.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Money raised from fishing licence sales is used to protect and improve fish stocks and fisheries, benefitting anglers and, for those caught cheating the system, we will always prosecute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any angler aged 13 or over, fishing on a river, canal or still water needs a licence. A 1-day licence costs from just £6 and an annual licence costs from just £30 (concessions available). Junior licences are free for 13 - 16-year olds. Licences are available from <a href="http://www.gov.uk/get-a-fishing-licence">www.gov.uk/get-a-fishing-licence</a> or by calling the Environment Agency on 0344 800 5386 between 8am and 6pm, Monday to Friday.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency carries out enforcement work all year round and is supported by partners including the police and the Angling Trust. Fisheries enforcement work is intelligence-led, targeting known hot-spots and where illegal fishing is reported.</p>

<p>Anyone with information about illegal fishing activities can contact the Environment Agency incident hotline 24/7 on 0800 80 70 60 or anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
