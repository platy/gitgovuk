        <div class="govspeak">
<p>Today major Japanese global technology services provider NTT Ltd., announces the opening of a new data centre, in Dagenham, East London, expecting to create 100 jobs in a boost to London’s technology sector.</p>

<p>The ‘London 1’ data centre is the latest addition to its growing portfolio, which includes five other data centres in the UK in Hemel Hempstead and Slough. The site is also a location of historic innovation; Winston Churchill benefitted from penicillin developed on the site by May and Baker during World War II, and the famous Ford car factory was adjacent.</p>

<p>London 1 Data Center opens as part of NTT’s ongoing £500 million data centre investment plan and highlights its commitment to the UK’s digital and tech industry.</p>

<p>The Department for International Trade has provided extensive support for the company throughout the investment process, connecting the business with government and providing information on the Technology and Data Centre markets in the UK, skills and training, and smart cities opportunities.</p>

<p>The department will continue to provide support for expansion of NTT Ltd.’s data centre portfolio in the UK as they look to secure additional facilities to meet growing demand.</p>

<p>This investment closely follows the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-japan-comprehensive-economic-partnership-agreement" class="govuk-link">UK-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement</a> agreed in September, which brings together two of the world’s most technologically advanced nations, placing the UK at the forefront of shaping new global standards on digital trade.</p>

<p>It also follows the major investment by US property developer Hackman Capital Partners in a Hollywood-style film production complex in Dagenham – across the road from the London 1 data centre.</p>

<p>Minister for Investment, Gerry Grimstone said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">World-class digital infrastructure projects are fundamental to our wider digital and investment strategies. Businesses are increasingly demanding infrastructure like this to operate innovatively, securely and efficiently.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">NTT’s continued commitment to the UK will help us to build and solidify our reputation as a leader in technological innovation in the industries of the future that will help us build back better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jason Goodall, CEO, NTT Ltd. said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This milestone data center and large investment shows our commitment to the UK market as well as the demand from our customers for sustainable, secure and scalable data centers. We are headquartered in the UK and it is fundamental to our future growth plans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Florian Winkler, CEO of the Global Data Centers EMEA division of NTT Ltd., said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We’re extremely proud to be opening London 1 Data Center and investing in the next era of innovation in Dagenham. UK data centers are a critical enabler of global business and ensure business continuity 365 days a year. The pandemic has demonstrated the vital importance of effective connectivity and reliable infrastructure for businesses to operate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The UK headquartered firm chose Dagenham for the area’s reputation as a digital and media innovation hub and its proximity to the Docklands. The Docklands is already established as the UK’s internet hub and backbone for the global internet network that facilitates the majority of the London Internet Exchange’s (LINX) infrastructure. The new location in Dagenham will more than triple NTT’s UK data centre footprint and be a major boost to the UK’s thriving tech industry.</p>

<p>Cllr Darren Rodwell, Leader of Barking and Dagenham Council said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We’re delighted to welcome London 1 Data Center to our borough. This latest addition will help support East London’s emerging technological industries and provide local jobs focused on digital skills. Today’s announcement will mean Barking and Dagenham will be able to power London’s digital led economy well into the 21st century, building into our vision of a Digital Dagenham.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>London 1 Data Center, when fully operational, will have 25,600 sqm of IT space and a maximum IT load of 64 MW. It will provide businesses with the best possible physical and technical infrastructure supported by N+1 UPS systems, generator backup, as well as highly redundant cooling systems. The data centre also includes a Technology Experience Lab, which will be used to test new technologies and validate hybrid cloud services and innovations faster and at a lower cost.</p>

<p>The data center has been built with sustainability and security in mind. The latest technology removes the need for compressors and refrigerants, which can have a significant impact on global warming. Additionally, the data center will deliver a power usage effectiveness of 1.2, which is aligned with industry best practice; and uses smaller generators to generate fewer greenhouse gases. NTT will only use guaranteed renewable power throughout the site.</p>
