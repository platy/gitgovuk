<p>Dame Glenys Stacey has been selected as the Government’s preferred candidate to become the Chair of the Office for Environmental Protection, Secretary of State George Eustice has confirmed.</p>

<p>Dame Glenys has been selected following a rigorous process which was conducted in accordance with the Ministerial Governance Code on Public Appointments.  A panel of five assessed each of the candidates prior to consideration by the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State has invited both the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee and Environmental Audit Committee to hold a joint pre-appointment hearing and to report on the suitability of Dame Glenys for the post. Pre-appointment scrutiny is an important part of the appointment process for some of the most significant public appointments made by ministers. It is designed to provide an added level of scrutiny, to verify that the recruitment meets the principles <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/governance-code-for-public-appointments" class="govuk-link">set out in the Governance Code on Public Appointments</a>.</p>

<p>Pre-appointment hearings are held in public and allow a Select Committee to take evidence from a minister’s preferred candidate before they are appointed. The Select Committee will then publish a report setting out their views on the candidate’s suitability for the post. Ministers consider the Committee’s views before deciding whether to proceed with the appointment.</p>

<p>All appointments are made on merit and political activity plays no part in the selection process. However, in accordance with the original Nolan recommendations, there is a requirement for appointees’ political activity (if any declared) to be made public. Dame Glenys has not declared any significant political activity in the past five years.</p>
