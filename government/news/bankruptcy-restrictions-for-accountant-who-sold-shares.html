<p>Valerie Culley, 71, of Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, has signed a five-year Bankruptcy Restriction Undertaking after transferring almost £145,000 in shareholdings to an associate whilst insolvent.</p>

<p>Valerie Culley, a former accountant and auditor specialising in tax affairs, was served by a creditor with a statutory demand for almost £346,000 in December 2019 but she failed to pay this within the deadline.</p>

<p>In January 2020 Valerie Culley then transferred £26,000 worth of shares to an associate, less than a week before the creditor issued a bankruptcy petition against her.</p>

<p>Before the first bankruptcy hearing, in April 2020, Valerie Culley then transferred almost £119,000 worth of additional shares in a second company to the same associate.</p>

<p>The bankruptcy petition was heard in August 2020 and a bankruptcy order was made against Valerie Culley. Upon bankruptcy she had liabilities of more than £1.2 million.</p>

<p>Valerie Culley’s bankruptcy triggered an investigation by the Insolvency Service, which discovered the share transfers to the detriment of her creditors.</p>

<p>On 10 May 2021 the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy accepted a five-year bankruptcy restrictions undertaking from Valerie Culley.</p>

<p>Effective immediately, Valerie Culley is under a number of restrictions, including not being able to borrow more than £500 without disclosing her bankrupt status and she cannot act as a company director without the court’s permission.</p>

<p>Kevin Read, Official Receiver at the Insolvency Service, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Valerie Culley knew of the statutory demand and the petition for bankruptcy, and yet still transferred the shares so the funds could not be paid to her creditors.</p>

  <p class="last-child">As a qualified practising accountant, Valerie Culley was in a position of trust and this exacerbated her misconduct.  We will always consider bankruptcy restrictions for those who act in detriment to their creditors and carry out serious misconduct like this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The shareholdings were recovered by the Trustee in Bankruptcy for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate.</p>
