<p>David Wood, Head of the Geography Profession said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">On the 1 December 2021 the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rgs.org/geography/news/2020-and-2021-medals-and-awards-celebration/" rel="external">Royal Geographical Society (with IBG) hosted their annual awards ceremony</a> a slimmed down event at the society and geographers from around the world joining us online.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">It was fantastic to be back at the Society to see leading geographers from all aspects of our discipline receiving their awards for both 2020 and 2021, which were presented by Her Royal Highness, the Princess Royal, the Society’s Patron.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The Government Geography Profession also held our annual GGP awards ceremony last year, where we presented the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://geography.blog.gov.uk/2021/06/21/geography-in-government-awards-mark-an-exceptional-year/" rel="external">winners of our individual categories</a>. This was an opportunity for the overall winners of the Geography in Government Award for the last two years to be presented with their trophy! It was great to spend time with our winners and see them get the recognition they deserved from our wider community, it really did highlight the important work we do and how we are applying the best aspects of our discipline in the design and delivery of government policy.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">My congratulations again to the following nominees from each category:</p>

  <p class="last-child">However I would like to give specific recognition to the winner of the overall <strong>Geography in Government Award</strong> which was shared between the <strong>Public Health England Team and the Data Science Campus from the Office for National Statistics</strong>. Congrats!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">As well as seeing our GGP awards presented, it was fantastic to see one of our Deputy Heads of Geography – <strong>Claire Hadley</strong> – recognised for her lifetime contribution to our discipline when she received a Honorary Fellowship in recognition of outstanding support for the Society and geography. Clare Hadley CGeog (GIS) is Policy and Engagement Manager at Ordnance Survey. Accredited in 2005, Clare has been a Final Assessor for the Chartered Geographer scheme and is now a member of the Society’s Professional Advisory Group.

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">It was also a great honour to be there to see <strong>Dr Rita Gardner</strong> presented with the Society’s highest award, the Gold Medal approved by Her Majesty the Queen. Rita was Director of the RGS-IBG when the Government Geography Profession was formed and has been a massive supporter of the profession and also provided me with personal support and guidance as we grew and established the profession for which I will always be grateful. Rita was also on my interview panel when I applied for the Head of Profession role, so it’s all her fault!</p>
