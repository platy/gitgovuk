<p>The Skills Board will consult with and comprise senior leaders and security professionals from across the industry. Together, they will agree strategic priorities and commit to deliver what is hoped to be transformational change in support of all those working in the industry.</p>

<p>The Board is chaired by Jason Towse, Managing Director of Business Services at Mitie and the vice chair is Gemma Quirke, Chief Operating Officer of Wilson James. It will be managed and administered jointly by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://citysecuritycouncil.co.uk/" rel="external">the CSC</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/sia">the SIA</a>.</p>

<p>Jason Towse, Chair of the Skills Board said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For some time, the need to address the level of skills and competencies has been a common theme discussed throughout the industry. We need to change perceptions about the quality and standard of service we provide, particularly if we wish to attract high calibre people and demonstrate the long-term futures that exist within the industry. With improved continuous learning and professional development structures in place we will not only show the added value of security businesses, but we will confidently and consistently deliver security at a higher level. I firmly believe the industry must drive change from within and we can only do this effectively if we collaborate and all agree how best to set direction.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We want to hear from and include as many views as possible across the private sector security industry, to help us agree the best course of action. As a Skills Board that collectively represents the voice of the industry, we will be strongly placed to influence Government to gain support and funding for the skills development of the private industry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Steve McCormick, the SIA’s Director of Licensing and Standards, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a significant opportunity for the private security industry, and it is exciting to see senior leaders come together to join the skills board and invest their resources in driving forward skills development as part of professionalising the industry. The skills board will help to develop the industry’s capability, capacity and excellence for competency. We will be working with the board to support a strategic approach to skills development that will strengthen the contribution the industry makes to protecting the public and enhancing community safety, as well as increasing the ability of industry employers to attract, develop and retain their employees and further professionalise private security.</p>

  <p class="last-child">To discharge our regulatory responsibility to help the industry achieve higher standards we need new ways of working with it to help bring about change and improvement. The skills board is a way of achieving that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The skills board will meet quarterly and lead on initiatives to enhance the private security industry, set new skills-related criteria, and ensure the industry has a voice.</p>
