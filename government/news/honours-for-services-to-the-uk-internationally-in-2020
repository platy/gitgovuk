<h3 id="kelly-hoppen-mbe">Kelly Hoppen MBE</h3>

<p>The Interior Designer and Entrepreneur receives a CBE for services to the GREAT campaign.</p>

<p>Kelly Hoppen is recognised for an exceptional contribution to the UK as an entrepreneurial and self-made female business owner and a powerful example of the talent and forward leaning nature of global Britain. Kelly gives a great deal of her time voluntarily to promote the UK overseas including her work as Chair of the GREAT Ambassadors’ group, a role in which she has generated significant activity to promote the UK and encouraged other high profile UK figures to support the campaign.</p>

<p>Closer to home, Kelly has taken part in a government scheme mentoring small- and medium-sized businesses and advising entrepreneurs hoping to export their products or services to international markets thus driving inward investment into the UK from overseas. A dedicated supporter of numerous good causes, and the championing and nurturing of women and young entrepreneurs, Kelly is also an ambassador for the Prince’s Trust and sits on their committee. She is an avid campaigner for anti-bullying, and a supporter and role model to women in business.</p>

<p>On learning of her award, Kelly Hoppen said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">On receiving the news I was overwhelmed and humbled and extremely thrilled to be honoured for work that I felt so passionate about over the years. Working together with GREAT campaign has been rewarding and exciting and it was wonderful to meet so many extraordinary people from all sectors, and I look forward to continuing the journey representing GREAT.</p>

<h3 id="dr-ian-singleton">Dr Ian Singleton</h3>

<p>The Director of Conservation, PanEco Foundation/Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme, Indonesia, receives an OBE for services to the environment and conservation.</p>

<p>Dr Singleton, leader of the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme (SOCP), a globally respected conservation programme in Indonesia, has dedicated over 30 years of his life to the conservation of orangutans. Under his leadership, the programme has created new self-sustaining wild orangutan populations in Sumatra and achieved significant success in conserving their habitat. The programme’s goal is not to simply rescue and release ex-captive orangutans for welfare reasons, but to gradually create two entirely new, self-sustaining wild populations in protected forest blocks.</p>

<p>This ground-breaking programme has successfully released over 300 orangutans back to the wild and has brought great credit to the UK through Dr Singleton’s involvement. Both new populations are now reproducing and serve as a ‘safety net’ or ‘backup’, should catastrophe befall the remaining truly wild populations; something of immediate concern today due the ongoing pandemic and the potential threat it also poses to orangutans.</p>

<p>On learning of his award, Dr Singleton said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I am of course extremely honoured to be recognised with this award, but must emphasise our work is as urgent as ever. The science predicts orangutans will be infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and we have no idea how it might impact them. We too are on the front lines of this awful pandemic, only with different species!</p>

<h3 id="nicholas-hallidie">Nicholas Hallidie</h3>

<p>The Chairman, Friends of the British Cemetery, Elvas, Portugal, receives an MBE for services to protecting British historical heritage in Portugal.</p>

<p>Nick Hallidie founded an association 23 years ago which is a leading force for the promotion of relations and cooperation between Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom and is one of the best known British organisations in Portugal. The ‘Friends of the British Cemetery, Elvas’ is responsible for preserving British historical heritage in Portugal and Nick Hallidie has tirelessly served as its volunteer Chairman since its foundation. He was the driving force in a group of local British volunteers who led the re-dedication of the British Military Cemetery in Elvas in 1997 which was instrumental in the town being recognised as a World Heritage site in 2012.</p>

<p>Every May, participants from Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom, including serving and retired military personnel, foreign and local dignitaries, come together for a Remembrance Ceremony at the Cemetery to commemorate those who died during the Peninsular War. This war forged a memorable and long-lasting alliance between the Portuguese, Spanish and British military which has been re-kindled in a dignified and now well-established way, thanks to the achievements of Nick Hallidie and the Friends of the British Cemetery, Elvas.</p>

<p>On learning of his award, Nick Hallidie said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I was very surprised to be told about the award and flattered. If you go on doing something long enough, someone will say “you should get a medal for that”, and I did.</p>

<h3 id="georgia-hague">Georgia Hague</h3>

<p>The Tourism Safety Campaigner receives a British Empire Medal for services to the British Community in the Balearics.</p>

<p>Following the tragic death of one of Georgia Hague’s friends in the Balearic Islands, Georgia set up her own safety awareness campaign to support other British tourists. ‘Don’t Leave a Friend Behind’ has proved hugely successful at getting vitally important messages out to young British tourists visiting the Balearic Islands.</p>

<p>Georgia has since become an invaluable voice in the UK’s official ‘Stick with your mates’ consular campaign, with the video featuring her going viral and reaching millions of young people, and thus helping prevent further deaths and accidents.</p>

<p>On learning of her award, Georgia Hague said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I am extremely grateful and humbled to have been recognised for my efforts in Mallorca. If the campaign helped to save just one life, then that means the world to me. Thank you for the positive recognition, I am grateful beyond words.</p>
