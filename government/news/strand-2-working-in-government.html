<p>Working in government is a vast topic, ranging from basic awareness through to specialist expertise - but the common themes throughout a Civil Service career will include things like managing public money, understanding the relationship with ministers and Parliament, and having a basic grasp of other professional areas and how to work with them.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/induction-to-the-civil-service" class="govuk-link">new induction course</a> is designed to give new joiners a basic awareness of the Civil Service and how government works.</p>

<h4>Explore the working in government strand</h4>
<p>Opportunities to gain a deeper understanding of specific aspects of government are highlighted below. As well as formal training, look out for informal opportunities, these will add greatly to your understanding of the government context.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work on cross-government projects</li>
  <li>Join <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-staff-networks/civil-service-networks" class="govuk-link">Civil Service networks</a>
</li>
  <li>Participate in initiatives like shadowing and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://civilservice.blog.gov.uk/2021/02/18/mentoring-and-me/" rel="external">mentoring</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a selection of some examples of the training available within Strand 2, to help you build your knowledge of working in government.</p>

<h4>Understanding Parliament</h4>

<p>Regardless of your role, the work that we all do as Civil Servants is scrutinised by the UK Parliament on an ongoing basis. All departments, their ministers, and the services they provide are examined through questions, debates, and scrutiny committees. This scrutiny covers ideas for new policies and laws, through to the daily experiences of the public when accessing services.</p>

<p>Understanding Parliament is essential for all civil servants in order to support ministers, ensure our work is effectively communicated to the public, and develop new services that meet the needs of the public.</p>

<p>Find out more about Parliament through the range of training courses available on the Civil Service Learning site, and through your department’s Parliamentary Branch.</p>

</ul>

<h4>Understanding the Civil Service</h4>

<p>The Civil Service Code governs how all civil servants must conduct themselves. Developing an understanding of the Code is a key part of induction training for new civil servants, and other tailored training is available to civil servants as required. The Civil Service Code is available online at the following link: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code" class="govuk-link">Understanding the Civil Service</a></p>

<h4>Advising, briefing and drafting</h4>
<p>We all have a duty to ensure that ministers, senior officials and organisational leaders are briefed and informed in a concise manner. It is crucial that your writing is accurate, brief and clear and the information you provide is prepared in the correct way.</p>
