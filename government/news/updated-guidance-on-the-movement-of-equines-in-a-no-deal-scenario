<p>The Government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-horses-and-ponies-special-rules">has issued updated guidance for owners of horses, ponies and other equines</a> on the preparations they need to make in the event of a no deal Brexit.</p>

<p>The guidance published is designed to give the owners of horses and other equine animals as much time to prepare for these new processes and factor in any extra travel time they may require when travelling to and from the EU.</p>

<p>The UK will be leaving the EU on 31 October whatever the circumstances. The guidance will help owners to navigate the new processes for moving horses and other equine animals from the UK to EU member states.</p>

<p>It will also apply to those owners that currently move their animals between the UK, Ireland and France under the Tripartite Agreement (TPA) â€“ an agreement relied on by many in the horseracing industry and the competition sector.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU on 31 October without a deal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>equines travelling from the UK to the EU may need to undergo additional blood tests, which will need to be carried out within 30 days or less of travelling to satisfy EU regulations</li>
  <li>owners will need to consult with a vet at least six weeks before they are planning to travel</li>
  <li>all equines will need an Export Health Certificate in order to travel to EU states, instead of current documents, and will need to enter the EU via a Border Inspection Post (BIP)</li>
  <li>most equines will also need a Government issued travel ID document, as well as their existing equine passport</li>
</ul>

<p>The UK has already committed to allowing continued movement on all equine animals from EU member states to support the industries that rely on these animals and ahead of major horseracing and equestrian events, such as the Olympia London International Horse Show.</p>

<p>The government is continuing with its application to the European Commission on securing listed status for the UK, which would enable the continued movement of equines to EU member states.</p>

<p>Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Rural Affairs and Biosecurity, Lord Gardiner, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the Government is seeking a deal, we have stepped up our preparations and we will be ready to leave the EU on 31 October, whatever the circumstances.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This guidance will help businesses and owners of horses prepare if we leave without a deal and the Government has already committed to the continued movement of horses from EU member states.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the UK is not provided with listed status by the European Commission, no movements of equines from the UK to the EU will be possible after we leave the EU until listed status is secured.</p>

<p>Businesses that may be affected should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-horses-and-ponies-special-rules?asdfg">read the latest guidance on equine movements</a>.</p>
