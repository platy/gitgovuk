<p>Companies across the UK are being urged not to leave filing their annual accounts until the last minute and consider going paperless, as the disruption caused by coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to affect people’s lives, businesses and the economy.</p>

<p>Companies House’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/file-your-company-annual-accounts" class="govuk-link">online filing service</a> - which is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week - can take as little as 15 minutes and has inbuilt checks to help directors avoid mistakes. Accounts filed on paper are 6 times more likely to be rejected than accounts submitted electronically (7.5% compared to just 1.2% respectively).</p>

<p>Paper accounts submitted too close to the 31 December 2020 deadline, which are then rejected, risk not having enough time to be corrected, re-submitted and manually checked. This type of late accounts will incur an automatic late filing penalty; however, if the late delivery of accounts was directly caused by the coronavirus outbreak, we will treat penalty appeals sympathetically.</p>

<p>In line with government guidance and restrictions surrounding coronavirus, there is currently a reduced number of staff working at Companies House offices. The processing of accounts filed on paper for the 2019/20 financial year is, as a result, expected to take significantly longer this year.</p>

<p>Companies House Chief Executive Louise Smyth says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By asking companies to submit their accounts early and preferably online, we are trying to ensure that they experience peace of mind during the busy end of year filing period.</p>

  <p>In common with so many organisations in these unprecedented times, we currently have a reduced number of people in our offices due to the ongoing coronavirus crisis and the government guidance and restrictions surrounding the pandemic.</p>

  <p>As a consequence of that, it’s going to take longer than it normally would to process accounts that are filed on paper, which need to be manually checked.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We want to do all we can to help companies during the pandemic, as well as ensuring the safety and wellbeing of everyone who works for Companies House. It’s a delicate balance, but one we are determined to get right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Companies can also use <a href="https://www.gov.uk/company-filing-software" class="govuk-link">third party software</a> to file their accounts electronically.</p>
