<p>These appointments take effect from the 3 May 2022 and last for 3 years.</p>

<p>The Committee on Fuel Poverty advises on the effectiveness of policies aimed at reducing fuel poverty and encourages greater co-ordination across the organisations working to reduce fuel poverty.</p>

<p>Following this announcement the chair of the Committee on Fuel Poverty, Caroline Flint, has said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am delighted Liz, Belinda and Anthony will be joining the Committee on Fuel Poverty. The variety of skills and experience they bring will inform and enhance the work we do to examine the impact of government’s Fuel Poverty strategies and make recommendations.</p>

  <p class="last-child">As energy prices rise and the wider costs of living impacts many more families, the Committee on Fuel Poverty must continue to be a strong voice for those living in fuel poverty. I look forward to working with our new members to address these challenges and advance the work to make homes warmer at a price that is affordable.</p>
</blockquote>
