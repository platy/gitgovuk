  <li>This makes Newable the first non-bank lender to join the initiative which includes five existing lenders; HSBC, Santander, Barclays, Lloyds and NatWest.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/general-export-facility" class="govuk-link">General Export Facility (<abbr title="General Export Facility">GEF</abbr>)</a> was launched in December 2020 and was first available in March 2021, designed to provide exporting <abbr title="Small and Medium-sized Enterprises">SMEs</abbr> access to working capital support through their COVID-19 recovery journey.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-export-finance-is-open-for-business-with-billions-available-for-exporters" class="govuk-link">Announced last week by Minister for Exports Mike Freer at the annual UK Trade and Export Finance Forum</a>, over £120 million worth of loans have now been issued to UK exporters using the export finance scheme, which has made <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s support more flexible and accessible for <abbr title="Small and Medium-sized Enterprises">SMEs</abbr> who have previously struggled to receive export specific funding.</p>

<h4>Minister for Exports, Mike Freer said:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>The General Export Facility introduced last year has been a remarkable success. Since the facility was made available in March, more than £120 million of <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> backed finance has been issued. Boosting businesses in sectors from online retail to renewable energy</p>

  <p class="last-child"><abbr title="General Export Facility">GEF</abbr> is a fantastic proposition for businesses looking to grow and export. But we need to make sure more businesses access it. That’s why I am pleased to announce that Newable has become the first non-bank lender accredited to the scheme.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Newable specialises in supporting smaller <abbr title="Small and Medium-sized Enterprises">SMEs</abbr> to gain the tools they need to successfully export and sees the addition of export finance as a key building block in supporting UK <abbr title="Small and Medium-sized Enterprises">SMEs</abbr>. Through the new accreditation, Newable will be providing working capital facilities of up to £150,000 to exporting businesses. Uniquely, Newable’s facilities can be used to support both new contract wins, or to provide additional working capital to exporting businesses.</p>

<p>To be eligible for support, businesses must meet several criteria including showing that in any one of the last three financial years, at least 20% of annual turnover has been made up of UK export sales or that in each of the last three financial years, at least 5% of annual turnover has been made up of UK export sales.</p>

<h4>Philip Reynolds, MD – Lending at Newable, commented:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Being the first non-bank to be accredited under the <abbr title="General Export Facility">GEF</abbr> scheme is a huge step forward in improving smaller businesses’ access to funding to support export growth. With around 1 in 10 UK <abbr title="Small and Medium-sized Enterprises">SMEs</abbr> currently exporting, there is a huge opportunity to continue to develop the UK’s export capability.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Chris Manson, Newable CEO, adds:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Newable has successfully delivered the International Trade Advice service on behalf of the government for the last 15 years and we have used this accumulated knowledge and ongoing support from <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> to develop an <abbr title="Small and Medium-sized Enterprise">SME</abbr> export funding product which is both unique and has the potential to help many UK <abbr title="Small and Medium-sized Enterprises">SMEs</abbr>.</p>
</blockquote>
