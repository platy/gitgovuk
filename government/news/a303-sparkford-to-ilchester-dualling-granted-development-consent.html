<p>The Order grants development consent for a continuous dual carriageway on the A303 linking the Podimore Roundabout and the Sparkford Bypass.  The Proposed Development would also involve the removal of at-grade junctions and direct accesses.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State has determined, following consideration of the report of the Examining Authority which conducted the Examination of the Application, that development consent should be granted.</p>

<p>The application was submitted to the Planning Inspectorate for consideration by Highways England on 27 July 2018 and accepted for examination on 23 August 2018. Following an Examination during which the public, Statutory Consultees and Interested Parties were given the opportunity to give evidence to the Examining Authority, a recommendation was made to the Secretary of State on 12 September 2019. The Secretary of State extended the deadline for the decision to 29 January 2021 for him to consider responses to the further consultations and his request for comments.</p>

<p>This is the 101st Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project and 37th transport application to have been examined by The Planning Inspectorate within the timescales laid down in the Planning Act 2008.</p>

<p>The Planning Inspectorate’s Chief Executive, Sarah Richards said:</p>

<p>“The Planning Inspectorate is committed to giving local communities the opportunity of being involved in the examination of projects that may affect them. Local people, the local authority and other interested parties were able to participate in the six-month long examination. The Examining Authority listened and gave full consideration to local views and the evidence gathered during the Examination before making their recommendation.”</p>

<p>The decision, the recommendation made by the Examining Authority to the Secretary of State and the evidence considered by the Examining Authority in reaching its recommendation is publicly available on the project page of the <a rel="external" href="https://infrastructure.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/projects/south-west/a303-sparkford-to-ilchester-dualling/" class="govuk-link">national infrastructure planning website</a>.</p>
