          <p>Has the New Year made you think about a new job, or the next chapter in your career? If this applies to you and you are scratching your head wondering where to start, why not register for our online National Careers Service careers workshops starting on 17 January.</p>

<p>We understand it can be difficult to untangle the offers that are out there to build your skills, or get going when faced with dusting off your old CV. Our workshops are there to make sense of it all and give you the tools, techniques, and motivation to take positive steps towards progressing in work or securing a new job.</p>

<p>We will take you on the journey and guide you through the process of planning your next steps and managing your career, from thinking about what skills you have, to being ready to apply for jobs and make a good impression on employers.</p>

<p>Each week will cover a new topic to improve your employability and help you to be as prepared as possible to go out and get that dream job.</p>

<ul>
  <li>17-21 Jan: Reviewing skills and interests</li>
  <li>24-28 Jan: Exploring careers and your local jobs market</li>
  <li>31 Jan – 4 Feb: Identifying learning</li>
  <li>7-11 Feb: Writing your CV</li>

<h2>Week 1 Reviewing your skills &amp; interests</h2>

<p>The first week will focus on helping you to think about the skills you have and the skills you need. Understanding these is a great way to start to improve your employability and job prospects.</p>

<p>Our fully qualified careers advisers will help you to recognise the skills you never knew you had and identify the essential skills that you have that employers often look for. You’ll learn:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to review your skills with online tools</li>
  <li>About essential skills you can use in the workplace</li>
