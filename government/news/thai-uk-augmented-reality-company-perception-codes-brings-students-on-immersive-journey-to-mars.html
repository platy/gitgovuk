    <p>The now UK-based deep tech company specialises in Desktop Augmented Reality (Desktop AR). The company develops Software Development Kit (SDK) for developers to make computer applications, turning your everyday 2D computers into an immersive and interactive 3D content display.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Founded in 2019 by “Rabbit” (Dr. Sirisilp Kongsilp), a Desktop AR pioneer. Through support from the UK’s Department for International Trade (DIT) in Thailand, the company recently qualified for the UK’s Global Entrepreneur Programme (GEP), which supports overseas deep tech entrepreneurs looking to use the UK as a springboard to scale up internationally. Currently, Holo-SDK is partnering with museums and schools in both the UK and Thailand to bring many 3D digital artefacts and interactive learning to life using its holographic applications.</p>

    <p>Students joined a workshop focused on developing their own immersive experience on Mars using “Holo-SDK”, a Software Development Kit for developers. In a little game comprising of an astronaut exploring Mars with his own rovers and satellite, students learned the basic principles of Desktop AR technology and the basic tools for making applications.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Thursday, 11 Feb 2020 - Perception, a UK-based computer software company hosted a workshop on developing Desktop AR for 26 Bangkok Prep International School students in Key Stage 3.</p>

<p>The workshop focused on educating students with basic coding skills and providing a hands-on exercise for them to develop their own Desktop AR using the company’s Holographic Software Development Kit (Holo-SDK). Utilizing the company’s sample application, Holo-Mars, the three-hour workshop enables students to make holographic applications using Holo-SDK through a little game that involves an astronaut exploring Mars with his rovers and satellite.</p>

<p>The software aka “Holo-SDK” utilizes Augmented Reality (AR) technology, enabling users to create their own version of a volumetric display. The software creates the illusion of 3D objects and scenes on any of your ordinary 2D monitor using just a computer, webcam, and 3D glasses (anaglyph glasses).</p>

<p>Students with basic coding skills can enhance their programming skillset and expand their portfolio using Holo-SDK. With such positive feedback, the company plans to do more of these similar workshops with the school and expand to other schools in Thailand and worldwide with an aim to build future technological entrepreneurs and professionals, building upon necessary digital skills of the 21st century – coding.</p>

<p>‘We want to educate our young students to be technology entrepreneurs, be creators, not consumers. This is why we organized the workshop to teach students at a very young age.” said, Perception Codes’ Chief Technology Officer, Dr. Krisada Chaiyasarn said.</p>

<p>“It is good to see students being challenged with activities outside of the classroom. I can see that Desktop AR applications can be integrated as teaching tools to increase the level of engagement and interactions with lessons.” said, Alison Cantrill, Head of Careers and Student Pathways, Bangkok Prep International School.</p>

<p>Founded by Dr Sirisilp or “Dr. Rabbit”, CEO, who has been working on the Desktop AR during his research 7-8 years ago. The company secured its first seed funding back in 2019. Receiving immense attention as a cost-effective alternative to expensive Augmented Reality, the company then secured the 2nd round of funding from investors and angels in late 2020.</p>

<p>Despite being less than 2 years old, the now, UK based start-up is looking to making technology accessible by putting the tools required for creating Desktop AR applications into the hands of developers.</p>

<p>Its recent business decision to expand to the UK with support from the UK government’s Department for International Trade’s Global Entrepreneur Programme (GEP) will see the company partnering with schools and museums, both in Thailand and the UK to enhance learning experience. With the covid-19 strikes, students and people are not able to go to museums, their Holo-SDK is the tool to allow people to access 3D contents at home with minimal costs, re-connecting history and learning with even more people than ever before.</p>

<p>“I’m excited to see more representations from Thailand under the Global Entrepreneur Programme (GEP) this year. With the current travel limitations as a result of covid-19, Desktop AR is certainly a technology of the future, removing barriers to learning and experiencing for learners around the globe. I very much look forward to Perception Codes bringing their technology to the UK, and helping them to reach even more consumers on the global stage.</p>

<p>If you are a deep tech entrepreneur in Thailand with a bright idea, do not hesitate to reach out to us at the Department for International Trade” said, Richard Porter, Commercial Counsellor, Department for International Trade.</p>

<p>‘Desktop AR is the technology of the future, all future computer applications will be holographic!’ said, Dr. Sirisilp Kongsilp, Founder and CEO, Perception Codes LTD.</p>

<p>Perception Codes is one of the 3 Thai companies to qualify for the UK’s Global Entrepreneur Programme (GEP). The programme supports overseas tech entrepreneurs to expand and use the UK as a springboard for scaling up and accessing the global market.</p>

<p>Since its conception in 2004, the programme has helped more than 100 overseas entrepreneurs raised more than £1 bn in total by helping them tap into the UK’s financial resource and advice from the programme’s dealmaker to expand internationally.</p>
