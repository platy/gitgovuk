  <li>Max Caller CBE leads government intervention</li>
  <li>Council transformation to start with immediate effect</li>
  <li>Commissioners will inform decisions on exceptional financial support</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Commissioners have been sent in to address serious financial and management failures at Slough Borough Council at the request of the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities today (1 December 2021).</p>

<p>Local Government Minister Kemi Badenoch <a href="https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2021-10-25/hcws353" rel="external" class="govuk-link">updated Parliament last month</a> that the Department was minded to intervene in the council after an independent review uncovered a “deeply concerning picture of mismanagement, a breakdown in scrutiny and accountability, and a dysfunctional culture at Slough Borough Council”.</p>

<p>Residents and councillors have voiced their support for government intervention and the proposal to appoint commissioners. The council has also accepted the findings of the review and has agreed to work with commissioners to make real improvements to its services.</p>

<p>Local Government Minister Kemi Badenoch MP said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is overwhelming evidence that Slough Borough Council has failed its residents and it is necessary for government to intervene.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I have appointed experienced commissioners who will start the process of rebuilding confidence and trust between the council, councillors and the communities they serve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The commissioners will be led by Max Caller CBE, who led the best value inspections at Northamptonshire and Liverpool Councils and was a commissioner at Tower Hamlets. He will be supported by finance commissioner Margaret Lee, former statutory finance officer at Essex County Council and member of the London Borough of Croydon Improvement and Assurance Panel.</p>

<p>The team will immediately take over several functions associated with financial management and governance after an independent review concluded the council was failing in its best value duty in these areas.</p>

<p>Lead Commissioner Max Caller CBE said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We look forward to working with Slough Borough Council, both members and officers, to help the council come back to high-quality local government where they deliver best value for all their residents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/slough-borough-council-external-assurance-review">review</a> published in October, revealed the financial challenge the council faces, concluding that Slough cannot become financially sustainable without considerable government support.</p>

<p>These commissioners will play an important role in deciding Slough’s future, including the council’s request for exceptional financial support.</p>
