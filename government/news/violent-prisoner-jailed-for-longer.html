<p>A convicted murderer who attacked a prison officer has had his sentence increased under the Unduly Lenient Sentence (ULS) scheme.</p>

<p>William Johnstone, 41, currently serving two life sentences at HMP Durham, attacked a prison officer on 12 April 2020. Johnstone threw a kettle of boiling water at the officer as she unlocked the door to his cell. She suffered burn injuries leading to permanent scarring. Johnstone claimed to be acting in self-defence, as he believed that he was about to be assaulted by a fellow prisoner.</p>

<p>Johnstone has 11 previous convictions for 22 offences. In November 2002 he was convicted of murdering his mother’s partner before dismembering her body. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 14 years. In April 2006 he entered a fellow prisoner’s cell and attacked him with an improvised knife. Following this offence, he was sentenced to automatic life imprisonment.</p>

<p>On this latest offence, Johnstone pled guilty to, and was convicted of, attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent. On 22 December 2020 he was sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment at Durham Crown Court.</p>

<p>Following a referral to the Court of Appeal under the Unduly Lenient Sentence (ULS) scheme by the Attorney General, on 9 November 2021 the Court found the sentence to be unduly lenient and increased it to 5 years’ imprisonment with a 4-year extended licence.</p>

<p>After the hearing at the Court of Appeal, the Solicitor General, Alex Chalk QC MP, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Johnstone’s act was a cowardly attack on a committed public servant acting in the execution of her duty. I want to make it clear that attacks on public servants, who protect society and deliver services on our behalf, should be met with appropriate prison sentences. I am glad that the Court of Appeal chose to increase his sentence today.</p>
