  <li>government and rail industry launches nation’s biggest ever rail sale cutting travel costs</li>
  <li>passengers can get their ‘next trip at a snip’ with savings of up to 50%</li>
  <li>more than one million discounted tickets will help connect friends and families, boost UK tourism and encourage green travel across the country</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Over one million rail tickets will be slashed by up to 50% as the government and rail industry launch the first-of-its-kind Great British Rail Sale.</p>

<p>The public is encouraged to take advantage of this unprecedented sale, which sees for the first time multiple operators come together to offer nationwide savings.</p>

<p>Savings on offer for off-peak tickets include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>York to Leeds: was £5.60, now £2.80</li>
  <li>London to Edinburgh: was £44, now £22</li>
  <li>London to Cardiff: was £47, now £25</li>
  <li>Wolverhampton to Liverpool: was £10.50, now £5.25</li>
  <li>Manchester to Newcastle: was £20.60, now £10.30</li>
  <li>Birmingham New Street to Bristol Temple Meads: was £25.30, now £12.60</li>
  <li>Portsmouth Harbour to Penzance was £45.70, now £22.00</li>
</ul>

<p>Cutting the cost of rail travel will help ease some of the pressure on family finances at a time when inflation is rising around the world.</p>

<p>It will also encourage people to visit different places, connect with friends and loved ones, and get out and about around the country.</p>

<p>Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the first time ever, operators across the rail industry are coming together to help passengers facing rising costs of living by offering up to 50% off more than a million tickets on journeys across Britain.</p>

  <p class="last-child">There’s no better time to visit friends, family or just explore our great country, so book your tickets today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jacqueline Starr, <abbr title="Chief Executive Officer">CEO</abbr> of the Rail Delivery Group, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We want everyone to be able to benefit from travelling by train because it’s more than just a journey, it’s a way to connect everyone to the people, places and things they love.</p>

  <p class="last-child">As part of the Great British Rail Sale customers will enjoy over one million discounted tickets, so they can explore some of the fantastic locations that are accessible by rail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tickets can be purchased online from participating retailers with the up to half-price rate applying to a huge range of off-peak tickets spreading the length and breadth of the country.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Tickets go on sale from 19 April with discounted tickets available on journeys from 25 April to 27 May.</p>
</div>

<p>The government is listening to people’s concerns about rising costs, and is taking action worth more than £22 billion in 2022-23 alone – which includes support with the cost of energy bills and to help to ensure people keep more of their money. Offering half-price rail tickets is one of the ways the government is further supporting families with the cost of living.</p>

<p>Reforms to the rail sector through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/great-british-railways-williams-shapps-plan-for-rail">Williams-Shapps Plan for Rail</a> mean that network-wide sales of tickets can occur more easily in the future.</p>
