<p>The transition period ends on 31 December 2020. On 1 January 2021 there will be changes to UK intellectual property law to ensure the smooth departure from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> systems.</p>

<p>The following is a summary of the key changes.</p>

<h3 id="use-of-representatives-and-address-requirements-to-represent">Use of representatives and address requirements to represent</h3>

<p>From 1 January 2021, UK attorneys will be unable to represent clients on new applications or new proceedings at the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Intellectual Property Office (<abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>). UK trade mark owners will need to appoint an <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> attorney to represent them on new applications and proceedings before the <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>.</p>

<p>However, the Withdrawal Agreement (<abbr title="Withdrawal Agreement">WA</abbr>) ensures that UK legal representatives can continue to represent their clients before the <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr> in cases that are ongoing at the end of the transition period.</p>

<h3 id="uk-address-for-service-afs">UK Address for Service (<abbr title="Address for service">AfS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The Intellectual Property Office (<abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr>) has published <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/address-for-service-for-intellectual-property-rights-from-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">business guidance</a>, following publication of the government response to the outcome of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/address-for-service-rules-changes-call-for-views" class="govuk-link">Address for Service call for views</a> published earlier this year. Views were invited on removing reference to the European Economic Area.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, subject to legislative implementation, only an address for service in the UK (which for these purposes includes the Isle of Man), Gibraltar or the Channel Islands will be accepted for new applications and new requests to start contentious proceedings before the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr>.</p>

<p>The change will apply across all the registered <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> rights (patents, trade marks and designs).</p>

<h3 id="changes-to-ip-rights">Changes to <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> rights</h3>

<h3 id="trade-marks">Trade marks</h3>

<p>Comparable UK trade mark and Design rights will be created at the end of the transition period under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>On 1 January 2021, The <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> will create a comparable UK trade mark for every registered <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> trade mark (<abbr title="European Union trade mark">EUTM</abbr>). Each of these UK rights will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be recorded on the UK trade mark register</li>
  <li>have the same legal status as if you had applied for and registered it under UK law</li>
  <li>keep the original <abbr title="European Union trade mark">EUTM</abbr> filing date</li>
  <li>keep the original priority or UK seniority dates</li>
  <li>be a fully independent UK trade mark that can be challenged, assigned, licensed or renewed separately from the original <abbr title="European Union trade mark">EUTM</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You will not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>need to file an application for this right or pay an application fee. There will be as little administration involved as possible</li>
  <li>receive a UK registration certificate, but you will be able to access details about the trade mark on GOV.UK and can take a screen shot from there as evidence of your right.</li>
</ul>

<p>Businesses, organisations or individuals that have applications for EUTMs which are not registered at the end of the transition period will have a period of nine months to apply in the UK for the same protection. In this case, UK application fees will be payable, and the application will be subject to UK examination and publication requirements.</p>

<p>Our digital and paper forms will be amended to include a new section for claiming the earlier filing date of the corresponding <abbr title="European Union trade mark">EUTM</abbr> application.</p>

<p>For information on renewals, opt out process and numbering as well as more detail on subjects covered in this section please refer to our business guidance</p>

</ul>

<p>Please see section below on <a href="#refGeographical-Indications" class="govuk-link">Geographical Indications</a> for details on this <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> right and the relationship with trade marks.</p>

<h3 id="designs">Designs</h3>

<p>Re-registered UK designs will be created at the end of the transition period under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>On 1 January 2021, the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> will create a re-registered design for every Registered Community design (<abbr title="Registered Community Design">RCD</abbr>). Each of these rights will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be recorded on the UK designs register</li>
  <li>have the same legal status as if you had applied for and registered it under UK law</li>
  <li>keep the original <abbr title="Registered Community Design">RCD</abbr> filing date</li>
  <li>keep the original priority date</li>
  <li>be a fully independent UK design that can be challenged, assigned, licensed or renewed separately from the original <abbr title="Registered Community Design">RCD</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>need to file an application for this right or pay an application fee. There will be as little administration involved as possible</li>
  <li>receive a UK registration certificate. You will be able to access details about the design on GOV.UK and can take a screen shot from there as evidence of your right.</li>
</ul>

<p>Businesses, organisations or individuals that have applications for <abbr title="Registered Community Designs">RCDs</abbr> which are either not registered or have deferred publication at the end of the transition period, will have a period of nine months to apply in the UK for the same protection. In this case UK application fees will be payable, and the application will be subject to UK examination requirements.</p>

<p>Our digital and paper forms will be amended to include a new section for claiming the earlier filing date of the corresponding <abbr title="Registered Community Design">RCD</abbr> application.</p>

<p>For information on renewals, opt out process and numbering as well as more detail on subjects covered in this section please refer to our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/eu-trademark-protection-and-comparable-uk-trademarks" class="govuk-link">business guidance</a></p>

<h3 id="international-trade-marks-and-designs">International trade marks and designs</h3>

<p>International designs designating the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> will continue to have protection in the UK under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, the UK Intellectual Property Office will create a re-registered UK design for every International design (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>), that is protected at the end of the transition period.</p>

<p>Where an international design designating the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> has been applied for, but is not yet protected or where the publication has been deferred, the holder will have a period of nine months to apply for the same right as a UK design.</p>

<p>UK application fees will be payable, and the application will be subject to UK examination requirements.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Re-registered International designs will not be displayed or available to view or search on the UK register from the end of the transition period as there will be a delay in updating UK systems.</p>

<p>Holders of these rights will not be disadvantaged as re-registered UK designs will have effect in law from the end of the transition period.</p>

<p>They will be available on the UK register as soon as practically possible.</p>

<p>The UK <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> will provide continuous updates to customers via GOV.UK once these rights become available to view and search.</p>
</div>

<p>For information on renewals, opt out process and numbering please refer to UK <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/changes-to-international-trade-mark-registrations-after-the-transition-period" class="govuk-link">business guidance</a>.</p>

<p>For further key information for customers and users of <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> about how the <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> system and the UK Intellectual Property Office will operate after the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/intellectual-property-after-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">end of the transition period</a>.</p>

<h3 id="unregistered-designs">Unregistered Designs</h3>

<p>Unregistered community designs that arise before the end of the transition period will continue to be protected in the UK for the remainder of their three year term through continuing unregistered designs.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, a  supplementary unregistered design (<abbr title="Supplementary unregistered design">SUD</abbr>) will become available in UK law.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Supplementary unregistered design">SUD</abbr> will provide similar protection to that conferred by the unregistered Community design, but for the UK only.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Supplementary unregistered design">SUD</abbr> will be established by first disclosure in the UK or another qualifying country.
First disclosure in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> will not establish a <abbr title="Supplementary unregistered design">SUD</abbr> right. It could destroy the novelty of the design should you later seek to establish UK unregistered rights.</p>

<p>Business will need to consider carefully where to disclose their products to ensure they have adequate protection in their most important market.</p>

<p>More information is available in our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/changes-to-unregistered-designs-after-the-transition-period" class="govuk-link">business guidance</a>.</p>

<h3 id="patents">Patents</h3>

<p>You can apply for a European patent through us or direct to the European Patent Office (<abbr title="European Patent Office">EPO</abbr>) to protect your patent in more than 30 countries in Europe, using the (non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) European Patent Convention (<abbr title="European Patent Convention">EPC</abbr>).</p>

<p>As the <abbr title="European Patent Office">EPO</abbr> is not an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> agency, leaving the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> does not affect the current European patent system. Existing European patents covering the UK are also unaffected.</p>

<p>European patent attorneys based in the UK continue to be able to represent applicants before the <abbr title="European Patent Office">EPO</abbr>. See the notice on the <abbr title="European Patent Office">EPO</abbr> website <a rel="external" href="https://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/official-journal/information-epo/archive/20200129.html" class="govuk-link">news story</a> 
for further information.</p>

<h3 id="supplementary-protection-certificates-spcs">Supplementary Protection Certificates (<abbr title="Supplementary Protection Certificates">SPCs</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="Supplementary Protection Certificates">SPCs</abbr> are granted as national rather than <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-wide rights.</p>

<p>It was not necessary for the UK and the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to agree the creation of a comparable right to ensure continued protection of existing <abbr title="Supplementary Protection Certificates">SPCs</abbr> in the UK at the end of the transition period.</p>

<p>The Withdrawal Agreement ensures that <abbr title="Supplementary Protection Certificate">SPC</abbr> applications which are pending at the end of the transition period will be examined under the current framework.</p>

<p>Any <abbr title="Supplementary Protection Certificate">SPC</abbr> which is granted based on those applications will provide the same protection as existing <abbr title="Supplementary Protection Certificates">SPCs</abbr>.</p>

<p>You will continue to apply for an <abbr title="Supplementary Protection Certificate">SPC</abbr> by submitting an application to the Intellectual Property Office.</p>

<h3 id="changes-affecting-spcs-due-to-the-northern-ireland-protocol">Changes affecting <abbr title="Supplementary Protection Certificates">SPCs</abbr> due to the Northern Ireland Protocol</h3>

<p>Due to regulatory changes for marketing authorisations there are some changes to the <abbr title="Supplementary Protection Certificate">SPC</abbr> application process which will come into effect from 1 January.</p>

<p>You will need to check whether your marketing authorisation is valid for the whole of the UK, or just Northern Ireland or Great Britain.</p>

<p>An application for an <abbr title="Supplementary Protection Certificate">SPC</abbr> must still be filed with the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> within six months of your first authorisation.</p>

<p>Please check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/changes-to-spc-and-patent-law-after-the-transition-period" class="govuk-link">business guidance</a> to ensure you are submitting the correct forms and accompanying documentation.</p>

<h3 id="parallel-trade-between-the-uk-and-the-eea">Parallel trade between the UK and the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> rights in goods placed on the UK market by, or with the consent of the right holder after the transition period may no longer be considered exhausted in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>.</p>

<p>This means that businesses parallel exporting these <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr>-protected goods from the UK to the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> might need the right holderâ€™s consent.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> rights in goods placed on the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> market by, or with the consent of the right holder after the transition period will continue to be considered exhausted in the UK.</p>

<p>This means that parallel imports into the UK from the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> will be unaffected.</p>

<p>We plan to publish a formal consultation in early 2021 and we will let interested parties know of the publication date in due course.</p>

<h3 id="actions-for-parallel-exporters-of-ip-protected-goods-to-the-eea">Actions for parallel exporters of <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr>-protected goods to the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Check whether you currently export legitimate, <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr>-protected goods to the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>. These could be goods branded with a trade mark that have already been placed on the UK market.</p>

<p>The rights holderâ€™s permission to export those goods may not currently be required.</p>

<p>You may need to contact the rights holder to get permission to continue exporting these goods after 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> rights holder may not provide permission for their <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr>-protected goods to be parallel exported to the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>.</p>

<p>You may need to review your business arrangements, business model or supply chain based on the outcome of the discussion with the <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> rights holder.</p>

<h3 id="actions-for-ip-rights-holders">Actions for <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> rights holders</h3>

<p>Businesses that own <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> rights (trade marks, patents, designs or copyright) may wish to seek legal advice if their <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr>-protected goods are parallel exported from the UK to the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>.</p>

<p>You will need to consider if you want to allow parallel exports of your <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr>-protected goods from the UK to the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> after 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>More information is available in our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exhaustion-of-ip-rights-and-parallel-trade-after-the-transition-period" class="govuk-link">business guidance</a>.</p>

<h3 id="copyright">Copyright</h3>

<p>Most UK copyright works (such as books, films and music) will still be protected in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and the UK. This is because of the UKâ€™s continued participation in the international treaties on copyright.</p>

<p>For the same reason, <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> copyright works will continue to be protected in the UK. This applies to works made before and after 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>Current cross-border copyright arrangements unique to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states will stop at end of the transition period.</p>

<p>These include cross-border portability of online content services, copyright clearance for satellite broadcasts, reciprocal protection for database rights and the orphan works exception.</p>

<p>More information is available in our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/changes-to-copyright-law-after-the-transition-period" class="govuk-link">business guidance</a>.</p>

<h3 id="refGeographical-Indications">Geographical Indications</h3>

<p>A geographical indication is an <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> right used on products that have a specific geographical origin. They possess qualities or a reputation due to that origin, such as Scotch Whisky or Stilton cheese.</p>

<p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) leads on agricultural and food Geographical Indications (<abbr title="Geographical Indications">GIs</abbr>) in the UK. They have <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protecting-food-and-drink-names-from-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">published guidance</a>, including the new UK <abbr title="Geographical Indications">GI</abbr> schemes which will come into force on 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> has worked with <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> to ensure the new schemes are compatible with the wider <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> framework. This will ensure the existing relationship between trade marks and <abbr title="Geographical Indications">GIs</abbr> is maintained. Business guidance on this area will be published in due course.</p>

<h3 id="protecting-intellectual-property-rights-at-the-uk-border">Protecting intellectual property rights at the UK border</h3>

<p>The way in which businesses protect their <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> rights at the UK border will change once the Transition Period ends on 31 December 2020. From this date all UK protection within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> will cease to be recognised.</p>

<p>This means that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>businesses that want to protect their <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> rights in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and in the UK will need to hold two Applications for Action (<abbr title="Applications for Action">AFA</abbr>) - one in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and one in the UK</li>
  <li>businesses that made an application to the UK for <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> rights protection in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries will need to check the <a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/running-business/intellectual-property/infringement/index_en.htm" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> EUROPA  website</a> for guidance on protecting <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> rights in one or more <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states</li>
  <li>if a business made an application in another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country for <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> protection in the UK before the end of the transition period, they need to make a new UK <abbr title="Applications for Action">AFA</abbr> application to continue to protect their <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> rights at the UK border</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="HM Revenue & Customs">HMRC</abbr> have introduced a new application process to protect <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> rights at the UKâ€™s borders. Businesses will need to complete the new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-action-to-protect-your-intellectual-property-rights#before-you-apply" class="govuk-link">UK <abbr title="Applications for Action">AFA</abbr> form</a> which is available on GOV.UK</li>
  <li>the UK government will recognise existing applications for <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> protection in the UK where an application was made in the UK and handled by HM Revenue & Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue & Customs">HMRC</abbr>) Intellectual Property Approvals. These applications will be stored on a UK register at the end of the Transition Period. Businesses can continue to seek enforcement in the UK until their <abbr title="Applications for Action">AFA</abbr> expires and there is no requirement to re-submit a UK application after the transition period</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information about the changes please refer to our business 
guidance <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-action-to-protect-your-intellectual-property-rights" class="govuk-link">Application for Action</a>.</p>
