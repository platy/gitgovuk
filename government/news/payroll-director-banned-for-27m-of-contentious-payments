<p>Jonas Stankevicius, from Doncaster, was appointed the sole director of S Jonas Solutions Limited in July 2018, at the same time the payroll services company was incorporated.</p>

<p>S Jonas Solutions started trading shortly after incorporation from premises in Stockhill Road, Doncaster, but only a few months later entered into creditors voluntary liquidation in December 2018.</p>

<p>The payroll company’s liquidation and the length of trading, however, brought S Jonas Solutions to the attention of the Insolvency Service who conducted further enquiries into a series of contentious payments.</p>

<p>Investigators uncovered that Jonas Stankevicius failed to ensure payroll company maintained and/or preserved adequate accounting records. This failure has meant that neither the liquidators nor investigators could verify the legitimacy of £2.73 million worth of payments made from the payroll company’s bank account between August and October 2018.</p>

<p>The failure to maintain proper records also meant that it has not been able to determine the true amount of tax liabilities owed by S Jonas Solutions after the tax authorities claimed just over £500,000 in the liquidation.</p>

<p>On 15 September 2020 the Secretary of State accepted a disqualification undertaking from Jonas Stankevicius, after he did not dispute that he failed to ensure that S Jonas Solutions maintained and/or preserved adequate accounting records, or alternatively failed to deliver up such records to the Liquidator.</p>

<p>Effective from 6 October 2020, Jonas Stankevicius is banned for 8 years from directly or indirectly becoming involved, without the permission of the court, in the promotion, formation or management of a company.</p>

<p>Mark Bruce, Chief Investigator for the Insolvency Service, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All directors have a statutory requirement to maintain company accounting records. Jonas Stankevicius, however, completely disregarded his responsibilities and as a direct consequence of his actions, he couldn’t explain the legitimacy of £2.7 million of payments paid out of the payroll company’s accounts over just two months.</p>

  <p class="last-child">But his misconduct has caught up with him and Jonas Stankevicius has been banned for eight years, which should serve as a warning to other rogue directors that your misconduct could see you being removed from the business environment for a substantial amount of time.</p>
</blockquote>
