  <li>
    <p>This funding builds on the biggest tranche of money awarded from the Government’s £1.57 billion Culture Recovery Fund announced on Monday, taking the total to £333 million this week.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Venues and organisations benefiting across England include the Military Wives Choirs, The Hepworth Wakefield, Night and Day in Manchester, Whitby’s famous Gothic Festival, London’s Somerset House and Kneehigh Theatre in Cornwall</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Comedy clubs, circuses, festivals, regional theatres and local museums are among 588 arts and cultural organisations receiving a share of more than £76 million in essential support, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has announced.</p>

<h3 id="culture-secretary-oliver-dowden-said">Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is more vital funding to protect cultural gems across the country, save jobs and prepare the arts to bounce back. Through Arts Council England we are delivering the biggest ever investment in the arts in record time. Hundreds of millions of pounds are already making their way to thousands of organisations.</p>

  <p class="last-child">These awards build on our commitment to be here for culture in every part of the country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This funding will provide a lifeline for organisations and venues engaging local communities with culture across England. It will protect nationally and internationally renowned organisations like the Military Wives Choir, the Kneehigh Theatre in Cornwall, the Comedy Store venues in Manchester and London and the Hepworth Wakefield’s collection of modern British art. The West End’s longest running play, The Mousetrap, will also receive a grant of £228,973 to help restart performances to socially distanced audiences.</p>

<h3 id="melanie-nightingale-director-military-wives-choirs-said">Melanie Nightingale, Director, Military Wives Choirs, said:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We are incredibly grateful to have been awarded part of the Government’s Culture Recovery Fund. This much-needed support enables the Military Wives Choirs to continue in our mission of increasing wellbeing through singing, to our inclusive network of over 2,000 women across the military community and audiences across the country and abroad. We are thrilled that this funding enables our 73 choirs to sing, share and support one another and feel stronger together through music.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A wide range of art forms will benefit from these awards including operating circuses and training for future performers. Zippos Circus, one of the oldest circuses still running in the UK, will receive £628,986 to continue with covid-secure performances across the country and the National Centre for Circus Arts will be able to safely provide workshops and classes for artists and young people thanks to a grant of £466,000.</p>

<h3 id="kate-white-ceo-national-centre-for-circus-arts-said">Kate White, CEO, National Centre for Circus Arts said:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The National Centre for Circus Arts is thrilled to have been successful in our application to the Cultural Recovery Fund. The grant is a real lifeline and will allow us to offer support to many circus artists, who as freelancers have been without work and income for many months now.  As we have reopened our building we are able to subsidise fees for professionals as they ease back into training and creation.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We will further develop our support for teachers as we create new and innovative ways of teaching and creating circus in a COVID safe way. The investment from DCMS and ACE will enable us to adapt our business model, testing new ways of working, to achieve long term financial viability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Funding is also going to festivals across the country from grassroots arts festival BlackFest based in Liverpool, which is receiving £50,000 to trial socially distanced events, to Shangri-La Glastonbury, the contemporary art producers behind one of the iconic festival’s most legendary stages where some of the world’s biggest artists including Lady Gaga and Madonna have performed, which is being awarded £61,059 to develop a new digital art and music event platform and continue work with emerging artists.</p>

<p>There are also grants for grassroot music venues like Night and Day in Manchester whose support for local unsigned artists has launched major careers for well-known acts like Elbow.</p>

<p>Comedy venues and festivals from Liverpool to London are also benefiting from this tranche of grants. The internationally renowned Leicester Comedy Festival is the longest running and largest comedy festival of its kind in Europe and a grant of £105,000 will allow planning to continue for next year’s festival. Liverpool’s only purpose built comedy club, The Hot Water Comedy Club, is receiving a £450,000 grant from the Culture Recovery Fund to cover fixed costs for the comedy club and the additional measures needed to make the venue Covid-safe for performances. The Comedy Store, the largest employer of professional comedy performers in the UK and one of Europe’s most significant comedy institutions, will receive £964,252 to retain staff in both city locations and deliver an exciting programme that will provide fees for more than 250 freelancers.</p>

<h3 id="don-ward-founder-and-ceo-the-comedy-store-said">Don Ward, founder and CEO, The Comedy Store, said:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Over 41 years have passed since I opened the very first alternative comedy venue in London, after 20 years I added a second venue in Manchester.  Comedy is now rightly recognised as an art form and I am so proud to be known as the Godfather. I was devastated last March when we had to close both venues due to the Coronavirus and all the relative problems it brought to the understandably enforced closure. The investment will ensure that we will be back to entertain live audiences as soon as it is safe to do so, protecting livelihoods and the artform of comedy itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today’s funding will help allow socially distanced performances to restart where safe to do so, venues to plan for reopening, protect jobs and create opportunities for freelancers. It follows £257 million in grants awarded to a range of arts organisations and cultural venues on Monday October 12 by Arts Council England on behalf of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.</p>

<p>Organisations have been awarded grants under £1 million in the first two rounds of funding this week. Darlington Hippodrome in County Durham is receiving the largest grant of £1 million to run a programme of engagement activities including youth theatre courses, adult dance classes and community events ranging from themed tours of the theatre to art classes for local people.</p>

<h3 id="sir-nicholas-serota-chair-arts-council-england-said">Sir Nicholas Serota, Chair, Arts Council England, said:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Culture is an essential part of life across the country, helping to support people’s wellbeing through creativity and self-expression, bringing communities together, and fuelling our world class creative industries.  This latest set of awards from the Culture Recovery Fund builds on those announced recently and will help hundreds of organisations to survive the next few months, ensuring that the cultural sector can bounce back after the crisis.  We will continue doing everything we can to support artists and cultural and creative organisations, with further funding to be announced in the coming weeks.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="neil-mendoza-government-commissioner-for-culture-recovery-and-renewal-said">Neil Mendoza, Government Commissioner for Culture Recovery and Renewal, said:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We are at a serious moment for the economy and jobs, but especially for the cultural sector. Culture provides a life-enhancing force. It contributes to our national good in so many ways, from well-being to economic growth, in every single part of the country.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Today’s funding announcement covers a range of performing arts and museums right across the country from Hadrian’s Wall to Truro. Arts Council England have worked hard to judge applications carefully ensuring that the Fund can release grants quickly while protecting taxpayers money. We are here for culture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All four nations are benefiting from the UK Government’s £1.57 billion Culture Recovery Fund, with Scotland receiving £97 million, Wales receiving £59 million and Northern Ireland receiving £33 million. This funding will enable them to increase the support already available to the arts and cultural sectors in each nation if they wish to.</p>

<p>The Culture Recovery Fund builds on more than £200 billion of support through the Job Retention Scheme; more than £13.5 billion through the Self Employed Income Support Scheme; and a hundred billion pounds of tax cuts, tax deferral, direct grants and government backed loans.</p>

<p>This is in addition to £104 million of emergency funding already distributed by Arts Council England to organisations and individuals, and £96 million currently available to support the arts and freelancers, through programmes like National Lottery Project Grants and Developing Your Creative Practice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We are hugely relieved to receive this grant. It makes a very welcome contribution to helping us get through the unprecedented financial loses of this year as we prepare to creatively meet the upcoming challenges and opportunities that the entire world now faces together. This money will encourage many others to continue investing in our work and our future. Culture will play a key part in building back better and levelling up what is currently an increasingly widening north-south divide in the UK. Our sector provides a superb return on investment for the country and we’ll be delighted to use this money at The Hepworth to continue demonstrating the significant part we play for the proven benefit of the economy, audiences, artists, tourism and education.</p>

<h3 id="robson-green-patron-the-vindolanda-trust-said">Robson Green, Patron, The Vindolanda Trust, said:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>This really is wonderful and extraordinary news. This money will not only secure financial viability, covering the core costs over the long and uncertain winter but will also enable them to get more robust systems in place for 2021. Having just recently completed a TV series telling the incredible story of Hadrian’s Wall the experience reminded me that History makes us what we are and gives us a wider awareness of the issues that faced, are facing, and will face the world we are growing up in.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Along with the wealth of knowledge and skills that is transmitted through our extraordinary history from one generation to the next, The Vindolanda Trust reminds us all that knowing our origins not only teaches us about the past and the world we live in today but more importantly it allows us learn so much about ourselves.</p>

<h3 id="helen-wallace-artistic-director-kings-place-music-foundation-said">Helen Wallace, Artistic Director, Kings Place Music Foundation, said:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are deeply grateful that Kings Place has been announced as a recipient of the government’s Culture Recovery Fund. We would like to thank the Department of Culture, Media and Sport and the Arts Council for recognising Kings Place’s position at the heart of a community of ensembles, freelance musicians, arts charities, promoters, podcasters, technicians and diverse audiences.</p>

  <p>In the most devastating year in the venue’s 12 year history, this invaluable support will enable us to retain our dedicated core team and work with our family of artistic partners to present a vibrant programme in the next six months, both in our Covid-secure hall and online.</p>

  <p>Since August we have run more than 100 events, from one-on-one Culture Clinics to acclaimed concerts to the London Podcast Festival, and developed an exciting digital platform to share our work. This funding also allows us to continue to offer spaces to music education charities, community groups, and for schools and family concerts.</p>

  <p class="last-child">With 70% of seats lost in our halls, Kings Place remains in an extremely fragile position. But this grant, and the generous support of our audiences, have given us the wherewithal and courage to continue our mission to enrich lives through music and spoken word.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We are so grateful for our award from the Government’s Culture Recovery Fund, which will enable us to develop an extensive, Covid-compliant strand of work encompassing nearly 100 new live events for communities throughout the East of England. That means crucial income for our freelance musicians who have endured so much financial hardship in recent months. This award helps us to bring our audiences and our musicians back together again in the way that we, and they, have all longed for – sharing the experience of live, world class music with each other.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I feel an incredible sense of relief that Hofesh Shechter Company has been supported by the DCMS and ACE through the Culture Recovery Fund. To those who made this decision - thank you. This is a meaningful step, a meaningful moment and a critical one, bringing renewed hope to the dancers, the team, the company and all its freelance collaborators and will, in return, have a direct impact on all those we wish to inspire.</p>

  <p>The last 7 months have been difficult for all of us collectively and this offers the arts an opportunity to rebuild the foundations for a creative future. There are still many challenges ahead - but it is the lifeline we need to move forward with more certainty. It allows us to progress from survival mode to the hopeful state of recovery. We will continue in our endeavours to bring the company back to action, back to work, to create, to inspire and engage audiences, students, the professional dance scene as well as all art forms and people. We must do so whilst adapting and finding new ways to help the arts thrive again. This fund gives us a chance to do this and we will do all we can to achieve it.</p>

This funding is very welcome news and will support us and enable us to continue to operate and deliver cultural and educational experiences to our visitors and community. We believe outdoor museums like ours are increasingly important, we providing visitors with access to 45 acres of Chilterns landscape and over 35 historic buildings from the region in an environment which enhances health and wellbeing.</p>

<h3 id="michelle-c-palmer-ceo-kneehigh-theatre-said">Michelle C-Palmer, CEO, Kneehigh Theatre, said:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The overnight loss of box office income and international touring placed our company into a precariously vulnerable position. Throughout the last six months we have continued to create, releasing our first film, The Neon shadow, launching new stories on our Walk With Me app, and setting creative challenges to thousands online in our Windows to the World project. Securing Cultural Recovery Funding will now enable Kneehigh to reimagine its operating model, reignite its creativity and prepare the company to present its work in front of live audiences once again - and we can’t wait.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Kneehigh would welcome the chance to tour the world again, meanwhile…we’ve reinvented! We have focussed on our creative space - the barns - a space for artists to seed, develop and embrace ideas. We have recently prototyped outdoor performance by firelight: Calvino Nights blazed under the stars and has the real potential to live stream globally. We plan to re-open our Asylum venue in Cornwall next year - a welcoming space predisposed to magic-music, food, drink, welcoming faces and a host of daring performances.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Kneehigh remain an inspiration for many throughout the sector, they’ve never got “stuck” and have always been quick to adapt to new challenges.  Their mission to remain local whilst telling stories that reflect all our lives is vital in helping us all through these unprecedented times</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This grant truly provides Paraorchestra with a financial lifeline. We are tremendously grateful to DCMS and to The Treasury for recognising the immeasurable value that culture brings to this country, not just economically but in terms of the joy and purpose it brings to the population at large. We will now be able to re-ignite our artistic work, creating rich music experiences across a range of spaces and places over the next six months and beyond, with a perfectly integrated orchestra of professional disabled and non-disabled musicians. We are fully committed to seeing an inclusive recovery from the pandemic and this grant will help us continue our on-going work to ensure that none of our disabled musicians will be left behind as the industry builds back better.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The team at Create Studios are absolutely delighted to have been supported by the Culture Recovery Fund and ACE to be able to anchor our mission to grow diverse talent for the Digital Creative Industries.  Our outreach, talent and diverse heritage commitment to Swindon and the region has been secured by the grant.  We are excited that this grant will enable us to appoint 2 apprentice roles for young people and  have 2 new members in our team to extend our outreach and practice in response to Covid. Most importantly we can support freelance roles that are the life-blood of the creative sector.  This grant is a game-changer for Create and for our offer to Swindon’s community. Thank you.</p>

<h3 id="helen-shute-chief-executive-rambert-said">Helen Shute, Chief Executive, Rambert, said:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We are delighted and uplifted to see the recovery funds are reaching arts organisations today. The support of small as well as large organisations and regional theatres, many of whom are our touring partners and who play an essential role in providing access to the arts across the country is particularly welcomed.  The support of small local London organisations such as Theatre Peckham with whom we are proud to be working ensures that the integral role they play in helping diversify the sector is allowed to continue throughout the crisis and beyond.</p>
