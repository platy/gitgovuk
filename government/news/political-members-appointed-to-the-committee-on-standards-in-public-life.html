<p>Notes:</p>

<p>The Committee on Standards in Public Life:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Committee on Standards in Public Life (CSPL) is an independent advisory non-departmental public body that advises the Prime Minister on ethical standards across the whole of public life in the UK. It conducts broad inquiries, collecting evidence to assess institutions, policies and practices and makes recommendations to the Prime Minister where appropriate.</li>
  <li>The Committee promotes the Principles of Public Life, which outline the ethical standards those working in the public sector are expected to adhere to. The Principles apply to all public office holders and private and voluntary organisations delivering services paid for by public funds.</li>
</ul>

<p>Political Members are appointed for three-year renewable terms. More information about CSPL can be found on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/the-committee-on-standards-in-public-life">their website</a>.</p>
