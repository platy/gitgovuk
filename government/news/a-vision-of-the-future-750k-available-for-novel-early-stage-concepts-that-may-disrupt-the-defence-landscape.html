<abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> has launched a new Themed Competition: Disruptive Science and Technology Impacting the Future of Defence</li>
  <li>Funded by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (<abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>).</li>
  <li>Up to £750k funding available for disruptive, early stage ideas and concepts may be used as the basis for further research within the Defence Science and Technology Futures (<abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Futures">DSTF</abbr>) Programme</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-and-security-accelerator">Defence and Security Accelerator</a> (<abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr>) is pleased to launch a new Themed Competition, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/disruptive-science-and-technology-impacting-the-future-of-defence">Disruptive Science and Technology Impacting the Future of Defence</a>. Run on behalf of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-science-and-technology-laboratory">Defence Science and Technology Laboratory</a> (<abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>), this competition seeks exciting concepts, technologies, or ideas that may disrupt the future of defence.</p>

<p>The outcome of this competition is anticipated to be a pool of novel Science and Technology (<abbr title="Science and Technology">S&amp;T</abbr>) ideas / concepts that may disrupt the defence landscape and have the potential to lead to radical change.</p>

<h2>Key dates and funding</h2>

<p>£750k (exc. <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>) funding is available for this Themed Competition. The value of each funded submission is £50k.</p>

<p>The deadline to submit a proposal is midday (<abbr title="British Summer Time">BST</abbr>) 12 October 2022</p>

<p>Do you have a disruptive idea or concept? <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/disruptive-science-and-technology-impacting-the-future-of-defence">Read the full competition document and submit a proposa</a>l.</p>

<h2>Getting ready for the technologies that will shape the future defence landscape</h2>

<p>The Defence Science and Technology Futures (<abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Futures">DSTF</abbr>) Programme identifies novel early stage research which may have a significant game-changing or disruptive impact on future military capability.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Futures">DSTF</abbr> Programme recognises the need to look beyond the current, developed science and technology landscape, and this Themed Competition has been launched to support this need.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> and <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> seek ideas that may underpin generation-after-next technology, concepts or approaches and could disrupt traditional technologies or ways of thinking. Proposals submitted to this competition will help defence understand how current novel Science and Technology (<abbr title="Science and Technology">S&amp;T</abbr>) might develop and impact defence priorities, to help plan for the future, combat threats and take advantage of opportunities.</p>

<p>We are interested in low Technology Readiness Level (<abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr>) ideas (<abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> 1-2) from any discipline. Proposals submitted for this competition do not need to fulfil contemporary defence requirements.</p>

<h2>Requirement areas</h2>

<p>This competition has one requirement area.</p>

<h4>Requirement 1: Evaluating Disruptive <abbr title="Science and Technology">S&amp;T</abbr> ideas and their impact on the Future of Defence</h4>

<p>The goal of this requirement is to help <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> develop an understanding of ideas to help determine their potential to be disruptive. Proposals should examine how the idea may fit within the future defence landscape, rather than the confines of contemporary technologies and capabilities.</p>

<p>Ideas that might help solve this requirement include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>early stage science and technology that currently do not have a defence application</li>
  <li>ideas identified through horizon scanning or technology watch, that may be disruptive and should be researched further</li>
  <li>ideas developed through brainstorming or other workshopping approaches that may have the potential to disrupt the future defence landscape but are at a very low Technology Readiness Level (<abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> 1-2)</li>
</ul>

<p>Any ideas submitted to this requirement must have a theoretical basis supported by reasoned explanation.</p>

<h2>Webinar</h2>

<h4>21 September 2022</h4>
<p>This webinar will provide more information on the challenge areas and how to submit a proposal. There will also be an opportunity to ask questions in the <abbr title="Question and Answer">Q&amp;A</abbr>. If you would like to get involved, please register on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/disruptive-st-impacting-the-future-of-defence-qa-session-tickets-407999065187" rel="external"><abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> Eventbrite page</a>.</p>
