  <li>new research shows huge growth in the zero emission vehicles market since the start of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s <abbr title="Conference of the Parties">COP</abbr>26 zero emission vehicle campaign, as industry leaders commit to go further and faster</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>All new heavy goods vehicles in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> will be zero-emission by 2040, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> government has confirmed today (10 November 2021). This, combined with the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s 2030 phase out for petrol and diesel cars and vans, represents a world-leading pledge to end the sale of all polluting road vehicles within the next 2 decades.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> will become the first country in the world to commit to phasing out new, non-zero emission heavy goods vehicles weighing 26 tonnes and under by 2035, with all new <abbr title="heavy goods vehicles">HGVs</abbr> sold in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to be zero emission by 2040.</p>

<p>This comes as new research from Bloomberg New Energy Finance, commissioned by the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="Conference of the Parties">COP</abbr> Presidency and published today, shows the progress made in the passenger vehicle market:</p>

<ul>
  <li>31% of the global passenger vehicle market is now covered by vehicle manufacturer commitments to end sales of fossil-fuel-powered vehicles, up from a near-zero share of the market at the start of 2021</li>
  <li>global sales of zero emission vehicles (<abbr title="zero emission vehicles">ZEVs</abbr>) have grown dramatically since 2019 from 2.1 million to 5.3 million</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="zero emission vehicles">ZEVs</abbr> are forecast to be 70% of all new car sales in 2040, with this projection having doubled in the last 5 years</li>
  <li>19% of 2020 passenger vehicles sales were in countries that now have an internal combustion engine (<abbr title="internal combustion engine">ICE</abbr>) phase-out date, up from 5% in 2019</li>
</ul>

<p>A group of ministers and industry leaders committed to working towards <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cop26-declaration-zero-emission-cars-and-vans" class="govuk-link">100% zero emission new car and van sales by 2040 or earlier</a> met at Transport Day at <abbr title="the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties">COP26</abbr>. Thirty-four countries, 6 major vehicle manufacturers (<abbr title="General Motors Company">GM</abbr>, Ford, Mercedes, BYD, Volvo, <abbr title="Jaguar Land Rover">JLR</abbr>), 41 cities, states and regions, 28 fleets and 13 investors all jointly set out their determination for all new car and van sales to be zero emission by 2040 globally and 2035 in leading markets.</p>

<p>In this group, companies like Sainsbury’s and countries including El Salvador and New Zealand are today making new commitments to 100% zero emission vehicles. They follow proposals made by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, Chile, Canada and a number of <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> states this year to ensure all new cars are zero emission by 2035. Also announced today, a number of emerging markets and developing economies have committed to work to accelerate the adoption of zero emission vehicles in their markets, including India, Ghana, Kenya, Paraguay, Rwanda and Turkey.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> government is also unveiling a new design for electric vehicle chargepoints, which could become as iconic as the Great British post box, London bus or black cab. Showcased in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Pavilion at <abbr title="the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties">COP26</abbr> and designed together with the Royal College of Art and PA Consulting, the concept prioritises inclusivity and ease of use, designed with consumers, local government, accessibility groups and industry.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="New design for electric vehicle chargepoints." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/135064/ev-charge-point.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>The design concept will provide greater choice to industry and local government, as well as raise awareness and generate excitement around electric vehicles, as we build one of the most convenient, affordable and reliable charging networks in the world. This builds on our goal to make sure everyone benefits from the transition to zero emission transport. <abbr title="zero emission vehicles">ZEVs</abbr> are already cheaper to run in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> than petrol or diesel cars and are expected to become cheaper to buy in the coming years.</p>

<p>As one of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cop26-world-leaders-summit-statement-on-the-breakthrough-agenda-2-november-2021/cop26-world-leaders-summit-statement-on-the-breakthrough-agenda#the-glasgow-breakthroughs">new Glasgow Breakthroughs</a> launched by the Prime Minister at the World Leaders Summit, 30 countries have agreed to work together to make zero emission vehicles the new normal by making them accessible, affordable, and sustainable in all regions by 2030 or sooner.</p>

<p>This goal is guiding the Zero Emission Vehicle Transition Council (<abbr title="Zero Emission Vehicle Transition Council">ZEVTC</abbr>), which will today meet with distinguished representatives, including experts on the transition in emerging markets and developing economies, to discuss how international collaboration can support a global transition. The council will launch its first annual action plan, which sets out areas for sustained international cooperation to accelerate the transition during 2022. Also announced today, the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> will join the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> as co-chair of the <abbr title="Zero Emission Vehicle Transition Council">ZEVTC</abbr>, reflecting the council’s growing ambition over the coming years.</p>

<p>Several initiatives are being launched today to help ensure a global and equitable transition to <abbr title="zero emission vehicles">ZEVs</abbr> and support the acceleration of transport decarbonisation. This includes the World Bank’s Global Facility to Decarbonise Transport – a multi-donor trust fund that will mobilise <abbr title="United States">US</abbr>$200 million over the next 10 years to support the decarbonisation of road transport in emerging markets and developing economies in the Global South. Today, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> announced a £4 million initial contribution to the fund, which will support these countries to accelerate the decarbonisation of transport and build greener and more resilient economies.</p>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From our roads to the skies, the transition to zero emission transport has reached a tipping point. We know that transport plays a key role saving the planet from warming above 1.5°C, which is why this is the <abbr title="Conference of the Parties">COP</abbr> that will kick start our ambition for zero emission aviation and why I’m proud to be uniting world leaders to tackle climate change – creating new opportunities for clean growth, green jobs and improved air quality right across the globe.</p>

  <p class="last-child">To support the transition to <abbr title="electric vehicles">EVs</abbr>, it’s integral that we have the infrastructure to support it. My vision is for the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to have one of the best EV infrastructure networks in the world, with excellent British design at its heart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Twenty-three states from across the world, representing over 40% of global aviation emissions, have also today committed to work together to achieve an ambitious new aviation decarbonisation target through the International Civil Aviation Organization, as part of a new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cop-26-declaration-international-aviation-climate-ambition-coalition" class="govuk-link">International Aviation Climate Ambition Coalition</a>. Together with the World Economic Forum and other governments, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> is also leading efforts to accelerate the global uptake of sustainable aviation fuels.</p>

<p>Twenty-two governments have also stated their intent to support the establishment of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cop-26-clydebank-declaration-for-green-shipping-corridors" class="govuk-link">green shipping corridors</a> – zero-emission shipping routes between 2 ports. This will involve deploying zero-emission vessel technologies and putting alternative fuel and charging infrastructure in place in ports to allow for zero emission shipping on key routes across the globe. This could in turn mean that taking a zero emission ferry could be part of our holidays, or that everyday household goods, including food and clothes, could soon arrive on zero emission ships.</p>

<p>Twenty-eight offshore wind industry stakeholders have committed to work together toward making <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/decarbonising-offshore-wind-operations-and-maintenance-roadmap" class="govuk-link">zero emission operations and maintenance vessels</a> a reality in the North Sea by 2025.</p>

<p>British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (<abbr title="British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association">BVRLA</abbr>) Chief Executive, Gerry Keaney, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today’s announcement is a welcome update and will support the industry in its drive towards decarbonisation. <abbr title="British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association">BVRLA</abbr> members are already leading the way in making positive changes and it’s vital that regulations acknowledge the different challenges experienced from one vehicle type to another.</p>

  <p>Use cases of <abbr title="heavy goods vehicles">HGVs</abbr> vary significantly, so we welcome the government’s intention to consult on derogations that will enable a fair and achievable transition. The <abbr title="British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association">BVRLA</abbr> looks forward to working with the government on the delivery plan that will be essential in ensuring the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> road transport network can be decarbonised successfully.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The approach must be comprehensive, particularly around <abbr title="heavy goods vehicles">HGVs</abbr> where the barriers remain huge. The recent funding that was announced to support trials of zero emission technology for the sector is a very positive step, and we eagerly await the clarity this will bring to help meet the phase-out dates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Olly Craughan, Head of Corporate Social Responsibility at DPDgroup <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="Limited">Ltd</abbr> said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We totally support the withdrawal of the selling of new, non-zero emission <abbr title="heavy goods vehicles">HGVs</abbr> in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> by 2035, as we do the sale of new diesel/petrol final mile fleet vehicles by 2030. We would urge all parties involved in the supply of alternative green <abbr title="heavy goods vehicles">HGVs</abbr> to press the fast forward button on their development plans so businesses like ourselves can make the transition as soon as possible.</p>

  <p class="last-child">DPD is one of the brands leading the way on the decarbonisation of fleets but bringing down the cost of green <abbr title="heavy goods vehicles">HGVs</abbr> and creating adequate supply will be essential to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> hitting this target.</p>
