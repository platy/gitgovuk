<p>The UK Government has today [Friday 16 October], opened a new walk-through coronavirus testing centre in Dundee. Located in the Park Place car park in the city centre, the site is easily accessible for people without a car.</p>

<p>The new facility is being provided by the UK Government as part of a UK-wide drive to continue to improve the accessibility of coronavirus testing for local communities. It is operated by Mitie on behalf of the UK Government.</p>

<p>The Dundee site is the first self-cleaning facility in Scotland. This involves decontaminating each testing cubicle with dry mist between each use - helping to speed up the cleaning process and increase the testing capacity.</p>

<p>The test centre is part of the largest network of diagnostic testing facilities created in British history. In Scotland, this comprises of six drive-through sites, eight walk-through sites, 21 mobile units, plus the Glasgow Lighthouse Lab which is working round the clock to process samples.</p>

<p>In Scotland, the UK Government is providing all COVID testing and test processing outside of the NHS. Around two-thirds of all daily tests are provided by the UK Government, in support of Scotland’s health services.</p>

<p>Tests must be booked in advance at <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/test-and-protect" class="govuk-link">www.nhsinform.scot/test-and-protect</a> or by calling 0800 028 2816. People should only book a test if they have coronavirus symptoms: a high temperature, a new and continuous cough, or a loss or change to their sense of smell or taste.</p>

<p>Health Minister Lord Bethell said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We continue to expand UK Government testing to make sure that everyone with symptoms can get a test, with our new walk-in sites making it even easier no matter where you live.</p>

  <p>This new site forms part of our UK testing network, which has the capacity to test more than a million people a week and is growing all the time.</p>

  <p>If you have symptoms of coronavirus, I urge you to book a test today, and follow the advice of contact tracers if you are contacted to protect others around you and stop the spread of the virus.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This is a UK-wide effort and we are proud to be working with a number of partners to turn this ambition into a reality and roll out additional capacity to where it is needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Baroness Dido Harding, Interim Executive Chair of the National Institute for Health Protection, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The UK Government’s new walk-through sites offer communities better access to coronavirus testing, so everyone with symptoms can get a test. This new site is part of our ongoing work to expand testing across the UK to deliver 500,000 tests a day by the end of October.</p>

  <p>Please book a test if you have coronavirus symptoms: a new continuous cough, a high temperature and a loss or change in sense of smell or taste.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Everybody should continue to think: ‘hands, face, space’, and follow the advice of contact tracers if you are contacted – this is the only way we can return to a more normal way of life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>UK Government Minister for Scotland, Iain Stewart, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The UK Government is helping all parts of the UK fight the coronavirus pandemic</p>

  <p>Testing is vital, helping to manage local outbreaks and protecting people’s livelihoods. The UK Government is providing the bulk of Covid testing in Scotland, and this new walk-through centre is just the latest in our extensive testing network.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We are pleased to be working with local and commercial partners. These sites are not possible without the hard work of many people. I would like to thank everyone involved for their incredible efforts for the good of the country at this difficult time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simon Venn, Mitie Chief Government & Strategy Officer, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our priority during the pandemic is to support the nation’s efforts to fight COVID-19 and help keep the country running. Testing is a critical part of the UK’s strategy to combat coronavirus and we’re proud to support the UK Government with this vital task.</p>

  <p class="last-child">A big thank you to all the NHS staff, Mitie employees and other frontline heroes in Dundee, who are working tirelessly to keep us all safe.</p>
