<p>Four DIT non-executive board members with extensive experience in investment, business and international affairs, were announced today (1 December) by International Trade Secretary Liz Truss.</p>

<p>The new members have been appointed for at least 3 years and will provide independent advice, support and scrutiny on the department’s work, to support the Government’s ambitious trade policy agenda.</p>

<p>They will help the department execute its key priorities including striking free trade agreements in markets around the world, operating our own trading system after the transition period, boosting exports and investment across the UK, and championing free trade and shaping global trading rules.</p>

<p>The new board members are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Andrew Hood, Founding partner at Oxford Research & Analysis, announced as lead non-executive board member</li>
  <li>Dominic Johnson, Founding Partner and Chief Executive at Somerset Capital Management, announced as chair of the Audit and Risk  Assurance Committee</li>
  <li>Dr Dambisa Moyo, Economist and Author, will become a new non-executive board member</li>
  <li>Douglas Carswell, former Member of Parliament for Clacton, will become a new non-executive board member</li>
</ul>

<p>Founding partner at Oxford Research & Analysis, Andrew Hood, will take on the role of Lead non-executive board member, after facing strong competition from a high number of candidates.</p>

<p>He will be joined by Dominic Johnson, who will replace Julie Currie as Chair of the Audit and Risk Assurance Committee, and by Dr Dambisa Moyo and Douglas Carswell, who will sit on the DIT Department Board.</p>

<p>Sir Stephen O’Brien, and Noel Harwerth will continue in their roles as Non-Executive Board Members.</p>

<h2 id="international-trade-secretary-liz-truss-said">International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said:</h2>
<blockquote>

  <p>These appointments bring vast experience and expertise to the department at a critical time for the UK as a trading nation.</p>

  <p>They will help execute our strategic priorities, in particular driving forward our trade deal negotiations programme, our export and investment campaigns, and our work on reforming and reshaping global trade rules.</p>

  <p class="last-child">All of them are high quality appointments who believe fiercely in rules-based free trade. They will play a big role in re-establishing the UK as a major force in global trade, and will help take our trade agenda to the next level in 2021 and beyond.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The non-executive board members were appointed following an open and fair selection process. There are now six non-executive board members.</p>
