<p>Defra Ministers have appointed three new Trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens (RGB), Kew. Steve Almond, Kate Priestman and John Scanlon’s three-year terms commenced on 1 April 2022.</p>

<p>The appointments were made in accordance with the Governance Code on Public Appointments published by the Cabinet Office. All appointments are made on merit and political activity plays no part in the selection process.</p>

  <p>I am delighted to welcome Steve, Kate and John to the Board of Trustees. They all bring strong and diverse expertise and experience to the Board, and I very much look forward to working with them.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This is an important time for Kew, as we build on our highly impactful presence at COP26, deliver our ambitious Manifesto for Change and new Science Strategy and continue to play a major role globally in addressing the twin crises of climate change and biodiversity loss.</p>
