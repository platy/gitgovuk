<p>The Home Office has today (11 February 2021) announced it has hit the milestone of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/eu-settlement-scheme-statistics" class="govuk-link">five million applications</a>  to the EU Settlement Scheme with four months still to go before the deadline of 30 June 2021.</p>

<p>This includes more than 4.5 million applications from England, 252,400 from Scotland, 83,800 from Wales and 81,800 from Northern Ireland up to 31 January 2021.</p>

<p>More than 4.5 million grants of status have also been made, delivering on the government’s promise to secure the rights of millions of Europeans in UK law for years to come.</p>

<p>A further £4.5 million of funding has been announced today for the network of 72 organisations across the UK who support the vulnerable and hard to reach in applying to the scheme. This is on top of the £17 million already provided.</p>

<p>Home Secretary Priti Patel said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">It is fantastic news that over 5 million people have applied to the hugely successful EU Settlement Scheme. It’s the biggest scheme of its kind in UK history and will mean European citizens and their families can continue to call the UK home.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Minister for Future Borders and Immigration Kevin Foster said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s great news there have been more than five million applications to the EU Settlement Scheme ahead of the 30 June deadline.</p>

  <p>My message to European citizens and their family members is simple – apply now and join the millions who have already been through the simple process to secure their status.</p>

  <p class="last-child">There is plenty of support available and the new funding announced today means no stone will be left unturned in ensuring everyone gets the help they need.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Home Office has also launched a new £1.5 million wave of UK advertising to ensure EU citizens and their family members are aware of the deadline and know they need to apply. This builds on the successful £4.6 million campaign already delivered with targeted adverts soon to appear on social media, website banners, catch up TV and radio.</p>

<p>The new £4.5 million grant funding announced today means that 72 organisations across the UK will continue to provide invaluable support to help vulnerable and hard to reach individuals and groups <a href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families" class="govuk-link">apply to the EU Settlement Scheme</a>. This includes victims of human trafficking or domestic abuse, those with severe mental health conditions, those without a permanent address, and those who are elderly or isolated.</p>

<p>Home Office Minister Kevin Foster will meet four of these grant funded organisations from across England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales later today and commend the exemplary support they have been providing to help vulnerable EU citizens apply to the EU Settlement Scheme.</p>

<p>Deputy CEO at Advice NI in Northern Ireland Fiona Magee said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Advice NI has already helped more than 30,000 people in Northern Ireland to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme and the Home Office funding allows us to continue this important work with the more vulnerable in society including the elderly, isolated or those who lack IT literacy skills.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chief Executive of Citizens Advice Scotland Derek Mitchell said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The Citizens Advice network in Scotland has played a vital role in providing free, impartial and confidential advice on the EU Settlement Scheme to over 11,000 people.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Our team of specialist advisers continue to provide support during the coronavirus pandemic through our national helpline and we are pleased to partner with the UK government in delivering this important service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trudy Aspinwall, EUSS Project Manager at TGP Cymru in Wales, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We provide EU Settlement Scheme application and post-application support to Roma communities across Wales.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We’ve already supported more than 1,000 people to apply and the new Home Office funding will help us to continue our vital work to ensure that no one in Wales is left behind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Matthew Evans, Director at The AIRE Centre in England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The AIRE Centre provides online legal advice and telephone support to help people apply to the EU Settlement Scheme and we have already engaged with more than 6,000 people but we know we need to do more.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We are determined to build on that success and with the help of Home Office funding we have worked with Centrepoint and New Europeans with the assistance of commercial and pro bono support to develop online tools specifically to assist young people apply to the scheme.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Home Office also has a dedicated team of more than 1,500 people working on the EU Settlement Scheme, with support available seven days a week by telephone and by email.</p>

<p>The EU Settlement Scheme uses cutting edge technology, including the EU Exit: ID Document Check app which allows people to apply from the comfort of their own home in as little as 15 minutes.</p>
