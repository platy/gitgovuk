<p>Two separate consultations have been launched today (28 June 2022) related to the proposed acquisition of Meggitt plc, a UK aerospace company, by Parker-Hannifin.</p>

<p>The consultations are to address both the national security and competition concerns raised by the proposed deal.</p>

<p>Parker-Hannifin is a US-headquartered company which supplies components to the mobile, industrial and aerospace markets globally, including in the UK. It is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>The Business Secretary is minded to accept undertakings offered by Parker-Hannifin to address the concerns.</p>

<p>This decision follows advice from the Ministry of Defence and the Competition and Markets Authority.</p>

<p>The proposed undertakings are now out for public consultation until 11:45pm on 13 July 2022, in accordance with the process set out in the Enterprise Act 2002.</p>

<p>No decision will be taken by the Business Secretary until the consultation has concluded and the representations have been carefully considered.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/proposed-acquisition-of-meggitt-plc-by-parker-hannifin-draft-public-interest-undertakings">full text of the proposed national security undertakings</a> can be found on GOV.UK. In summary they would deliver:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Security of Supply: ensuring that Parker will commit to honouring existing contracts while they are in place and will notify the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> in advance if there is a material change to Meggitt’s ability to supply the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Information Security: reinforcing the commitment to existing List X / Facility Security Clearance site security arrangements protecting sensitive <abbr title="Her Majesty's">HM</abbr> government information in Meggitt, including a requirement to retain a majority of the Board of Directors of Meggitt as UK nationals resident in the UK</li>
  <li>Sovereign UK Capabilities: requiring Parker-Hannifin to institute an <abbr title="Her Majesty's">HM</abbr> government-approved control plan to prevent International Traffic in Arms Regulations (<abbr title="International Traffic in Arms Regulations">ITAR</abbr>) controls applying to <abbr title="International Traffic in Arms Regulations">ITAR</abbr>-free products designed and manufactured by Meggitt. The undertakings would allow the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> to add new technology to future-proof the remedy</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/proposed-acquisition-of-meggitt-plc-by-parker-hannifin-draft-competition-undertakings">full text of the proposed competition undertakings</a> can be found on GOV.UK. In summary they would deliver the divestment of Parker’s aircraft wheels and brakes (‘<abbr title="aircraft wheels and brakes">AWB</abbr>’) division (the ‘Divestment Business’) to a purchaser approved by the Secretary of State. The Divestment Business includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all tangible assets (including the production site of the <abbr title="aircraft wheels and brakes">AWB</abbr> division located at Avon, Ohio, <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr>, as well as the relevant inventory and equipment) and intangible assets (including intellectual property rights)</li>
  <li>all licences, permits, authorisations issued by any governmental organisation for the benefit of the Divestment Business</li>
  <li>all contracts, leases, commitments, and customer orders of the Divestment Business</li>
  <li>all customers credit and other records of the Divestment Business</li>
  <li>all staff currently employed by the Divestment Business, including staff seconded to the Divestment Business, shared personnel as well as certain additional personnel</li>
</ul>

<p>These decisions on the national security and competition considerations are separate to any discussions on the wider economic implications of the proposed merger.</p>

<p>The Business Secretary’s decisions are made in a quasi-judicial capacity, which means that the Secretary of State must act, and be seen to act, in a scrupulously fair and impartial manner.</p>
