  <li>9 in 10 of those aged 75 and over in England have received their first dose</li>
  <li>vaccines offered to all elderly care home residents and staff in England and Wales</li>
</ul>

<p>More than 10 million people in the UK have received their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, marking a significant milestone for the largest vaccination programme in British history.</p>

<p>Figures out today show the NHS vaccinated a total of 10,021,471 million people between 8 December 2020 and 2 February 2021, including 9 in 10 people aged 75 and over in England.</p>

<p>This is equivalent to vaccinating the total capacity of 111 Wembley stadiums in just 8 weeks and is an important step towards hitting the Prime Minister’s target of offering vaccines to the top 4 priority groups by the middle of February.</p>

<p>These top 4 groups account for 88% of COVID deaths, which is why the vaccines will play such a crucial role in saving lives and reducing the demand on the NHS.</p>

<p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This terrific achievement is testament to the monumental effort of NHS workers, volunteers and the armed forces who have been working tirelessly in every corner of the UK to deliver the largest vaccination programme in our history. Every jab makes us all a bit safer – I want to thank everyone for playing their part.</p>

  <p>Vaccines are the way out of this pandemic. The unprecedented national effort we have seen right across the United Kingdom means the majority of our most vulnerable people are now inoculated against this awful disease.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The UK government has worked rapidly to secure and deliver doses to all of the UK, demonstrating the strength of our union and what we can achieve together.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vaccines have been offered to all elderly care home residents and staff in England and Wales, with staff returning to homes where residents may have been unable to get a vaccine due to medical conditions, or because of a local outbreak.</p>

<p>A study published in the Lancet today shows <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-02-02-oxford-coronavirus-vaccine-shows-sustained-protection-76-during-3-month-interval">the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine provides a sustained protection of 76% during the 12-week interval between the first and second dose</a>. It is also the first study to show the vaccine may substantially reduce transmission, suggesting those who have already been immunised with this vaccine cannot infect others.</p>

<p>All vaccines being used in the UK have undergone robust clinical trials and have met the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency’s strict standards of safety, effectiveness and quality.</p>

<p>The vaccination programme continues to expand, with thousands of vaccination centres open – ranging from GP and pharmacy-led services to hospitals and large-scale vaccination centres – to provide easy access to those eligible, regardless of where they live.</p>

<p>Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The UK’s vaccination programme is in full swing and almost 1 in 6 people across the UK are already protected from serious illness.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The NHS is doing everything it can to protect the most vulnerable and will continue to expand the vaccination programme ever further in the coming weeks to save as many lives as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The public has a vital part to play in the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and the government has called on people to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>help out: help those eligible for the vaccine by supporting friends, family and loved ones with their appointments, as well as volunteering to help those in the community</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>join up: sign up to clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines, as well as treatments</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>stay informed: keep up to date with accurate and trusted NHS advice and make sure to share the facts with friends and family</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are many people and groups responsible for the UK’s vaccination programme, and we owe our thanks to our brilliant scientists, to Kate Bingham and the Vaccine Task Force which has procured over 400 million doses of seven different types of vaccine, to the manufacturers and the delivery drivers, the pharmacists, the military medics, countless volunteers.</p>

  <p>But to get this life-saving medicine into the arms of the nation at the kind of speed that we’re seeing, we are relying on the doctors, nurses and all the staff of our NHS.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It is thanks to their effort – the most colossal in the history of our National Health Service – that we have today passed the milestone of 10 million vaccinations in the United Kingdom, including almost 90% of those aged 75 and over in England and every eligible person in a care home.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Background information</h2>

<p>A total number of 10,021,471 have <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/healthcare">received the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine</a> in the UK. 498,962 people have received their second jab.</p>

<p>Through the government’s Vaccines Taskforce, the UK has secured early access to 407 million doses of 7 of the most promising vaccine candidates, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>BioNTech/Pfizer for 40 million doses</li>
  <li>Oxford/AstraZeneca for 100 million doses</li>
  <li>Moderna for 17 million doses</li>
  <li>GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi Pasteur for 60 million doses</li>
  <li>Novavax for 60 million doses</li>
  <li>Janssen for 30 million doses</li>
  <li>Valneva for 100 million doses</li>
</ul>

<p>To date, the government has invested over £300 million into manufacturing a successful vaccine to enable a rapid roll out.</p>

<p>The UK government is committed to supporting equitable access to vaccines worldwide. The UK is the largest donor to the COVAX facility, the global mechanism to help developing countries access a coronavirus vaccine, and has committed £548 million in UK aid to help distribute 1.3 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines to 92 developing countries this year.</p>
