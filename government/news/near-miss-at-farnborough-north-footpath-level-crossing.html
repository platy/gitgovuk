<p>At around 08:22 hrs on 19 May 2022, the 07:02 hrs Great Western Railway service from Gatwick Airport to Reading was approaching Farnborough North station at around 70 mph. As the train approached, the driver observed a large group of people using the footpath crossing at the station. The driver sounded the train’s horn and made an emergency brake application, but the crossing did not become clear of users until about five seconds before the train passed over it. No-one was hurt in the incident.</p>

<p>The footpath crossing at Farnborough North station is fitted with gates and miniature stop lights. These lights show a red aspect to pedestrians when trains are approaching, and the crossing should not be used with this red aspect showing. The gates at the crossing are also fitted with magnetic locks, which are operated by a level crossing attendant between 05:30 and 00:30 hrs. These locks are intended to prevent an already closed gate from being opened by users and are activated when a red aspect is being displayed on the miniature stop lights.</p>

<p>The train involved in the incident would normally have stopped at Farnborough North station but had been made a non-stopping service due to earlier disruption. The arrival of the train was not indicated on passenger information screens installed on the platforms.</p>

<p>Our investigation will seek to identify the sequence of events which led to this incident. It will also consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the method of working at this crossing, including the role of the level crossing attendant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the level crossing risk assessment process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the history of this crossing, including the response to previous incidents and how plans to replace it were realised.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any underlying management factors.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Our investigation is independent of any investigation by the railway industry or by the industry’s regulator, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.orr.gov.uk/" rel="external">Office of Rail and Road</a>.</p>

<p>We will publish our findings, including any recommendations to improve safety, at the conclusion of our investigation. This report will be available on our website.</p>
