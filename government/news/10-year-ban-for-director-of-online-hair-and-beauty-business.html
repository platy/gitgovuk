<p>Grigorijs Hacaturjancs, 34 and originally from Latvia, has been disqualified as a director for 10 years after fraudulently claiming a £50,000 Bounce Back Loan.</p>

<p>Grigorijs Hacaturjancs was director of Beauty&amp;Melody Shop Ltd which was incorporated in 2015 and operated as an online retailer for hair and beauty products. The company was not related to the London-based chain of hair and beauty salons of the same name.</p>

<p>Despite company accounts showing that the company had ceased trading in 2019 and had shut down its website, Hacaturjancs applied for a £50,000 Bounce Back Loan (BBL) in May 2020 on behalf of the company.</p>

<p>Businesses were only eligible for support through the BBL scheme if they had been adversely impacted by the pandemic lockdown, meaning online-only retailers such as Beauty&amp;Melody could not apply.</p>

<p>In addition to Hacaturjancs’ business being ineligible, he inflated the company’s turnover on the BBL application in order to secure the maximum £50,000 available through the scheme.</p>

<p>Beauty&amp;Melody went into voluntary liquidation in July 2021 shortly after which the liquidator passed on concerns to the Insolvency Service regarding Grigorijs Hacaturjancs’ conduct.</p>

<p>Investigators discovered that the last sale by Beauty&amp;Melody was on 23 March 2019, with no further money being paid into the company bank account after that date until the receipt of the £50,000 Bounce Back Loan in May 2020.</p>

<p>Just two weeks after this, a payment of nearly £50,000 was made to a company based in Slovakia. Hacaturjancs told investigators that this was to a company supplier, although Beauty&amp;Melody had never done business with this company before, and it received no goods or services in return for the payment.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy accepted a disqualification undertaking from Grigorijs Hacaturjancs, after he admitted his company had been insolvent in 2019 on a balance sheet basis and also that he did not carry out adequately checks on the new Slovakia-based supplier.</p>

<p>His disqualification is effective from 12 July 2022 and lasts for 10 years.</p>

<p>The disqualification undertaking prevents Hacaturjancs from directly, or indirectly, becoming involved in the promotion, formation or management of a company, without the permission of the court.</p>

<p>Dave Elliott, Chief Investigator at the Insolvency Service said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Mr Hacaturjanc’s disqualification should act as a deterrent to others who think they can profit by obtaining taxpayer-backed loans to which they are not entitled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The liquidator has determined that Hacaturjancs has no personal assets, however the possibility of applying for a compensation order will remain under review.</p>

<h3>Notes to editors</h3>

<p>Grigorijs Hacaturjancs is a Latvian national and his date of birth is February 1988.</p>

<p>Beauty&amp;Melody Shop Ltd (Company number 09639900). The company traded online from https://www.beautyandmelody.shop.</p>

<p>A disqualification order has the effect that without specific permission of a court, a person with a disqualification cannot:</p>

<ul>
  <li>act as a director of a company</li>
  <li>take part, directly or indirectly, in the promotion, formation or management of a company or limited liability partnership</li>
  <li>be a receiver of a company’s property</li>
</ul>

<p>Disqualification undertakings are the administrative equivalent of a disqualification order but do not involve court proceedings.</p>

<p>Persons subject to a disqualification order are bound by a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/corporate-insolvency-effect-of-a-disqualification-order">range of other restrictions</a>.</p>
