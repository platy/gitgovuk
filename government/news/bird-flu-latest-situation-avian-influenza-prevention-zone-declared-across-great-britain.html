<p>The Chief Veterinary Officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have agreed to bring in new housing measures to protect poultry and captive birds from avian influenza following a number of confirmed cases across Great Britain in recent weeks.</p>

<p>The new housing measures, which will come into force on Monday 29 November, mean that it will be a legal requirement for all bird keepers across the UK to keep their birds indoors and to follow strict biosecurity measures in order to limit the spread of and eradicate the disease.</p>

<p>Wild birds migrating to the UK from mainland Europe during the winter months can carry the disease and this can lead to cases in poultry and other captive birds.</p>

<p>Housing measures have been in place <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fnews%2Fnew-prevention-zone-to-stop-spread-of-avian-influenza&amp;data=04%7C01%7CAngus.Anderson%40defra.gov.uk%7Cf80427d31ad541e811e508d9af2f2c86%7C770a245002274c6290c74e38537f1102%7C0%7C0%7C637733440773213933%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=faYqP%2BHRfli6XqerNyocH3QkxrfIEcuuW2YfUJZQ%2B6A%3D&amp;reserved=0">for parts of North Yorkshire</a> since 21 November following a number of confirmed and suspect cases of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry in the area.</p>

<p>Public health advice remains that the risk to human health from the virus is very low and food standards bodies advise that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. Do not touch or pick up any dead or sick birds that you find and instead report them to the relevant helpline below. There is no impact on the consumption of properly cooked poultry products including eggs.</p>

<p>Government Chief Veterinary Officers are encouraging bird keepers to use the next five days to prepare for the new housing measures, including taking steps to safeguard animal welfare, consult their vet and put up additional housing where necessary.</p>

<p>The additional housing measures build on the strengthened biosecurity regulations that were brought in across Great Britain as part of the Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) on 3 November 2021 and in and Northern Ireland on 17 November 2021.</p>

<p>The introduction of housing measures means that from 29 November, in addition to housing all poultry and captive birds, keepers must continue taking extra precautions to keep their flocks safe. This includes regularly cleaning and disinfecting equipment, clothing and vehicles when entering or exiting sites and limiting access to non-essential workers or visitors.</p>

<p>The Chief Veterinary Officers from across all four nations have worked together to introduce the new housing measures at the same time, meaning that the restrictions will be applied across the whole of the UK.</p>

<h3>UK Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>We have taken swift action to limit the spread of the disease but we are continuing to see a growing number of bird flu cases on farms and in backyard flocks across the country. Whether you keep just a few birds or thousands you must take action now to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It is now a legal requirement to keep your birds indoors to keep them separate from wild birds which spread the disease. It is also vital that you maintain strong biosecurity by regularly checking and maintaining sheds and cleaning and disinfecting footwear to limit the risk of the disease spreading. Don’t walk the virus into your hens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The introduction of the housing measures comes after the disease was detected in captive birds at a number of premises across Great Britain (full list of cases in England below).</p>

<p>Poultry and captive bird keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and seek prompt advice from their vet if they have any concerns.</p>

<h4>Poultry keepers must now do the following:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>house or net all poultry and captive birds to keep them separate from wild birds</li>
  <li>cleanse and disinfect clothing, footwear, equipment and vehicles before and after contact with poultry and captive birds – if practical, use disposable protective clothing</li>
  <li>reduce the movement of people, vehicles or equipment to and from areas where poultry and captive birds are kept, to minimise contamination from manure, slurry and other products, and use effective vermin control</li>
  <li>thoroughly cleanse and disinfect housing on a continuous basis</li>
  <li>keep fresh disinfectant at the right concentration at all farm and poultry housing entry and exit points</li>
  <li>minimise direct and indirect contact between poultry and captive birds and wild birds, including making sure all feed and water is not accessible to wild birds</li>
</ul>

<p>These new housing measures will be kept under regular review as part of the government’s work to protect flocks.</p>

<p>Do not touch or pick up any dead or sick birds that you find. If you find dead swans, geese or ducks or other dead wild birds, such as gulls or birds of prey, you should report them to the Defra helpline on 03459 33 55 77. For further information see our advice to the public.</p>

<p>Bird keepers should report suspicion of disease in England to Defra Rural Services Helpline on 03000 200 301, in Wales contact 0300 303 8268. In Scotland, contact your local Field Services Office. In Northern Ireland contact DAERA on 0300 200 7840. Keepers should familiarise themselves with our avian flu advice.</p>

<p>Avian influenza is in no way connected to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and is not carried in poultry or captive birds.</p>

<h3>Poultry shows, markets and gatherings:</h3>

<p>Gatherings of poultry, galliforme or anseriforme birds have also been banned. Galliforme birds include pheasants, partridge, quail, chickens, turkey and guinea fowl. Anseriforme birds include ducks, geese, and swans. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/bird-gatherings-licences">bird gatherings</a> guidance for further information.</p>

<h4>Wild birds:</h4>

<p>The Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) carries out year-round avian influenza surveillance of dead wild birds submitted through public reports and warden patrols. Our weekly findings of avian influenza in wild birds can be found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/avian-influenza-in-wild-birds" class="govuk-link">here</a>.</p>

<p>Poultry keepers and members of the public should report dead wild birds to Defra’s national dead wild bird helpline on 03459 33 55 77 (please select option 7) and keepers should report suspicion of disease to APHA on 03000 200 301. Keepers should familiarise themselves with our avian flu advice.</p>

Keepers with less than 50 birds are strongly encouraged to register. It is also a legal requirement to notify APHA of any significant changes in the average number of birds kept.</p>

<p>In Northern Ireland if you keep any birds, other than pet birds kept in the owner’s home, you need to make sure they are registered.</p>

<p>Avian Influenza is in no way connected to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus which is not carried in poultry.</p>
