<p>Following a number of detections of avian influenza (bird flu) in wild birds across Great Britain, the Chief Veterinary Officers from England, Scotland and Wales have declared an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) across the whole of Great Britain to mitigate the risk of the disease spreading amongst poultry and captive birds.</p>

<p>This means that from 5pm on Wednesday 3 November 2021 it will be a legal requirement for all bird keepers in Great Britain to follow strict biosecurity measures to help protect their flocks.</p>

<p>Keepers with more than 500 birds will need to restrict access for non-essential people on their sites, workers will need to change clothing and footwear before entering bird enclosures and site vehicles will need to be cleaned and disinfected regularly to limit the risk of the disease spreading.</p>

<p>Avian influenza circulates naturally in wild birds and when they migrate to the UK from mainland Europe over the winter they can spread the disease to poultry and other captive birds.</p>

<p>Backyard owners with smaller numbers of poultry including chickens, ducks and geese must also take <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu#biosecurity-advice" class="govuk-link">steps</a> to limit the risk of the disease spreading to their animals.</p>

<p>The UK health agencies advise that the risk to public health from the virus is very low and the UK food standards agencies advise that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat.</p>

<h4>In a joint statement the Chief Veterinary Officers for England, Scotland and Wales said:</h4>
<blockquote>

  <p>Following a number of detections of avian influenza in wild birds across Great Britain we have declared an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone across the whole of Great Britain. This means that all bird keepers must take action now to prevent the disease spreading to poultry and other domestic birds.</p>

  <p>Whether you keep just a few birds or thousands, you are now legally required to introduce higher biosecurity standards on your farm or small holding. It is in your interests to do so in order to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The UK health agencies have confirmed that the risk to public health is very low and UK food standards agencies advise that bird flu poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The introduction of the AIPZ comes after the disease was detected in captive birds at a number of premises across Great Britain.</p>

<h4>In England this includes:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>H5N1 (high pathogenic) avian influenza confirmed at a rescue centre near Droitwich in Worcestershire on 27 October.</li>
  <li>H5N1 (high pathogenic) avian influenza confirmed at a commercial poultry premises near Alcester in Warwickshire on 8 November.</li>
  <li>H5N1 (high pathogenic) avian influenza confirmed at an animal sanctuary near Frinton-on-Sea in Essex on 12 November.</li>
  <li>H5N1 (high pathogenic) avian influenza confirmed at a commercial poultry premises near Salwick in Lancashire on 14 November.</li>
  <li>H5N1 (high pathogenic) avian influenza confirmed at a commercial poultry premises near Leeming Bar in North Yorkshire on 14 November.</li>
  <li>H5N1 (highly pathogenic) avian influenza confirmed at a premises near Kirkham in Lancashire on 16 November.</li>
  <li>H5N1 (highly pathogenic) avian influenza confirmed in birds at a premises near Willington, South Derbyshire on 19 November.</li>
  <li>H5N1 (pathogenicity to be confirmed) avian influenza confirmed at a premises near Pokesdown, Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole on 19 November.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all cases the birds on site are humanely culled and Protection and Surveillance Zones are put in place to limit the risk of the disease spreading.</p>

<p>The risk level for avian influenza incursion in wild Birds in Great Britain has been raised from ‘medium’ to ‘high’. For poultry and captive birds the risk level has been raised from ‘low’ to ‘medium’ at premises where biosecurity is below the required standards, but remains ‘low’ where stringent biosecurity measures are applied.</p>

<p>The AIPZ now in force across GB, does not include a requirement to house birds. However, this is being kept under constant review. With the increased risk of Avian Influenza during the winter, the need to include a mandatory housing requirement in the AIPZ may arise. Further disease control measures will be based on the latest scientific evidence and veterinary advice.</p>

<h4>The Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) means bird keepers across the country must:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Keep domestic ducks and geese separate from other poultry;</li>
  <li>Ensure the areas where birds are kept are unattractive to wild birds, for example by netting ponds, and by removing wild bird food sources;</li>
  <li>Feed and water their birds in enclosed areas to discourage wild birds;</li>
  <li>Minimise movement into and out of bird enclosures;</li>
  <li>Cleanse and disinfect footwear and keep areas where birds live clean and tidy;</li>
  <li>Reduce any existing contamination by cleansing and disinfecting concrete areas, and fencing off wet or boggy areas;</li>
  <li>Keep free ranging birds within fenced areas, and ponds, watercourses and permanent standing water must be fenced off (except in specific circumstances, e.g. zoo birds).</li>
</ul>

<p>The prevention zone will be in place until further notice and will be kept under regular review as part of the government’s work to monitor and manage the risks of bird flu.</p>

<h4>Wild birds:</h4>

<p>The Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) carries out year-round avian influenza surveillance of dead wild birds submitted through public reports and warden patrols. Our weekly findings of avian influenza in wild birds can be found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/avian-influenza-in-wild-birds" class="govuk-link">here</a>.</p>

<p>Poultry keepers and members of the public should report dead wild birds to Defra’s national dead wild bird helpline on 03459 33 55 77 (please select option 7) and keepers should report suspicion of disease to APHA on 03000 200 301. Keepers should familiarise themselves with our avian flu advice.</p>

<h4>Further information</h4>

<p>The government’s latest guidance on avian influenza, including how to spot the disease and what action you should take to report it, can be found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu" class="govuk-link">here</a>.</p>

<p>The government’s outbreak assessment following recent cases in England can be accessed here.</p>

<p>Biosecurity guidance and a biosecurity self-assessment checklists have been published on each of the GB administration’s website to assist all bird keepers in instigating and maintaining good biosecurity:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu" class="govuk-link">England</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/avian-influenza-bird-flu/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Scotland</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/avian-influenza-bird-flu">Wales</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Bird flu is a notifiable animal disease. If you suspect any type of bird flu you must report it immediately. Failure to do so is an offence.</p>

<p>You can report suspected or confirmed cases in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>England by calling the Defra Rural Services Helpline on 03000 200 301,</li>
  <li>Scotland by contacting your local <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#scotland-field-service-offices">Field Services Office</a>
</li>
  <li>Wales by calling 0300 303 8268</li>
  <li>Northern Ireland by calling the DAERA Helpline on 0300 2007840</li>
</ul>

<p>In Great Britain, if you find dead wild waterfowl (swans, geese or ducks) or other dead wild birds, such as gulls or birds of prey, you should report them to the Defra helpline (03459 33 55 77 - please select option 7). In Northern Ireland contact DAERA on 0300 200 7840.</p>

<p>For more advice and regular updates on the latest situation, visit Governments’ avian flu pages: in England, Scotland, Wales and NI.</p>

<p>In GB, you are legally <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/poultry-including-game-birds-registration-rules-and-forms" class="govuk-link">required to register your birds</a> if you keep more than 50 birds. Keepers with less than 50 birds are strongly encouraged to register. It is also a legal requirement to notify APHA of any significant changes in the average number of birds kept.</p>

<p>In Northern Ireland if you keep any birds, other than pet birds kept in the owner’s home, you need to make sure they are registered.</p>

<p>Avian Influenza is in no way connected to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus which is not carried in poultry.</p>
