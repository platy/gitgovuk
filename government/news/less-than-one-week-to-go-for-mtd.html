<p>Businesses have less than a week to prepare for Making Tax Digital (<abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>) for Value Added Tax (<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>) becoming mandatory for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses on 1 April, HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) said today.</p>

<p><abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> helps taxpayers get their tax returns right by reducing common mistakes as well as saving time managing their tax affairs and is a key part of the overall digitalisation of UK tax.</p>

<p>Evidence shows <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> is succeeding in its central aims of reducing errors, while also making it faster to prepare and submit returns, and boosting productivity for businesses. New research, conducted by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and peer reviewed by independent academics, shows <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> is likely to have generated increased revenue through reducing errors in both 2019 and 2020.</p>

<p>Nearly 1.6 million taxpayers had joined <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> as of December 2021 with more than 11 million returns successfully submitted. Around a third of <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses with taxable turnover below £85,000 have voluntarily signed up to <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> ahead of April 2022, and thousands more are signing up each week.</p>

<p><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses that have not yet signed up to <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> should do so now. All <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses must use <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> for their first <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return starting on or after 1 April 2022. Businesses should use the time left to choose the software that is right for them, whether that is one of the simple free options available, or a more advanced product for those with more complex affairs.</p>

<p>Lucy Frazer, HM Treasury’s Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Businesses using <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> are saving time on their tax affairs, streamlining their processes and boosting their productivity as a result.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Our first move towards a modern, digital tax service – <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> makes it easier for businesses to get their tax right first time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a range of support and information available for those that need it – including accessible online content such as YouTube videos, GOV.UK help pages and <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Extra Support service.</p>

<p>Agents can sign up on behalf of a business, although businesses remain responsible for meeting their <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> obligations. Those who do not join may be charged a penalty for failure to do so.</p>

<p>There are a range of compatible software products available for <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>, allowing businesses to choose which tools they use to run their business and tax affairs. A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-software-thats-compatible-with-making-tax-digital-for-vat">list of software compatible with <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr></a>, including free and low-cost options, can be found on GOV.UK.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> understands that some businesses will find it easier to comply with <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> than others. For those who need more <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/help-and-support-for-making-tax-digital">help and support on signing up for <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr></a>, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is running a series of webinars.</p>

<p>Some <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses may be eligible for an exemption from <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>, if it is not reasonable or practicable for them to use digital tools for their tax. If a business has previously been granted an exemption for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> online filing, this will carry over to <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> requirements. Go to GOV.UK for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-an-exemption-from-making-tax-digital-for-vat">more information on whether an exemption may apply</a>.</p>

<p>Example <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVC_UuErOB0&amp;list=PL8EcnheDt1zi1ipk1qexrwdAU5O6LS84a&amp;index=7" rel="external"><abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> case studies</a> from businesses who are currently benefitting from <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> can be found on YouTube.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>To sign up to MTD VAT, businesses, or an agent on a businesses’ behalf, need to:</p>

<p>Step 1: Visit GOV.UK and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-software-thats-compatible-with-making-tax-digital-for-vat">choose MTD-compatible software</a></p>

<p>Step 2: Keep digital records starting from 1 April 2022 or the beginning of their VAT period</p>

<p>Step 3: Sign up and submit their VAT Return through MTD</p>
</div>

<h2>Further information</h2>

<p>Businesses can choose to register themselves for <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> or can ask their agent to do this for them.</p>

<p>Businesses, or an agent on their behalf, must sign up to <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> via GOV.UK  to fully join <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>. They must have <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software before signing up.</p>

<p>Businesses should ensure that they sign up to <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> at least 5 days after their last non-<abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return deadline date, and no less than 7 days before their first <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return deadline date to avoid paying for their <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> twice.</p>

<p>Businesses must keep digital records through <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>. This can be done via software. Where a business chooses to use bridging software (a type of recognised <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> compatible software which extracts information from a business’s spreadsheet and then submits it to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> in a way which is compliant with <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> requirements) digital links must be in place to ensure that records are kept digitally as information is transferred between different platforms.</p>

<p>Businesses need to have signed up to <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for their first <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return starting on or after 1 April 2022. They may not be required to make their first submission via <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> until Summer 2022.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/research-to-assess-the-impact-of-making-tax-digital-for-vat">A piece of qualitative research</a>, published in February 2022, based on 60 in-depth interviews conducted with a random sample of small businesses that had made the change to <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> following mandation showed the ongoing customer impact of record-keeping behaviour change in the second year of mandation. This found that businesses using fully compatible software were reaping the rewards of <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> through saving time on their tax affairs and improving their financial confidence.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> published a new report, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/evaluating-additional-tax-revenue-from-making-tax-digital-for-vat">Evaluating additional tax revenue from Making Tax Digital for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr></a>, in March 2022 that represents the strongest evidence yet that <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> is succeeding in helping to ensure the right amount of tax is collected from businesses by reducing opportunities for error or miscalculation.</p>

<p>In 2020, the government published ‘Building a trusted, modern tax administration system’, setting out a vision of a UK tax system fit for the 21st century, designed to improve its resilience, effectiveness and support for taxpayers. <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> is the first phase of a move toward this modern, digital tax service.</p>

<p>Since April 2019, businesses with a taxable turnover above £85,000 have already been required to follow <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>, keeping digital records and filing <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> returns using <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> compatible software. In July 2020, it was announced that all <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses must file digitally through <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> from April 2022, regardless of turnover. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has reminded businesses below the £85,000 threshold of the steps which they need to take to be ready.</p>
