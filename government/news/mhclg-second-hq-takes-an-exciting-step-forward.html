<p>In another milestone in the government’s plans to move decision making away from London, the Communities Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP has today (Friday 28 May) confirmed his department’s second HQ will be based at the i9 building in the City Centre, with work underway to have the building open this summer.</p>

<p>The announcement confirms the next step in establishing the first government headquarters with a ministerial office based outside of London.</p>

<p>The i9 building, funded and developed by the City of Wolverhampton Council, is in the historic heart of Wolverhampton, close to landmarks such as the Chubb Building whose design it reflects and complements. MHCLG will take two floors, including the top floor with views over the regeneration area of Wolverhampton. It will also include a space forcvMinisters to use regularly, making the first of its kind outside of London.</p>

<p>The Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) is playing a lead role in levelling up and boosting the regions by moving hundreds of roles out of Westminster and ensuring that more local voices influence the creation and delivery of government policy.</p>

<p>At least 150 roles will be based in the city as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m pleased to announce that the i9 building will be our new home in Wolverhampton and look forward to opening the office later this year.</p>

  <p>This department is leading the effort to level up every corner of the country, so it is absolutely right that we bring decision-making to the heart of the communities we serve. I hope that this vote of confidence in Wolverhampton helps the city to attract other employees and further investment.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We are already recruiting in Wolverhampton and over time this move will bring hundreds of jobs and exciting careers in the UK Civil Service to the city and the West Midlands. I look forward to welcoming staff to our new headquarters and as a Wulfrunian myself, will be working from the office as often as I can and enjoying the city once again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>City of Wolverhampton Council’s Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for City Economy, Councillor Stephen Simkins, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a huge vote of confidence in the City of Wolverhampton and we are delighted to have been chosen to host this historic move away from Whitehall for the MHCLG dual-headquarters.</p>

  <p>We are currently enjoying record levels of private and public investment with £4.4 billion pounds on site or in the pipeline. Now, the kudos of being the first place outside of Whitehall to host a government department will create a real buzz and interest in our city, attracting further investment which is exactly what we want to be able to ‘relight’ Wolverhampton after the pandemic.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Wolverhampton is the ideal location in the heart of the country, with enviable connectivity to the rest of the West Midlands and beyond. When the idea of MHCLG moving out of London was first discussed last year, the council, local MPs and other stakeholders lobbied hard to make it a reality and that has paid off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This new headquarters will support the government’s ambitious levelling-up plans by providing an economic boost to the area. It will also bring people with different experiences and viewpoints into the Civil Service and provide improved career paths for those in Wolverhampton and across the West Midlands.</p>

<p>A number of staff members have already taken the opportunity to have their roles reassigned to the new second HQ.</p>

<p>Recruitment is happening at pace in Wolverhampton and the wider region across a range of roles and levels from entry grade to Senior Civil Servants. Interested people should visit civil service jobs web pages.</p>
