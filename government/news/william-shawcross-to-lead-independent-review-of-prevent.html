<p>The government has today (26 January 2021) announced that William Shawcross has been appointed as the new Independent Reviewer of Prevent.</p>

<p>William Shawcross was formerly the Chair of the Charity Commission between 2012 and 2018 and became the Special Representative on UK victims of Qadhafi-sponsored IRA terrorism.</p>

<p>Prevent, which safeguards vulnerable people from being drawn into terrorism, is one of the 4 strands of the government’s counter-terrorism strategy, CONTEST.</p>

<p>The independent review will consider the strategy and delivery of the Prevent programme, and will make recommendations for the future. The terms of reference will be published shortly.</p>

<p>Lords Minister Baroness Williams said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prevent plays an essential role in stopping vulnerable people being drawn into terrorism and I am grateful to those who work tirelessly, including throughout the pandemic, to turn lives around and keep our communities safe.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It is important that this vital programme continues to improve and I look forward to seeing Mr Shawcross’ recommendations in due course.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Independent Reviewer of Prevent William Shawcross said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am delighted to lead this important review to ensure that Britain has the most effective strategy possible for preventing people from becoming terrorists.</p>

  <p>As Independent Reviewer, I look forward to assessing how Prevent works, what impact it has, and what further can be done to safeguard individuals from all forms of terrorist influence. I look forward to hearing from a wide range of voices, particularly those who have had experience of Prevent in practice.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I intend to lead a robust and evidence-based examination of the programme, to help ensure that Britain has a clear and effective strategy to protect vulnerable people from being drawn into terrorism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In January 2019, the government announced the creation of the Independent Review of Prevent as part of the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act. William Shawcross’ appointment follows the previous Independent Reviewer, Lord Carlile, stepping down in December 2019.</p>

<p>Prevent deals with all forms of terrorism, including Islamist and far right terrorism, and does not focus on any one community.</p>

<p>From 2012 to March 2020, almost 3,000 people have been adopted to Prevent’s voluntary and confidential Channel programme.</p>

<p>As part of Prevent, the Channel programme provides tailored support for a person vulnerable to being drawn into terrorism and works in a similar way to processes designed to protect people from gang activity, drug or sexual abuse – with individuals offered dedicated support and advice.</p>

<p>In the year ending 31 March 2020, there were 6,287 referrals to Prevent. This is an increase of 10% compared to the previous year.</p>

<p>Of those referred to Prevent in 2019 to 2020, 1,487 (24%) were referred for concerns related to Islamist radicalisation and 1,387 (22%) were referred for concerns related to far right radicalisation.</p>

<p>As one part of the CONTEST Strategy, Prevent, alongside Pursue (stopping terrorist attacks happening in the UK and overseas), Protect (strengthening protection against a terrorist attack in the UK or overseas) and Prepare (mitigating the impact of a terrorist incident if it occurs) comprise the 4 strands of the strategy.</p>
