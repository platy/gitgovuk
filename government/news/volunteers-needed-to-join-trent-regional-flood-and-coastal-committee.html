  <li>Call for talented individuals to help communities become more resilient to climate change</li>
  <li>Committee works to decide local priorities for flood risk management</li>
  <li>Work supports Environment Agency and local authorities in creating local partnerships to tackle flood risk</li>
</ul>

<p>As the Environment Agency embarks on the next 6-year period of investment to reduce the risk to over 300,000 homes and businesses across England, it is an exciting time to be joining the committee.</p>

<p>The committee would love to welcome talented and enthusiastic individuals from all backgrounds to join this important committee, to represent the diversity of communities and interests from across the area.</p>

<p>The committee is fundamental in deciding local priorities for flood risk management, approving programmes of work.</p>

<p>It helps to manage flood risk throughout the Trent water catchments across the East and West Midlands and contains major urban centres such as Birmingham, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham and Leicester, as well as the dramatic landscapes of the Peak District and low-lying ground to north Nottinghamshire and the Isle of Axholme.</p>

<p>It also supports the Environment Agency and local authorities in creating local partnerships to fund and deliver projects, while ensuring resilience and adaptation to the impacts of climate change are embedded throughout.</p>

<p>These roles make a real difference to people’s lives, livelihoods and to the environment we live in. Being an RFCC member is an exciting opportunity to guide local flood risk investment. While not a paid role, reasonable out-of-pocket expenses will be covered.</p>

<p>The Trent RFCC is one of 12 statutory committees across the country that make key decisions on local priorities for flood and coastal risk management. A key role is making sure the aims of the National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy are embodied within the committee’s decisions and to ensure consistency between strategic and local plans.</p>

<p>Vijith Randeniya, chair of the Trent RFCC, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As we look at the world ahead, we do so through a prism where many of our assumed views have been challenged or shattered.</p>

  <p>If we think back to 10 years ago, very few of the challenges we have faced in the past two years would have been foreseen or would have seemed likely. It is on that premise that we can predict, with some certainty, that the future holds challenges which are as of yet undefined and will need confronting together.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Joining the RFCC as an independent member will give you an exceptional opportunity to influence and support the local investment to combat those challenges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Applications are welcome from individuals with an active interest in flood risk management and from a diverse range of backgrounds, with additional interest or experience in climate change and resilience, academia, catchment-based approaches, community engagement, land use and blue-green-grey infrastructure.</p>

<p>Anyone interested in helping communities become more resilient to climate change and joining the Trent Regional Flood and Coastal Committee, see:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/trent-regional-flood-and-coastal-committee">Trent Regional Flood and Coastal Committee (RFCC)</a></p>

<p>The closing date is 24 June 2022 and interviews are 11 July 2022.</p>

<h2>Notes to editors</h2>

<p>Due to members’ terms coming to an end, we are recruiting for 2 members to join the Committee in 2022.</p>

<p>Applications are welcome from individuals with an active interest in flood risk management and from a diverse range of backgrounds, with additional interest or experience in one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Community engagement</li>
  <li>Academia</li>
  <li>Catchment-based approaches – ensuring a holistic approach to risk management, for our current and future communities</li>
  <li>Land use/blue-green-grey infrastructure</li>
  <li>Climate change and resilience</li>
</ul>

<h3>Volunteers’ time commitment</h3>

<p>The committee meets 4 times a year, usually at locations within the Trent catchment. Due to restrictions, meetings have recently been held online and this may continue for some meetings, balanced with those in-person (as circumstances allow). Any work you do around the main meetings can be flexible to your own commitments. You will be given at least 6 months’ notice of quarterly meetings dates and times.</p>

<h3>Role and how to apply</h3>

<p>Typically, members are expected to read papers, join sub-groups if interested, and engage with Environment Agency colleagues and other committee members.</p>

<p>You do not need formal qualifications for this post, but your enthusiasm and commitment to your local community will be important. These are unpaid roles but reasonable expenses, including travel, can be claimed.</p>

<p>For further information please contact the Environment Agency at <a href="mailto:louise.townrow@environment-agency.gov.uk">louise.townrow@environment-agency.gov.uk</a> or 02077 140468.</p>
