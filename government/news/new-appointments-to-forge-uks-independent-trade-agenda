<p>• Oliver Griffiths will lead the new independent UK body to protect UK industries from unfair trade practices</p>

<p>• Amanda Brooks to take over as UK’s lead negotiator on the US trade deal ahead of Joe Biden’s Presidency</p>

<p>• Appointments will strengthen our relationships as an independent trading nation</p>

<p>The Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) will play a vital role in ensuring a fair and level playing ground for British industries, helping tackle unfair trading practices and unforeseen surges in imports. It forms a key part of the UK’s independent trade policy, and will operate as an independent arm’s length body from January, subject to the passing of the Trade Bill.</p>

<p>Oliver joins the TRA from his current role as UK Chief Negotiator for the UK-US negotiations and will take over from interim Chief Executive, Satjit Singh in the New Year.</p>

<p>He is replaced by Amanda Brooks CBE who has been appointed as the new Chief Negotiator for US negotiations. Amanda moves from her most recent position as interim Director-General for Trade Relations and Implementation.</p>

<h2 id="chair-designate-of-the-tra-simon-walker-said">Chair Designate of the TRA, Simon Walker said:</h2>

<p>“I could not be more pleased that Oliver is joining us and look forward tremendously to working with him.</p>

<p>“I know he has a deep understanding of trade policy and business drawn from his extensive time working in government and the private sector. His talent, expertise and experience mean he could not be a better qualified or suitable appointment.”</p>

<p>As the UK comes to the end of the Transition Period and work intensifies on several major international trade negotiations, a number of other senior appointments have been made within the Department for International Trade.</p>

<p>Graham Zebedee will be assuming a new role as Chief Negotiator to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), moving from his current role as Chief Negotiator on the UK-Japan Free Trade Agreement now those negotiations have concluded.</p>

<p>Jo Crellin, HM Trade Commissioner for Latin America and the Caribbean, will take up the role of Director-General for Trade Relations and Implementation.</p>

<h2 id="international-trade-secretary-liz-truss-said">International Trade Secretary, Liz Truss, said:</h2>

<p>“With these appointments, we are bringing top quality expertise and experience to key roles as we strike new trade deals and re-establish the UK as an independent trading nation.</p>

<p>“They will build on the great progress we have made so far and help create our new trade remedies regime as we take back control of our trade policy from 1st January.</p>

<p>“They all have a proven track record of delivery and will help us take our trade agenda to a new level in 2021.”</p>
