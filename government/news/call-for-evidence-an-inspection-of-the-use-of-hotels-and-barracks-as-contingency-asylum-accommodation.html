        <div class="govspeak">
<p>The Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration (ICIBI) has begun an inspection of the use of hotels and barracks as contingency asylum accommodation and is inviting anyone with relevant knowledge or experience to submit their evidence to <a href="mailto:chiefinspector@icibi.gov.uk?subject=Contingency%20Asylum%20Accommodation%20submission.&amp;body=%0D%0A%0D%0A%20I%20consent%20to%20the%20Independent%20Chief%20Inspector%20of%20Borders%20and%20Immigration%20retaining%20and%20processing%20the%20information%20and%20data%20in%20this%20email." class="govuk-link">chiefinspector@icibi.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>The call for evidence will remain open for four weeks (until 19 February 2021).</p>

<p>This inspection will examine the use made of hotels and other forms of contingency asylum accommodation, including Penally Camp and Napier Barracks, since the beginning of 2020. It will focus on the roles and responsibilities of the Home Office and the accommodation service providers, and of other parties, in relation to the use of contingency asylum accommodation, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>communication between the Home Office and the accommodation service providers, and with other stakeholders (for example, local authorities, health services, NGOs who provide support to asylum seekers), regarding the need for contingency asylum accommodation in particular areas</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the process(es) for identifying potential contingency asylum accommodation and for testing and deciding about the suitability of specific sites, including with regard to Covid-19 safety</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>decisions about individual asylum seekers and their needs in terms of accommodation and other support, including information sharing, record keeping, oversight and review, particularly with regard to vulnerabilities and risks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>communication between the Home Office and/or the accommodation service providers and individuals (“service users”) regarding their asylum accommodation, including any changes to that accommodation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the strategy for reducing the requirement for contingency asylum accommodation in the short- to medium-term (to the end of 2021-22) and longer-term (through to the end of the current Asylum Accommodation and Support Contracts)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>ICIBI would welcome evidence in relation to any of the above points, but also in respect of any other matters that those with knowledge and experience of contingency asylum accommodation consider relevant.</p>

<p>Since the end of 2020, ICIBI has been speaking to and receiving evidence from a number of stakeholders, along with residents of both Penally Camp and Napier Barracks. There is no need for those who have already provided evidence to re-submit it, unless they wish to update or add to it.</p>

<p>Please Note: The Independent Chief Inspector is unable to assist with individual asylum claims or with complaints, but where anyone considers that the details of a claim or complaint are relevant they may include them in their evidence submission.</p>
