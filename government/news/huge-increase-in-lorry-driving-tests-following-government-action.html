<h2>Action to help deal with the HGV driver shortage</h2>

<p>Changes to simplify the process to become a heavy goods vehicle (HGV) driver to help deal with the HGV driver shortage were introduced by the government in 2021. These included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>allowing the off-road part of the lorry test to be carried out by non-DVSA assessors</li>
  <li>allowing drivers to take one test to drive both a rigid and articulated lorry</li>
  <li>removing the need for drivers to do a separate car and trailer test</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these changes, DVSA recruited more vocational driving examiners to help make more tests available in the areas of where demand is highest.</p>

<p>The actions were part of the the government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/hgv-driver-shortage-uk-government-response/about">33 actions taken to deal with the HGV driver shortage</a> and protect the supply chain. This included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>making 11,000&nbsp;HGV&nbsp;driver training places available through&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/training-hgv/skills-bootcamps">Skills Bootcamps</a>
</li>
  <li>injecting a major and sustained boost to the number of&nbsp;HGV&nbsp;driving tests available</li>
  <li>investing £52.5 million in improvements in roadside facilities and lorry parking</li>
</ul>

<h2>Industry bodies are reporting the number of&nbsp;HGV&nbsp;drivers is stabilising</h2>

<p>Since the government intervened, the sector has started to recover and industry bodies are reporting positively on the number of&nbsp;HGV&nbsp;drivers stabilising.</p>

<p>They indicate that the initiatives introduced by government and industry have started to yield results, showing that perceptions of the industry are changing as a result of government support and more people are looking to train and qualify as&nbsp;HGV&nbsp;drivers.</p>

<p>It comes as part of wider government efforts to help more people into work, since this is the best way to support families in the long-term while growing the economy to address the cost of living.</p>

<p>Grant Shapps, Transport Secretary, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We took swift action and introduced 33 measures to support our vital freight sector throughout a global driver shortage and maintain our country’s supply chains. Those measures worked, with the number of lorry driver tests being taken on the rise, and the sector reporting driver numbers are stabilising.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We’ll continue to work with the industry to remove any potential barriers to a rewarding, successful career in logistics and boost driver numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Loveday Ryder, DVSA Chief Executive, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We recognise the haulage industry keeps the wheels of our economy turning. I want to say thank you to all vocational training providers and our vocational driving examiners for supporting the changes.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It’s their hard work and commitment that has allowed us to offer an additional 11,197 tests and increase the number of drivers joining the industry.</p>
</blockquote>
