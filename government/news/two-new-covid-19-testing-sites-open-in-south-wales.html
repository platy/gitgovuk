<p>Two new drive-through coronavirus testing facilities have opened in Merthyr Tydfil and Bridgend for those with symptoms to book appointments.</p>

<p>The sites have opened at Keir Hardie Health Park Community Testing Site (CF48 1BZ) in Merthyr and Ysbyty’r Seren Community Testing Site (CF31 3SH), Bridgend as part of the UK Government’s drive to continue to improve the accessibility of coronavirus testing for local communities.</p>

<p>Testing at these sites is only available for those with coronavirus symptoms – a high temperature, a new continuous cough, or a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. Anyone with one or more of these symptoms should book a test at <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/" class="govuk-link">nhs.uk/coronavirus</a> or by calling 119. The UK Government is committed to continue expanding the capacity of the network of UK test sites and laboratories to make it even easier to get tested and reduce the time it takes to receive test results. Appointments at both sites are made available each day.</p>

<p>These sites are part of the largest network of diagnostic testing facilities created in British history which has the capacity to process more than 700,000 tests a day and includes more than 800 sites across the UK, including 89 drive-through sites, 511 walk-through sites, six Lighthouse laboratories, home testing and satellite kits, and a large number of mobile units.</p>

<h4>Secretary of State for Wales, Simon Hart, said:</h4>
<blockquote>

  <p>There are now more than 50 UK Government testing facilities in Wales, all of which are contributing to our continued fight against the virus. We are grateful to the NHS and its partners for their continued hard work in setting up new testing centres quickly and efficiently to meet demand.</p>

  <p>With more and more test centres opening in Wales it is becoming easier for people to get tests close to home, which is very important in helping stem the spread of the virus and putting fewer people at risk of catching and spreading Covid-19.</p>

  <h4>Dr Kelechi Nnoaham, Director of Public Health at Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board, said:</h4>

  <p>I’m pleased to see two new drive-through COVID-19 testing sites opening to the public in the Cwm Taf Morgannwg region. Getting a test when you have coronavirus symptoms is one of the best ways to keep your community safe. These new sites will help to ensure that testing facilities are available to anyone who needs them.</p>

  <p>We encourage everyone to self-isolate and book a test if they have any of the symptoms of coronavirus: a new, continuous cough, a high temperature, or a change to your sense of smell or taste.</p>

  <h4>Health Minister, Lord Bethell, said:</h4>

  <p>To respond to the coronavirus, we have built a major testing and tracing system from scratch. We are constantly working to expand and improve it with new technologies and innovations so everyone with symptoms can get a test.</p>

  <p class="last-child">New drive-in sites like these make it even easier to get a test no matter where you live. If you have symptoms of coronavirus, I urge you to book a test today and follow the advice of NHS Test and Trace if you are contacted to protect others and stop the spread of the virus.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Baroness Dido Harding, Interim Executive Chair of the National Institute for Health Protection, said:</h4>
<blockquote>

  <p>Drive-through sites offer communities better access to coronavirus testing, so everyone with symptoms can get a test. This new site is part of our ongoing work to expand our testing network across the UK which now has the capacity to process more than 700,000 tests a day. We will continue to expand capacity to improve test turnaround times and push forward testing innovations to make sure anyone who needs a test can get one.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Please book a test if you have coronavirus symptoms: a new continuous cough, a high temperature and a loss or change in sense of smell or taste, and follow the advice of NHS Test and Trace if you are contacted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The testing centres are being operated in partnership with PHW and will offer assisted tests.</p>
