<p>The Defence and Security Accelerator (<abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr>) is making more funding available for innovations that enhance aviation security measures, courtesy of the Future Aviation Security Solutions (<abbr title="Future Aviation Security Solutions">FASS</abbr>) programme.</p>

<p><abbr title="Future Aviation Security Solutions">FASS</abbr> – a joint initiative between the Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>) and Home Office which was set up to improve aviation security by funding and supporting the development of innovative science and technology solutions – will provide up to £1 million for innovative solutions that can boost the screening of passengers and cargo at airports.</p>

<p>This substantial funding will build on existing aviation threat detection capabilities by encouraging industry and academia to come up with novel ideas that reinforce screening processes at UK and international airports.</p>

<p>Cutting-edge science and technology developed with this funding could mean passengers see shorter queues and experience faster screening while benefiting from more effective security measures.</p>

<p>Security Minister, Ben Wallace, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ensuring that the UK is a world leader in aviation security is a key objective of the government’s counter-terrorism strategy, CONTEST.</p>

  <p>This is another example of bringing together government, industry and experts to ensure that the UK remains on the front foot and a global leader in the development of technologies that keep the public safe.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I look forward to seeing new ideas which improve security and make for a better experience at airports for passengers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This funding will be made available to experts from industry and academia through <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr>’s Open Call for Innovation focus areas – many of which focus exclusively on aviation. Alongside ideas that could improve the airport screening process for passengers, <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> is also seeking novel proposals that can boost the screening of aviation cargo.</p>

<p>Around 80% of air cargo is carried on passenger aircraft so it is important that it is robustly screened to ensure that prohibited items are not part of flown cargo. Identifying and investing in the latest screening solutions will help keep passengers – and those who work at airports – safe and secure.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> is requesting proposals from industry and academia through its Open Call for Innovation focus areas as follows:</p>

<h3 id="finding-suspected-threats-on-passengers-during-airport-screening">Finding suspected threats on passengers during airport screening:</h3>

<p>We are interested in receiving proposals for the development of hand-held solutions that will help detect both metallic and non-metallic threats on the body while reducing the need for person-person contact, particularly in harder-to-search areas of the body.</p>

<h3 id="matching-passengers-with-their-x-ray-trays-during-airport-screening">Matching passengers with their x-ray trays during airport screening:</h3>

<p>We’re looking for innovative solutions to ensure airport passengers are correctly linked to the x-ray trays they are using to put their personal effects through scanners.</p>

<h3 id="improving-aviation-cargo-screening-speed">Improving aviation cargo screening speed</h3>

<p>We’re looking for novel ideas that would help increase the speed, accuracy and volume at which cargo is screened.</p>

<p>The next deadline to submit proposals for this security funding is 2 May 2019. Full details of these areas of interest can be found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/defence-and-security-accelerator-dasa-open-call-for-innovation/open-call-innovation-focus-areas">on our website</a>.</p>
