  <li>£1 million fund awarded to 39 community projects across Northern Ireland as part of a Shared History Fund with the National Lottery Heritage Fund</li>
  <li>A major Northern Ireland 2021 Business Showcase in London to boost investment and build back better.
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis has unveiled an extensive programme of projects and events to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland in 2021.</li>
</ul>

<p>This includes a major Northern Ireland 2021 Business Showcase in London, a £1 million Shared History Fund, an ambitious programme for young people, tree planting projects, academic and historic events and a Cultural Programme</p>

<p>In  addition, stakeholders from across Northern Ireland are delivering activities including
a George V event in Belfast City Hall and an International church service for all denominations.</p>

<p>The initiatives reflect the UK Government’s commitment under the New Decade New Approach deal to showcase Northern Ireland’s economic, cultural and social achievements on a local, UK and international stage when marking this key anniversary. This will entail reflecting on the past and looking forward to a bright future for Northern Ireland, with the programme focusing on investment, young people, culture and the environment.</p>

<p>The centenary will also highlight the strength and beauty of the diverse perspectives and identities within the four nations of the UK which make our Union unique.</p>

<p>Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis said:</p>

<p>“The UK Government’s centenary programme of events provides an opportunity for us all to reflect on the history of Northern Ireland and to take pride in all this fantastic place has to offer the UK and the world.</p>

<p>“In its 100th year, the people of Northern Ireland can build on their spirit of togetherness and recognise their enormous achievements over past decades.</p>

<p>“I hope that these projects and events will help drive Northern Ireland’s post Covid recovery forward, inspire the next generation and showcase to the world the beauty, innovation and tenacity of the people of Northern Ireland.”</p>

<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:</p>

<p>“2021 marks 100 years since the creation of Northern Ireland, which has paved the way for the formation of the United Kingdom as we know it.</p>

<p>“Our centenary programme will reflect on the past and on the people and developments that make Northern Ireland the great place it is today.</p>

<p>“The activities will pay tribute to all those who have worked tirelessly to support Northern Ireland throughout the pandemic, and will champion the incredible young people in Northern Ireland who offer so much to the shared success of our United Kingdom.”</p>
