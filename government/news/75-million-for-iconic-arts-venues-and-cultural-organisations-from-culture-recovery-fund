  <li>Culture Secretary announces grants of up to £3 million to save 35 of the country’s cultural icons</li>
  <li>70 per cent of funding awarded to organisations outside London</li>
  <li>Grants announced today include the largest awards from the Culture Recovery Fund to date</li>
  <li>Recipients include iconic venues like the Design Museum, Shakespeare’s Globe, the Old Vic and the Sheffield Crucible</li>
</ul>

<p>35 of the country’s leading cultural organisations and venues will be the first to receive grants between £1 and £3 million from the Government’s £1.57 billion Culture Recovery Fund, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has announced.</p>

<p>£75 million will protect some of the nation’s most significant stages, from the iconic Shakespeare’s Globe and the internationally renowned Sadler’s Wells to major theatres like the Old Vic, Sheffield Crucible, Manchester’s Royal Exchange Theatre, the Birmingham Repertory Theatre and the Theatre Royal Plymouth. These famous organisations have been essential stepping stones for some of the UK’s brightest stars including Adrian Lester, Abi Morgan, Mark Rylance and David Tennant.</p>

<p>Grants are being awarded to places that define culture in all corners of the country, providing jobs, supporting the wider community and engaging the public through innovative means during the pandemic.</p>

<p>More than £500 million has now been allocated from the Culture Recovery Fund to nearly 2,500 cultural organisations and venues of all sizes, including cinemas, heritage sites, museums, circuses, festivals and comedy clubs across the country, to help them plan for reopening and restarting performances and programmes. The certainty and security provided by these grants will also help to support organisations as they plan for the future and create opportunities for freelancers.</p>

<h3 id="culture-secretary-oliver-dowden-said">Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">As part of our unprecedented £1.57 billion rescue fund, today we’re saving British cultural icons with large grants of up to £3 million - from Shakespeare’s Globe to the Sheffield Crucible. These places and organisations are irreplaceable parts of our heritage and what make us the cultural superpower we are. This vital funding will secure their future and protect jobs right away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All four nations are benefiting from the UK Government’s £1.57 billion Culture Recovery Fund, with £188 million barnetted to the Devolved Administrations to run their own process - £97 million for Scotland, £59 million for Wales and £33 million for Northern Ireland. This funding will enable them to increase the support already available to the arts and cultural sectors in each nation.</p>

<p>Some of the nation’s best known organisations will receive funding including The Old Vic, one of the capital’s leading independent not-for profit theatres, which will be able to continue making new work and provide opportunities for freelancers thanks to their £3 million grant.</p>

<h3 id="andrew-scott-actor-and-the-old-vic-ambassador-said">Andrew Scott, Actor and The Old Vic Ambassador, said:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Today’s announcement is a hugely exciting and positive step forward in helping The Old Vic survive and thrive. Over its 200-year lifetime, hundreds of thousands of performers, creatives, technical crews, back-of-house teams and everyone else in-between have worked together to make The Old Vic the cultural icon it is today. To have been a part of the IN CAMERA series during the theatre’s closure, and to have seen first-hand how hard everyone is working to support others and keep the organisation alive, has been a real privilege and I wish everybody luck as they work to rebuild a theatre that we all love so much.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More than £52 million, 70% of the total awarded in this round, will be going to organisations outside of London.</p>

<p>The award-winning Black Country Living Museum, which has provided a backdrop to popular series like Peaky Blinders and feature films like Stan & Ollie, will be able to reopen thanks to a grant of £2,559,805 so they can continue to employ uniquely skilled staff in the West Midlands. Funding will also go to the Ironbridge Gorge Museum, one of the UK’s UNESCO World Heritage Sites, which has huge local significance and supports the region’s tourism industry.</p>

<p>These grants will help support the pipeline of innovative productions and work in theatres across the country. Manchester’s Royal Exchange, where actors like Andrew Garfield performed at the start of their careers, will be able to reopen when it is safe to do so thanks to a grant of £2,854,444. The Sheffield Theatre Trust, which includes the renowned Crucible Theatre, will receive £2,246,000 to reopen for a new season including a pop-up panto for Christmas if it is safe to do so. £1,380,023 will allow the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, a major cultural venue in the city, to deliver Covid-secure events and create jobs for artists and freelancers as well as transitioning to a more sustainable business model.</p>

<h3 id="adrian-lester-actor-director-writer-and-trustee-of-the-board-of-the-birmingham-repertory-theatre-said">Adrian Lester, Actor, Director, Writer and Trustee of the Board of The Birmingham Repertory Theatre, said:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The REP was one of the main reasons I applied to drama school. It was the first theatre I visited as a child and the first theatre I ever performed in. Without it, my life may have taken a completely different course. The impact The REP has goes far beyond the economic contribution it makes to my home city - it is an essential and vital pathway for aspiring talent and for creating truly world class productions - and for welcoming back that talent when it has flowered. This wonderful news ensures that this historic, pioneering theatre - now under the exciting new leadership of Artistic Director Sean Foley and Executive Director Rachael Thomas - will be there to inspire and entertain again when it is possible to return to full production.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>World renowned performance groups showcasing the best of British talent will also be supported. The English National Ballet will receive £3 million to restart performances, retain its elite talent and explore live and digital opportunities to bring world class ballet to the widest possible audience. Rambert has been awarded £1,283,835 to enable dancers to rehearse safely and develop a new digital platform so that audiences and artists can still engage with one of the world’s leading independent dance companies. London’s dedicated dance stages at Sadler’s Wells will also be able to partially reopen for socially distanced performances thanks to a grant of £2,975,000 which will also support its acclaimed digital programme.</p>

<p>This funding will also support the events industry that makes live performances possible, for example Lights Control Rigging which has worked with some of the UK’s biggest artists including Ed Sheeran and Rita Ora will be receiving £1,076,179.</p>

<p>The recipients were informed of the outcome of their application by Arts Council England, who are delivering £500 million in grants as part of the Culture Recovery Fund on behalf of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. A second round of grants over £1 million and the recipients of the £270 million loans package will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>

<h3 id="sir-nicholas-serota-chair-arts-council-england-said">Sir Nicholas Serota, Chair, Arts Council England, said:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The Culture Recovery Fund has already helped hundreds of organisations, of all types and sizes, in villages, towns and cities across the country. It has provided a lifeline that will allow these organisations to continue to play an integral role in their communities and produce new artistic work that will entertain and inspire us all.
This latest funding, which are the largest grants to date, will support some of the country’s most loved and admired cultural spaces – from great regional theatres and museums to historic venues in the capital – which are critical to the development of a new generation of talent and in providing work for freelance creatives.”</p>

<h3 id="neil-mendoza-government-commissioner-for-culture-recovery-and-renewal-said">Neil Mendoza, Government Commissioner for Culture Recovery and Renewal, said:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Culture provides a life-enhancing force, contributing to our national good in so many ways, from well-being to economic growth. Today’s funding announcement delivers a lifeline to a nationally diverse range of performing arts and cultural institutions at a particularly difficult time when many communities are facing local lockdowns. We are grateful to Arts Council England for the rapid and exhaustive work it has undertaken to distribute this funding where it is most needed. We are here for culture.</p>

<h3 id="matthew-warcus-artistic-director-and-kate-varah-executive-director-the-old-vic-said">Matthew Warcus, Artistic Director, and Kate Varah, Executive Director, The Old Vic, said:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We are incredibly grateful to the Chancellor, the Culture Secretary, HM Treasury, the DCMS and Arts Council England for the grant our independent theatre will receive through the Culture Recovery Fund. As a registered charity in receipt of no regular public subsidy, this injection of recovery funding is crucial to safeguard our immediate future. It will allow us not just to stay solvent but to continue our online artistic programme and education projects for beneficiaries. This will, in turn, allow us to go on employing staff and, through the projects we deliver, pass on funds to the freelance creative community who continue to be disproportionately affected by the pandemic. As we look towards the future, we do so with hope and belief that the cultural sector will recover and be able to play its part in reviving the spirits of the nation. We want to thank all those, alongside government - audiences, supporters and participants - who have journeyed with us so far. For all of us, this time of crisis is not over, but today’s news is a huge step forward in our efforts to rebuild.</p>

<h3 id="natascha-mcelhone-actor-said-of-the-award-for-the-old-vic">Natascha McElhone, actor, said of the award for The Old Vic:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The Old Vic is an ideal recipient  - having transformed itself many times over the last 200 years - it has to be the most versatile, flexible space with Matthew’s creative mind at its helm always shredding any rule book. If 100 years ago Lilian Baylis ( social reformer, suffragette, theatre manager) could make Shakespeare desirable & affordable for everyone ; that’s a brilliant legacy to uphold in this theatre . There’s no limit to what a bit of social distancing might end up inventing - onwards! Or as The Old Vic slogan says: ‘Dare,always dare’.</p>

<h3 id="neil-constable-ceo-and-michelle-terry-artistic-director-shakespeares-globe-said">Neil Constable, CEO, and Michelle Terry, Artistic Director, Shakespeare’s Globe, said:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We at Shakespeare’s Globe are hugely grateful and relieved to receive a lifeline from the Culture Recovery Fund. We are pleased to have worked closely with DCMS, and our industry colleagues, to ensure that the urgent financial help could be accessed by publicly unfunded organisations like ours. When we return, our audiences will yet again experience Shakespeare’s poetry in our wooden ‘O’, an emblem of survival spanning 400 years; a plague, and now a pandemic – a reminder that we will come through this time and be together once again. The Government is backing the arts to ensure that when we come out of these dark months, the country’s internationally renowned cultural strength can rebuild itself and boost national morale significantly contributing, once again, to the UK’s economy. This fund was created to support organisations that were financially stable before Covid-19, and due to the grant the Globe is now able to produce and plan more confidently for our future, returning to employing a multitude of talented freelancers and artists, the true makers of theatre, who bring Shakespeare’s stories to life.</p>

<h3 id="alistair-spalding-artistic-director-and-ceo-and-britannia-morton-executive-director-sadlers-wells-said">Alistair Spalding, Artistic Director and CEO and Britannia Morton, Executive Director, Sadler’s Wells, said:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We want to extend our heartfelt thanks to the UK government, Treasury, DCMS and Arts Council England for this vital lifeline to ensure Sadler’s Wells can stay afloat into 2021. The Culture Recovery Fund provides us with the support we need to continue to survive the pandemic and to deliver on our mission and vision as a world-leading home for dance. With this support we will continue to make and share world-class dance for audiences from across the UK and around the world. We will create opportunities for artists, companies, freelance professionals, and colleagues whose talent and skill are the backbone of this organisation. We will continue to innovate and invent, work toward a more diverse and representative sector, and through dance reaffirm our common humanity in a time when empathy is needed more than ever. With this funding, we are committed to doing all we can to play our role in rebuilding our sector and cultural life in the UK as we all face unprecedented challenges and navigate continued uncertainty along our path to recovery.</p>

  <p>This investment will support us as we continue to adapt, rebuild and innovate in the face of the ongoing challenges and uncertainties that the coronavirus crisis has brought to bear on our company, our work, and our ability to serve our audiences.</p>

  <p class="last-child">With this grant we can ensure ENB’s survival for the immediate future, helping us to retain talent and protect as many jobs as possible, and allowing us to create, to collaborate and to support and enrich the lives of our local, national and global communities through our artform.</p>

<h3 id="tim-marlow-director-and-ceo-design-museum-said">Tim Marlow, Director and CEO, Design Museum said:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This emergency funding is a vital bridge for the Design Museum’s recovery, providing much needed support at a very precarious time. Being awarded a grant by Arts Council England from the DCMS Culture Recovery Fund is recognition of the importance of design to all our futures and is a huge boost for which we are immensely grateful. I would also like to thank all of our supporters, visitors, sector colleagues and staff, without whose sacrifice and ingenuity we wouldn’t have made it this far. The museum re-opening to restricted numbers of visitors but selling out every day since July shows what we can do, even in the most challenging circumstances. This grant means we can keep on trying to make the impact of design visible to all.</p>

<h3 id="philip-bernays-chief-executive-newcastle-theatre-royal-said">Philip Bernays, Chief Executive, Newcastle Theatre Royal, said:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are thrilled and relieved; this is great news as we were at the point where, without intervention, we would have been at real risk of permanent closure. Theatres have a hugely important civic role in our society, bringing communities together and helping regional economies thrive, and we want to play our part in the years ahead.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This grant from the Government’s Culture Recovery Fund is for the period to April 2021 and while there remains uncertainty beyond, it allows us to invest in creating an organisation that is sustainable in what will be a new and different “normal”. We can now turn the lights back on and look forward to a brighter future.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This is tremendous news for TRP and a great relief for Plymouth and the cultural landscape of the far south-west.  It demonstrates that the government clearly recognises the great economic, social and creative value of an organisation like Theatre Royal Plymouth to this city and region.   We are grateful to the DCMS and the Arts Council for this demonstration of support and confidence and look forward to justifying that confidence with a growing programme of activity across and beyond our stages as conditions allow.  It will see real benefits for our audiences, local artists, creative freelancers and the wider community.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Plymouth’s Theatre Royal is one of those really special regional theatres that draws people from all over the place. It’s why I’ve started a number of my big musicals there and why I just love going back there for panto.  It was terrifying to think it might have to close for good so more power to the government for giving them the backing they need.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We are enormously relieved and grateful to be receiving this vital support from the Culture Recovery Fund. As an independent charity with no regular public funding, Covid-19 has had a devastating impact on our finances. This grant gets us back on our feet to serve our communities through our vibrant and inclusive programme, to protect our team, and to care for the world’s first public art gallery. In difficult times we all need - more than ever - the inspiration and hope that art brings. We can’t wait to welcome audiences back to Dulwich Picture Gallery when we reopen on 21 November as our creative work continues.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We are over the moon to be given this funding – it’s a vital lifeline that will enable us to continue to make bold and brilliant theatre in Sheffield on our stages, in our communities and online, to work with artists and theatre professionals, many of whom have been without work for most of this year. This funding will also support us to further adapt our buildings and three performance spaces as we look towards a full reopening next year. We are hugely grateful to the Government’s Culture Recovery Fund for this funding and can now look to the future with the security of knowing that this investment will sustain us until March 2021.</p>

<h3 id="lolita-chakrabarti-adapter-of-life-of-pi-said-of-the-award-for-sheffield-theatres-trust">Lolita Chakrabarti, adapter of Life of Pi, said of the award for Sheffield Theatres Trust:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Sheffield Theatres are at the heart of the city, offering outstanding and wide reaching work made by a diverse community of freelance practitioners. They are an essential local resource and, in a normal year, sell almost 400,000 tickets a year to over 750 performances. Their theatres offer so many excellent opportunities to bring people together for entertainment and engagement. Life of Pi was lucky enough to premiere at the Crucible last year. I can’t wait until they open their doors again and look forward to going back soon to experience their next live performances.</p>
