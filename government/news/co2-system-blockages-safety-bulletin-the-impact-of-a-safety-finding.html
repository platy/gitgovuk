<p>In September 2021, a fire broke out&nbsp;in the auxiliary engine room on board the Finland registered&nbsp;ro-ro cargo ship Finnmaster while&nbsp;it was leaving the port of Hull in the UK. The MAIB is conducting an investigation into this accident, supported by the Safety Investigation Authority Finland. Our lead inspector for the investigation, Simon Graves, explains a key initial safety finding from the investigation that is already having a major impact on the maritime industry:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The crew activated the onboard fixed fire extinguishing system&nbsp;to attempt to fill the machinery spaces with carbon dioxide (<abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO</abbr><sub>2</sub>) to put the fire out. The system was designed to empty a total of 42 cylinders into the engine room, each holding 45kg of <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO</abbr><sub>2</sub>. In the event, only 21 of the cylinders activated and&nbsp;therefore&nbsp;only half of the required amount of <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO</abbr><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;was injected into the space. Thankfully, the crew were able to extinguish the fire without any injuries but the partial failure of the <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO</abbr><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;system could have had far worse consequences.</p>

  <p>In the early stages of the&nbsp;MAIB&nbsp;investigation, it became apparent that the fixed <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO</abbr><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;fire extinguishing system partially failed due to a blockage in some of the flexible hoses, which supply <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO</abbr><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;to the valves on the cylinders to open them when the system is activated. Detailed examination of the flexible hoses&nbsp;fitted to the system&nbsp;identified a manufacturing defect in some of the hose assembly couplings&nbsp;that had prevented the flow of <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO</abbr><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;through the system. The investigation into the source of the hose assemblies, which had been installed earlier in the year, indicated that more than 33,000 hose assemblies originated from the&nbsp;same supply chain&nbsp;and were likely installed on ships around the world, a small percentage of which may have the same manufacturing defect.</p>

  <p>In early 2022, we&nbsp;published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/maib-reports/safety-warning-issued-after-discovery-of-blocked-fixed-co2-fire-extinquishing-system-pilot-hoses">safety bulletin 1/2022</a> detailing the&nbsp;identified issue with the&nbsp;<abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO</abbr><sub>2</sub> system on Finnmaster and recommending that recipients of the affected hose assemblies check their systems to ensure that they are fully operational&nbsp;should they be required in an emergency. We also requested that information on any findings be fed back to us to establish&nbsp;the extent of the issue.</p>

  <p>Since the safety bulletin was issued, the MAIB has received a number of positive reports of findings in fixed fire extinguishing systems affected by the same issue.&nbsp;In one case, five affected hoses were identified on&nbsp;a&nbsp;large drill&nbsp;ship certified to carry 200 people.&nbsp;The failure of the fixed <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO</abbr><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;firefighting installation&nbsp;on board this vessel could have had catastrophic consequences and major loss of life.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We continue to receive responses to the safety bulletin and urge any companies still to respond to our recommendation in the bulletin to confirm that they have taken immediate remedial action to identify and rectify any blocked pilot hose assemblies on&nbsp;affected <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO</abbr><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;fire extinguishing systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Graham Wilson, the Principal Inspector for the investigation goes on to note:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The MAIB’s complex technical investigation into this accident is ongoing and will be published in due course. However, issuing urgent safety bulletins such as this to inform the industry of significant safety issues as soon as they are identified, and to recommend that organisations take timely appropriate action, is a key element of the MAIB’s role. The success of this particular bulletin in identifying and addressing a safety critical issue on other ships highlights the value and importance of these safety warnings. It truly demonstrates the effectiveness of the MAIB in helping to prevent future accidents.</p>
