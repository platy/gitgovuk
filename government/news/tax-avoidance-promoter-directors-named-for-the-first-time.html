<p>Tax avoidance bosses have been named for the first time in the latest move to help protect the public.</p>

<p>HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) has used new powers today (31 August 2022) to publicly name <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/named-tax-avoidance-schemes-promoters-enablers-and-suppliers/current-list-of-named-tax-avoidance-schemes-promoters-enablers-and-suppliers#information-published-under-promoters-of-tax-avoidance-schemes-potas">directors of tax avoidance promoting companies</a>, with customers being warned to leave the firms’ schemes or risk large tax bills.</p>

<p>Adam Fathers is the director of tax avoidance promoter Saxonside Ltd while Stuart John Brooke is behind tax avoidance promoter The Umbrella Agency Ltd.</p>

<p>Naming the directors behind these schemes will alert the public to steer clear of any avoidance schemes promoted by other companies with the same directors.</p>

<p>Mary Aiston, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Director of Counter Avoidance, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Naming the people behind tax avoidance schemes is a crucial step in helping customers stay clear of current and future schemes they promote.</p>

  <p>Our recent action should serve as a stark warning to promoters who think they can get away with peddling avoidance schemes. We will continue to use all the powers at our disposal to crack-down on promoters.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Customers who think they’re involved in a tax avoidance scheme, should withdraw from the scheme and contact us for help as soon as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Umbrella Agency Ltd and its director have been exposed for the first time today. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has also exposed the director of the previously named promoter Saxonside Ltd, with users of both schemes warned to withdraw or risk large tax bills.</p>

<p>Both schemes’ users enter an employment contract with the promoter and are then paid the National Minimum Wage. Scheme users then receive the remainder of their income disguised in a bid to avoid paying Income Tax and National Insurance. Schemes such as these often wrongly promise their users can avoid National Insurance and Income Tax.</p>

<p>This latest step in <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s crack-down on tax avoidance promoters comes as a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/promoters-of-tax-avoidance-schemes-guidance/promoters-of-tax-avoidance-schemes-guidance#stop-notices">stop notice</a> was issued earlier this month. This prevents the promoter from selling their scheme or face penalties of up to £1 million.</p>

<p>A total of 15 companies involved in promoting tax avoidance schemes have been named by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. This is not a complete list of all tax avoidance schemes currently being marketed, nor a complete list of all promoters, enablers, and suppliers.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> also provides people with a range of tools to help them steer clear of avoidance schemes, as a part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://taxavoidanceexplained.campaign.gov.uk/?&amp;utm_source=govuk_case&amp;utm_medium=refferal&amp;utm_campaign=upstream_" rel="external">Tax Avoidance – Don’t Get Caught Out</a> campaign. These tools include an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-are-at-risk-of-tax-avoidance?&amp;utm_source=campaignpage&amp;utm_medium=refferal&amp;utm_campaign=upstream_">interactive risk checker</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-your-payslip-if-you-work-through-an-umbrella-company?&amp;utm_source=campaignpage&amp;utm_medium=refferal&amp;utm_campaign=upstream_">payslip guidance</a>, and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/tax-avoidance-dont-get-caught-out?&amp;utm_source=campaignpage&amp;utm_medium=refferal&amp;utm_campaign=upstream_#the-nurse---tanyas-story">case studies</a> demonstrating the risks of becoming involved in a tax avoidance scheme and the warning signs the public should look out for.</p>

<p>People who believe that they are involved in a tax avoidance scheme are advised to contact <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> as quickly as possible by calling 03000 534 226. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is also urging people who have been encouraged to get into a tax avoidance scheme or have come into contact with someone selling tax avoidance schemes to report this by using their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-tax-fraud">online form</a>.</p>

<h2>Further information</h2>

<p>Further details about both Saxonside Ltd and The Umbrella Agency Ltd can be found on <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s regularly updated list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/named-tax-avoidance-schemes-promoters-enablers-and-suppliers/current-list-of-named-tax-avoidance-schemes-promoters-enablers-and-suppliers">named tax avoidance promoters.</a></p>

<p>New powers granted to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> under Section 86 of the Finance Act 2022 now enable <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> to name directors, shareholders and company officers of companies suspected of promoting tax avoidance. They also enable <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> to share the details of the schemes being promoted much faster than before. This is the first time that <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has used these new powers.</p>
