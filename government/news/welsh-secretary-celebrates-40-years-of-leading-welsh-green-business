<p>Secretary of State for Wales Alun Cairns uses ROCKWOOL UK’S 40th anniversary to highlight the business’ history, growth and success during his keynote speech. From a humble beginning in a factory near Bridgend in 1979, ROCKWOOL UK has gone onto produce and export sustainable volcanic rock insulation products to countries across the UK and the world.</p>

<p>Addressing an audience at the company’s birthday event, Mr Cairns noted its commitment to clean growth. Using only natural and sustainable volcanic rock for their products, the thriving south Wales business is tackling one of the biggest challenges facing society as set out in the UK Government’s modern Industrial Strategy. Discussing the issue of climate change, the Secretary of State welcomed ROCKWOOL UK’S commitment to developing more efficient buildings, reducing household energy bills and boosting economic growth.</p>

<p>Since its inception ROCKWOOL UK has experienced significant growth and now employs nearly 500 staff across the UK, the majority of whom are based in Bridgend. This growth and success has not only created a strong supply chain across south Wales and the south east of England but has also led to the development of a new logistics hub at the Pencoed site, securing an additional 115 jobs within the past year.</p>

<h3 id="at-the-reception-welsh-secretary-alun-cairns-said">At the reception Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>As we face one of the biggest universal challenges in climate change, ROCKWOOL UK is seizing the opportunity to lead the way in finding the solutions to these questions.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Using only natural and sustainable volcanic rock for their products, they are 97% recyclable and deliver energy savings within five months of installation. They are a shining example to businesses across Wales and the Union.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Addressing ROCKWOOL UK employees, supply chain members and key stakeholders, Alun Cairns reminded the audience that the UK Government is working hard to create the right conditions for economic growth through the modern Industrial Strategy which prioritises investment in skills, industries and infrastructure. He highlighted the UK Government’s recent £9 million funding for new electric buses in south Wales, which demonstrates the UK Government’s commitment to backing clean growth initiatives.</p>

<h3 id="darryl-matthews-managing-director-of-rockwool-uk-said">Darryl Matthews, Managing Director of ROCKWOOL UK said:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are proud to be celebrating our 40th anniversary in the UK. Now more than ever, homes and businesses are looking to address energy efficiency, fire safety, and noise in the built environment with our recyclable volcanic rock insulation. We are growing as a result, with 115 new staff over the last year alone.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We are delighted that the Secretary of State for Wales has been able to join us as we celebrate this occasion in our history and the fantastic social and economic contribution made by businesses all across South Wales.</p>
