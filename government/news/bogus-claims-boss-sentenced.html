<p>Haroon Karim (35) appeared at Nottingham Magistrates Court on 2 February 2022 where he pleaded guilty to failing to preserve company accounting records before District Judge Grace Leong.</p>

<p>The claims management boss was fined more than £25,000, as well as being disqualified from running companies for 2 years, to run concurrently with the 7-year ban Haroon Karim received in 2018.</p>

<p>During proceedings, the court heard that Bramcote-based Haroon Karim ran several claims management companies, assisting people with personal injury claims following road traffic collisions.</p>

<p>One of the companies based in Nottingham, ACA Accident Claims Assistant Ltd, entered into Creditors Voluntary Liquidation in August 2016, which triggered an investigation by the Insolvency Service.</p>

<p>Investigators, however, were frustrated in their enquiries as Haroon Karim failed to deliver the company’s records despite repeated requests.</p>

<p>The claims management boss went on to tell investigators he had delivered the records to another party but could not verify this when questioned.</p>

<p>Further enquiries uncovered bank records demonstrating that Haroon Karim spent company money on unnecessary expenses despite having company debts. One of these purchases was a designer suit worth £1,000, which the claims management boss claimed he bought to attend an awards ceremony.</p>

<p>With a lack of records, neither the Liquidator nor the Insolvency Service were able to establish what happened to the company’s tangible assets. This led to Haroon Karim signing a seven-year disqualification undertaking in July 2018.</p>

<p>A criminal investigation was then launched into the claims management boss’ conduct, which resulted in Haroon Karim being charged on three counts, including: failing to deliver up books and records to the liquidator; failing to cause ACA Accident Claims Assistant Ltd to keep accounting records; and failing to preserve company accounting records.</p>

<p>A trial was set for 2 February 2022 before Haroon Karim pleaded guilty and was sentenced with a fine of £20,000 and costs of £5,715.34.</p>

<p>In separate proceedings, Haroon Karim was sentenced to six months for contempt of court. This was in connection with a claim brought by an insurance company in September 2017 after Haroon Karim had forged a claimant’s signature without their knowledge to start insurance compensation proceedings.</p>

<p>Julie Barnes, Chief Investigator for the Insolvency Service, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Haroon Karim was evasive throughout our enquiries and with a lack of company records was unable to explain exactly what happened to the company assets – something we’ll never know.</p>

  <p>But the court recognised the severity of the claims management boss’ misconduct and have not only extended his ban from running limited companies but ordered Haroon Karim to pay a substantial fine.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We hope this serves as a stark warning to company directors that they have clear responsibilities and if they are not upheld, could lead to disqualifications and even criminal prosecutions.</p>
</blockquote>
