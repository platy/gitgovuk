<p>Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has today (Friday 9 October) praised the achievements of over 100 people in Wales who have received awards via the Queen’s Birthday Honours list.</p>

<p>The list was postponed from June in order to honour recipients who are making an outstanding contribution to tackle coronavirus in their communities. It includes representatives from frontline services such as NHS staff, people delivering food and goods, education professionals as well as those providing social and community services.</p>

<p>Some of those honoured include Elizabeth Waters, a Consultant Nurse at Aneurin Bevan University Health Board who receives an MBE for services to the NHS in Wales. John Challenger from Flintshire receives a BEM for services to young people in the north west of the UK during COVID-19 following his role in keeping 2,300 Sea Cadets spread across North Wales and the North West of England together virtually through lockdown. Julie Cook, a Community Colleague at Asda from Aberdare also receives a BEM for services to the community during COVID-19 after being recognised for her role boosting morale, caring for vulnerable people and overseeing donations for local charities.</p>

<p>From the world of sport of entertainment, former Welsh rugby coach Warren Gatland receives a CBE for services to rugby in Wales. Ex-Wales captain and HIV charity campaigner Gareth Thomas receives a CBE for services to sport and health, while Wales’ most capped male rugby player and current skipper Alun Wyn Jones receives an OBE for services to Rugby Union in Wales. Opera singer Rebecca Evans also receives a CBE for services to the arts in Wales.</p>

<h3 id="secretary-of-state-for-wales-simon-hart-said">Secretary of State for Wales Simon Hart said:</h3>
<blockquote>

  <p>Twice a year we recognise the achievements and service of extraordinary people across the United Kingdom, in a wide range of professions, industries and communities.</p>

  <p>But the announcement of this year’s Queen’s Birthday Honours come at an incredibly poignant time as we continue to fight the impact of coronavirus. Many of those honoured today include those not only selflessly serving their communities but who are also responsible for planning Wales’ response to the virus and caring for those suffering its consequences.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all those honoured today and wish to congratulate them on their individual achievements.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="ends">ENDS</h3>
