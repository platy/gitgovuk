<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>The Conflict, Stability and Security team in British High Commission are seeking bids that pilot innovative approaches to addressing the interconnected challenges associated with conflict dynamics, climate change and livelihoods in Sri Lanka. All projects should be conflict sensitive to ensure interventions do no harm, contribute to stability, and do not inadvertently generate tensions between different communities. Interventions should be locally appropriate, gender responsive, adapted to the Sri Lankan economic situation and aim to support a green economy that helps mitigate climate risk.</p>

<h2>Project content requirements</h2>

<p>Any project must focus on the nexus of conflict dynamics, climate change and livelihoods stressors in Sri Lanka. Based on the contextual analysis, the programme will need to be inclusive, culturally sensitive, tailored to local conditions, conflict-sensitive, environmentally sustainable, and locally owned. Technical interventions should include climate resilient livelihoods, environmental/natural resource management, and community mobilisation.</p>

<p>The implementer may pilot interventions under the following suggested sub-themes:</p>

<h3>Evidence gathering</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>research into the impact of climate change upon specific communities in Sri Lanka to help inform strategies for supportive interventions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>undertake consultation with households and communities regarding the livelihoods options most likely to suit them based on their existing livelihoods practices. Access to natural resources; the particular microclimate in their area, the impact on crops and livestock, market linkages, cultural practices as well as other relevant factors, defined by the consulted households/communities, will all need to be considered</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Interventions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>pilot direct economic/livelihoods support for conflict-affected communities that respond to environmental degradation and the resulting livelihoods challenges. These should identify, examine and aim to reduce intercommunal tensions and the possibility of people returning to violence and conflict. The project should integrate ecosystem-based adaptation throughout, for example: promotion of climate smart and eco-friendly agriculture or by using community Natural Resource Management mechanisms</li>
  <li>facilitate community led participatory processes to develop locally-led adaptation plans and Nature Based Solutions to issues around livelihood insecurity and its interactions with climate change driven conflict</li>
  <li>support national or local government to understand the risks of, and respond to, climate change induced conflict and implement interventions in collaboration with local communities</li>
</ul>

<p>Any intervention should take an approach that aims to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Increase or stabilise the natural resource pool (to manage scarcity)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improve benefit-sharing modalities (to enhance equity)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improve governance/management (to reduce conflict)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Include a conflict management component. Opportunities for dialogue and peace-building activities should also be included. A conflict sensitivity analysis is essential.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Promote whole community approach. This will mitigate perceptions of bias, supports expectation management, and enables local ownership and empowerment in a more sustainable manner.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If the implementer considers additional sub-themes to be relevant, we would welcome new and innovative ideas where they align with policy objectives.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;Bidding guidance</h2>

<p>We are looking to fund one project that addresses the core issues set out above. Projects will be funded for three Financial Years between October 2022 to March 2025 (Financial Year (FY) : April to March). Successful implementers must receive project funding in GBP. The funding will be available as Official Development Assistance.</p>

<p>The first FY (October 2022 – March 2023) should not exceed a budgeted amount of £200,000 GBP (two hundred thousand pounds sterling) with flexibility to scale up activities and budget in FY2 and FY3 to around £500,000 per financial year. Proposals should not be crafted to reach the budget ceiling, but to specifically meet the objectives in pursuit of demonstrable impact and value for money.</p>

<p>Each project will be subject to annual break clauses in March each year.</p>

<p>Bids should not exceed 30 pages and should be in English. We welcome bids from national and international civil society organisations, and multilateral partners and agencies. Joint bids from consortia with one lead partner will be considered.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h2>&nbsp;Additional information</h2>

<p>The FCDO is moving away from using a flat NPAC rate. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1015186/Accountable_grant_budget_template_and_cost_eligibility_guidance_frequently_asked_questions_August_2021.pdf" rel="external">Read further guidance</a>. However, for the majority of projects, admin costs are unlikely to exceed 10% of the total project budget, but 10% is not a target or a cap. There will be circumstances where admin costs over 10% may still represent value for money and we will review these costs during the review process. Applicants are expected to pass on their NPAC rates to second-tier partners, or use a rate of 10%. This should be added together for all second-tier partners and included as a line in the budget.</p>

<p>The Suppliers are free to choose who they partner with and where they wish to work in order to deliver the best outcomes.</p>

<p>Only one Supplier will be selected for this project using the evaluation, but the supplier may wish to form a consortium bid.</p>

<p>The selected Supplier will be expected to work constructively with Sri Lankan government and other stakeholders in order to achieve the objectives of this project.</p>

<p>All successful implementers will sign a standard FCDO grant agreement. The terms of the contract or agreement are not negotiable.</p>

<p>Projects should aim to achieve 85% spend by 31 December 2022 and activities should be avoided in the final month of the project; however, we recognise this may not be possible with a short implementation period. Activity Based Budgets should reflect this where possible.</p>

<h2>About CSSF</h2>

<p>The Conflict Stability and Security Fund (CSSF) is a unique cross-government fund that tackles conflict, stability and security challenges overseas, which pose the greatest threat to UK national security.</p>

<p>Since its inception in 2015, CSSF programmes have addressed threats arising through conflict, serious and organised crime, terrorism and violent extremism in more than 85 countries and territories.&nbsp; It has been a catalyst for a more integrated UK government response to fragility and conflict, including delivering our commitments under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-national-action-plan-on-women-peace-and-security-2018-to-2022">UK national action plan on women, peace and security (WPS) 2018 - 2022</a>, and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/975077/Global_Britain_in_a_Competitive_Age-_the_Integrated_Review_of_Security__Defence__Development_and_Foreign_Policy.pdf" rel="external">Integrated Review</a>.</p>

<p>The CSSF Sri Lanka programme works to address the legacy of conflict from the civil war and reduce existing and future drivers of conflict in the country. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/975077/Global_Britain_in_a_Competitive_Age-_the_Integrated_Review_of_Security__Defence__Development_and_Foreign_Policy.pdf" rel="external">Integrated Review</a> positioned climate change and biodiversity loss as the number one international priority for Her Majesty’s Government due to the impacts on global resilience.</p>

<p>British High Commission in Colombo commissioned a ‘climate and conflict scoping study’ through the Centre for Poverty Analysis (CEPA) Sri Lanka back in 2020. The study identified that climate change is fuelling conflict and instability in Sri Lanka and this is likely to increase. It also explores interventions that the UK Government could implement to help mitigate the conflicts – drawing on desk and field research with diverse stakeholders. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cepa.lk/blog/how-is-climate-induced-environmental-change-increasing-conflict-between-and-within-communities/" rel="external">summary of report</a>.</p>
