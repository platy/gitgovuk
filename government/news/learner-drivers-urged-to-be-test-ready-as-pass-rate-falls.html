<p>The latest data released today (11 August 2022) by the Department for Transport reveals the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/driver-and-rider-testing-and-instructor-statistics-january-to-march-2022">car driving test pass rate for January to March 2022</a> was 47.1%. This is down from 48.1% in the previous quarter.</p>

<p>To provide support for learner drivers, the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>) has recently launched the ‘Ready to Pass?’ campaign at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://readytopass.campaign.gov.uk/?utm_source=govuk&amp;utm_medium=inline-link&amp;utm_campaign=pass-rate-news-story" rel="external">www.gov.uk/ready-to-pass</a>. It aims to improve pass rates, which will help to reduce the waiting times for tests.</p>

<p>The campaign gives learner drivers advice on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>finding an approved driving instructor</li>
  <li>monitoring and checking progress of their driving lessons and private practice</li>
  <li>when to take a mock test</li>
  <li>how to manage test-day nerves - 1 in 10 learners who fail their driving test say the main reason they failed was because they were too nervous</li>
</ul>

<p>The website also includes a checklist of the things learner drivers should consider when they and their driving instructor agree they’re ready to take the test.</p>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> is asking learner drivers to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/change-driving-test">move their test back</a> if they are not ready, so their appointment can be used by someone else who is ready. They can do this free of charge up to 3 full working days before their test.</p>

<h2>Driving examiners had to take physical action in 1 in 5 failed tests</h2>

<p>Between April 2021 and March 2022, car driving tests were failed 786,400 times.</p>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> research shows that driving examiners had to physically intervene in 168,583 tests during that time to avoid a dangerous incident. This means driving examiners had to do things such as brake or steer the car in 1 in 5 failed tests.</p>

<h2>Increasing the number of driving tests</h2>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> has already taken unprecedented action to increase test availability. The latest statistics show that 425,887 car driving tests were carried out between 1 January and 31 March 2022 (up 14% compared to the same period in 2020).</p>

<h3>Measures to create extra test appointments</h3>

<p>Since April 2021, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> has created about 428,000 more test appointments than are normally available by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>recruiting new driving examiners - this has created an estimated 140,000 extra appointments</li>
  <li>carrying out overtime, including at weekends and on public holidays - this has created an estimated 135,000 extra appointments</li>
  <li>getting all colleagues who are qualified to carry out driving tests but have moved to other roles to carry out tests - this has created an estimated 75,000 extra appointments</li>
  <li>increasing utilisation – this has created an estimated 60,000 extra appointments</li>
  <li>buying back leave from driving examiners - this has created an estimated 13,000 extra appointments</li>
  <li>inviting recently retired driving examiners to return to work – this has created an estimated 5,000 extra appointments</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>There may be an element of double-counting in some of the figures, as it’s not possible to separate each of the measures fully.</p>

<h2>Make sure you’re ready - and delay your test if you’re not</h2>

<p>Loveday Ryder, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> Chief Executive, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We took swift action to tackle the impact of the pandemic and ensure as many people as possible could take their driving test. I’m glad to see the action we took – along with the hard work of driving instructors and our driving examiners – is working, and more test slots are available for learner drivers.</p>

  <p class="last-child">However, with less than half of learners passing, I’d urge them to use our Ready to Pass? checklist to make sure they’re ready – and delay their test if they’re not. This will help make more tests available and prevent people having to pay to re-test.</p>
