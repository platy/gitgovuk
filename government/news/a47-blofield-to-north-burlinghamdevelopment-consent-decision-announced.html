<p>The application involves dualling of the A47 between Norwich and Acle Straight. It includes two junctions at the scheme’s extent and is approximately 4km in length.</p>

<p>The application was submitted to the Planning Inspectorate for consideration by National Highways on 30 December 2020 and accepted for Examination on 27 January 2021.</p>

<p>Following an Examination during which the public, Statutory Consultees and Interested Parties were given the opportunity to give evidence to the Examining Authority, recommendations were made to the Secretary of State on 22 March 2022.</p>

<p>This is the 113th Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project and 41st transport application to have been examined by The Planning Inspectorate within the timescales laid down in the Planning Act 2008.</p>

<p>The Planning Inspectorate’s Chief Executive, Sarah Richards said:</p>

<p>“The Planning Inspectorate has now examined more than 100 nationally significant infrastructure projects since the Planning Act 2008 process was introduced, ensuring local communities have had the opportunity of being involved in the examination of projects that may affect them.</p>

<p>“This Examination took place during the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated restrictions and the Examining Authority worked hard to ensure that local people, the local authority and other Interested Parties were able to fully participate.</p>

<p>“The Examining Authority listened and gave full consideration to local views and the evidence gathered during the Examination before making its recommendation.”</p>

<p>The decision, the recommendation made by the Examining Authority to the Secretary of State and the evidence considered by the Examining Authority in reaching its recommendation are publicly available on the project pages of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://infrastructure.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/projects/eastern/a47-blofield-to-north-burlingham/" rel="external">National Infrastructure Planning website</a>.</p>
