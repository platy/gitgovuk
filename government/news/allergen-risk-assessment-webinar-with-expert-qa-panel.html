<p>During the webinar the presenters will explain why food allergens are a problem and give an overview of the iFAAM (Integrated approaches to Food Allergen and Allergy Management) tiered risk assessment and the VITAL (Voluntary Incidental Trace Allergen Labelling) Program, both of which have been designed to assist food companies and regulatory bodies in the implementation of food allergen risk assessment procedures.</p>

<p>The presentations will be followed by a Q&amp;A session during which you can pose your questions to food allergen experts.</p>

<p>This event is intended for individuals currently working within the food allergen testing arena, the food industry and those involved with the UK official control system.</p>
