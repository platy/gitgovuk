<p>Education trials and interventions to improve attainment will be carried out across schools, colleges and early years settings, backed by a new multi-million government grant.</p>

<p>The Department for Education is to continue funding the Education Endowment Foundation (<abbr title="Education Endowment Foundation">EEF</abbr>) with a new grant of £137 million, cementing the independent charity’s role as a central part of the education landscape for at least the next decade.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Education Endowment Foundation">EEF</abbr> will continue to support the Government’s teacher training reforms, whilst expanding activity in the early years. This will include working as the evidence partner for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/early-years-stronger-practice-hubs">Early Years Stronger Practice Hubs</a>, which are due to launch in November 2022, to share effective evidence-based practices with local settings to help boost young children’s development.</p>

<p>The Government is also announcing a further £66 million for the next phase of the Accelerator Fund to increase access to high-quality literacy and numeracy programmes in schools over the next three academic years. This forms part of the Government’s commitment to ensuring that any child who falls behind in maths or English will get the support they need to get back on track.</p>

<p>As part of this, the <abbr title="Education Endowment Foundation">EEF</abbr> will be given up to £41.5 million to continue to increase its evidence around effective programmes, scale-up existing programmes, and support schools with implementation. Up to £21 million of the funding will also support Maths and English Hubs to roll out high quality programmes to schools.</p>

<p>Schools Minister, Will Quince, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The re-endowment of the <abbr title="Education Endowment Foundation">EEF</abbr>, in addition to funding to continue the Accelerator Fund, will provide the evidence base that allows schools and teachers to give children the best start to their education.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This work, in addition to our ambitious education recovery plan, will help to improve the attainment of millions of pupils and level up opportunities across the country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Over the past decade, the <abbr title="Education Endowment Foundation">EEF</abbr> has carried out over 200 evaluations to understand which interventions and approaches are most effective in closing the attainment gap, engaging 23,000 nurseries, schools, and colleges in trials and reaching over 1.8 million children, including 500,000 pupils eligible for free school meals.</p>

<p>Today’s funding for the Accelerator Fund also follows a successful first year of the initiative, in which the <abbr title="Education Endowment Foundation">EEF</abbr> supported 20 programmes across more than 1,500 settings, including those in regions that experienced significant learning loss during the pandemic. Some of these programmes included ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/projects-and-evaluation/projects/reciprocal-reading" rel="external">Reciprocal Reading</a>’, an intensive 12-16 small-group programme to improve reading comprehension and ’<a class="govuk-link" href="https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/projects-and-evaluation/projects/1stclassnumber" rel="external">1stClass@Number</a>’, which supported 6–7-year-olds with low attainment in maths to improve their skills.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.englishhubs.org/" rel="external">English Hubs</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ncetm.org.uk/maths-hubs/" rel="external">Maths Hubs</a> programmes also helped to deliver programmes to over 5,000 schools, giving them access to phonics and numeracy programmes. These programmes have experienced strong demand and will continue to be rolled out to additional schools as part of ongoing funding announced today. Schools can contact their local hub for more information.</p>

<p>Areas with high proportions of children from disadvantaged backgrounds will continue to be prioritised for the schemes to help level up attainment.</p>

<p>Sir Peter Lampl, chair of the <abbr title="Education Endowment Foundation">EEF</abbr> since its inception, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over the past decade, the <abbr title="Education Endowment Foundation">EEF</abbr> has&nbsp;built a reputation as a trusted and independent source of evidence. The new endowment will allow&nbsp;us to continue to evaluate and spread best practice across the country, as well as expand our work in the early years sector.</p>

  <p class="last-child">High-quality evidence plays an important role in supporting education practitioners’ own professional judgement, as they work to make sure that every child and young person has access to a great education.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These initiatives form part of the Government’s wider ambitious education recovery plan worth nearly £5 billion. This includes £1.5 billion for a national tutoring revolution, through which over two million high-quality tutoring courses have already started. A £1 billion Recovery Premium is also supporting some of the most disadvantaged pupils across the country to catch up on lost learning.</p>

<p>The £137 million re-endowment of the <abbr title="Education Endowment Foundation">EEF</abbr> is in addition to around £40 million of remaining funding from the <abbr title="Education Endowment Foundation">EEF</abbr>’s original endowment. The  £66 million in funding for the next phase of the Accelerator Fund includes up to £41.5 million for the <abbr title="Education Endowment Foundation">EEF</abbr>, up to £21 million to Maths and English Hubs, up to £3 million for a procured supplier to provide capability building support to programmes to help them scale-up, and up to £500,000 for an evaluation of the <abbr title="Education Endowment Foundation">EEF</abbr> element of the Accelerator Fund programme.</p>
