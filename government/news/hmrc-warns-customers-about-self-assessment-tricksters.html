<p>As HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) prepares to issue emails and SMS to Self Assessment customers, the department is reminding them to be on their guard after nearly 800,000 tax-related scams were reported in the last year.</p>

<p>Fraudsters use Self Assessment to try and steal money or personal information from unsuspecting individuals. In the last year alone, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has received nearly 360,000 bogus tax rebate referrals.</p>

<p>The Self Assessment deadline is 31 January 2022 and customers may expect to hear from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> at this time of year. More than 4 million emails and SMS will be issued this week to Self Assessment customers pointing them to guidance and support, prompting them to think about how they intend to pay their tax bill, and to seek support if they are unable to pay in full by 31 January.</p>

<p>However, the department is also warning customers to not be taken in by malicious emails, phone calls or texts, thinking that these are genuine <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> communications referring to their Self Assessment tax return.</p>

<p>Myrtle Lloyd, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Director General for Customer Services, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Never let yourself be rushed. If someone contacts you saying they’re from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, wanting you to urgently transfer money or give personal information, be on your guard.</p>

  <p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will also never ring up threatening arrest. Only criminals do that.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Scams come in many forms. Some threaten immediate arrest for tax evasion, others offer a tax rebate. Contacts like these should set alarm bells ringing, so if you are in any doubt whether the email, phone call or text is genuine, you can check the ‘<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> scams’ advice on GOV.UK and find out how to report them to us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Criminals use emails, phone calls and text messages to try and dupe individuals, and often mimic government messages to make them appear authentic. They want to trick their victims into handing over money or personal or financial information.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Customers can report suspicious phone calls using a form on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/reporting-fraudulent-emails">GOV.UK</a>. Customers can also forward suspicious emails claiming to be from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:phishing@hmrc.gov.uk">phishing@hmrc.gov.uk</a> and texts to 60599.</p>
</div>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has a dedicated team working on cyber and phone crimes. They use innovative technologies to prevent misleading and malicious communications from ever reaching the customer. Since 2017 these technical controls have prevented 500 million emails from reaching <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s customers. More recently, new controls have prevented 90% of the most convincing SMS messages from reaching the public and controls have been applied to prevent spoofing of most <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> helpline numbers.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is also reminding Self Assessment customers to double check websites and online forms before using them to complete their 2020 to 2021 tax return. People can be taken in by misleading websites designed to make them pay for help in submitting tax returns or charging to connect them to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> phone lines. Customers who are in any doubt about whether a website is genuine should visit GOV.UK for more <a href="https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns" class="govuk-link">information about Self Assessment</a> and use the free signposted tax return forms.</p>

<h2>Further information</h2>

<p>The Self Assessment deadline for 2020 to 2021 tax returns is 31 January 2022.</p>

<p>In the last 12 months <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>responded to 797,010 referrals of suspicious contact from the public - some 357,567 of these offered bogus tax rebates</li>
  <li>worked with the telecoms industry and Ofcom to remove more than 1,282 phone numbers being used to commit <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>-related phone scams</li>
  <li>received 327,044 reports of phone scams in total, 21% up on the previous year</li>
  <li>reported 8,561 malicious web pages for takedown</li>
