<p>Jay Robert Hannington, 33, and Ajay Surendranath Laxman, 53, both from London, have been disqualified for 11 and 6 years respectively.</p>

<p>Jay Hannington was previously disqualified in 2017 for 4 years because of misconduct while serving as a director of Capital Waste Services Limited.
However, in April 2018, Jay Hannington was given permission by the court to become a director of Capital Metal Recycling Limited, subject to certain conditions. These included a specific undertaking from his co-director, Ajay Laxman, that he would keep Capital Metal Recycling’s tax affairs up to date.</p>

<p>But by June 2018 Capital Metal Recycling Limited had fallen behind with its tax obligations, breaching the conditions set by the court, so Jay Hannington was automatically disqualified again.</p>

<p>Despite being fully aware that he could now no longer serve as a director without again seeking the permission of the court, Jay Hannington continued acting as Capital Metal Recycling’s director until its liquidation on 12 August 2019.</p>

<p>In addition, Ajay Laxman, an accountant, knew that Jay Hannington had breached the court’s conditions, but he let him continue acting as director until March 2019.</p>

<p>Jay Robert Hannington admitted he was the director of a company whilst disqualified and signed a new disqualification undertaking on 8 October 2021. His new ban starts on 29 October 2021 and lasts for 11 years.</p>

<p>Ajay Surendranath Laxman admitted he allowed Jay Hannington to act as a director while still disqualified. His ban started on 21 September 2021 and lasts for 6 years.</p>

<p>The disqualifications prevent them from directly or indirectly becoming involved in the promotion, formation or management of a company without the permission of the court.</p>

<p>Dave Elliott, Chief Investigator of the Insolvency Service, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The court imposed conditions designed to protect the public, but Jay Hannington breached those conditions and then continued acting as director while disqualified.</p>

  <p>The Insolvency Service takes these breaches of disqualification undertakings very seriously. This is reflected in the length of Jay Hannington’s new disqualification.</p>

  <p class="last-child">And Ajay Laxman’s disqualification should be a reminder to directors that allowing misconduct by a co-director is also serious misconduct.</p>
</blockquote>
