<p>The Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) has made several senior appointments to its Strategic Leadership Team.</p>

<p>Among those appointed are a new Executive Director of Strategy and Performance, Finance, Business Transformation, Human Resources and Organisational Development, a Board Secretary and a Commercial Director.</p>

<p>In a first for the organisation, all interviews with candidates were conducted using video technology to ensure social distancing guidelines could be followed and to reduce the need for people to travel.</p>

<p>DBS issues nearly six million disclosure checks a year and is also responsible for maintaining the Adults’ and Children’s Barred Lists. The organisation employs over 1,000 staff who work out of offices in Liverpool and Darlington and funds over 40 police disclosure units.</p>

<p>The recently recruited directors will be responsible for delivering the organisation’s strategy and reporting to the DBS board on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>DBS continues to play a leading role in the country’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, providing DBS checks on nearly 200,000 medical professionals, carers and volunteers who have answered the nation’s call to arms as the United Kingdom fights the virus.</p>

<p>Chief Executive of DBS Eric Robinson said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I am delighted to be able to appoint a number of senior leaders to the organisation. Due to retirement and colleagues leaving us for pastures new, our leadership team was left with several gaps that needed filling. Those recruited are able to bring with them years of strategic leadership and vision as well as specific expertise needed by the organisation if we are to achieve our ambition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">It is an exciting time for DBS as we have just published our new 5-year strategy that will see the organisation transform to become truly customer focussed ensuring that we embrace technology to improve our services. We certainly utilised modern ways of working when recruiting for these roles and it was the first time, I had conducted interviews on video but I have to say, it was a really good process and one that I would consider again in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
