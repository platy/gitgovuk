<ul>
  <li>Government has secured 20 million doses for all of UK</li>
  <li>Doses expected to be available from later this year</li>
</ul>

<p>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>) has today announced that the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen meets the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness. The independent Commission on Human Medicines (<abbr title="Commission on Human Medicines">CHM</abbr>) has reviewed the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>’s decision and endorsed it.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the single-dose vaccine was shown to be 67% effective overall in preventing COVID-19 infection and 85% effective in preventing severe disease or hospitalisation.</p>

<p>The vaccine can be stored at fridge temperatures, between 2 and 8 degrees, making it ideal for distribution to care homes and other locations across the UK.</p>

<p>Through the UK’s Vaccine Taskforce, 20 million doses of the vaccine have been secured for all 4 nations of the UK and first deliveries are expected to arrive from later this year.</p>

<p>The vaccination programme continues at pace and remains on track to offer a jab to all adults by the end of July.</p>

<p>Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a further boost to the UK’s hugely successful vaccination programme, which has already saved over 13,000 lives, and means that we now have 4 safe and effective vaccines approved to help protect people from this awful virus.</p>

  <p class="last-child">As Janssen is a single-dose vaccine, it will play an important role in the months to come as we redouble our efforts to encourage everyone to get their jabs and potentially begin a booster programme later this year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As with all vaccines, the government is in regular contact with the manufacturers, including exploring how best to optimise supply across the current programme and preparing for a potential booster programme from later this year. Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine is part of the Cov-Boost study to assess its safety and effectiveness as the third dose of a potential booster programme.</p>

<p>Alongside this, the government is working with the devolved administrations to ensure the vaccine is deployed fairly across the UK.</p>

<p>The Vaccine Taskforce originally secured 30 million doses of the Janssen vaccine last year, based on the predicted clinical need at the time. With the UK’s COVID-19 vaccination programme continuing at an unprecedented scale and pace, the government has decided to amend its original order to 20 million.</p>

<p>The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>) will submit updated advice for the Janssen vaccine before doses become available.</p>

<p>The company continues to explore a 2-dose regimen of their vaccine. The single-dose regimen has also been authorised by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>

<p>The government is preparing for a booster programme based on clinical need and will publish further details in due course. The final policy will be informed by advice from the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> and take into account the results of clinical trials.</p>

<p>Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Janssen vaccine will be another weapon in our arsenal to beat this pandemic.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We are doing everything we can to vaccinate all adults as quickly as possible and I encourage everybody to come forward for a jab as soon as they are eligible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vaccinated people are far less likely to get COVID-19 symptoms. Vaccinated people are even more unlikely to get serious COVID-19, to be admitted to hospital, or to die from it, and there is growing evidence that vaccinated people are less likely to pass the virus to others.</p>

<h2>Background information</h2>

<p>Through the government’s Vaccine Taskforce, the UK has secured early access to over 500 million doses of 8 of the most promising vaccine candidates, including: BioNTech/Pfizer, Oxford/AstraZeneca, Moderna, Janssen, Novavax, GSK/Sanofi, Valneva and CureVac.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccine-surveillance-report" class="govuk-link">latest data from PHE’s real-world study</a> shows the vaccines are already having a significant impact in the UK, reducing hospitalisations and deaths, saving more than 13,200 lives and preventing more than 39,700 hospitalisations in England up to 13 May.</p>

<p>PHE analysis also shows that individuals who receive a single dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine have approximately 80% lower risk of death against the B.1.1.7 coronavirus variant originating in Kent and a second dose of the vaccine can provide 85% to 90% protection against symptomatic disease. Protection against death from the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine rises from approximately 80% after one dose to 97% after 2 doses against the Kent variant.</p>
