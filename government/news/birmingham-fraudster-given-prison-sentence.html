<p>A 69 year-old woman who preyed on a couple seeking help with their immigration status, has been given a 19 month prison sentence for fraud.</p>

<p>Mrs Zabun Nissa of Herrick Road, Birmingham, pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud, contrary to Sections 1 and 2 of the Fraud Act 2006 at Birmingham Crown Court in November 2020. On her return to the court on 3 February  she was given details of her sentence.</p>

<p>Mrs Nissa befriended the couple , and claimed to work at Birmingham Airport’s immigration department. Using this false position to gain their trust she charged the victims £8,450  for immigration work that was never carried out. This included help in obtaining British Citizenship; employment within the immigration department at Birmingham Airport; and visas for other family members to come to the UK and work.</p>

<p>Judge Mukherjee said, “This offending was very mean and very serious. You preyed on a couple who found themselves in a difficult position. You established trust in them – your word in the Pre-Sentencing Report is that you ‘targeted’ them. They called you ‘auntie’. You know how important a title that is. You lied to them from the outset. This was a planned fraud for financial gain.</p>

<p>“It was prolonged, persistent and planned.”</p>

<p>Mrs Nissa was previously convicted of similar offences in 2008.</p>

<p>The judge added, “This offending is so serious that only an immediate custodial sentence can be justified.”</p>

<p>Speaking about the case, Immigration Services Commissioner John Tuckett said:</p>

<p>“Zabun Nissa allowed people to put their trust and future in her. She took a considerable sum of money from her victims and then avoided them over a significant period of time. These were serious offences, given the circumstances and the amount of money involved, and demonstrates the harm that can be caused by unregulated immigration advisers.”</p>
