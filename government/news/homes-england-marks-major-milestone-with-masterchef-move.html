<p>Homes England, the Government’s housing and regeneration agency, has agreed a Memorandum of Understanding with development firm Digbeth Loc Limited and their partners to help bring the MasterChef studios to its Warwick Bar site in central Birmingham. It is one of the agency’s first actions to deliver on the Levelling Up agenda set out in the government’s Levelling Up White Paper.</p>

<p>The move marks a significant milestone in the regeneration of Warwick Bar, the keystone in the future of Birmingham’s Digbeth district.</p>

<p>The development of the new studios will bring a major TV production out of London to the heart of the West Midlands and Birmingham, creating unparalleled new opportunities, jobs and investment, and kickstarting a new creative heart for the city, setting the stage for others in the industry to follow suit.</p>

<p>Homes England has assembled Warwick Bar – a collection of derelict and brownfield sites around Digbeth – over recent years to help catalyse the wider regeneration of Digbeth.</p>

<p>As one of the first steps in this journey, the agency will look to lease part of their land, at Fazeley Street, Warwick Bar to Digbeth Loc Limited, who will develop proposals for a mixed-used scheme, starting with a state-of-the-art film studio to house the production of BBC’s MasterChef.</p>

<p>The agreement supports Birmingham City Council’s vision for the area. The council’s Birmingham Development Plan sets out a spatial vision and strategy for the sustainable growth of the city, and identifies Digbeth as a new urban village centred on creative industries, leisure and residential-led mixed use development.</p>

<p>Mike Palin, Interim Executive Director, Markets, Partners &amp; Places at Homes England commented, “The regeneration of Warwick Bar will have a transformational impact on central Birmingham and the wider economy. Not only will it create jobs in the area, it will stimulate the development of a creative hub for the city, delivering on Birmingham City Council’s aspirations and the Levelling Up agenda. The relocation of such a major production operation from London to the city is just the first example of that.</p>

<p>“This agreement is testament to the importance of partnership working in place-making. We have the expertise, the influence, and the appetite to support and empower local leadership to meet their ambitions and transform derelict urban sites into beautiful communities.”</p>

<p>The agreement comes just weeks after the Government announced that Homes England remit will be extended, with a renewed focus on the regeneration of towns and cities, as part of its Levelling Up Whitepaper.</p>

<p>Steven Knight, Digbeth Loc Limited, said, “I am so excited to kick off the regeneration of this area with this announcement.  To have such an iconic, globally respected British brand come to the heart of Birmingham is a genuine game changer for the city and the West Midlands. Birmingham welcomes MasterChef with the promise that more is yet to come.”</p>

<p>The creative-led commercial regeneration of the Fazeley Street plot began late last year, when work commenced on converting the Grade II listed Junction Works building – a purpose-built canal office from the late 18th century – into a high-quality arts venue showcasing local artists in a building owned by Homes England and leased back to Grand Union, a local artists collective.</p>

<p>The regeneration of the wider Warwick Bar site has the opportunity to deliver around 1,000 new homes, and 25,000 square meters of employment / educational floor space.</p>

<p>Homes England will continue work closely with its public and private sector partners to transform the area into a thriving neighbourhood and a commercial hub for the city’s growing creative sector, building on Digbeth’s industrial heritage and the forthcoming connections to HS2.</p>
