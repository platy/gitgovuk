          <p>The 7 Commissioners have been reappointed for five-year terms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ian Comfort and Johanna Higgins from 7 May 2022</li>
  <li>David Brown from 16 May 2022</li>
  <li>Rachel Ellis, Jill Gramann and Rob Ward from 29 September 2022</li>
  <li>Linda Lee from 20 November 2022</li>
</ul>

<p>The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) was established by  the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 (“the Act”) and commenced operation in 1997. The CCRC considers - on application - cases in England, Wales and Northern Ireland where a miscarriage of justice is alleged or suspected. The CCRC decides if there is any new evidence or new argument which raises a real possibility that an appeal court would quash a conviction or reduce a sentence.</p>

<p>The appointment of CCRC Commissioners are  regulated by the Commissioner for Public Appointments and recruitment processes comply with the Cabinet Office Governance Code on Public Appointments, as do the proposed reappointments.</p>

<p>Appointments to CCRC are made by Her Majesty the Queen on the recommendation of the Prime Minister who receives advice from the Deputy Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State.</p>
