<p>Louis Roberts joins the Government Property Agency (GPA) as Deputy Director for Workplace Service Delivery. He brings more than two decades of private sector expertise gained from the UK property industry.</p>

<p>Louis is supporting the GPA to strengthen its service strategy and solutions for property across government departments in the UK. And will play a strategic role in expanding the GPA’s workplace solutions expertise as it continues to deliver productive and collaborative spaces for the UK’s civil servants.</p>

<p>Louis’ success in delivering sustainable growth and stability is backed by his experience gained working with global brands including Jaguar Land Rover, Barclays and EY.</p>

<hr>

<p>Purpose, transformation, value - the three words Louis shared when asking what attracted him to his new role with GPA.</p>

<p>When Louis found himself starting to look for his next opportunity, it was the public sector that captured his attention. Louis commented; “I wanted to challenge myself, and wanted to feel a deeper sense of purpose. I knew about GPA and its purpose, and I see its strategic value in transforming the government’s general office estate. I wanted to be a part of something big, and it doesn’t get much bigger than this.</p>

<p>“As I moved through the recruitment process, each step gave me more confidence this was the place I wanted to be. The people I met, the conversations and meetings I was involved in, all demonstrated the extensive and diverse skill set GPA has acquired. It’s a fast growing organisation. It’s putting the right people in place to create an effective balance between private sector and industry commercial knowledge and civil service experience. And it’s those people - us - making the GPA a great place to work, and a great organisation to work with.”</p>

<p>Louis continues; “People will always need places for work. It’s upon us to adapt quickly to building-user needs, and provide the spaces in our buildings that support civil servants to be productive and happy at work. It is so important that this is done in a cost-conscious way, so value will always remain a key element of the changes we will see.“</p>

<p>And finally, when asking Louis what his biggest aspiration is within GPA, he comments; “Adding value by driving forward GPA’s strategic objectives, and enhancing what the government and public sector do well. And mostly, empowering people throughout the journey. We’re all on this journey together - colleagues, clients, customers and supply partners. And there is so much valuable expertise and knowledge we can tap into. I want to play a part in empowering people to realise their potential and be confident when positively impacting civil service experiences.”</p>
