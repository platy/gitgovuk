<p>Driving for Better Business is a government-backed National Highways programme to help employers in both the private and public sectors reduce work-related road risk, control the associated costs and improve compliance with current legislation and guidance.</p>

<p>The ambition of the programme is to bring about radical change in how organisations think about worked-related road risk, and to improve the levels of compliance for all those who drive or ride for work by demonstrating the significant business benefits of managing work-related road risk more effectively.</p>

<p>National Highways Chief Executive Nick Harris said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">It is a great honour that we have been recognised for our Driving for Better Business road safety programme, which has successfully improved road safety and also brought financial benefits to the many companies that have joined. If you are a fleet operator, please do look at the benefits that the Driving for Better Business can bring.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>HRH Prince Michael of Kent said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Initiatives which ensure the safe use of vehicles by those who drive for work are of immense importance. The approach taken to promote the critical role of employers in delivering road safety by highlighting the many business benefits that stem from good management is truly innovative. The Driving for Better Business programme is a fine example of what can be done by sharing good practice and through inspiring leadership.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I am therefore delighted that the campaign has been selected to receive my International Road Safety Award in recognition of its innovation and outstanding achievement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Driving for Better Business programme is free to access and contains useful online tools and resources to help organisations evaluate practices, strengthen culture, enhance performance and demonstrate leadership in the management of work-related road risk.</p>

<p>Since 1987 the Awards have given public recognition to those who have improved road safety throughout Britain. Now the Prince Michael International Road Safety Awards recognise outstanding achievement and innovation world-wide.</p>

<p>Each year the most outstanding examples of international road safety initiatives are given public recognition through the scheme.</p>

<p>All road users, including pedestrians, drivers, cyclists, bikers and horse riders are asked to identify those whose initiatives make our roads safer and nominate them for an award.</p>
