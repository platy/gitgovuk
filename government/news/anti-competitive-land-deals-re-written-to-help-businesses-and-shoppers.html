  <li>Waitrose re-writes land deals to allow rivals to open nearby</li>
  <li>“We will continue to take action when our rules are broken”, says CMA’s Adam Land</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Waitrose admitted to a total of 7 breaches of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/groceries-market-investigation-controlled-land-order-2010">Groceries Market Investigation (Controlled Land) Order 201</a>0 between 2010 and 2019 after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-demands-action-after-tesco-blocks-rival-supermarkets">took a closer look at how supermarkets were competin</a>g. The Order was brought in by the CMA to ensure supermarkets cannot use restrictive terms to prevent rivals from opening stores.</p>

<p>By helping supermarkets to compete freely, the Order aims to ensure that shoppers have more choice and so benefit from a wider range of groceries and access to cheaper prices – which is even more important as the cost of living rises.</p>

<p>To comply with the Order, Waitrose has agreed to remove restrictions from land agreements which prevented rivals from setting up new stores.</p>

<p>The 7 breaches relate to the following locations, where Waitrose operate existing stores:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bromsgrove</li>
  <li>Rustington</li>
  <li>Swindon</li>
  <li>Daventry</li>
  <li>Chester</li>
  <li>Notting Hill Gate</li>
  <li>Market Harborough</li>
</ul>

<p>Adam Land, Senior Director of Remedies at the CMA, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s disappointing that Waitrose has acted against the interests of shoppers, despite these rules having been in place for over 10 years.</p>

  <p>Families across the UK are facing the rising cost of living. Preventing other supermarkets from opening new stores could stop people saving on their weekly shop.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Waitrose is now putting this right so that everyone gets a fair deal. We will continue to take action when our rules are broken, and we have asked all supermarkets to show us their land deals comply with the Order.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The announcement today follows similar changes from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-demands-action-after-tesco-blocks-rival-supermarkets">Tesco</a> in 2020 after the CMA found it had breached the same rules 23 times.</p>

<h2>Notes to editors</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The CMA’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-letter-to-waitrose-about-land-agreements-restricting-competition">letter</a> sent to Waitrose is publicly available and sets out the CMA’s response to the seven breaches reported by the supermarket.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The CMA’s assessment of land deals by other supermarkets covered by the Order is ongoing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the CMA does not currently have the power to fine those who breach the Order, the government is currently considering giving the CMA these powers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Groceries Market Investigation (Controlled Land) Order 2010 banned new restrictive covenants, which prohibit a piece of land from being used for a supermarket, when it came into force in 2010.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Order also banned Exclusivity Arrangements (which prevent landlords from allowing competing stores in the same block as an existing supermarket) which were over 5 years long.</p>
