          <p>Tuesday 19 October marks the start of the National Apprenticeship Awards 2021 regional finals, with virtual ceremonies taking place to recognise apprentice employers, apprentices, Rising Stars and Champions up and down the country.</p>

<p>Back for their 18th year, the National Apprenticeship Awards highlight the benefits apprenticeships bring to individuals, businesses, and local communities, and celebrate the successes of those that have gone above and beyond to make a difference.</p>

<p>Over 1,000 entries from apprentice employers, apprentices, and apprenticeship champions have been received this year from all over England. The breadth of industries and sectors recognised highlights the broad appeal of apprenticeships, and how employers and individuals are continuing to build business and career success through apprenticeships.</p>

<p>Minister for Skills Alex Burghart said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the new Minister for Skills, I’m a major believer in what apprenticeships can do for employers, the economy, and the apprentices themselves, so a huge congratulations to everyone taking part in these regional finals.</p>

  <p>Apprenticeships are incubators of greatness. These nominees are showing just how much potential apprenticeships have to offer opportunities and skills on the job. Good luck to everyone involved.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I very much hope you all enjoy a fantastic ceremony and celebrate the achievements and successes of apprenticeships in your region, and I thank you very much for all you do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Director of Apprenticeships, Education and Skills Funding Agency Peter Mucklow added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apprentices and apprentice employers are really flying the flag for apprenticeships at this time, and I admire that commitment to rebuild our economy and drive change.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I am also delighted to see the ‘Apprentices in Action’ mini-series, which has been supported by EY, and I cannot wait to see some of the amazing stories that have and will be shared.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This year the Apprentices in Action series, presented by EY, follows on from the success of last year’s ‘Apprentices on the Frontline’ campaign where we celebrated and recognised employers who retained apprentices and supported them to do outstanding things throughout the pandemic.</p>

<p>For 2021, we will be focussing on how employers and apprentices are contributing to business recovery and highlighting those who have shown their ongoing resilience.</p>

<p>The Special Recognition Award winner will be selected from a short list of the most inspirational ‘Apprentices in Action’ stories and will be announced at the National Ceremony.</p>
