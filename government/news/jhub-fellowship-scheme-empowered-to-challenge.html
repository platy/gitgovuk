<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">You’re given an incredible number of freedoms working in the jHub and you’re trusted to work within those. The difference with a naval training environment is significant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite only having worked in the team for 6 months it has provided him with more than enough time to appreciate jHub career opportunities:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">There is a real push to experience the job hands on. Whether that be going out to where the users are, either operationally or at home, or meeting and working alongside industry suppliers who are at the bleeding edge of modern technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The integrated nature of Strategic Command means dotted lines connect everyone working in Defence, and means the pool of potential users for Ollie to work with is incredibly broad.</p>

<p>A common theme with those we’ve spoken to at the jHub is the feeling of empowerment among the workforce. By encouraging contributions from everyone a holistic approach to tasks is generated and this is echoed by Ollie:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">You’re empowered to challenge, ask questions and voice your opinions, and this is all handled delicately by the leadership. What you’re left with are the views and experience from a range of different people which can then be used in the most effective way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And whereas some within the MOD plan and prepare for the long-term future, Ollie highlights the here and now work he’s involved in at the jHub:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">On any given day I might be working with the Special Forces and industry leaders to help solve a problem that could have immediate risk to life which is an incredibly rewarding experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There aren’t many fields of work where someone in a junior role would be tasked with liaising with industry leaders to help solve urgent problems however this, Ollie tells us, is what makes jHub the place it is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I’m given the authority to engage with both the upper ends of Defence and the upper end of industry and, as an opportunity, this is second to none.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Ollie concludes, if you’re looking for a role that will provide you with the freedom and power to make critical decisions, look no further than the jHub.</p>
