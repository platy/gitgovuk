<p>HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) has automatically registered 95,000 businesses for its simplified import procedures allowing most traders up to 6 months to pay import duties and submit customs declarations, if the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal on 31 October 2019.</p>

<p>The scheme, known as Transitional Simplified Procedures (<abbr title="Transitional Simplified Procedures">TSP</abbr>), will make importing after Brexit on 31 October much simpler, particularly for businesses that would be completing customs processes for the first time. Up to now, businesses have had to apply for it – over 30,000 had previously registered.</p>

<p>This <abbr title="Transitional Simplified Procedures">TSP</abbr> scheme will allow most businesses up to 6 months to send in customs declarations and pay any customs duties to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> after importing goods from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. This will prevent congestion at the border when goods enter the UK.</p>

<p>The government has chosen to automatically enrol <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses that import from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> into the <abbr title="Transitional Simplified Procedures">TSP</abbr> scheme as it is the best option for businesses that are new to customs processes and haven’t yet appointed a customs agent. Businesses that are not registered for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> should apply for the scheme if it would benefit them.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-standard-goods-using-transitional-simplified-procedures">more information on <abbr title="Transitional Simplified Procedures">TSP</abbr></a> and the records businesses need to keep.</p>
</div>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Interim CEO Jim Harra said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are doing everything we can to help businesses get ready for Brexit on 31 October.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This move will support the trade of thousands of businesses and is part of our longstanding policy of making sure we continue to keep trade flowing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (<abbr title="British Chambers of Commerce">BCC</abbr>), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At a time of change, the top priorities at the border have to be keeping trade flowing and minimising the potential for disruption.</p>

  <p>Automatically registering companies for <abbr title="Transitional Simplified Procedures">TSP</abbr> at the border means one less immediate demand on traders’ limited time and resources in the unwanted event of a ‘no-deal’ exit.</p>

  <p class="last-child">In particular, it would help the thousands of UK firms who import from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> but have little experience of dealing with customs processes. We are pleased that ministers have again listened to <abbr title="British Chambers of Commerce">BCC</abbr>’s calls to reduce the number of administrative hoops businesses will need to jump through as they navigate major changes to the way they trade across borders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Businesses registered for <abbr title="Transitional Simplified Procedures">TSP</abbr> today are UK-based traders that <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has a record of having imported goods from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> in 2018.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has sent letters to these traders with further details of their <abbr title="Transitional Simplified Procedures">TSP</abbr> registration, and they only have to take a few simple extra steps – such as checking if their goods attract tariffs, and getting a Duty Deferment Account if they do – to make sure that they are ready for 31 October.</p>

<p>Importers do not have to use <abbr title="Transitional Simplified Procedures">TSP</abbr>: they still also have the option to use full import processes instead. However, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> strongly advises traders new to dealing with customs to take advantage of the benefits of <abbr title="Transitional Simplified Procedures">TSP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The UK remains committed to ensuring the country’s borders remain secure, and simplified customs measures will not change that. Border Force will continue to carry out intelligence-led checks.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, <abbr title="Transitional Simplified Procedures">TSP</abbr> arrangements become active from the leaving date.</p>

<p>In the letter businesses being registered receive, they will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check what tariffs will apply to their goods after Brexit and whether they need to pay customs duties on their goods – under the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/temporary-tariff-regime-updated">temporary tariff</a>, 88% of total imports to the UK by value would be eligible for tariff-free access</li>
  <li>if they do have duties to pay, they must apply for a Duty Deferment Account before importing goods – this allows them to pay the duties they owe monthly by direct debit rather than as soon as the goods enter the UK</li>
  <li>keep customs records of all the goods they import from the date the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and get ready to make monthly declarations to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Traders can choose to delay making declarations until 6 May 2020, giving them more time to get used to new processes. If they choose to delay making declarations until 6 May 2020, payment for the duties they owe will be taken by direct debit on 15 May 2020. Traders should prepare to account for the import <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on imports on their normal <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return.</p>

<p>If a trader doesn’t receive a letter but thinks they should get <abbr title="Transitional Simplified Procedures">TSP</abbr>, they can apply on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Non-<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> registered traders who import goods from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> are also encouraged to register for <abbr title="Transitional Simplified Procedures">TSP</abbr>. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is developing a new online service which will let them report and pay import <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on a quarterly import <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return if they choose to delay making declarations until 6 May 2020. This service will be available to sign up for after Brexit.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-standard-goods-using-transitional-simplified-procedures">more information on <abbr title="Transitional Simplified Procedures">TSP</abbr></a> and the records you need to keep.</p>

<p>A copy of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/no-deal-brexit-advice-for-businesses-only-trading-with-the-eu">letter to businesses</a> has been published on GOV.UK today (15 October 2019).</p>

<h3 id="hmrc-action-to-prepare-traders">
<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> action to prepare traders</h3>

<p>This announcement comes after <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> auto-enrolled 88,000 <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered traders with UK EORI numbers in August. Having a UK EORI is the vital first step for businesses to take if they wish to continue trading with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> as normal after 31 October.</p>

<p>Earlier this month <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> also invested a further £10 million in grants to boost the staff capability of customs agents after Brexit. This grant is available to businesses currently completing customs declarations on behalf of other importers and exporters. The investment followed previous funding of £16m in September as well as £5 million provided in December 2018 available to UK traders.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has sent over 1.3 million letters and emails to traders, published a wide range of guidance, step-by-step guides, videos, webinars and held events to help businesses and agents prepare for a no deal scenario.</p>

<p>Businesses can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc/business-support">register for our free email update service</a> - select ‘business help and education emails’, then select ‘Brexit’.</p>

<p>Businesses can also use the GOV.UK readiness checker to ensure that they have made the necessary preparations for 31 October, or call the new Brexit import and export helpline on 0300 3301 331 for advice.</p>
