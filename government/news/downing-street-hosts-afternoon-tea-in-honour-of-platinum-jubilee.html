<p>The Queen’s Baton for the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games made an appearance in Downing Street as the four-day Platinum Jubilee events drew to a close yesterday. It marked the end of the Relay in London following an epic four-day tour around major landmarks in the capital, including iconic venues across Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.</p>

<p>Hosted by Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries and Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston, attendees included young people from cadets, scouts, beavers, cubs, girl guides and brownie groups, as well as recipients of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pointsoflight.gov.uk/" rel="external">Points of Light Award</a>, Commonwealth athletes and representatives of Age UK.</p>

<p>Schoolchildren from St Mary Cray Primary Academy in Orpington were also in attendance, with some of the children having recently arrived in the UK after fleeing the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Athletes in attendance included current and former Commonwealth Games England sporting stars - Paralympic athlete and medalist Thomas Young, squash players Alison Waters, Gina Kennedy and Sara-Jane Perry and beach volleyball players Javier Bello and Joaquin Bello.</p>

<p>The Batonbearers bringing the Baton to Downing Street today were Kash Gill – a world champion kick boxer and Courtney Hughes, who received a Point of Light award for her services to the elderly and vulnerable, through a charity she founded at age 13 to support lonely and isolated people in crisis at Christmas.</p>

<p>As part of the event today, the Culture Secretary awarded Kash Gill a Point of Light award to acknowledge his community spirit. Since lockdown, Kash has been running free martial arts, fitness classes and community running groups in Handsworth Park Birmingham for people of all ages.</p>

<p>Alongside this, he also runs anti-gang and anti-knife campaigns and works with the West Midlands Police to promote unity in the community through sports.</p>

<p>After today, the Baton will continue its relay around the Commonwealth, passing through the Falkland Islands, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man before touring through Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and England ahead of its return to the Midlands for the Commonwealth Games’ Opening Ceremony in Birmingham on July 28.</p>

<p>Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are delighted to round off the incredible Platinum Jubilee celebrations with the arrival of the Queen’s Baton Relay to Downing Street. It’s been fantastic to see Britain come out in force this weekend to mark 70 years of Her Majesty The Queen’s reign.</p>

  <p class="last-child">There is still so much more to look forward to in 2022. Next month, Birmingham and the West Midlands will host a fantastic Commonwealth Games and UNBOXED continues to bring world-class art and culture to communities nationwide.</p>
</blockquote>
