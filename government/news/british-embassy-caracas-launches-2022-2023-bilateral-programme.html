<p>Deadline:  Wednesday 18 May 2022 11:59 PM.</p>

<h3>What is the Bilateral Programme?</h3>

<p>The Bilateral Programme is the main channel through which the British Embassy finances projects in Venezuela. These should contribute towards achieving results within strategic objectives and expected outcomes identified by the Embassy, which benefit Venezuela.</p>

<p>Through this programme, the Embassy has supported various projects on areas such as human rights and democracy, economic reform, sustainable development and energy.</p>

<h3>What are the Embassy´s expected areas of work for FY 2022-2023?</h3>

<p>This year, we are looking for projects that focus on the various themes listed below. Some indicative outcomes that projects could look to achieve within each theme are also listed below. These are not exhaustive and are meant to serve as a guide. You may still bid for funding for a project as long as it falls under the broad theme, even if the expected outcomes are different. The themes listed below are in no particular order.</p>

<h4>Human Rights and Human Rights Defenders</h4>

<p>Indicative outcomes:</p>

<h3>Key points to consider before submitting your bids</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Activities should be carried out before 31 March 2022. Please plan to start activities by August 2022.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Payments are made in arrears (reimbursements). This means that the Embassy is not allowed to pay up-front for project activities which have not taken place.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overhead/administration costs should not exceed 10% of the overall project budget.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least 85% of the funds must be implemented by December 2022.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure the proposed project purpose (in the format) is well defined and specific, and fits within at least one of the listed cooperation themes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Co-financing from other institutions is welcomed. Please include this as part of your bid if appropriate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each organisation may only present one (1) proposal per area of work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Purchase of capital goods, including infrastructure, properties, furniture and/or IT equipment, is not authorised.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All projects must align with the Paris Agreement and consider climate and environmental risks, as well as their impact on gender equality.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These points are subject to change at the discretion of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO).</p>

<h3>Gender equality</h3>

<p>The British Government is committed to achieving gender equality at home and worldwide, which is why we pushed for a standalone Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) on gender.</p>

<p>As such, we expect that all projects funded by the Embassy are gender mainstreamed by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>paying careful consideration to the level of female participation in the delivery of project activities, which applies both for implementers and beneficiaries;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>understanding and responding to the different needs of women and girls taking part/benefitted by the project, which should be considered at the project design stage, during its implementation, and as part of the evaluation of the project impact;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and considering and preparing for the differentiated impact the activities may have on women and girls taking part in the project.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Who may send in their project proposal?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>state institutions – at all levels</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>non-governmental organisations (NGOs), legally registered</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>universities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>think tanks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>private sector and commerce and industry chambers</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Before applying, please be sure you are able to submit the following legal documentation, when required by the Embassy (do not forward these documents when applying):</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a copy of the Identity Card (Cédula) of the legal representative of the organisation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>What is the indicative process timeline?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>18 May 2022 - Deadline for potential project implementers to send in their project proposal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>6 June 2022 – Embassy notifies shortlisted potential project implementers of their semi-finalist status, and asks them to develop a revised project proposal, accompanied by it activity based budget (ABB), aimed at contributing to one of the specified areas of work.</p>

<p>The form is designed to  determine why your organisation is best suited to deliver a project aimed at achieving one of our cooperation outcomes, what type of activities you envisage as part of a project funded by the Embassy, how much it would cost and with whom you would partner up to deliver project activities. Please note we will not considered proposals presented in a different format.</p>

<p>After receiving your project proposal, the Embassy will produce a shortlist according to agreed criteria such as whether the project is sustainable in the long-term, has a multiplying effect, represents value-for-money and is gender mainstreamed.</p>

<p>These criteria are reflected in an appraisal matrix the Embassy uses to mark potential project implementers. Those with higher marks will be shortlisted and required to develop a full project bid. Please note the Embassy may consider asking organisations to join up as partners and work on a full project bid together.</p>

<p>The Embassy project board will then meet to assess project bids.</p>

<h3>What comprises the monitoring process for projects?</h3>

<p>Once approved, and in accordance with the grant agreement/contract/MoU, the implementing organisation must submit quarterly reports, and a final evaluation report.</p>

<p>Please note that Embassy staff will keep in touch with your organisation throughout the project implementation and may call for monitoring meetings or participate in project activities.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>creation of a network of organisations aimed at tackling violence against women and girls in Venezuela</p>
  </li>
  <li>
