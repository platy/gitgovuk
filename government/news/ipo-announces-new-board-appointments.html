<p>Adam’s appointment will take affect from 1 September 2022, and follows the forthcoming departure of current Chief Executive Tim Moss, who is joining the Welsh Government as Chief Operating Officer and Director General.</p>

<p>Adam will assume responsibilities over the next few months while open competition to find a permanent appointment to the role concludes.</p>

<p>Adam joined the Intellectual Property Office in 2009 as Head of International Coordination in the Copyright and Enforcement Directorate. He then took up the role of Deputy Director of International Policy in July 2013, and the role of Director in September 2017.</p>

<p>Adam has previously worked for the UK government on defence policy matters and has extensive experience dealing with policy issues in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> and <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization">NATO</abbr> as well as undertaking bilateral negotiations.</p>

<p><strong>Commenting on his appointment, Adam said:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I’m delighted to have been appointed Interim <abbr title="Chief executive office">CEO</abbr>. Together with my colleagues on the Executive Board we are looking forward to providing continuity of leadership to ensure we continue as a great place to work for our people and ensure excellent delivery for our customers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The IPO has also been carrying out further recruitment exercises and implementing some organisational design changes.</p>

<p><strong>Andy Bartlett has been appointed as Deputy <abbr title="Chief executive office">CEO</abbr> and Director of Services.</strong></p>

<p>This role is responsible for delivering all current services to customers, IT and our One IPO transformation programme, to deliver the <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> office of the future.</p>

<p>Andy will continue to drive the ambitious work already underway to create a truly customer focused organisation, transforming our customers’ experience of accessing and managing their <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> rights in a more streamlined and efficient way</p>

<p>The IPO also confirms appointments in the following roles, completing the organisational design process:</p>

<p><strong>Chris Mills, Director, Rights Policy and Enforcement at the IPO</strong></p>

<p>In this role, Chris will be responsible for all areas of domestic <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> rights policy and legislation including patents, trade marks, designs and copyright, in addition to continuing to lead on <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> enforcement issues. The role will help support UK innovation through&nbsp;<abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>, including specific oversight of policy areas currently under development through consultative exercises, such as <abbr title="Artifical Intelligience">AI</abbr>, Designs, and music streaming.</p>

<p>He will also jointly lead the Policy Group with the interim Director of Business and International Policy, when this post is backfilled following Adam’s appointment as interim <abbr title="Chief executive office">CEO</abbr>.</p>

<p><strong>Pippa Hall as Director of Strategy:</strong></p>

<p>The Strategy Directorate will coordinate the IPO’s strategic direction, ensuring progress towards corporate priorities, and alignment with wider Government initiatives.</p>

<p>Pippa will work with the services and policy functions to support initiatives across the organisation.&nbsp; She&nbsp;will coordinate and have oversight of wider strategies and business plans within the IPO, to ensure alignment and&nbsp;deliver the IPO’s overall corporate strategy, corporate plan, and priorities.</p>

<p><strong>Sian- Nia Davies as Chief Data and Technology Officer:</strong></p>

<p>Sian-Nia will lead on the creation of a world leading technology platform to provide businesses and citizens with the tools they need to harness the power of <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>. Reporting to the Deputy <abbr title="Chief executive office">CEO</abbr> and Director of Services, Sian-Nia&nbsp;will ensure that the IPO’s tech capability continues to support its strategic ambitions.</p>

<p>She will lead on the exploitation of new technologies including <abbr title="Meta Language">ML</abbr> and <abbr title="Artifical Intelligience">AI</abbr> - together with more established tech - to deliver a user centred service central to the One IPO transformation journey.</p>

<p>These new appointments are made in addition to the following existing board roles, which complete the redesigned board structure:</p>

<p><strong>Neil Hartley as Director of Finance</strong></p>

<p>As Director of Finance, Neil remains responsible for financial strategy, operations and systems, accounts and financial reporting, budgets, controls and procurement.</p>

<p><strong>Penny Phillpotts as Director of People and Place:</strong></p>

<p>As Director of People and Place, Penny remains responsible for all Human Resources, Organisational Design and Estates matters. The responsibility includes further embedding equality, diversity and inclusion throughout the organisation, supporting innovation by helping make the IPO a brilliant place to work.</p>

<p><strong>The IPO’s Chief Executive Tim Moss said:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">It is testament to the strong leadership across the IPO that the organisation has clear succession planning in place, and we can seamlessly move from one state to another. I have full confidence that the Executive Board will provide continuity of leadership and they, and our wider senior leaders, have the technical expertise required to match our ambition to the best <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> office in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our new board look forward to opportunities to meet with stakeholders in the coming weeks and months, and to continuing the IPO’s long standing relationships with partner organisations and their members.</p>
