<p>Ploughshare, the company owned by the Ministry of Defence (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>) that finds new and inspiring uses for government inventions, has won more than £280,000 in grants to develop 2 technologies for the benefit of society.</p>

<p>Ploughshare facilitated successful bids by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (<abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>) to the government’s new Knowledge Assets Grant Fund. The funds will assist in the development of 2 new technologies – a predictive test for sepsis being developed by Presymptom Health, and a sensor that can detect and identify laser threats from Sentinel Photonics.</p>

<p>The grants, offered by the Knowledge Assets unit in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>), are to support the repurposing, commercialisation or expanded use of public sector knowledge assets. 
This is part of the Government’s Knowledge Assets initiative which aims to unlock the value of Knowledge Assets for social, economic and financial benefit to the public with a targeted programme of work and support to organisations across Government.</p>

<p>David English, <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> Chief Finance Officer, commented:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We’re delighted that these science and technology innovations developed by <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> will be further advanced. These 2 examples are indicative of <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>’s commitment to protect lives through superior technology and innovation, while also supporting <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> industry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the case of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.presymptom.com/" rel="external">Presymptom Health</a>, Ploughshare supported <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> in securing up to £100,000 from the fund which it will use to contract Presymptom Health to conduct research and development of <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> machine learning software. This software could be used to analyse thousands of blood samples in <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>’s biobank, accumulated over 10 years of research.</p>

<p>Initial trials of the technology, first developed for the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> for use on the front line and now licensed by Ploughshare to Presymptom Health, suggest it can predict the onset of sepsis in patients up to three days before symptoms appear, enabling clinicians to treat them much sooner and manage them more effectively.</p>

<p>Ploughshare also aided <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> in its bid for £180,000 relating to its work with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sentinelphotonics.co.uk/" rel="external">Sentinel Photonics</a>, which is developing sophisticated technology to detect and protect against laser threats. The technology, licensed to Sentinel by Ploughshare, was developed for military use to detect and assess the threat levels of lasers deployed against personnel, aircraft and vehicles.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> will use the grant funding to contract Sentinel to explore opportunities for civilian use – for example as a method of detection and threat level assessment when lasers are shone at commercial aircraft such as air ambulances, or at sporting events. The technology could potentially be installed in public areas to detect lasers, acting as a deterrent against their illegal use.</p>

<p>Hetti Barkworth-Nanton, CEO of Ploughshare, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are delighted to have facilitated <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>’s successful applications so that Presymptom Health and Sentinel Photonics can be among the first to benefit from the Knowledge Assets Grant Fund. This fund was created specifically to test the potential of knowledge assets for expanded or alternative use – directly in line with our mission to enable the commercialisation of government defence research for the benefit of society.</p>

  <p class="last-child">These 2 technologies are at a very exciting stage of development, and the support of <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> and <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> will enable them to take the next step towards delivering positive societal impact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chris Burgess, Sentinel Photonics CEO, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We are grateful for the support of Ploughshare, <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> in securing these funds which will enable us to take a significant step in unlocking the potential for our technology to detect and protect against laser threats to civilians. This grant will give us space and time to hold conversations with relevant organisations while continuing to develop and refine our technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Iain Miller, CEO at Presymptom Health, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As we continue to explore the potential for our technology to provide early diagnosis of sepsis, which claims the lives of up to 11 million people each year around the world, we are grateful for this grant which could enable us to find new ways of detecting tell-tale markers which are an indication for the disease.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Our development of machine learning technology, with the support of <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> and enabled by the Knowledge Assets Grant Fund, could greatly increase the rate at which we can analyse samples, enabling us to bring this potentially life-saving test into general use more quickly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ploughshare, wholly owned by <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>, has unique access to a wide range of technologies developed by leading scientists and engineers at the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> and wider government. Since it was founded in 2005 it has licensed more than 140 innovative technologies and created more than 400 jobs.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-the-knowledge-assets-grant-fund">Knowledge Assets Grant Fund</a>, operated out of <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>, offers grants of up to £250,000 to support the repurposing, commercialisation or expanded use of public sector knowledge assets. This aims to realise the potential of these assets for the benefit of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. Later this year, a new dedicated unit in <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will launch to support knowledge asset development, including a new funding round for the Knowledge Assets Grant Fund.</p>
