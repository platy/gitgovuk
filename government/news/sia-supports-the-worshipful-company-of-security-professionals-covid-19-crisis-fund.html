<p>Launched in January 2021, The Worshipful Company of Security Professionals Charitable Trust, crisis fund seeks to help those working within the security industry in a front line, security role who have suffered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes those in private security as well as blue light services and the military.</p>

<p>The Worshipful Company of Security Professionals Charitable Trust is offering two types of grants:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£250 for applicants who have been hospitalised due to COVID-19</li>
  <li>£500 to dependents of those who have died because of COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<p>Members of the private security industry who fit the criteria can apply for the grant by downloading the <a rel="external" href="https://wcosp.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WCoSP-Covid19-Crisis-Fund-Application-Form-update.pdf" class="govuk-link">application form here</a>. For more information about the Worshipful Company of Security Professionals Charitable Trust COVID fund, please visit the website <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://wcosp.org.uk/charitable-trust/">here</a>.</p>

<p>A business can also apply for the fund on behalf of their employees and funds are paid directly to the employee.</p>

<p>The SIA’s grant comes from monies recovered from the proceeds of crime confiscation orders under the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/29/contents">Proceeds of Crime Act 2002</a> (POCA). Since 2017 the SIA has been pursuing financial recovery from convicted criminals following prosecution. Where the SIA has brought a prosecution and there has been a conviction, the SIA may undertake confiscation proceedings against those convicted. If successful, the SIA receives a percentage of the confiscated money. The proceeds must be used to either fund good causes or further SIA financial investigations.</p>

<p>Pete Easterbrook, the SIA’s Head of Criminal Investigation, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We are delighted to be making a significant contribution to support victims of the pandemic, as well as building firm relationships with the Worshipful Company of Security Professionals. The purpose of confiscation under the Proceeds of Crime Act is to ensure that crime does not pay and it feels like suitable restorative justice to return money to individuals in the private security industry that was originally gained illegally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yasmeen Stratton, Master of the Worshipful Company of Security Professionals said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Our front line personnel continue to play a vital role protecting our businesses and people. The crisis fund is a simple process that provides a swift response to security staff who have been adversely affected by COVID-19, and with a fund capability that will respond to the anticipated high number of grant applications. The company and the charitable trust have always supported the most vulnerable people working in - and retired from - the security profession, and that work continues. I am delighted to see the launch of the COVID-19 fund as it offers almost immediate support to people in our industry where a small financial cushion can make a big difference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Claire Palmer, Chair of the Charitable Trust, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Early on in the pandemic the research expressed that those working in front line security had been particularly affected by COVID-19. We wanted to do something about that and provide a focal point for industry to make donations and with a straight forward easy process for those affected. Whilst the sum granted to individuals is relatively small, to those applying for the grants, it is a vital form of support and ensures we can reach the maximum number of front line security workers. We are particularly grateful to the SIA for their support of this initiative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The SIA’s grant to the Worshipful Company of Security Professionals is the third that it has made from the proceeds of crime reparations. In 2020 the SIA donated £25,000 to the EY Foundation Secure Futures initiative. It also invested £20,000 in The Prince’s Trust ‘Get into Security’ initiative in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>The SIA will announce when there are opportunities for national and regional charities to bid for a donation from the SIA’s grant for good causes. Further details are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/learn-about-the-sia-grant-for-good-causes" class="govuk-link">available on GOV.UK</a>.</p>
