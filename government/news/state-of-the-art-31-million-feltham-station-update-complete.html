  <li>£31 million Feltham station upgrade completed with extended platforms, new pedestrian and cycle bridge and step-free entrance</li>
  <li>closure of Feltham West level crossing has enhanced the safety of local community</li>
  <li>£375 million project to replace older signalling by 2024 continues, improving reliability on busy commuter line</li>
</ul>

<p>Important upgrades to improve accessibility, local connections and increase capacity at Feltham station have been completed, Rail Minister Chris Heaton-Harris has announced today (5 February 2021), thanks to government investment of £31 million.</p>

<p>The station and the surrounding area has seen a host of improvements since Network Rail began work in September 2018, delivering significant benefits to passengers on a busy commuter line into London Waterloo. 
These include extended platforms to allow longer 10-car trains to call, while the Feltham West level crossing has been closed to improve community safety.</p>

<p>Accessibility has also been enhanced with the construction of a new shared pedestrian and cycle bridge, providing a bike-friendly route over the railway, along with a further step-free entrance to platform 1, next to newly positioned bus stops, improving local connections.</p>

<p>It comes as a £375 million project to replace older signalling with new state-of-the-art equipment continues, with the new technology set to improve reliability for passengers by reducing the time it takes to restore services in times of disruption.</p>

<p>Rail Minister Chris Heaton-Harris said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These important upgrades to Feltham station will make a huge difference on this key commuter line from London Waterloo, providing smoother passenger journeys and improved accessibility into and between platforms.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This investment underlines our commitment to build back better out of COVID-19, delivering improved journeys for passengers as they return to the railway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mark Killick, route director at Network Rail Wessex, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We’re committed to providing better journeys for passengers. These improvements, on a key route into London, make the station more accessible for passengers and the local community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="https://www.networkrail.co.uk/running-the-railway/our-routes/wessex/feltham-and-wokingham-re-signalling-programme/" class="govuk-link">Feltham and Wokingham Resignalling Programme (FWRP)</a> involves the full renewal of the signalling systems and is being delivered in 6 stages between 2021 and 2024. As part of the work, a number of level crossings in the area are being upgraded to improve the reliability and resilience of services, and to ensure the safety of local residents using them.</p>

<p>Alex Foulds, South Western Railway’s Commercial Projects Director, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This joint effort to enhance Feltham station is fantastic news for our customers and the local community. The improvements to accessibility, a modern new station entrance and improved links with cycle and bus routes will make the station a first-class gateway to the area.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The extended platforms will also welcome our brand-new fleet of longer Arterio trains later this year, fully equipped with charging points at every seat, onboard wifi and increased capacity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today’s news comes ahead of the introduction of a new state-of-the-art train stabling and maintenance depot in Feltham that will serve <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.southwesternrailway.com/travelling-with-us/our-trains/arterio">South Western Railway’s new £1 billion fleet of Arterio trains</a> when it opens later this year.</p>
