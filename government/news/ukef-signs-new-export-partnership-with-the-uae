<p>UK Export Finance (<abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>) has signed a cooperation agreement with its counterpart in the United Arab Emirates (<abbr title="United Arab Emirates">UAE</abbr>), the Etihad Credit Agency (<abbr title="Etihad Credit Agency">ECI</abbr>), that will strengthen trade cooperation and boost investment between the UK and <abbr title="United Arab Emirates">UAE</abbr>.</p>

<p>The agreement provides a general framework for reinsurance underwriting between <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> and <abbr title="Etihad Credit Agency">ECI</abbr> that will enable the two agencies to combine their financial support to help UK and <abbr title="United Arab Emirates">UAE</abbr> businesses secure export contracts anywhere in the world.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> can now support the export of products from the <abbr title="United Arab Emirates">UAE</abbr> through its collaboration with <abbr title="Etihad Credit Agency">ECI</abbr> where a transaction also involves substantial trading opportunities for UK exporters in third countries.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Arab Emirates">UAE</abbr> was one of the top destinations for exports supported by <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> last year and total trade between the two countries is now worth £17.8 billion. This agreement will strengthen this trading relationship and create more opportunities for UK businesses to export.</p>

<p>UK Minister for Exports, Graham Stuart, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This partnership is a boost to our trading relationship and to businesses in both countries. The <abbr title="United Arab Emirates">UAE</abbr> is diversifying its exports away from oil and gas into renewable energy and its goals to reduce its dependency on fossil fuels align with our own.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Having overtaken France last year to become the world’s fifth largest exporter, we are determined to help businesses across the UK access the finance they need to take advantage of new opportunities uncovered by <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> across the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His Excellency Dr. Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, Minister of State for Foreign Trade and Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors of Etihad Credit Insurance, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The <abbr title="United Arab Emirates">UAE</abbr> and the UK have always had strong trade relations over the years, and this agreement reflects the keenness of both nations to enhance the competitive advantage of our respective business sector in the international market. We are pleased to enter this partnership with <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>, with our strong confidence that this will further help <abbr title="Etihad Credit Agency">ECI</abbr> propel <abbr title="United Arab Emirates">UAE</abbr> businesses towards greater heights. This alliance will prove instrumental in advancing the <abbr title="United Arab Emirates">UAE</abbr>’s national economic non-oil diversification programmes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Louis Taylor, <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s Chief Executive, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">There is a strong pipeline of new opportunities in renewable energy and healthcare – among others – where UK and <abbr title="United Arab Emirates">UAE</abbr> businesses can offer their expertise. This agreement will help us tap into that shared potential and increase the scale of new business that we can support in cooperation with <abbr title="Etihad Credit Agency">ECI</abbr>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Massimo Falcioni, CEO of <abbr title="Etihad Credit Agency">ECI</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The <abbr title="United Arab Emirates">UAE</abbr> and the UK have always had strong trade relations over the years, and this agreement reflects the keenness of both nations to enhance the competitive advantage of our respective businesses in the international market. We are pleased to enter this partnership with <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>, with confidence that this will further help <abbr title="Etihad Credit Agency">ECI</abbr> propel <abbr title="United Arab Emirates">UAE</abbr> businesses towards greater heights. This alliance will prove instrumental in advancing the <abbr title="United Arab Emirates">UAE</abbr>’s national economic non-oil diversification, in line with our country’s vision.</p>
