<p>Pride Cup and the UK Government bring you the Pride Cup Community Cricket Series - inspired by the Ashes and celebrating LGBTI+ inclusion in sport with three community Pride Cups kicking off in Geelong on 20 February 2022 before heading to Canberra and Newcastle in March.</p>

<p>These Pride Cups will be a celebration of the diverse identities that help make our international cricket teams so unique and impactful throughout the LGBTI+ community.</p>

<p>We are also celebrating the historic rivalry between the UK and Australia with an exhibition match at each of the games in this series. The Geelong curtain raiser match will feature MP’s Andy Meddick and Chris Couzen, Pride Cup Chair Holly Ransom, Victorian Commissioner for LGBTI+ communities Todd Fernando and LGBTI+ community leaders from across Victoria.</p>

<p>The Geelong leg of the Community Cricket Series will take place at South Barwon Reserve with South Barwon Cricket Club taking on Collendina Cricket Club across 6 teams on 3 grounds.</p>

<p>Pride Cup CEO James Lolicato said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pride Cup is extremely proud to be partnering with the UK Government to help change the landscape of LGBTI+ inclusion in sport and make cricket everyone’s game.</p>

  <p>The UK Government is helping achieve safer sporting environments around the globe. We know that sport is a human right and everybody deserves a safe and equitable connection to a sporting club that accepts them for who they are.</p>

  <p>Evaluation has shown how communities can change by hosting a Pride Cup, and the Barwon Cricket Association is dedicated to seeing those positive changes ripple across their league.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Through running education, delivering inclusive activations and showcasing diversity, we can ensure LGBTI+ people are included and welcomed in our community sport clubs, which for a long time hasn’t been the case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>British High Commissioner to Australia, Vicki Treadell said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re delighted to be supporting Pride Cup on the Community Cricket Series. The UK and Australia share a love of sport – we’re great mates on and off the field - but it’s fair to say we see some of our greatest rivalry in cricket! The recent Ashes tournament was a great example of this - I won’t talk about the men’s result - but proudly watched on as the Women chased down the final runs needed to draw in what was an exceptional match.</p>

  <p>Watching and playing sport can feel like a break from reality – but these sports and these teams must also be a reflection of reality and inclusive and open to all players - regardless of their sexuality or gender identity.</p>

  <p>The UK is committed to championing LGBT+ rights globally. We’re co-chairs of the Equal Rights Coalition and this year we are hosting ‘Safe to Be Me: A Global Equality Conference”. This is the UK Government’s first global LGBT+ conference coinciding with the first official London Pride March’s 50th anniversary.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I’m excited to see the themes of the Conference come to light in this tournament – tackling discrimination and ensuring equal opportunities for all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Geelong game organiser Jennifer Walsh said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This Pride Cup event is incredibly important because it not only highlights LGBTI+ inclusion in sport, but also increasing LGBTI+ inclusion in regional Victoria. My teammates and our opposition players are so excited about taking part in such a positive, fun, and inclusive day of sport where everyone belongs and everyone is celebrated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pride Cup works with all levels of sport to build a world where LGBTI+ people feel included, accepted and proud to be who they are, and empowers clubs to become leaders for inclusivity and diversity in their communities.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://outonthefields.com/">Research</a> shows that 80 per cent of Australians have experienced or witnessed homophobia in sport; 75 per cent believe openly gay spectators would not be safe at a sporting event; and 87 per cent of young gay men and 75 per cent of young gay women hide their sexuality while playing sport.</p>
