<h2>Analysis in Government Awards 2021</h2>

<p>We are delighted to announce the 2021 Analysis in Government Awards are now open for nominations. These awards are the perfect opportunity to recognise, celebrate and reward the exceptional work being undertaken across the Analysis Function. There are six different award categories, so make sure you nominate a team or individual that has made a real difference and celebrate those people who deserve an award for their achievements.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/7MGR68/" rel="external">Nominations will be open</a> from 4 October until midnight on 12 November.</p>

<p>You’ll find everything you need to nominate right here on this launch page, including information on each of the categories, what the judging panel will be looking for and some tips on writing a winning entry. You can also read about previous winners and find inspiration on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/launch-of-the-analysis-in-government-awards">Analysis in Government Awards 2020 article</a>.</p>

<h2>Award categories</h2>

<h3>Collaboration</h3>

<p>Do you know an individual or team who has collaborated between teams, departments, other professions, external organisations or researchers to deliver a piece of analysis or analytical project or know of others that have? Then why not submit a nomination form for this category?</p>

<p>A winning entry will demonstrate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Collaboration which improved data and methods</li>
  <li>Ways of working which enabled effective collaboration</li>
  <li>Collaboration which enhanced the insight and understanding of the findings</li>
  <li>Successful collaboration with stakeholders such as other analytical professions, other teams in your department, other government departments, organisations outside government, topic and method experts, policy professionals, producers of related analysis, international organisations and researchers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Innovative Methods</h3>

<p>This award recognises innovative methods or techniques of analysis.  Have your colleagues or team used methods which led to new insight, answered complex questions, or improved efficiency? Nominate them to ensure their work is recognised and rewarded.</p>

<p>A winning entry will demonstrate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Innovative analytical methods and techniques used</li>
  <li>Methods which led to new insight, answered complex questions, or improved efficiency</li>
  <li>The strengths and limitations of the methods used were considered, and communicated effectively to users</li>
  <li>Feedback from peer reviewers and experts was invited and acted upon to refine the methods</li>
</ul>

<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>This award celebrates those who have successfully used clear communications to present analysis, considering needs of the audience. This could be an example of public-facing or internal communication within teams, departments or across professions. Do you know someone who has demonstrated the story of data analysis using commentary, visualisations, interactives or social media?  If so, then submit a nomination for the communication award.</p>

<p>A winning entry will demonstrate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use of innovative methods of communicating and disseminating analysis</li>
  <li>Analysis presented clearly and explained meaningfully for all users</li>

<h3>Impact</h3>

<p>Has your colleague or team’s outstanding analysis helped influence a policy decision?  Has it met an identified knowledge gap? This award will recognise analysis which has been impactful through use, influenced decision-making and/or has contributed to public debate in this award category. </p>

<p>A winning entry will demonstrate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A demonstrable link between the analysis and impact; for example, is there evidence to show that the analysis influenced a policy decision?</li>

  <li>The nominee is pro-active in ensuring the analysis has impact</li>

</ul>

<h3>Inclusion</h3>

Celebrate those who have built an inclusive culture by nominating them for this award.</p>

  <li>Acting as a role model and championing the development of colleagues from different backgrounds and with different thought processes and experiences to bring unique viewpoints across their team, department and/or the Analysis Function</li>
  <li>Building an inclusive culture by challenging inequalities, barriers and bias to reflect the experiences of everyone</li>
  <li>Evidence of real impact due to interventions or actions</li>
</ul>

<h3>New category for 2021: The Sir Ian Diamond Excellence Award 2021</h3>

<p>New for 2021, we want to recognise an individual that has displayed excellence in championing or promoting the Analysis Function.

<h2>How to nominate</h2>

<p>It’s easy to nominate a team or individual for one of the awards. Simply submit your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/7MGR68/" rel="external">Analysis in Government Awards nomination form</a> by midnight on 12 November.</p>
</div>

<h2>Tips for writing a great nomination</h2>

<p>Use Plain English by writing in short, clear sentences and using everyday words without acronyms and unnecessary jargon. Remember that the judges may not be familiar with your topic area, so use simple language.</p>

<p>Use the STAR method by explaining the Situation, Task, Action and Result of your work. In particular, judges really want you to showcase the impact of the nominee’s work.</p>

<p>Be clear on the criteria and address each point of the award you are nominating for. These can be found in the nomination form.</p>

<p>Include any appropriate links to your work to demonstrate any outputs you may want to showcase.</p>

<p>Keep within the word count of 1,000 words.</p>

<h2>When will the winners be announced?</h2>

<p>Nominations will be considered by our judging panel following the closing date on 12 November. The six highest scoring nominations will then be passed to an expert judging panel to decide on two highly commended nominations, one runner-up and one winner in each of the four categories. These winners will be announced at an exclusive awards ceremony in December.</p>

<p>If you are part of the Analysis Function and you would like to join the judging panel, email the team at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Analysis.Function@ons.gov.uk">Analysis.Function@ons.gov.uk</a>.</p>
