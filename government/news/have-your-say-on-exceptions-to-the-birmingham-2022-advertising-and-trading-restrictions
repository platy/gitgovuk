<p>Individuals and organisations who could be affected by measures to restrict advertising and trading in and around Birmingham 2022 Games locations are being encouraged to provide their views on a number of proposed exceptions.</p>

<p>The Birmingham Commonwealth Games Act contains offences concerning unauthorised advertising and unauthorised trading in certain places at certain times. These restrictions will help ensure we deliver on our hosting commitments for the Games. They will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>protect the rights of commercial sponsors, whose contributions help to offset the public costs of the Games</li>
  <li>ensure Birmingham 2022 Games locations and their surroundings have a consistent look and feel in line with Commonwealth Games branding</li>
  <li>ensure people can safely access the venues and the free flow of spectators</li>
</ul>

<p>The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) is working closely with the Birmingham 2022 Organising Committee and our Games partners to ensure we take a proportionate approach - one that protects the rights of commercial sponsors and ensures that spectators can move easily and safely around Games locations while minimising disruption to existing businesses.</p>

<p>The consultation will run from 5 November until 11 January. Responses will be used to inform potential exceptions to the advertising and trading offences which we expect to be brought forward in secondary legislation later next year. An ‘exception’ is a form of advertising or trading activity (for example, public transport services) that will not be caught by the advertising and trading offences in the Act.</p>

<p>The restrictions will be in place in and around specified Games locations at specified times, and will only be in place when and where necessary, but there is the possibility that the restrictions could apply at any time between 7 July to 13 August (a maximum of 38 days).</p>

<p>A list of the Games locations that we currently expect to be affected is included in the consultation document. In most cases, we would expect the restrictions on advertising and trading to extend no more than a few hundred metres around each location’s perimeter. However, in some circumstances, restrictions may need to extend further to ensure that designated walking routes and key transport hubs are taken into account.</p>

<p>This consultation does not address the timing or vicinity of the restrictions, as this will be driven by when and how Games locations are used and is the subject of ongoing operational planning. Once they have been finalised, the locations and timings of the restrictions will be set out in secondary legislation.</p>

<p>For more information on the proposals, and to respond to the consultation, please visit: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/exceptions-to-birmingham-2022-advertising-and-trading-restrictions" class="govuk-link">https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/exceptions-to-birmingham-2022-advertising-and-trading-restrictions</a></p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>The Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games (28 July to 8 August) is an unprecedented opportunity to showcase Birmingham and the West Midlands on a global stage. The Games will deliver lasting economic and cultural benefits to the whole of the region and support in renewal and recovery post-Covid-19.</p>

<p>With around £350 million in potential procurement, local and regional suppliers are well placed to benefit. 76% of Organising Committee contracts for the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games went to local businesses and the Games contributed more than £740m to the Scottish economy.</p>

<p>In line with similar legislation that was introduced for the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics and the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games, the UK Parliament has passed the <a rel="external" href="https://services.parliament.uk/Bills/2019-21/birminghamcommonwealthgames.html" class="govuk-link">Birmingham Commonwealth Games Act</a>. The act provides a small number of temporary operational measures to help deliver a successful Commonwealth Games and satisfy the requirements associated with hosting a major multi-sport event. The act and its measures are key in ensuring the Games are delivered successfully and the West Midlands benefits economically from the staging of the Games.</p>

<p>The act includes criminal offences relating to unauthorised advertising and trading in and around Games locations at specified times to ensure. These restrictions will help us to deliver on our hosting commitments for the Games by protecting the rights of commercial sponsors and ensuring that spectators can move easily and safely around Games locations.</p>
