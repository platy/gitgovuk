<p>The Attorney General is seeking to appoint new members to three of her panels of junior counsel, the London A, B and C panels, to undertake civil work for government departments.</p>

<p>Membership of the London panels is open to both barristers and solicitors with the appropriate qualifications.</p>

<h2>The London A, B and C panels</h2>

<h3>London A Panel</h3>

<p>Members of this panel deal with the most complex government cases in all kinds of courts and tribunals including the Supreme Court. They will often appear against QC’s. Those previously appointed to the A panel have generally had in excess of 10 years advocacy experience in actual practice (from end of 2nd six months’ pupillage for barristers, date of commencement of advocacy for solicitors).</p>

<h3>London B Panel</h3>

<p>Members of this panel deal with substantial cases but not in general as complex as those handled by the A panel. They will generally be instructed where knowledge and experience of a particular field is required. Those previously appointed to the B panel have generally had between 5 and 10 years advocacy experience in actual practice (from end of 2nd six months’ pupillage for barristers, date of commencement of advocacy for solicitors).</p>

<h3>London C Panel</h3>

<p>Members of this panel will be expected to have at least two years’ experience in actual practice (from end of 2nd six months’ pupillage for barristers, date of commencement of advocacy for solicitors). Those appointed to the C panel will often (but not exclusively) provide the A and B panel members of the future and so should have the potential to join the A panel.</p>

<p>In choosing which of the panels to apply to, candidates will want to make a careful decision based on which best suits their level of expertise and experience.</p>

<p>Appointments will be for five years.</p>

<h2>Experience and specialisms</h2>

<p>As is the case every year, the Attorney General is looking for applicants with experience in general public and administrative law; employment; or personal injury. For the 2021 exercise, the Attorney is also looking to deepen the capacity of the panels by appointing specialists in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Admiralty – Maritime/Shipping</li>
  <li>Charity/Trust</li>
  <li>Clinical negligence</li>
  <li>Competition and State Aid</li>
  <li>Construction</li>
  <li>Contract / Commercial Law</li>
  <li>Corporate</li>
  <li>Costs (including routine &amp;/or mass group litigation experience)</li>
  <li>Data Protection</li>
  <li>Defamation</li>
  <li>Directors’ Disqualification</li>
  <li>Education, including teacher regulation proceedings</li>
  <li>Energy/Utilities</li>
  <li>Environmental Law</li>
  <li>Equality and Discrimination</li>
  <li>EU Law</li>
  <li>Extradition</li>
  <li>Family and Public Children’s Law</li>
  <li>General Tax Work – Direct and Indirect, Personal and Business</li>
  <li>Human Rights</li>
  <li>Industrial Diseases</li>
  <li>Industrial Relations</li>
  <li>Inquests</li>
  <li>Insolvency</li>
  <li>Intellectual Property</li>
  <li>International Arbitration</li>
  <li>Land and Planning/Environmental</li>
  <li>Mental Health/Mental Health Capacity Act 2005</li>
  <li>Pensions</li>
  <li>Planning (including Environmental Impact expertise)</li>
  <li>Procurement</li>
  <li>Property (including Landlord and Tenant)</li>
  <li>Rating and Valuation</li>
  <li>Social Security, including free movement, social justice and statutory payments</li>
  <li>State Aid</li>
  <li>Trade expertise, International Trade</li>
  <li>VAT and Duties</li>
</ul>

<p>The Attorney General is also looking to appoint applicants capable of advising departments on the interface of public and commercial law issues, and also where criminal or regulatory issues arise in public law cases.</p>

<h2>Application</h2>

<p>To obtain details about the application process, we recommend reading our <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/963542/Information_for_Candidates.docx">Information for candidates</a> (<span class="type">MS Word Document</span>, <span class="file-size">57.7KB</span>)</span> and <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/963543/FAQ_sheet_for_Candidates.docx">Frequently Asked Questions</a> (<span class="type">MS Word Document</span>, <span class="file-size">60.9KB</span>)</span>.</p>

<p>To make an application, please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:panelcounsel@governmentlegal.gov.uk">panelcounsel@governmentlegal.gov.uk</a> and register an interest in applying. Please note that registering an interest does not commit you to making an application if you later decide not to do so.</p>

<p>Once you have registered, you will be provided with a link to access our online portal to obtain the full application pack.</p>

<p>Completed applications must be submitted by noon on Thursday 8 April 2021.</p>

<p>We will be hosting a virtual recruitment seminar to be held via Zoom on Tuesday 9 March in the evening for anyone considering applying this spring. Please see the attached <span class="attachment-inline"><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/965819/Flyer_for_Widening_Pool_event.doc" class="govuk-link">Flyer</a> (<span class="type">MS Word Document</span>, <span class="file-size">57.5KB</span>)</span> for more information.</p>

<h2>Further information and mentoring</h2>

<p>If you have any queries, please feel free to raise them in the first instance with the Government Legal Department Panel Counsel Secretariat via email <a href="mailto:panelcounsel@governmentlegal.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">panelcounsel@governmentlegal.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>We wish to encourage applications from as wide a range as possible of those eligible to apply. We will therefore endeavour to put advocates who are considering applying and who want to discuss the application process in touch with an established Panel member. The mentor will discuss either by telephone or in a meeting the application process, the eligibility criteria and the presentation of relevant information on the application form.</p>

<p>If you are considering applying and want a mentor please contact the Panel Counsel Secretariat via email:</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:panelcounsel@governmentlegal.gov.uk">panelcounsel@governmentlegal.gov.uk</a> on or before Friday 12 March 2021.</p>
