  <li>visitors from Denmark arriving in the <abbr title="United Kingdon">UK</abbr> from 4am Saturday 7 November will be denied entry</li>
  <li>British Nationals, visa holders and permanent residents who have travelled to Denmark in the last 14 days will have to self-isolate along with their household</li>

<p>The Home Office is announcing that from 4am, Saturday 7 November 2020, visitors arriving into the <abbr title="United Kingdon">UK</abbr> from Denmark will not be permitted entry into the <abbr title="United Kingdon">UK</abbr>. This excludes freight and hauliers.This means that all non-British national or resident travellers who have been in or transited through Denmark in the last 14 days will be denied entry by Border Force upon arrival.</p>

<p>The decision to act quickly follows the release of further information from health authorities in Denmark reporting widespread outbreaks of coronavirus (COVID-19) in mink farms, with a variant strain of the virus spreading to some local communities.</p>

<p>Yesterday the Department for Transport announced that Denmark would no longer be on the <abbr title="United Kingdon">UK</abbr>â€™s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-travel-corridors" class="govuk-link">travel corridors list</a>. We are also now expanding the self-isolation requirements for Denmark. From 4am on 7 November, British Nationals, or residents, who are returning to the <abbr title="United Kingdon">UK</abbr> directly or indirectly from Denmark will need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-how-to-self-isolate-when-you-travel-to-the-uk/coronavirus-covid-19-how-to-self-isolate-when-you-travel-to-the-uk" class="govuk-link">self-isolate</a> along with all other members of their household until 2 weeks have passed since they were last in Denmark. Unlike other travel to the <abbr title="United Kingdon">UK</abbr>, there will be no <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-travellers-exempt-from-uk-border-rules/coronavirus-covid-19-travellers-exempt-from-uk-border-rules" class="govuk-link">exemptions to this quarantine policy</a>.</p>

<p>For those who arrived before 4am on 7 November, we are also asking anyone who has been in Denmark in the last 14 days, to self-isolate along with their households. The length of that self-isolation will depend on when travellers were last in Denmark, and those affected will be contacted with advice via the means detailed on their passenger locator forms completed on arrival to the <abbr title="United Kingdon">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>Anyone who has returned from Denmark within the last 2 weeks will be contacted to ensure they complete the self-isolation needed to ensure the virus does not spread across the <abbr title="United Kingdon">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdon">UK</abbr> government is working closely with international partners to understand the changes in the virus that have been reported in Denmark and we are conducting a programme of further research here in the <abbr title="United Kingdon">UK</abbr> to inform our risk assessments.</p>

<p>All travellers, including British Nationals and residents who are returning from Denmark, will be required to show a complete passenger locator form on arrival into the <abbr title="United Kingdon">UK</abbr>. This is critical in being able to track the virus in case of any local outbreaks. Yesterday the Home Office announced they would step up Border Force presence to ensure that those arriving to the <abbr title="United Kingdon">UK</abbr> from Denmark were compliant with the new restrictions.</p>

<p>The travel ban and expanded self-isolation requirements will be reviewed after one week.</p>

<p>Decisions on border measures and travel advice can be changed rapidly if necessary to help stop the spread of the disease and further announcements regarding freight will be made later today.</p>
