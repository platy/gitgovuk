<p>The transformational Ayrshire Growth Deal reached a major milestone today (19th November 2020) when partners ratified the implementation and financial arrangements for the £251 million investment in the region.</p>

<p>Secretary of State for Scotland, Alister Jack, joined the three Council Leaders, Councillors Douglas Reid, Joe Cullinane and Peter Henderson, and Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity, Michael Matheson, for a virtual event to conduct the landmark signing.</p>

<p>The deal will galvanise efforts to develop key strategic sites and sectors in Ayrshire.  It will help leverage private sector investment of more than £300 million, with the potential of creating up to 7,000 new jobs.</p>

<p>The UK Government is investing £103 million into eight projects including regeneration, research and innovation, infrastructure, marine science and aerospace technology. The Scottish Government are also investing £103 million with local partners contributing the rest.</p>

<p>Secretary of State for Scotland, Alister Jack said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a landmark moment for Ayrshire.  The deal we have agreed today will have a profound positive impact on the region for generations to come.</p>

  <p class="last-child">From advanced manufacturing, to clean energy, to aerospace and marine science -  the UK Government’s £103 million investment will cultivate innovative and sustainable industries that bring quality jobs and benefit Ayrshire’s communities.
Growth Deals are important to our long term economic recovery from COVID-19 and the UK Government’s £1.5 billion in Growth Deal investment across Scotland is securing our future prosperity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The deal will position Ayrshire as one of the UK’s leading centres of Aerospace and Space activity through an ambitious and transformational Aerospace and Space Programme. This will be supported by both the Scottish and UK Governments, with total funding for the programme of £80 million. £32 million will be invested by the UK Government and £30 million by the Scottish Government, with a further £18 million from South Ayrshire Council.</p>

<p>Ian Annett, Deputy CEO, UK Space Agency said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The deal will deliver another boost to the UK’s growing space sector by funding a range of new, cutting-edge aerospace activities around Glasgow Prestwick Airport, including development of the spaceport site.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This will not only create highly-skilled jobs across the region but also further the UK’s reputation as Europe’s leading new space destination and bring us one step closer to small satellite launches taking place in the UK.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both governments will each invest £3.5 million in the HALO Kilmarnock regeneration project.  Work is already well underway to transform the former Johnnie Walker bottling site into a dynamic commercial, educational and advanced training hub, with a focus on sustainability and low carbon energy.  Earlier this month HALO announced it would also be participating in the UK Government’s £1 billion Kickstart Scheme to create 200 cybersecurity job placement opportunities for young people.</p>

<p>Other UK Government Ayrshire Growth Deal investments include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£10 million for the Ayrshire Manufacturing Investment Corridor (AMIC) to establish a new national asset at Kilmarnock which will build on Ayrshire’s proud history of manufacturing</li>
  <li>£5 million for the i3 Irvine Enterprise Area Advanced Manufacturing Space to create a National Digital Processing Industry Hub and advanced manufacturing flexible space</li>
  <li>£17 million for the National Energy Research Demonstrator Project (NERD) which will work on solutions to technical challenges that currently prevent the harnessing of local but intermittent energy generation</li>
  <li>£18 million for a Centre for Research into Low Carbon Energy and Circular Economy (CECE) at the Hunterston Strategic West Scotland Industrial Hub</li>
  <li>£6.5 million in a new International Marine Science and Environmental Centre (IMSE) based at Ardrossan</li>
  <li>£11 million for a subsea fibre optic cable to have its landing point in Irvine</li>
</ul>

<p>The projects represent a tremendous opportunity to improve the well-being of communities and the economy.  Signing this deal will allow partners to progress plans to support recovery and renewal post Covid-19, and transform Ayrshire into a 21st century powerhouse for growth.</p>
