  <li>Theme of ‘Build the Future’ announced for NAW2021</li>
  <li>Focus on how employers train, retain and achieve with apprenticeships</li>
  <li>Toolkit available online to assist the apprenticeship community in getting involved</li>
</ul>

<p>“Build the Future” is the theme for NAW2021, taking place between 8 and 14 February 2021, aiming to encourage everyone to consider how apprenticeships help individuals to build the skills and knowledge required for a rewarding career.</p>

<p>The 14th annual week-long celebration of apprenticeships, taking place across England, will showcase the impact apprenticeships can have on communities, local businesses and regional economies and how they all benefit from the impact of apprenticeships.</p>

<p>As a result of the pandemic and many individuals relying on technology and virtual meetings more than ever, National Apprenticeship Week 2021 will be different, but just as exciting. NAW2021 will celebrate the motivating stories of how apprentices have helped business adapt and build during a difficult year.</p>

<p>Minister for Apprenticeships and Skills, Gillian Keegan said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apprenticeships are a fantastic way to learn while you earn, opening up new and exciting career paths that can transform lives. It’s been a tough year for everyone, but we want the theme for National Apprenticeship Week 2021 to be a springboard to look ahead to how apprenticeships can futureproof workforces and boost careers.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The week is a great opportunity to highlight the huge range of apprenticeships on offer – from Space Engineer to Registered Nurse. There are currently around 7,000 apprenticeship opportunities available on the Find An Apprenticeship website which will benefit individuals, businesses and local communities. I encourage everyone to get involved and help make it a success.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To support National Apprenticeship Week 2021, individuals, employers, training providers and communities are being encouraged to get involved, to celebrate apprenticeships and how they:</p>

<p><strong>TRAIN apprentices</strong>, and future proof their workforce and careers though apprenticeships;</p>

<p><strong>RETAIN apprentices</strong>, gaining the skills and knowledge needed by the business, and seeing apprentices thrive, whilst having impact;</p>

<p><strong>ACHIEVE a real return on investment from apprentices</strong>; realising the business benefits of apprenticeships, with apprentices progressing in their chosen careers.</p>

<p>Peter Mucklow, Director, Apprenticeships, Education and Skills Funding Agency said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no doubt that National Apprenticeship Week 2021 will be different this year in how we celebrate apprenticeship success.</p>

  <p>We are however continuing to ask employers to encourage everyone to consider how apprenticeships can help build organisations for years to come; whilst showing the clear return on investment realised when apprentices are brought into the business. Employers are helping the nation to #BuildTheFuture through apprenticeships.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The diversity of career options and industries available now, through apprenticeships, is outstanding.  We want all current apprentices from all sectors to get behind the Week and to showcase the positive impact of apprenticeships, on careers, families and communities.</p>
</blockquote>
