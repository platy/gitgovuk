  <li>Multi-million government fund backs local authorities and regulators that are helping businesses to unleash innovation across the UK</li>
  <li>21 initiatives backed by latest round of Regulators’ Pioneer Fund includes the development of standards for drones to carry medical supplies</li>
  <li>Business Minister Lord Callanan: These projects will help bring benefits to British businesses and consumers alike</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Regulators are clearing the runway for drones to transport vaccines and other live-saving drugs, in a ground-breaking venture funded by government.</p>

<p>The project, to be run by the Civil Aviation Authority (<abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr>), is one of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/projects-selected-for-the-regulators-pioneer-fund" class="govuk-link">21 bold new initiatives</a> backed by the government’s Regulators’ Pioneer Fund to propel cutting-edge innovation across the UK.</p>

<p>The Fund supports projects led by regulators and local authorities that help support the country’s regulatory environment to keep pace with technological advances of the future – benefiting both entrepreneurs and consumers.</p>

<p>Using its grant, the <abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr> will develop world-first standards for special containers that will allow drones to safely carry sensitive goods like medical products, so that remote communities can access critical supplies without delay. At present, there is no regime anywhere in the world for testing and approving these containers to make sure that they do not leak even in the event of a crash.</p>

<p>The aviation regulator has also received money to create a service for the public to report safety concerns about drones, while Oxfordshire County Council has won funding to help innovators understand their legal requirements when setting up new trials in the drone industry.</p>

<p>Business Minister Lord Callanan said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Good regulation should spur entrepreneurship, not stand in its way, and this Fund will keep the UK at the cutting-edge of innovation.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The projects we are supporting could pave the way for exciting developments across a range of sectors, from drone technology to healthcare, all of which will bring benefits to British businesses and consumers alike.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In total, 21 projects received a share of £3.7 million of funding, and winning projects include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Oxfordshire County Council – in collaboration with the Met Office, Ordnance Survey, and others – received £198,000 to develop a tool to help self-driving car developers know when they can conduct trials</li>
  <li>The Health and Safety Executive received £198,000 for a project to support construction companies to share information about dangerous incidents to help prevent injuries</li>
  <li>Cornwall Council received £200,000 to improve the monitoring of harmful algal blooms that can enter the food chain through shellfish, leading to sickness and product recalls</li>
  <li>The Scottish Environmental Protection Agency received £200,000 for a hub bringing together businesses and regulators in the Grangemouth Industrial cluster to move towards a net zero economy</li>
</ul>

<p>This investment comes on top of the £10 million awarded by the Fund from 2018 to 2020, which saw approximately £700,000 provided to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to develop synthetic datasets, supporting the development of cutting-edge medical technologies to fight coronavirus (<abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>) and cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>The Fund is part of wider government work on regulation. This includes the recent <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/reforming-the-framework-for-better-regulation">Reforming the Framework for Better Regulation consultation</a> and the Better Regulation Committee, chaired by the Chancellor, which is driving an ambitious reform agenda to ensure the UK’s regulatory framework is fit for purpose and delivers the government’s strategic objectives.</p>
