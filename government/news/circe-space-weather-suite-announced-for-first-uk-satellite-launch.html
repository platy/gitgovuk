<p>The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory’s (<abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>) miniaturised space weather instrumentation suite will be one of the payloads aboard Virgin Orbit which is targeting the first <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> satellite launch this summer from Spaceport Cornwall in Newquay. Virgin Orbit’s Launcher One rocket takes off horizontally, carried aloft by a modified Boeing 747 jet, named Cosmic Girl.</p>

<p>The Coordinated Ionospheric Reconstruction Cubesat Experiment (<abbr title="Coordinated Ionospheric Reconstruction Cubesat Experiment">CIRCE</abbr>) satellite mission comprises two 6U cube-satellites that will be launched into a near-polar low Earth orbit in a string-of-pearls configuration (targeting 555 kilometres altitude). Each 6U satellite bus measures 10cm by 20cm by 30cm (the size of a cereal box), and will fly almost identical instrument capability on both satellites. <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> is partnering with the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> Naval Research Laboratory (<abbr title="Naval Research Laboratory">NRL</abbr>) on the joint mission.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> contribution to <abbr title="Coordinated Ionospheric Reconstruction Cubesat Experiment">CIRCE</abbr> is the In-situ and Remote Ionospheric Sensing (<abbr title="Insitu and Remote Ionospheric Sensing">IRIS</abbr>) suite, complementary to <abbr title="Naval Research Laboratory">NRL</abbr> sensors and comprising 3 highly miniaturised payloads developed for <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> by University College London (<abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr>), University of Bath, and Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (<abbr title="Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd">SSTL</abbr>), drawing on expertise from the University of Surrey. <abbr title="Coordinated Ionospheric Reconstruction Cubesat Experiment">CIRCE</abbr> will characterise a region of the space environment, the ionosphere, which is important for a range of defence and civil applications and can impact <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr>, communications and sensing technology – both in space and on the ground.</p>

<p>All 3 <abbr title="Insitu and Remote Ionospheric Sensing">IRIS</abbr> payloads together occupy a small volume no more than 10cm by 10cm by 20cm. Miniaturisation of space weather sensors means that a significant capability is packed into each satellite bus provided by Blue Canyon Technologies. This type of miniaturisation could pave the way for deployment of many more such sensors as a routine inclusion on other satellites thanks to their small size, weight and power. The result would expand data collection for the near-Earth space environment, and enhance space weather modelling capabilities.</p>

<p>Understanding space weather is crucial to the safe operation of satellites. Solar flares and geomagnetic storms can severely impact satellites in space, as highlighted by the recent loss of 40 Space X Starlink satellites in February 2022.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="CIRCE mission patch" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/152363/CIRCE_mission_patch_960x640.png"></div>
<figcaption><p>Image: CIRCE mission patch</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>During the mission the satellites will be operated from a series of ground stations in conjunction with international partners. As well as data collection, the miniature satellites will act as technology demonstrators, with their utility and performance being assessed to de-risk future missions.</p>

<p>A unique aspect of the <abbr title="Coordinated Ionospheric Reconstruction Cubesat Experiment">CIRCE</abbr> mission is the ability to characterise the same volume of space within a very short return period, enabled by the constellation of 2 near identical spacecraft actively maintaining a lead-follow configuration in the same low Earth orbit, separated by 250 to 500 kilometres. A single satellite in low Earth orbit has an approximately 90 minute revisit period; a multi-satellite constellation would improve on this, but it is the dual-nature of the 2 relatively closely-spaced <abbr title="Coordinated Ionospheric Reconstruction Cubesat Experiment">CIRCE</abbr> satellites that is anticipated to provide unique insights into the temporal dynamics associated with specific ionospheric structures.</p>

<p>Air Vice-Marshal Paul Godfrey, Commander of <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Space Command, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Defence science and technological activity in space has never been more important, whether it is in support of military operations or helping to combat climate change, defence innovation is at the forefront of this work. After it enters orbit from Spaceport Cornwall, <abbr title="Coordinated Ionospheric Reconstruction Cubesat Experiment">CIRCE</abbr> will enhance our understanding of space weather and help us to keep critical satellites safe from the many hazards associated with operating in space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Paul Hollinshead, <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> Chief Executive, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The <abbr title="Coordinated Ionospheric Reconstruction Cubesat Experiment">CIRCE</abbr> mission showcases the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s academic and industry space capabilities and extends the physical boundaries of our collaboration. This joint endeavour with our <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> partners shows there are no limits to what can be achieved with our international allies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Paul Bate, <abbr title="chief executive officer">CEO</abbr> of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Space Agency, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The <abbr title="Coordinated Ionospheric Reconstruction Cubesat Experiment">CIRCE</abbr> space weather experiment will join a host of small satellites on board Virgin Orbit’s first launch from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, and it’s exciting to see the wide range of commercial, academic and government partners who will share this moment in history with us. We are on track to meet our ambition of becoming the first country to offer commercial launch services from Europe, catalysing investment into our growing space sector and creating hundreds of new jobs. I can’t wait to see Cosmic Girl take to the skies above Spaceport Cornwall later this year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Melissa Thorpe, Head of Spaceport Cornwall, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">It’s an honour that critical <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> partnerships are to be launched from Cornwall and we are proud to support the facilitation of these international milestones. The mission aligns with Spaceport Cornwall’s delivery of ‘space for good’, by bringing together partners from across the planet in a shared mission to support transformational space-to-planet communications and applications to benefit humanity.</p>

<h2>Notes to editors</h2>

<h3><abbr title="Insitu and Remote Ionospheric Sensing">IRIS</abbr></h3>

<p><abbr title="Insitu and Remote Ionospheric Sensing">IRIS</abbr> provides in-situ ionospheric particle and radiation measurements (<abbr title="Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer">INMS</abbr> and <abbr title="Radiation Monitor">RadMon</abbr>), combined with remote-sensing of triple-frequency <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr> signals to map the topside ionosphere and beyond (TOPCAT). The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> data will provide useful information in their own right, as well as providing contextual environmental information for <abbr title="Coordinated Ionospheric Reconstruction Cubesat Experiment">CIRCE</abbr>, and enrich the science that can be derived from <abbr title="Naval Research Laboratory">NRL</abbr>’s triple tiny ionospheric photometry (<abbr title="triple tiny ionospheric photometry">Tri-TIP</abbr>) ultra violet optics cameras, for tomographic specification of electron density.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Insitu and Remote Ionospheric Sensing">IRIS</abbr> suite, integrated by <abbr title="Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd">SSTL</abbr>, includes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (<abbr title="Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer">INMS</abbr>), developed by <abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr>’s Mullard Space Science Laboratory, which will improve understanding of the variability of atmospheric drag, the chemistry of the thermosphere and the impact of space weather on the upper-atmosphere;</li>
  <li>A Radiation Monitor (<abbr title="Radiation Monitor">RadMon</abbr>) from <abbr title="Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd">SSTL</abbr> will identify areas of increased radiation for satellites to avoid, help identify suitable orbits and shielding requirements for future satellites, and highlight dynamic radiation enhancements that can be cross-correlated with payload and subsystem anomalies;</li>
  <li>TOPCAT, developed by Bath University’s department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, which will look at remote sensing of triple-frequency <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr> signals, and validate the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s Multi-Instrument Data Analysis System (<abbr title="Multi-Instrument Data Analysis System">MIDAS</abbr>) tomography algorithm for the topside ionosphere and plasmasphere, by using total electron content (<abbr title="total electron content">TEC</abbr>) measurements from the differential phase of <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr> signals, inverting them to derive the electron density of the region.</li>
