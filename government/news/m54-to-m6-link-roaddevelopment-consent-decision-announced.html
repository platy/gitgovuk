<p>The application was to develop a link road between Junction 1 of the M54 and Junction 11 of the M6. The M54 to M6 Link Road aims to reduce congestion on local / regional routes, particularly the A460 and A449.</p>

<p>The scheme will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new link road of approximately 2.5km (1.6 miles) in length between the M54 Junction 1 and the M6 Junction 11</li>
  <li>a new junction at M54 junction 1 to provide direct links to and from the M54 and the new link road, and to maintain the connections to the local road network</li>
  <li>realignment of Hilton Lane over the new link road</li>
  <li>a new junction at M6 Junction 11 with junction capacity improvements and changes proposed to Mill Lane</li>
</ul>

<p>The application was submitted to the Planning Inspectorate for consideration by Highways England on 31 January 2020  and accepted for Examination on 28 February 2020.</p>

<p>Following Examinations during which the public,  Statutory Consultees and  Interested  Parties were given the opportunity to give evidence to the Examining  Authority, recommendations were made to the Secretary  of  State on  21 July 2021. </p>

<p>This is the 110th Nationally  Significant  Infrastructure  Project and 38th transport application to have been examined  by   The Planning  Inspectorate  within the timescales laid down in the Planning Act 2008. </p>

<p>The Planning Inspectorate’s Chief Executive, Sarah Richards said: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The Planning Inspectorate has now examined more than 100  nationally significant infrastructure projects since the Planning Act  2008 process was introduced, ensuring  local communities  have had the opportunity of being involved in the examination of projects that may affect them. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This Examination took place during  the  COVID-19 pandemic and its associated restrictions,  and the  Examining  Authority  worked hard to ensure that local people, the local authority and other Interested Parties were able to fully participate.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The Examining Authority listened and gave full consideration to local views and the evidence gathered during
 the  examination before making their recommendation.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The decision, the recommendation made by the Examining Authority to the Secretary of State and the evidence considered by the Examining Authority in reaching its recommendation are publicly available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://infrastructure.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/projects/west-midlands/m54-to-m6-link-road/" rel="external">project pages of the National Infrastructure Planning website</a></p>
