<p>The British Embassy Washington is pleased to announce a call for bids for a US State Future Transportation Report as part of the UK Government’s Prosperity Fund. The resulting analysis from the project will be used in support of UK engagement on transportation policy priorities at state level across the US. The analysis will also be used to prioritise UK trade and investment engagement in the United States to ensure that we are able to support and react to emerging trends, opportunities, and potential challenges.</p>

<h3 id="the-deadline-for-completion-of-all-work-is-5-march-2021-and-the-budget-must-not-exceed-130000">The deadline for completion of all work is 5 March 2021 and the budget must not exceed £130,000.</h3>

<h3 id="the-deadline-to-submit-bids-is-20-november-2020-please-submit-bids-using-the-attached-template-to-nicholaswoodbridgefcdogovuk">The deadline to submit bids is 20 November 2020. Please submit bids using the attached template to <a href="mailto:nicholas.woodbridge@fcdo.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">nicholas.woodbridge@fcdo.gov.uk</a>.</h3>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<ol>
  <li>The UK is on the verge of a leading a global transport revolution. Innovation and technology are becoming ever more important in overcoming the transportation challenges of the future. The UK is a global leader in transport. International collaboration is essential to maintaining the excellence of the UK’s transport system and the competitive advantage of our innovative businesses, for filling capability gaps and for ensuring value by leveraging international resources.</li>
  <li>The UK seeks to develop its relationships with the transport communities in individual US states as radical new technologies are emerging today that within a generation will transform everyday journeys. Zero tailpipe emission cars are replacing those powered by fossil fuels. Self-driving vehicles will soon allow disabled people and older people to enjoy the freedom to travel that the rest of us take for granted. And advances in data will improve the way that transport services are devised, planned and delivered for the passenger.</li>
  <li>The UK is a global leader in transportation policy which is evidence based, outcome driven, and performance measured. In June 2019 the UK became the first major global economy to pass a law that requires us to achieve ‘net zero’ greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. The UK has a strong focus on the innovation and technology needed to deliver the significant emissions reduction needed across all modes of transport, putting the UK on a pathway to achieving carbon budgets and net zero emissions across every single mode of transport by 2050.</li>
  <li>The US and the UK face significant transportation challenges including overcrowded urban networks, meeting the needs of changing demographics, constraints in import and export corridors, rising carbon emissions and funding limitations for infrastructure. Facilitating policy discussions and the exchange of knowledge will encourage regulatory cooperation between the UK and US States to ensure we are in a position to meet the challenges facing our respective transport sectors and promote economic prosperity.</li>
  <li>Mobility and low carbon innovation are top foreign policy, and international trade and investment priorities for the UK. The UK also firmly believes that a clean and resilient economic recovery must be at the forefront of the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
  <li>The UK and US have a strong history of close collaboration on transport innovation at both the national level and sub nationally with universities, states, and the private sector. However, in this quickly evolving sector the British Embassy has limited access to tailored data to advance this agenda, particularly at the state level.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="project-objectives-and-parameters">Project Objectives and Parameters</h2>
<ol>
  <li>This report will help inform the UK’s state-level engagement on policy priorities related to the transportation system and support prioritisation of trade and investment opportunities in all transportation sectors. This report will exclude Zero emission vehicles (ZEV) and the infrastructure necessary to support ZEV’s.</li>
  <li>To achieve this objective, the project will deliver detailed analysis of the current and projected transportation policies and their link to economic development and prosperity. Mapping the municipal authorities which are invested in developing these policies including regional transport agencies, academia, utilities, the private sector and public-private partnerships. We hope that this analysis will include at least 20 US states, with the final list of states to be agreed in collaboration with the Project Board that will work with the grant recipient.</li>
  <li>For each state, the report should focus on each mode of the transport system and align with the UK’s transport objectives (support the creation of a stronger, cleaner, more productive economy; help to connect people and places, balancing investment across the country; make journeys easier, modern and reliable and make sure transport is safe, secure and sustainable). The reports for each state will identify current trends, the drivers and opportunities for future growth, the short-term and potential longer term impact of COVID-19 on the state’s transport system, and the policy and investment/export environments.</li>
  <li>Bidders will be responsible for proposing precisely how to achieve the objectives set forth in Section 2. Proposals should include how the bidder will:
    <ul>
      <li>Use existing data sources (and primary data if relevant) to provide information on the current transport system in the state, aligned with UK priorities and definitions where possible. Potential metrics are for the current: A list of ongoing transportation projects; Transport volumes by mode; Transport mix by mode (generation); Transport imports/exports; Transport jobs and the quality of those jobs; Size of the transport-related economy including tax revenues; Data on the Transport-related markets including sales, supporting infrastructure, jobs etc.; Relevant data on green energy transformation within transportation (e.g. converting locomotives from diesel to electric et.al); Identify key companies and stakeholders and the role of ambitious businesses; The importance of transport in the state; Details of current UK involvement in the US’s sub sectoral industries (e.g. Ground Handling, Maintenance and Repair, Port and Airport Services, etc.);  What companies are operating in these industries, The value of this involvement to the US  (also in reverse direction); Insight into areas where the US domestic market is currently unable to meet demand (present opportunity identification) – understanding of the value of these areas to the US and State economy(also in reverse direction).</li>
      <li>Potential metrics are for the projected: Current sources and levels of funding, and anticipated funding needed for ongoing and future projects (including an overview of where the funding will need to come from – public vs. private investment); understand market changes within the State transportation sectors that are driving policy changes, and any current or proposed policy changes that would restrict or liberalise investment. Potential renewable energy capacity; Understand market changes within the State transportation sectors that are driving policy changes; Potential renewable energy capacity; Transport jobs projections; Primary funding sources for transport subsectors and innovation, including the role of venture capital; More detail on the subsectors most relevant to the state (linked to current UK priorities) to better understand future opportunities; Insight in to areas of the US transport sector that are  seeing rising demand, with the potential to outstrip the ability of domestic businesses to provide (future opportunity identification); Insight into projected and current high growth areas of transport in the US and State economy.</li>
      <li>Likely through novel analysis, for example economic modelling, provide projections for future transport developments for each state, including the impact of COVID-19. It is expected that the final reports could include: An assessment of the commitments made by the state to date; Future impact of current incentives to support transport related investment; Likely impact of COVID-19 on the green transport in the short and longer term (focusing on the sectors most relevant to the state); Data on state and/or major city transport transition plans in place or planned; and Major funding sources for transport related businesses.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In addition to the detailed reports for specific states (Section 3), the Project should include a summary report providing an overview of the current state policies/regulation; a narrative summary of the current transportation regulatory environment. As well as an overview of the current and emerging opportunities for transport engagement across the states assessed. The grant recipient will also be expected to present findings and recommendations to the Project Board and broader UK Government stakeholders via video teleconference.</li>
  <li>The grant recipient will be expected to provide interim products to the UK Project Board for its review and guidance. Bidders are encouraged to include a timeline in their proposal that includes regular opportunities for feedback on draft reports and a phased approach to delivery.</li>
  <li>All work must be completed by 5th March, 2021. Bidders should include a realistic timeline in their proposals demonstrating ability to deliver against the Project’s objectives within this timeframe.</li>
