<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is looking at how best to fulfil these requirements in the future by considering our strategy and the capability of the marketplace.</p>

<p>The requirements have not yet been finalised, and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is hosting an industry pre-market engagement event to give potential delivery partners the opportunity to better understand <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s objectives and challenges, and for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to gain insight from the market about potential ways forward.</p>

<h2>About the Department for Work and Pensions</h2>

<p>The Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) is responsible for welfare, pensions and child maintenance policy. As the UK’s biggest public service department, it administers a range of working age, pension age, disability and ill-health benefits to over 20 million claimants and customers.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> priorities include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>running an effective welfare system that enables people to achieve financial independence by providing assistance aimed at supporting them into employment</li>
  <li>creating a fair and affordable welfare system which improves the life chances of citizens</li>
  <li>delivering outstanding services to our customers and claimants</li>
  <li>delivering efficiently: transforming the way we deliver our services to reduce costs and increase efficiency</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> currently provides grant funding to organisations to support people to make and maintain their Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) claim up until their first correct <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> payment. For example, support to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>set up an email address</li>
  <li>work through claimant to-do’s</li>
  <li>access the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> phone service to make a claim</li>
  <li>access <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> home visiting support</li>
  <li>help verify identity</li>
  <li>help provide additional evidence</li>
  <li>help access adaptations such as direct payments to landlords and conditionality easements</li>
  <li>apply for advances and help to access other financial support</li>
  <li>help prepare for first monthly payment</li>
  <li>signpost out to other provision and support</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future strategy</h2>

<p>This event is aimed at how best to fulfil these requirements in the future by considering our strategy and the capability of the marketplace.</p>

<p>The requirements have not yet been finalised, and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is hosting an industry pre-market engagement event to give potential delivery partners the opportunity to better understand <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s objectives and challenges, and for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to gain insight from the market about potential ways forward.</p>

<p>We want to engage with all potential delivery partners (commercial and   not for profit) to establish interest and further understand how the support could be delivered, including an indication of realistic timescales for implementation, transition and training, as well as indicative costs.</p>

<p>Some of the key considerations for delivery may include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the delivery model e.g. single national delivery, lot-based regional delivery, lot-based channel delivery</li>
  <li>the channels for support e.g. telephony, digital, face-to-face</li>
  <li>a grant versus commercial contract</li>
  <li>a 2-year delivery agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>At this stage it is not confirmed if <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> require a single or multiple delivery partners to deliver the different channels for support, however we would welcome and encourage feedback from potential delivery partners regarding partnership working or consortiums and building relationships with other organisations to provide wrap around support where necessary.</p>

<p>The event will be held virtually over MS Teams and hosted by Tech UK on Thursday 19 May at 10am and will last no longer than 90 minutes.</p>

<p>There will be an introduction from the Universal Credit Programme, providing a high-level overview of the requirement. Following the introduction, there will be an opportunity for suppliers to ask any questions.</p>

<p>After the event, suppliers will be invited to complete a questionnaire, providing supporting information on a range of areas that will support <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s strategy. The supplier responses will be reviewed and where appropriate, suppliers may be invited to a 1-2-1 session to explore ideas and discuss further.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>To <a href="https://www.techuk.org/what-we-deliver/events/dwp-universal-credit-help-to-claim-market-engagement-event.html" rel="external">register your interest in attending this event</a>, please book via the Tech UK Event Page by Wednesday 18 May 2022.</p>
</div>

<p>Please note that due to technical capacity constraints suppliers will be limited to a maximum of 2 representatives.</p>

<p>Registration is for this pre-market engagement event only. This is not a Contract Notice or an invitation to tender for a contract opportunity. In the event that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> wishes to progress with any procurement activity, a separate Contract Notice will be advertised on Contracts Finder and Find a Tender (<abbr title="Find a Tender">FTS</abbr>) websites.</p>

<p>Care will be taken not to provide any individual organisation or organisations with a competitive advantage at any stage in the pre-market engagement process.</p>
