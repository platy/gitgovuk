  <li>An event to accelerate partnerships across Industry</li>
  <li>In advance of a new themed competition, Novel Amphibious Craft, launching in October 2022</li>
  <li>Meet subject matter experts in this field</li>
</ul>

<p>The Defence and Security Accelerator (DASA) will host a collaboration event in advance of a new themed competition launch,  Novel Amphibious Craft. This competition launches in October 2022, and will fund promising technologies to help develop a Commando Insertion Craft (CIC) fit to combat the threats of the 21st Century.</p>

<p>To create a platform that can transport personnel and light vehicles across great distances, in challenging conditions, whilst evading detection from coastal sensors is a significant challenge. It demands collaboration between experts in many disciplines, including those outside the defence sector.</p>

<p>This event looks to accelerate partnerships, by bringing together prospective innovators across industry. There will also be an opportunity to connect with subject matter experts from the competition team.</p>

<h2>Why should you attend?</h2>

<p>Attending the collaboration event will allow you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand the requirements of front line operators</li>
  <li>form new collaborative relationships with innovators that have complimentary knowledge</li>
  <li>meet the experts from DASA and the Royal Marines Commando Force</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who should attend?</h2>

<p>There are multiple complex engineering requirements for this competition and we expect that a proportion of the proposals will be collaborative efforts between multiple suppliers. This event targets innovators interested in networking and/or establishing collaborations before submitting a proposal to the competition.</p>

<h2>Register</h2>

<p>Register your interest in attending via this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/novel-amphibious-craft-collaboration-day-tickets-400137611367" rel="external">Eventbrite page</a>. Registration will close at midday on Friday 23 September 2022.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The CIC will be the medium lift craft to deliver Royal Marine Commando teams and their equipment from specialist ships to foreign and hostile coastal access points without being detected.</p>

<p>Royal Marine Commando teams will be expected to operate independently and as part of a larger group, and will complement the force’s network of sensors and command and control capabilities. The craft must be able to travel ranges of 300 nautical miles (threshold) at speeds of no less than 25 knots in sea state 2.</p>

<p>The Novel Amphibious Craft competition is seeking innovative technologies that could help to develop a novel landing craft that can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>travel at sustained high speed over a long range</li>
  <li>provide the ability to deliver personnel and light vehicles to a coastal access point with limited/ no impact on operational speed/capability</li>
  <li>relaunch from the coastal access point</li>
  <li>consider Signature Management across all spectrums to reduce probability of detection (for example thermal, radar, visual, acoustic)</li>
</ul>

<h4>This competition is expected to launch in late October 2022, with funding being provided to proposals that successfully pass DASA’s assessment and moderation panels.</h4>

<h2>Important information</h2>

<ul>
  <li>please note that the event will be an open public event held at OFFICIAL; the appropriateness of discussions should be considered by attendees</li>
  <li>while we encourage collaboration, we wish to stress that it is the sole responsibility of each attendee to consider and manage appropriately any disclosure of their proprietary information to any other attendee or party, given the public nature of the event</li>
  <li>there will be a limited hybrid component to this event via Microsoft Teams</li>
  <li>photographic identification will be required at entry</li>
</ul>

<p>Further event details will be sent upon confirmation of your place to attend.</p>
