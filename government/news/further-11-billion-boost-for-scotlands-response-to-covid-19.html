<p>The UK Government has provided the Scottish Government with an additional £1.1 billion to support people, businesses and public services affected by coronavirus.</p>

<p>This funding brings the total allocated through the Barnett formula to the Scottish Government since the start of the pandemic to £9.7 billion.</p>

<p>In recognition of the exceptional circumstances and in response to calls for flexibility, the Scottish Government will be able to carry over any of the £1.1 billion not spent this year into the 2021/22 financial year on top of their existing tools to transfer funding between years.</p>

<p>Chief Secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From the outset of this crisis people and businesses in Scotland have been able to rely on the UK Government.</p>

  <p>UK Treasury schemes such as furlough, support for the self-employed and business loans have helped to protect jobs and livelihoods.</p>

  <p>The UK Government will continue to offer this support and to give the Scottish Government the resources and flexibility it needs to fulfil its responsibilities to the people of Scotland.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I would urge the Scottish Government to make the full and best use of this funding as well as their devolved powers to support people, businesses and public services.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scottish Secretary, Alister Jack said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This new £1.1 billion funding from the UK Treasury for Scotland’s Covid response is good news and will provide further certainty to the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>This now brings our additional funding to Scotland to £9.7 billion this financial year on top of direct UK Government support to people and businesses in Scotland.</p>

  <p>This includes supporting over 900,000 Scottish jobs through our furlough and self-employed income schemes, backing £3.4 billion in loans to Scottish businesses, helping thousands get back into work and investing millions in the development of and supplying vaccines.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The strength of the union and support offered by the UK Treasury has never been more important.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following the previous update on 24 December, this is expected to be the final update for 2020-21 as part of the process for finalising departmental funding at Supplementary Estimates.</p>

<h2>Further info</h2>

<p>Any changes to devolved funding are normally confirmed towards the end of the financial year at Supplementary Estimates – but in July 2020 the UK Government introduced an unprecedented upfront guarantee to provide the devolved administrations with funding certainty to respond to COVID-19 this year. A full explanation of the Barnett guarantee can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/barnett-consequentials-and-the-barnett-guarantee/barnett-consequentials-and-the-barnett-guarantee">here</a>.</p>

<p>The agreed arrangements the devolved administrations have to move funding between years is set out in Chapter 10 of the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/943689/Statement_of_Funding_Policy_2020.pdf" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Statement of Funding Policy</a>.</p>
