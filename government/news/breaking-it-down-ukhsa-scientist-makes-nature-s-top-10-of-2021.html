          <p>Chosen by Nature’s editors, <a rel="external" href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-021-03621-0/index.html">the top 10</a> explores key developments in science and recognises individuals who, along with their colleagues, helped to make amazing discoveries and bring attention to crucial issues.</p>

<p>Meaghan has been recognised for helping to disseminate crucial information about coronavirus (COVID-19) by breaking down the agency’s scientific reports into easy-to-understand social media posts. After spending her first 10 years at Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) tracking <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>, Meaghan was drafted into the COVID-19 response in 2020.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, formerly <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) has brought together the UK’s unparalleled expertise across genomics, epidemiology and virology to monitor and better understand SARS-CoV-2 variants. By regularly publishing detailed technical briefings, the latest data and understanding of the virus is made freely available to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Scientific data is complex by nature, and it was Meaghan’s ability to distil and present the cutting-edge findings into accessible content on Twitter that has secured her place on the top 10 list, alongside the scientist who placed a rover on Mars, and a former UN special rapporteur credited with protecting the rights of indigenous communities across the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking as the list was published, Meaghan said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m very humbled to be included and it’s a huge honour to be recognised. Behind the many reports we publish is a large team of scientists working at pace around the clock. Back in January I was inspired to showcase our collective work, to breakdown the findings for an unscientific audience and it quickly became clear that people valued the insight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>My day job is still very much focused on understanding how coronavirus behaves and to provide the scientific basis on which public health decisions are made, to find a way through this unprecedented challenge and to protect as many lives as possible.</p>

  <p class="last-child">In my spare time, I’ll continue to help people understand the science and make informed decisions. The best advice I can give now is to go out and get the vaccine, whether that’s a first, second or booster shot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor at <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I’m incredibly proud that Meaghan’s commitment to communicate the science is being celebrated in this way. I know that all the scientists and researchers working at <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> during the pandemic are delighted at this recognition. Shining a light on their work, her posts have been both a great source of information and reassurance for members of the public and the media.</p>
