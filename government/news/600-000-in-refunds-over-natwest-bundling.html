  <li>NatWest issued with legal directions by the CMA after it broke banking rules</li>
  <li>Over 700 small and medium-sized businesses to receive refunds</li>
  <li>Senior Director: “Forcing businesses to open costly current accounts to secure essential loans is unacceptable”</li>
</ul>

<p>The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has found that NatWest breached CMA banking rules by forcing business customers to open a business current account, which incurs fees, in order to secure a loan – a practice known as ‘bundling’.</p>

<p>As such, hundreds of businesses have been charged monthly for a business account that they may not have wanted or needed. It also limited businesses’ choice as they were unable to hold an account with a separate provider, which may have better met their requirements.</p>

<p>The breach lasted for over 3 years, with NatWest failing to alert the CMA until January 2021. Having scrutinised the error more closely, the CMA became aware the bank had signed certain customers up to a business account, when they had specifically requested to have a fee-free account.</p>

<p>Adam Land, CMA Senior Director of Remedies, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Forcing businesses to open costly current accounts to secure essential loans is unacceptable – and a direct breach of our rules, which have been in place for 20 years. NatWest should have known better. These rules are there for a reason: to make sure small businesses are treated fairly, and to make sure the market is competitive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The CMA has now issued legal directions to NatWest, and the bank is in the process of refunding affected customers. NatWest will now write to all affected SME customers with a business account to offer them the option of switching to a fee-free loan servicing account.</p>

<p>The move comes as part of the CMA’s crackdown on breaches of its banking rules. Over the past 4 years, it has put a stop to bundling by <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sme-banking-2002-behavioural-undertakings-directions-to-hsbc">HSBC</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cma-letter-to-danske-bank-on-a-second-breach-of-the-sme-banking-undertakings">Danske Bank</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-stops-clydesdale-bundling-business-accounts-with-loans">Clydesdale Bank</a>, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-stops-lloyds-bundling-business-accounts-with-loans">Lloyds</a>, as well as securing millions in refunds in relation to overdraft charges: £17 million for Santander customers, £11 million for Metro Bank customers, £8 million for HSBC customers, and £7 million for Nationwide customers.</p>
