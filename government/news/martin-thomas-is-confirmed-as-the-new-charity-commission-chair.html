<p>Martin Thomas appeared before MPs on the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee for pre-appointment scrutiny on 9th December 2021, who have now confirmed the appointment.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/work/1638/preappointment-hearing-for-chair-of-the-charity-commission/publications/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">report published today</a>, MPs commented that Mr Thomas will bring ‘considerable experience in, and knowledge of, the charity sector’ as that he had a ‘sound awareness of the challenges facing the sector and the regulator’s role vis-à-vis its wide range of stakeholders’.</p>

<p>Martin has been appointed from 27th December 2021 - 26th December 2024.</p>

<p>Martin Thomas has over 20 years’ experience in the insurance and financial services sectors including roles at the Bank of England, the European Commission and the European Central Bank.  Martin currently holds a number of charitable roles (which he will step down from) and is the Chair of NHS Resolution.</p>

<p>Secretary of State, Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Nadine Dorries said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I would like to offer a very warm welcome to Martin Thomas, who brings both a broad range of regulatory and charity sector experience to the role of Charity Commission Chair.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I look forward to working with Martin as he takes on this important post, ensuring public confidence in our charities is maintained. I would also like to thank and pay tribute to Ian Karet for all his hard work as interim chair.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Martin Thomas said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The Charity Commission is seen as independent, precise, clear, consistent, calm and just. It has true authority and expertise in the areas where it operates. I am very honoured and very proud to have a chance to help it hold fast to these attributes as it enters the next chapter of its history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under the terms of the legislation, the appointment is made by the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>Ministers were assisted in their decision-making by an Advisory Assessment Panel which included a departmental official and a senior independent panel member approved by the Commissioner for Public Appointments.</p>

<p>ENDS</p>
