    <p>Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced today (3 December) that he has nominated Professor David Miles for appointment to the OBR’s Budget Responsibility Committe</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subject to approval by the Treasury Committee, Professor Miles will start in the role on 1st January 2022</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Chancellor has nominated Professor David Miles for appointment to the Budget Responsibility Committee (BRC) of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).</p>

<p>The OBR is the UK’s official independent fiscal watchdog who are responsible for examining and reporting on the sustainability of the public finances. The BRC has executive responsibility for the core functions of the OBR and is responsible for judgements reached in OBR economic and fiscal forecasts.</p>

<p>The new BRC vacancy arises because Professor Sir Charles Bean is due to step down from office at the end of the year following the end of his 5-year term.</p>

<h4>Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak said:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am delighted to nominate Professor David Miles for appointment to the OBR’s Budget Responsibility Committee – a role that is a vital part of our commitment to strong public finances as we rebuild from the pandemic</p>

  <p>A highly respected economist, Professor Miles brings a variety of academic and professional expertise which will only strengthen the existing independent and authoritative analysis of the OBR.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Professor Sir Charles Bean for his exceptional service to HM Government during his time at the OBR. I would like to extend my gratitude for his work and wish him all the best for his future.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Professor Sir David Miles said:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I am very pleased that the Chancellor has nominated me to join the Budget Responsibility Committee. The work of the Committee is of great importance as the UK faces exceptional challenges after the coronavirus outbreak. Sir Charles Bean has contributed greatly to the work of the Committee. It would be an honour to replace him should the Treasury Committee wish me to do so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Treasury Committee will conduct a hearing with Professor Miles in the coming weeks. Subject to their confirmation, he will take up his new role for a 5-year term starting on 1 January 2022.</p>
