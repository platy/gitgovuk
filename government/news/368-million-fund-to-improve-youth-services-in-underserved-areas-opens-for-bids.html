  <li>Scheme is part of government commitment to ensure young people given access to more activities, trips away from home and volunteering opportunities</li>
  <li>Announcement follows 418&nbsp;youth&nbsp;projects benefiting from £12 million of cash fast-tracked to those in need earlier this year</li>
</ul>

<p>Youth&nbsp;services in the country’s most underserved areas are being encouraged to apply for a slice of a £368 million fund to improve the health, wellbeing, skills and opportunities for young people.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;Youth&nbsp;Investment&nbsp;Fund, designed to create, improve and expand local&nbsp;youth&nbsp;facilities and services, today opens for bids from 45 local authorities and more than 600 district wards in some of the most deprived areas in England. It will provide funding to build or refurbish up to 300&nbsp;youth&nbsp;facilities over the next 3 years, providing safe spaces in which young people can socialise and participate in a wide range of activities, including those designed to help support them into employment.</p>

<p>The funding forms part of the Government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fnews%2Fgovernment-outlines-ambitious-plans-to-level-up-activities-for-young-people&amp;data=05%7C01%7CGSale%40no10.gov.uk%7Ca39870a8f4064e1c4fb008da722a3024%7C29c8cbb9d9af4c7eb28b470f15275e47%7C1%7C0%7C637947822763216986%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=oKvKBqfXWWgdGqAq1DLa%2B5qaxslslpvSGdrE%2B3%2FXJQI%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="external">‘National&nbsp;Youth&nbsp;Guarantee’</a> to ensure every young person right across England will have access to regular out of school activities, adventures away from home and opportunities to volunteer backed by a £560 million&nbsp;investment. These opportunities will help them develop the skills they need for life and work, improving their wellbeing and employability.</p>

<p>The guarantee also includes offering The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award to every state secondary school for the first time, as well as increased access to social action projects or the opportunity to meet new people and learn life and work skills like money management or public speaking skills through the National Citizen Service.</p>

<p>Minister for Civil Society and&nbsp;Youth&nbsp;Nigel Huddleston said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are committed to ensuring that no young person is left out of reach or left behind, and have put it at the heart of our drive to level up this country.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I encourage eligible&nbsp;youth&nbsp;services to apply for this life-changing funding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nick Temple, CEO, Social&nbsp;Investment&nbsp;Business said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All young people deserve access to high-quality&nbsp;youth&nbsp;services and great&nbsp;youth&nbsp;facilities to thrive in life, but&nbsp;youth&nbsp;provision across the country is sadly unequal. That’s why we’re proud to be able to apply our 20+ years’ knowledge and experience of grant programmes and capital projects to design, manage and deliver the&nbsp;Youth&nbsp;Investment&nbsp;Fund.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Working alongside our partners National&nbsp;Youth&nbsp;Agency, Key Fund and Resonance, we’ll enable up to 300&nbsp;youth&nbsp;facilities to be built or refurbished over the next three years. This is a wonderful opportunity to prioritise the needs of young people in England and create a more equal society for future generations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Earlier this year £12 million from the fund was fast-tracked to local&nbsp;youth&nbsp;services where supply was short of meeting demand. The aim was to cover small-scale capital improvements such as providing new laptops to&nbsp;youth&nbsp;groups, small redevelopments of buildings and facilities, and improving transport, such as providing a new minibus for a&nbsp;youth&nbsp;club so they can keep young people safe and extend activities beyond their local area.</p>

<p>BBC Children In Need was the grant administrator for the first phase of the&nbsp;Youth&nbsp;Investment&nbsp;Fund and distributed funding to some 418 eligible&nbsp;youth&nbsp;projects in the most in-demand areas which included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunitycourtyard.org%2F&amp;data=05%7C01%7CGSale%40no10.gov.uk%7Ca39870a8f4064e1c4fb008da722a3024%7C29c8cbb9d9af4c7eb28b470f15275e47%7C1%7C0%7C637947822763216986%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=7MoNV4ujwILXLA%2BQmZbY49mqlSXvyHRf%2FZ2hIXyMcvo%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="external">The Community Court Yard</a> in Northampton, a social enterprise delivering traditional&nbsp;youth&nbsp;work, bespoke alternative education and creative workshops based on the&nbsp;youth&nbsp;work curriculum. It was awarded a grant of more than £44,740 to fund a vehicle for detached&nbsp;youth&nbsp;work, gaming booth equipment, CCTV and the refit of the gym area. It will help build positive behaviours and communication skills for disadvantaged young people.</li>
  <li>IMO (Inspire, Motivate, Overcome) Charity in Blackburn and Darwen, which aims to help local young people and their families to combat disadvantage and overcome challenges they face. The grant of £32,155, has funded equipment and furnishings for a new&nbsp;Youth&nbsp;Hub which will provide programmes, activities and a safe environment for young people who struggle at school with their mental health and who are in poverty.</li>
  <li>Brunswick&nbsp;Youth&nbsp;and Community Centre in Bootle, which provides a wide range of activities for young people, received £10,325 of funding to update a community garden space for the&nbsp;youth&nbsp;community centre. It will help promote wellbeing and healthy eating programmes for young people facing mental health challenges and/or at risk of exposure to gang culture.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Leigh Middleton, CEO, National&nbsp;Youth&nbsp;Agency said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>High quality, universal&nbsp;youth&nbsp;provision supports all young people to have somewhere safe to go, to socialise and learn new skills, with a trusted adult who is skilled and trained to support them.</p>

  <p>We are delighted to be partnering with Social&nbsp;Investment&nbsp;Business on the design and delivery of the&nbsp;Youth&nbsp;Investment&nbsp;Fund. This provides much needed&nbsp;investment&nbsp;for&nbsp;youth&nbsp;centres and dedicated spaces for young people to go in their communities, as part of the government’s National&nbsp;Youth&nbsp;Guarantee.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Working with SIB,&nbsp;youth&nbsp;sector partners and young people directly, our shared aim is to ensure the funding enables high quality&nbsp;youth&nbsp;work which will have the best outcomes for young people, and for communities to thrive.</p>

  <li>The National Youth Guarantee is targeted at all 11-18 year olds, and up to 25 years old for those with special educational needs and disabilities</li>
  <li>Youth&nbsp;services are a vital part of the response to these challenges, delivering benefits for wellbeing and employability skills.</li>
