<p>Applications are officially open for the Future Females Business School, an initiative offered by the British Government in Brazil through the International Tech Hub Network. The programme will support 50 Brazilian female founders of tech-based enterprises to start, grow, scale, and become more sustainable, promoting positive social, economic or environmental impact.</p>

<p>The Future Females Business School Programme is a three month virtual programme, equipping local female entrepreneurs with the entrepreneurial skills and best practices needed to start and grow successful and sustainable businesses, that utilise technology to not only generate wealth for themselves, but to have a positive impact in their community, and environment.</p>

<p>Women are underrepresented in the Brazilian technology and innovation ecosystems. According to the Brazilian Association of Startups, only 15% of Brazilian startups have female founders, and these companies receive less than 3% of all VC funds. Also only 3% of Brazilian SMEs reach international markets, according to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, which excludes the vast majority of Brazilian entrepreneurs from the benefits of increased productivity, competitiveness, and revenue. The Future Females programme will help Brazilian women to change these numbers, connecting entrepreneurs to a supporting global network of successful business owners, mentors, investors and experts.</p>

<p>Future Females has previously partnered with the UK-South Africa Tech Hub in 2018, supporting 200+ female entrepreneurs to date, with participants seeing 88% increase in digital skills development, 95% uplift in confidence, and on average a 168% revenue increase in their businesses. In 2020, Future Females also ran pilot programmes in partnership with UK-Kenya Tech Hub and UK-Nigeria Tech Hub.</p>

<p>“We are very excited to expand our Future Females Business School into Brazil, in partnership with UK-Brazil Tech Hub - to allow women from all over the country to gain confidence, practical digital skills, and access the mentoring and community support needed to bring their dream business to life.  The entrepreneurs who participate in our programmes are not just building businesses - they’re creating innovative solutions to real problems we’re facing in this ‘new’ world, and act as a source of hope for their communities - and we can’t wait to meet them!” – Lauren Dallas, Co-Founder &amp; CEO of Future Females.</p>

<p>“Diversity drives innovation as it is ‘sine qua non’ to creating solutions that address problems from multiple perspectives. Including more women as leaders of change in technology is paramount to fostering innovative solutions to Brazil’s most urgent challenges, from those we are facing as a result of the COVID-19 crisis to climate change, poverty and inequality. Enabling women to transform great ideas into positive social, economic and environmental impact through digital technology is key to lead a profound country transformation into prosperity in Brazil. We are very happy to partner with Future Females to empower Brazilian women to become enablers of change in the local and global digital economy” – Andrea Motta, Director of the UK Brazil Tech Hub.</p>

<p>“I’m delighted with this new partnership between the UK Government and the Future Females Business School, an impressive programme with huge global reach. The partnership reinforces our commitment to work together to tackle gender inequality, promote digital inclusion, create jobs and foster a vibrant digital economy capable of building back better from COVID-19” –  Liz Davidson, Chargé d’Affairs of the British Government in Brazil.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Applications are open until 22 February 2021, with only 50 places available in the three-month pilot programme commencing on 8 March 2021.</p>
