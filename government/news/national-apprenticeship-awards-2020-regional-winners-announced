<p>The National Apprenticeship Awards 2020 regional finals commenced this week with virtual ceremonies taking place up and down the country.</p>

<p>The awards kicked off on Monday 2 November, with events to recognise apprentice employers, apprentices, Rising Stars and Champions at ceremonies taking place across England, to celebrate apprenticeships and the benefits they bring to individuals, businesses and local communities.</p>

<p>Back for their 17th year, the National Apprenticeship Awards are a fantastic opportunity to highlight business and individual success in apprenticeships. Particularly poignant this year, given the challenges many employers and apprentices have faced during the pandemic. Each online ceremony will recognise apprentices that have gone above and beyond to make a difference whilst undertaking their apprenticeship.</p>

<p>Apprentice employers, apprentices and apprenticeship champions from all industries entered the awards – with over 1,100 entries received.</p>

<p>Gillian Keegan, Apprenticeships and Skills Minister said:</p>

<p>“Huge congratulations to all of the regional winners. The National Apprenticeship Awards are a fantastic opportunity to showcase the range of exciting apprenticeships available across so many industries including digital, health, construction and the public sector.</p>

<p>“Apprenticeships are a great way of attracting new talent, helping to make sure employers of all sizes have access to the skills they need to grow. They will play a vital role rebuilding our economy after the pandemic, transforming businesses and revitalising local communities.</p>

<p>“I wish all the winners the best of luck for the final virtual award ceremony in November.”</p>

<p>Apprenticeships are a cornerstone of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/rishis-plan-for-jobs-will-help-britain-bounce-back" class="govuk-link">Chancellor’s Plan for Jobs</a> to help the UK’s recovery from the pandemic. Through the Plan for Jobs a total of £1.6 billion will be invested in scaling up employment support schemes, training and apprenticeships to help people looking for a job.</p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <a rel="external" href="https://engage.apprenticeships.gov.uk/incentives?utm_source=awards&utm_medium=PR&utm_campaign=incentives-emp" class="govuk-link">Incentive Payment for Hiring a New Apprentice</a>, where businesses will be given £2,000 for each new apprentice they hire under the age of 25, and £1,500 for each apprentice aged 25 and over.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A £111 million investment to triple the scale of traineeships in 2020-21 ensuring more young people have access to high quality training.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Peter Mucklow, director, Education and Skills Funding Agency added:</p>

<p>“Apprentices and apprentice employers are really flying the flag for apprenticeships at this time. We have recently announced the Top 100 Apprenticeship Employers and I am now delighted to recognise the winners of the National Apprenticeship Awards in our English regions.</p>

<p>“Today marks the start of a week-long celebration of awards winners, with apprentices at all levels, and employers from a wide range of sectors and industries, all being recognised for their commitment to skills, through apprenticeships.</p>

<p>“Employers and apprentices alike continue to commit to apprenticeships for the many benefits they bring, and I admire that commitment, especially through the difficult period 2020 has brought. I offer a huge congratulations, not only to the winners and highly commended, but to all entrants to these awards.”</p>
