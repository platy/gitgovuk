<p>A man who fled to Dubai after he was found guilty of an immigration advice scam has been imprisoned on his return to the UK.</p>

<p>Babbar Ali Jamal, a director at DDR Legal Services LLP, was one of three people found guilty of providing unqualified immigration advice and/or services at the Old Bailey in April 2020 following a two-year investigation by the OISC which revealed fees in excess of £2.5m was generated .</p>

<p>Two of the defendants were sentenced last year at the Old Bailey 
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/unregulated-immigration-advice-earns-directors-17000-fine">Unregulated immigration advice earns Directors £17,000 fine - GOV.UK</a> but Mr Jamal left the country even though he was bailed to attend court and in his absence was given a £10,000 fine.</p>

<p>In June 2022, having returned to the UK from Dubai, he gave himself up to the authorities.</p>

<p>At the original sentencing in January 2021, Judge Munro QC said:</p>

<p>“The consequential loss and the impact on the complainants is far-reaching and in some cases devastating.”</p>

<p>One victim had to leave the UK permanently; another paid £7000 in expenses to contest a failed application; others had to travel to Shanghai or Bangkok to submit applications which were bound to be rejected; and a couple who travelled for work were unable to leave the UK for two years while their documentation was sorted out.</p>

<p>Mr Jamal was last week sentenced at the Old Bailey to 20 weeks imprisonment and ordered to pay £500 prosecution costs for failing to surrender to bail. Judge Munro QC concluded that by absconding Mr Jamal had caused substantial interference with the administration of justice. He enjoyed a good quality of life with his family in Dubai while making no attempt to make payments towards the £10,000 fine imposed.</p>

<p>John Tuckett, Immigration Services Commissioner said: “Mr Jamal showed a total defiance of the law. This has been reflected in the sentence, and I hope this serves as a reminder to those who might otherwise choose this path.”</p>

<p>Burlow and Spencer Ltd subsequently ceased trading in 2019.</p>
