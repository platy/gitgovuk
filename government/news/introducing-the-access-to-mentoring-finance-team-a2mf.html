<p>Alan said</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I am delighted we have been able to create the Access to Mentoring &amp; Finance team, which really understands the challenges of running a business. Their wide-ranging experience means we can support a broad spectrum of companies and their staff. Even though we are a relatively new team, it’s a pleasure to see the positive impact they have already had.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Investor Showcase</h3>
<p>Each year the A2MF team bring together a cohort of top innovators to pitch their businesses and novel technological ideas at DASA’s Annual Investor Showcase. The businesses receive dedicated training and support to develop a compelling pitch deck tailored to the investor audience.</p>

<h2>Working with the A2MF team</h2>
<p>DASA’s Access to Mentoring and Finance services are already helping innovators across the UK develop their businesses. Here’s some feedback from organisations who have already received support:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The range of different funding mechanisms is really making us think much longer term about how we fund, what we fund and working with DASA to make things happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Your support has been confidence building. It will help us review our approach in terms of how we best position ourselves strategically</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Thank you for helping us think differently about our value proposition. Both for defence and beyond, we’ll use this methodology as standard in our business</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">It is quite extraordinary, and rare, to have this level of support, and in a process that is fraught with pitfalls and challenges, it is refreshing to have a team working with us and investing so much effort on our behalf. We appreciate it immensely.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Get involved with DASA</h2>
<p>We are looking forward to helping even more innovators commercialise their novel ideas. if you have a mature solution for a defence or security challenge and are looking for additional business support, contact the team today: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:A2MF@dasa.service.mod.uk">A2MF@dasa.service.mod.uk</a></p>
