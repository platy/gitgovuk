<p>Strengthening links between the specialist force and the West Cumbrian college, students working towards a level-three diploma in policing, were invited to spend time at the world-class Griffin Park tactical training centre, just outside the Sellafield site.</p>

<p>While at Griffin Park, which has the biggest 360-degree live fire range in Europe, students learned about life within CNC and the FTU from officers and staff who carry out this unique work, and were taught how the Dog Training Unit can be utilised to protect both nuclear facilities and the public.</p>

<p>This was the first cohort of students given a four-day placement, and Chief Inspector Marcus Robson, Griffin Park’s Unit Commander, said: “It’s vital CNC plays a role in shaping the future of policing; and it’s also really rewarding for us to play a role in the education of local students.</p>

<p>“While at Griffin Park, the students were given first-hand experience of the FTU and dog unit. They also had an opportunity to learn about life within CNC, and the incredible work we do from our experienced staff, who proudly defend the UK’s nuclear sites as well as the public.</p>

<p>“Through these links with Lakes College, our aim is to bolster the wider recruitment drive, and it was great to see the students enjoy their time with us.”</p>

<p>There are plans to host more students throughout the academic year at Griffin Park, which cost £42.5m when it opened its doors in 2020, and most recently hosted soldiers from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cnc-host-visit-from-us-army-facility">USA’s Nuclear Disablement Team</a>.</p>

<p>Kayleigh Smith, lead work placement officer for Lakes College, added: “With many of our policing students being interested in a career with CNC at Sellafield, this is a great opportunity to see what their future career could entail.</p>

<p>“We are also working closely with CNC to look at the delivery of our curriculum, as well as having employer-engagement sessions with our students around the recruitment process.</p>

<p>“We are very grateful for the work CNC has put into this to make our students’ work placement an unforgettable experience.”</p>
