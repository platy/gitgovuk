<h3>Contest’s sponsors</h3>

<p>The “Ambassador for a Day Competition 2022: Freedom and Democracy“ is a joint initiative by the Embassies of Canada, United Kingdom and United States to the Czech Republic.</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>

<p>The theme of this year’s competition is freedom and democracy. Currently, the importance of our shared values of freedom and democracy are top of the international news agenda. Two years of restrictions in response to COVID have also impacted some people’s attitudes to what freedom and democracy mean. In international relations and conflict resolution, women’s voices are often absent or sidelined, yet research shows they can make a difference to how issues are approached and managed, and the resilience of responses.</p>

<h3>How to participate</h3>

<p>Submit an essay of 500-700 words in English that responds to the following questions:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Why more women’s voices need to be heard in international affairs, conflict resolution, and policymaking more generally;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Why women’s engagement and participation in decision-making processes is important;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What difference women’s voices can make in this field;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What freedom and democracy mean to you in the Czech Republic in 2022.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<ul>

    <p>Your essay should be submitted <a class="govuk-link" href="https://forms.gle/WL5ERBFrWzyDcoNu8" rel="external">via this form</a> or via <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ukinczechrepublic@fco.gov.uk">ukinczechrepublic@fco.gov.uk</a>.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Contest is open to females, aged 16-25, who are resident in the Czech Republic and are able to communicate in both English and Czech.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Platforms</h3>

<p>The information about the essay Contest, including the selection process, announcement of the winner, as well as activities engaging the winners will be communicated on social media platforms of all the sponsors, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube.</p>

<p>Communication between the sponsors and participants will take place via email or phone. Announcement of the competition winners will be communicated on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube, however, none of these platforms are partners or sponsors of the Contest.</p>

<h3>Submissions of essays – format</h3>

<p>Please, submit your essays in doc, docx, or pdf format. Each submission should include the name of the contestant.</p>

<h3>Content</h3>

<p>Submissions must be original pieces, must not include text protected by intellectual property rights or third party’s ownership rights.</p>

<h3>Eligibility</h3>

<p>The Contest is open to females aged 16 to 25 who are residents of the Czech Republic and are able to communicate in both English and Czech.</p>

<p>Only the person who submits the essay will be considered as the Contest participant. To participate in the Contest, the participant must submit all the requested information, which will be strictly used only for the purpose of the Contest and will not be shared with third parties.</p>

<p>The Contest is not open to employees and interns of any of the sponsors, nor it is open to family members of such employees and interns.</p>

<p>After submission of the essay, the Contest participants may be publicly identified.</p>

<h3>Selection of winners</h3>

<p>The sponsors reserve the right to discount all entries to the Contest that do not fulfill the requirements of the competition.</p>

<p>The winners will be selected by representatives of all three Embassies. Each Embassy will choose one winner (three in total).</p>

<h3>Winners</h3>

<p>Each participating embassy will choose a winning essay whose author will win the opportunity to work shadow the American, British or Canadian Ambassador (or Chargé) for the day to experience first hand a “day at the office” of a senior diplomat. Winners will be announced on 25th April 2022. Our aim is to inspire young women to think about what freedom and democracy means to them, and how women can contribute to international affairs. The winners will gain insight into the work of our Embassies on the issues, and perhaps inspire young women to consider a career in diplomacy.</p>

<p>Although the competition will launch on International Women’s Day (8 March), the actual work shadowing day will take place later in the summer months, when the COVID-19 situation allows and through mutual agreement with the winners. It will cover a day’s worth of meetings and activities on the subject of freedom, democracy and foreign affairs.</p>

<p>The winners will also have the opportunity to work on our respective Embassies’ social media feeds for a day to share their experiences.</p>

<h3>Awards</h3>

<p>Each of the three winners may expect:
* To spend a day at the Embassy with Embassy staff, shadowing the Ambassador and/or other Embassy representatives. 
* Program of meetings with stakeholders, selected and planned by the Embassy
* Social media take-over for a day
* Small gifts from the Sponsors</p>

<p>The sponsors reserve the right to make the winning essay available online on either Embassy website and/or on social media.</p>

<p>The winners must respond to Embassy’s email within a week. If the winner does not accept the selection, the sponsors reserve the right to reach out to the runner-up.</p>

<p>The fulfilment of the awards cannot be passed on a third person, cannot be exchanged for a different activity, and cannot be reimbursed in monetary value.</p>
