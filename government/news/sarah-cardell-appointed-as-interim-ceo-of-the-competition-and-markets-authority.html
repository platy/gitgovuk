<p>Sarah Cardell has been appointed as the interim Chief Executive of the Competition and Markets Authority (<abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>) by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng today (Friday 17 June).</p>

<p>Sarah Cardell is currently the General Counsel of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> and will take over on an interim basis from current <abbr title="chief executive officer">CEO</abbr> Andrea Coscelli when he leaves at the end of his term in office in July.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> is a non-ministerial department responsible for enforcing competition and consumer law and carrying out investigations into mergers and markets. It has recently taken on new functions including the Office for the Internal Market (<abbr title="Office for the Internal Market">OIM</abbr>).</p>

<p>The Chief Executive provides visible and dynamic leadership to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> and its 900 staff across the UK and is an advocate for competition and consumers setting a clear brand and vision for the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> across the UK and globally.</p>

<p>Today, the government also launches the recruitment process for a new permanent <abbr title="chief executive officer">CEO</abbr>.</p>

<p>Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sarah’s experience and expertise provides a strong foundation for the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> at a time when their work to help people make the most of their money is critically important to consumers across the country.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I thank Andrea for his achievements at the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>. These include securing hundreds of millions of pounds for consumers following cancelled events and holidays during the pandemic, helping patients and the NHS by tackling unfair price increases for lifesaving medicines, and establishing the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> as a global leader in the regulation of digital markets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sarah Cardell was appointed as General Counsel at the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> in September 2013. She heads the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>’s Legal Service and Policy and International Directorates which provide legal and policy advice across the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>’s functions. She also has executive leadership responsibility for the establishment of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>’s Digital Markets Unit. Sarah is a member of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>’s senior executive team and is the legal advisor to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>’s Board.</p>

<p>Sarah Cardell said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m delighted to have been appointed Interim <abbr title="chief executive officer">CEO</abbr> of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>. The work of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> to promote competition has never been more important, ensuring that prices remain as low as possible and supporting growth and innovation in our economy. &nbsp;</p>

  <p class="last-child">Under Andrea’s leadership the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> has become a world-leading competition authority, bringing real benefits to consumers and businesses across the UK.&nbsp;I’m committed to continue that progress, working with our dedicated and talented teams across the UK as we take on important new responsibilities and tackle a range of issues from ensuring effective competition in digital markets to mitigating the impact of rising cost of living pressures.</p>
