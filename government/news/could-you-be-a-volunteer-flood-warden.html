<p>The Environment Agency and the Kent Resilience Forum are looking for people to become volunteer flood wardens in Kent.</p>

<p>Kent has experienced repeated flood incidents both historically and recently. Around 71,000 properties in the county are at risk of flooding. Flood wardens can help people prepare for flood events in those areas identified as most at risk.</p>

<p>As a flood warden you would have a key role in helping to develop a <a rel="external" href="https://www.kentprepared.org.uk/help-your-community" class="govuk-link">Community Flood Plan*</a> for your area. You would play a crucial part in putting that plan into action in the event of flooding.</p>

<p>During and after a flood, when emergency services and local authorities are helping those most in need, flood wardens become a vital link between those responding and their community.</p>

<p>Jenny Newham, Environment Agency Flood Resilience Advisor, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can help your local community prepare for flooding by volunteering as a flood warden. We will provide you with training, a comprehensive handbook and resources to carry out the role.</p>

  <p class="last-child">You’ll also have great support from colleagues when you join our volunteer team of flood wardens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Carl Lewis, volunteer flood warden, Tonbridge, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">You can see the difference we make to people, knowing they can rely on you when they’re in distress, knowing you’re there to help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Steve Sculley, Senior Emergency Planner, Kent Resilience Forum, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Flooding in Kent is the major risk that we plan for. Its effects can devastate lives and communities.</p>

  <p class="last-child">If you feel you can help as a flood warden, please sign up for one of our free virtual training sessions that take 2 hours to complete.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Free virtual training sessions on Wednesday 6 October and Tuesday 9 November, 7pm to 9pm.</p>

<p>Training is free of charge and will delivered on Zoom. It is accessible on smartphone, tablet or computer. Full guidance will be provided.</p>

<h3>Notes to editors</h3>
<p>Around 71,000 properties in Kent are at risk of flooding.
Flood wardens are needed across Kent – particularly in Maidstone, Tonbridge and Folkestone.
Flood wardens are also needed in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Canterbury</li>
  <li>Dartford</li>
  <li>Deal</li>
  <li>Dymchurch</li>
  <li>East Malling and Larkfield</li>
  <li>Faversham</li>
  <li>Gravesend</li>
  <li>Herne Bay</li>
  <li>Hythe</li>
  <li>Medway Towns</li>
  <li>Minster-on-sea</li>
  <li>Paddock Wood</li>
  <li>Sheerness</li>
  <li>Sittingbourne</li>
  <li>St Mary in the Marsh</li>
  <li>Whitstable</li>
</ul>

<h4>Community flood plan</h4>
<p>Flood wardens are involved in writing a community plan. They help to implement it during a flood. It can help to save lives and minimise the damage and distress that flooding can cause.</p>

<p>A community flood plan sets out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the locations at risk of flooding in the community</li>
  <li>actions to be taken before, during and after a flood</li>
  <li>contact details of volunteers/flood wardens and the cascade of information during a flood</li>
  <li>what the local triggers are that will activate the plan</li>
  <li>important telephone numbers</li>
  <li>available resources</li>
  <li>arrangements with the authorities</li>
  <li>vulnerable residents/properties</li>
</ul>

<h4>Flood warden recruitment</h4>
<p>Last winter the Environment Agency and Kent Resilience Forum were able to train more than 200 wardens for the county. However, there is always a need for more people to volunteer and train as flood wardens, and to help make our communities more resilient to flood events.</p>

<h4>Be prepared for flooding</h4>
<p>Members of the public can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-flood-risk">check their flood risk, sign up for free flood warnings and keep up to date</a> and follow @EnvAgency on Twitter for the latest flood updates.</p>
