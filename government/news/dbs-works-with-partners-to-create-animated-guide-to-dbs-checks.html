<p>The Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) has recently worked with a number of organisations to create an animated ‘guide to DBS checks’ video, and accompanying leaflet.</p>

<p>The video and leaflet, which can be found below, look at a number of different subjects, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the different types of DBS check, and how to apply</li>
  <li>what type of information may be included on DBS certificate</li>
  <li>what countries DBS covers</li>
  <li>the DBS Barred Lists</li>
</ul>

<p>Feedback from customers and partners showed that various parts of the DBS checking process can be confusing, so we worked alongside <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.princes-trust.org.uk" rel="external">The Prince’s Trust</a>, and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions">Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)</a> to understand which sections of the process they wanted us to focus on, to maximise understanding of the work we do within DBS.</p>

<p>Cathy Taylor, Regional Outreach Manager at DBS, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">By working with The Prince’s Trust and the DWP, and finding out what they need from us, we were able to produce a resource which will not only benefit the individuals they work with, but the general public too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cathy continued:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The work of the Partnerships team at DBS focuses on that collaborative working with partner organisations, and we really value the feedback we’re given, as it allows us to continually review how we provide information to those that use DBS services and products.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1059974/Quick_Guide_to_DBS_Checks.pdf">A guide to DBS checks</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">2.95 MB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">5 pages</span>)</span></p>

<p>Jonathan Townshend, Chief Executive of Prince’s Trust UK, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The Prince’s Trust is pleased to have worked with DBS to develop the training information and animated guide to assist organisations and individuals in using DBS processes to create safe environments for children and young people. As an organisation supporting young people to achieve their potential, we recognise the importance of working with other organisations to deliver safe and effective programmes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Martin Snooks, of the National Employer and Partnership team at the DWP, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">DWP and DBS have been working collaboratively on this project for the past year. It arose out of an identified need to let our customers have a product that they could refer to, that was in plain English and a simple format. Following consultations with work coaches and account managers within DWP, the leaflet and supporting video has been produced and will allow our customers to understand the process of DBS checks.</p>
</blockquote>
