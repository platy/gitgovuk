<p>Science, technology, engineering and maths (<abbr title="science, technology, engineering and maths">STEM</abbr>) ambassadors from <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> (Defence Science and Technology Laboratory) are encouraging the next generation of space engineers with 2 new employer-led challenges for students at the university technical college (<abbr title="university technical college">UTC</abbr>) in Portsmouth.</p>

<p>Students from Year 12 completed the challenges during the height of lockdown, from April to July 2020. They worked individually and in small groups to research, design and present solutions to problems devised by the scientists from <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>’s Space group located on Portsdown Hill.</p>

<p>Challenge 1 was a space debris mission, with students designing a craft to rendezvous with, capture and safely de-orbit the rogue satellite Envisat. The growing amount of debris in space poses a risk to orbiting satellites which provide vital services such as <abbr title="global positioning system">GPS</abbr> communications. Challenge 2 was a moon colony challenge, to design a moon base on Europa or Callisto – overcoming problems like ice and radiation. The students had regular feedback from the <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> team, even though they were not able to meet in person.</p>

<p>In order to develop the students’ skills and employability, challenges were designed to replicate work at <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>, the science inside UK defence and security. Students took on specific roles and were required to thoroughly research, illustrate and present their solutions – including costs and mission timelines. Challenges gave students an understanding of systems engineering and an opportunity to pursue their own, in-depth research, which they really enjoyed.</p>

<p>Rebecca Couchman-Crook, Space Mission Scientist who led the project with assistance from Jordan Lowrey, Max Faulkner and Simon George, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This challenge was a fantastic chance for us to engage with the students and show them why a career in <abbr title="science, technology, engineering and maths">STEM</abbr> is a great opportunity and that <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> as an awesome place to work. A few of the students produced excellent work that really impressed us. And we must have inspired them too, as one of them is very keen to join us as an apprentice after college.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><abbr title="university technical college">UTC</abbr> Portsmouth Assistant Principal, Alex Blandford, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">As one of our Primary Employer Partners, we were delighted when <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> was able to adapt their Space Debris Challenge to make it accessible to our students as they continued their studies during lockdown. It gave them the opportunity to work on a brief that they would not normally come across in their day to day curriculum but one that has provided invaluable feedback and insights into the world of space engineering. Their career aspirations have increased greatly because of this experience and we cannot thank <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> enough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jaime Williamson, Early Careers Lead at <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">It was amazing that Rebecca and the team were able to adapt to remote working with their students. The <abbr title="university technical college">UTC</abbr> in Portsmouth relies on employers to ensure that the students gain relevant skills to make them employable in the local economy. The students really appreciated the opportunity to get this <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> project on their <abbr title="curriculum vitae">CV</abbr> and the teachers really valued <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>’s support to engage the students while they were in lockdown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>’s engagement with <abbr title="university technical college">UTC</abbr> Portsmouth is continuing, and Year 13 students embarked on the very popular <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> Sentry Challenge in September, devised and delivered by <abbr title="science, technology, engineering and maths">STEM</abbr> Ambassadors from <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>’s Platform Systems Division.</p>
