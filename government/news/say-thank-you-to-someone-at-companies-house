<h2 id="how-to-say-thanks">How to say thanks</h2>
<p>If you’d like to say thanks and tell us about a person or team at Companies House who has given you a brilliant level of service - send your email to <a href="mailto:thanks@companieshouse.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">thanks@companieshouse.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>This could be someone who has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gone out of their way to help you</li>
  <li>been genuinely interested in your needs and responded to them</li>
  <li>helped you deal with a difficult situation</li>
</ul>

<p>The person will be told that you appreciated their effort and may even receive an award or gift voucher for their service.</p>

<h2 id="what-others-have-said">What others have said</h2>

<p>Here is some recent feedback about Companies House staff:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I would like to thank RE our Customer Care manager for the help he gives and the speed he responds to us.  It is wonderful to have him as our customer support. Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Hello, just a short e-mail to say a very big thank you to the New Companies Team that supported me with setting up a CIC early September. They were incredibly supportive and helped fast track my application. GR and AH were a real pleasure to talk to despite my very stressed disposition.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">To all concerned at Companies House. Just to say thank you to all who assisted me in setting up the company and keeping me up today with the respective deadlines. You were a great help, with grateful thanks.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I just wanted to say a special thank you to ML from the team at the Wales cooperative centre. She went above and beyond in resolving an issue we were facing with CIC registrations. She not only dealt with the issue promptly but put in measures to reduce the chance of issues happening again and dealt with the respective teams so that we did not have to navigate our way through the Companies House system. She provided a very professional service and we would like to extend our thanks for going that extra mile.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Good afternoon, as a follow on from my colleague’s email, I would also like to extend a special thank you to SW. He initially came to talk at one of our team meetings to help get us going with online company registration. Since then he has responded swiftly to numerous queries and has always gone above and beyond to help us as a team.  He has now organised for us to have our own Customer Care Manager at Companies House which will be extremely helpful for us. Thank you SW and ML for your continued support. It is a pleasure to work with you both. Congratulations to whoever came up with the idea of “thanks@” too – a great idea!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Just a massive THANK YOU to PT and EN who filed a client’s 2019 accounts, change of year end and then their 2020 accounts, which all had to be done in that order, with no gaps in the filing process. They went above and beyond what was expected to help our client and their business and it’s greatly appreciated. These are really difficult and testing times and it’s great to know that you have a dedicated and helpful team doing their utmost to assist us and our clients. Thank you again.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Thanks to DW for her very useful email - I did not know the insolvency service had such a range of responsibilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Hi, thank you very much for the reminder email that was sent! It was especially helpful when I have been in a partial lockdown area and needed the time to get hold of the Authentication code - and because I no longer have the phone I put the details into from before from which I was trying to be more organised with deadlines!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Hello, I would like to thank NG for assisting me with a query regarding an incorporation containing a potentially sensitive word.  NG agreed to look out for the incorporation to ensure it would not get automatically rejected, and called twice to update me with what was happening. I would also like to thank AD who also tried to assist. Both ladies are in the sensitive word department, I believe. It was a successful outcome to a frustrating situation. Many thanks.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Hello AJ, my sincere thanks for the information received in your recent reply to my share certificate inquiry. Great service.</p>
</blockquote>
