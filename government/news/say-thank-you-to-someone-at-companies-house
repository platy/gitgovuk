<h2 id="how-to-say-thanks">How to say thanks</h2>
<p>If you’d like to say thanks and tell us about a person or team at Companies House who has given you a brilliant level of service - send your email to <a href="mailto:thanks@companieshouse.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">thanks@companieshouse.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>This could be someone who has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gone out of their way to help you</li>
  <li>been genuinely interested in your needs and responded to them</li>
  <li>helped you deal with a difficult situation</li>
</ul>

<p>The person will be told that you appreciated their effort and may even receive an award or gift voucher for their service.</p>

<h2 id="what-others-have-said">What others have said</h2>

<p>Here is some recent feedback about Companies House staff:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I have been in contact with staff at Companies House for many years from going to the office in Bloomsbury to telephone conversations and I have always been treated with respect and had nothing but courteous attention and positive help from all members of staff. I am ashamed to say that it was your email prompt that reminded me to say, Many Thanks to you all! Keep safe and well!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">A warm Thank You to all at Companies House for extending 2019 returns in order to give us more time after the lockdowns and shielding we went through. Also Thank You for running wonderfully the online and newsletter services that keep us with prompt access to data and always updated and informed. With gratitude.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Thanks. I am Italian and I have an inactive company in the UK and you have given me great support, which is unthinkable here in Italy. Thank you and sorry for my bad English.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I would like to thank MR in Credit Control who was a massive help to me when I was struggling with an issue in relation to a Companies House Lender account. He was quick, efficient and made it easy for me to understand the advice he gave me. Invaluable service. Thanks Mark.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I would like to thank PW for all her support over the years. She is a reassuring presence on the phone and always provides a clear and prompt response to any queries. Many thanks</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Following my colleague’s e-mail below I would like to thank PW for her help and support. I have always found PW to be extremely helpful, providing a prompt response to any enquiry.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">To all concerned at Companies House. Just to say thank you to all who assisted me in setting up the company and keeping me up today with the respective deadlines. You were a great help, with grateful thanks.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Thank you to PW and a lady called A who helped put an incorporation through (with a sensitive name). Above and beyond their duty and very much appreciated. Thank you ladies!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Yesterday I rang around 5:10pm and my call was answered and was provided good guidance how to change the details of a director. Thank you for helping me.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Hello, I would like to say thank you to BJ, my customer care manager, who has always responded quickly to any questions asked, she has helped to smooth out difficult situations, provided advice on resolving issues and is always willing to assist where possible. This accessibility to such a great facilitator makes me feel that in a small way she and Companies House are an extended part of my team.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">PC was very helpful with detailed information sent the next day after my inquiry! Thanks.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I would like to say thank you to BJ for her continued support during the current climate. It is noted and appreciated. Keep up the good work.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Thanks for your help to the problem I had with my Dormant Account.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Greetings. It is not very often people say “thank you” to those who matter the most and I personally know that when I incorporated my business during the recession in 2008, I knew I had great support from all the team I was dealing with then and now. People forget that you are all here to provide everyone with a great service in being able to work for themselves and when it was in the days I had to send paper forms to incorporate, I can assure you things have improved with the services. So really, this is to express my huge thanks to you all for everything you did, do and continue to do to assist me in being able to assist my clients. Keep well and safe and will look forward to our next Focus Meeting.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">On Friday 13 November I received fantastic service – absolutely fantastic service. I am one very happy customer. I rang with a query about filing accounts for a company I have that has been dormant since registration.  I spent the best part of 4 hours the previous evening trying to make the Share capital paid and issued work. Your colleague talked me through the process start to finish – and we were done in under 5 minutes. She was polite, helpful, patient! And empathetic to my dilemma. I’ve completed a telephone survey and given 10/10 to both questions – but really felt the service I received today deserved me making the time to send a special mention.  Thank you for your professional support – it means a lot.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We would just like to say a massive thank you to RE for all the assistance he has provided since lockdown and previously. We feel he is an absolute asset to your organisation. He always goes above and beyond anything we have experienced in customer care before. Just wanted to show our appreciation for all that he does.</p>
