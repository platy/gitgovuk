<h3>Friday 15 July 2022</h3>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>&nbsp;has published the latest <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-outbreak-epidemiological-overview">epidemiological overview</a> for the ongoing monkeypox outbreak.</p>

<p>It shows that as of 14 July 2022, there were 1,856 confirmed cases in the UK. Of these, 1,778 are in England.</p>

<p>It also includes a breakdown of cases in England by region, which demonstrates that a significant majority of cases are in London.</p>

<p>Full <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/monkeypox-semen-testing-for-viral-dna">guidance on semen testing for monkeypox</a> for clinicians has been published.</p>

<p>The evidence relating to the transmission of monkeypox through semen is limited at the present time. In line with the World Health Organization’s (<abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>) guidance, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is now advising people to use condoms for 12 weeks after infection. This is a precaution to reduce the risk of spreading the virus to a partner.</p>

<p>We continue to advise those with monkeypox to not have sex while symptomatic and while lesions are present.</p>

<p>Further epidemiological data and additional analysis can be found in&nbsp;<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>’s regular monkeypox <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-outbreak-technical-briefings">technical briefings</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> has published the latest <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-outbreak-epidemiological-overview">epidemiological overview</a> for the ongoing monkeypox outbreak.</p>

<p>It shows that as of 7 July, there were 1,552 confirmed cases in the UK. Of these, 1,482 are in England.</p>

<p>It also includes a breakdown of cases in England by region, which demonstrates that a significant majority of cases are in London.</p>

<p>Further epidemiological data and additional analysis can be found in <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>’s regular monkeypox <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-outbreak-technical-briefings">technical briefings</a>.</p>

<h3>Tuesday 5 July 2022</h3>

<p>As of 4 July, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-outbreak-epidemiological-overview/monkeypox-outbreak-epidemiological-overview-5-july-2022">the total number of monkeypox cases in the UK is 1,351</a>.</p>

<p>Dr Meera Chand, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections at <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While anyone can catch monkeypox, the majority of monkeypox cases in the UK continue to be in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (<abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr>), with the infection being passed on mainly through close contact between people in interconnected sexual networks.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Before you go to a party or event, check yourself for monkeypox symptoms, including rashes and blisters. If you have monkeypox symptoms, take a break from attending events or&nbsp;sex until you’ve called 111 or a sexual health service and been assessed by a clinician. It can take up to 3 weeks for symptoms to appear after being in contact with someone with monkeypox, so stay alert for symptoms after you have skin to skin or sexual contact with someone new.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As of July 2022, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hcid-status-of-monkeypox">the current outbreak clade of monkeypox is no longer classified as a high consequence infectious disease (<abbr title="high consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr>)</a>, following review by the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (<abbr title="Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens">ACDP</abbr>) and agreement by the UK 4 nations public health agencies.</p>

<p>This does not alter the public health response or measures taken to control monkeypox, but relates to which clinical pathways are used in the NHS.</p>

<p>This decision has been taken because the current outbreak does not meet the criteria for a high consequence infectious disease, which is defined as having a high mortality rate and a lack of available interventions.</p>

<p>We have had no reported deaths from monkeypox in the UK and we have vaccine available for higher risk contacts, healthcare workers who are caring for and who are due to start caring for a patient with confirmed monkeypox, and a new vaccination programme for those who are most at risk.</p>

<p>Future importations of monkeypox directly from West Africa as well as cases caused by the Congo basin clade of the virus will still be classified as <abbr title="high consequence infectious diseases">HCIDs</abbr> as we cannot predict their characteristics.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is now working to adapt case and contact management using the growing body of evidence about the outbreak. The majority of contacts of cases will no longer be contacted every day following their initial notification and will instead be provided with contact details to approach if they develop symptoms.</p>

<p>This change has been made in light of the emerging evidence about disease severity, meaning that suspected cases do not need to be rapidly transferred to hospital.</p>

<p>NHS England is due to set out details on how eligible people can get vaccinated shortly. People are advised not to come forward for the vaccine until contacted.</p>

<h3>Friday 1 July 2022</h3>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>&nbsp;has published the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-outbreak-epidemiological-overview">data report on monkeypox</a>&nbsp;in the UK.</p>

<p>As of Thursday 30 June, there are 1,235 confirmed cases in the UK.</p>

<p>Wendi Shepherd, monkeypox incident director at <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The monkeypox outbreak continues to grow. Our investigations and information from confirmed cases continue to show that the overwhelming majority of cases are in gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men.</p>

  <p>This weekend, let’s enjoy Pride safely – before you go to any events or parties, check yourself for blister-like spots and rashes. Please don’t attend if you have monkeypox symptoms or feel unwell.</p>

  <p>If you have a rash or blisters, stay at home, phone a sexual health clinic, and get tested. Please be vigilant for any monkeypox symptoms in the coming weeks – especially if you are having sex with someone new.</p>

  <p class="last-child">To assist with our contact tracing, we encourage everyone to ensure they exchange contact details with sexual partners, to help us limit further transmission where cases occur.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyone can get monkeypox and it can spread from person to person through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash</li>
  <li>touching monkeypox skin blisters or scabs (including during sex)</li>
  <li>the coughs or sneezes of a person with the monkeypox rash</li>
</ul>

<p>We have been advising event organisers throughout the outbreak. See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/monkeypox-planning-events-and-mass-gatherings">latest guidance for organised events and mass gatherings</a>.</p>

<h3>Tuesday 28 June 2022</h3>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>&nbsp;has published the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-outbreak-epidemiological-overview">data report on monkeypox</a>&nbsp;in the UK.</p>

<p>As of Sunday 26 June, there are 1,076 confirmed cases in the UK.</p>

<p>This report is published every Tuesday and Friday.</p>

<p>Dr Sophia Makki, Incident director at <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The monkeypox outbreak in the UK continues to grow, with over a thousand cases now confirmed nationwide.&nbsp;We expect cases to continue to rise further in the coming days and weeks.</p>

  <p>If you are&nbsp;attending large events over the summer or having sex with new partners, be alert to any monkeypox symptoms so you can get tested rapidly and help avoid passing the infection on.</p>

  <p>Currently the majority of cases have been in men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men. However, anyone who has had close contact with an individual with symptoms is also at increased risk.</p>

  <p>If you are concerned that you may have monkeypox, don’t go to events, meet with friends or have sexual contact. Instead, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice.&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="last-child">We are grateful to all the people who have come forward so far&nbsp;for testing and&nbsp;to assist us with our contact tracing.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> publishes first monkeypox technical briefing</h3>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-outbreak-technical-briefings">published its first technical briefing</a> on the ongoing monkeypox outbreak. The briefing shares <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> analysis with other public health investigators and academic partners.</p>

<p>This first publication includes updated epidemiological data, with evidence from anonymised detailed interviews with patients which are helping us to understand transmission and to determine how to target interventions.</p>

<p>Of the cases interviewed, 81% were known to be London residents and 99% were male. The median age of confirmed cases in the UK was 38 years old.</p>

<p>152 cases participated in more detailed questionnaires. In this data, 151 of the 152 men interviewed identified as gay, bisexual, or men who have sex with men, or reported same sex contact. Recent foreign travel, within 21 days prior to symptom onset, was reported by 75 cases, with 59 of these reporting travel within Europe.</p>

<p>We also share preliminary assessment of the genomic differences between the outbreak virus and previous monkeypox viruses. In any emerging infection outbreak we assess the virus or bacteria for any changes. We will be working to investigate the significance of the mutations identified so far to determine if they will have any impact on the virus’ behaviour</p>

<p>Dr Meera Chand, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are working, both in the UK and together with global partners, to progress the investigations that we need to help us better understand the virus, its transmission and the best use of mitigations such as vaccines and treatments. We use the new data rapidly to inform the public health response and we continue to work to reduce transmission.&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="last-child">We are grateful to all those who have come forward for testing and the patients who continue to help us understand the outbreak through participating in studies and investigations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> has identified a number of aspects of this outbreak which require further investigation. We will release the results of our ongoing investigations in subsequent technical briefings – these will be published regularly.</p>

<h3>Friday 10 June 2022</h3>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has detected 43 additional cases of monkeypox in England, one additional case in Scotland and one additional case in Wales.</p>

<p>This brings the total number confirmed in the UK to 366, as of 9 June.</p>

<p>There are currently 348 confirmed cases in England, 12 in Scotland, 2 in Northern Ireland and 4 in Wales.</p>

<p>Anyone can get monkeypox, particularly if you have had close contact, including sexual contact, with an individual with symptoms. Currently most cases have been in men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men.</p>

<h3>Tuesday 7 June 2022</h3>

<h3>Monkeypox designated a notifiable disease</h3>

<p>Monkeypox is to be listed as a notifiable disease in law from 8 June 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Legislation has been laid today (7 June 2022) which will make monkeypox a notifiable infectious disease under the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010 from 8 June 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This means all doctors in England are required to notify their local council or local Health Protection Team (<abbr title="Health Protection Team">HPT</abbr>) if they suspect a patient has monkeypox. Laboratories must also notify the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) if the monkeypox virus is identified in a laboratory sample.</p>

<p>Wendi Shepherd, monkeypox incident director at <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rapid diagnosis and reporting is the key to interrupting transmission and containing any further spread of monkeypox. This new legislation will support us and our health partners to swiftly identify, treat and control the disease.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It also supports us with the swift collection and analysis of data which enables us to detect possible outbreaks of the disease and trace close contacts rapidly, whilst offering vaccinations where appropriate to limit onward transmission.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/notifiable-diseases-and-causative-organisms-how-to-report">Full guidance about reporting notifiable diseases and causative organisms</a> can be found on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>It is important anyone concerned they may have symptoms of monkeypox feels able to access healthcare and clinical advice immediately.</p>

<p>To enable this, The National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 2022 have been amended making the diagnosis and treatment of monkeypox, and suspected monkeypox, exempt from charges for all overseas visitors.</p>

<h3>Monday 6 June 2022</h3>

<h3>Tuesday 31 May 2022</h3>

<h3>Eleven new monkeypox cases identified in England</h3>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has detected 11 additional cases of monkeypox in England.</p>

<p>The latest cases, as of 30 May, bring the total number confirmed in England since 7 May to 183.</p>

<p>There are currently 4 confirmed cases in Scotland, 2 in Northern Ireland and 1 in Wales, taking the UK total to 190.</p>

<p>The risk to the UK population remains low, but we are asking people to be alert to any new rashes or lesions, which would appear like spots, ulcers or blisters, on any part of their body.</p>

<p>Although this advice applies to everyone, the majority of the cases identified to date have been among men who are gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men, so we are asking these people in particular to be aware of the symptoms, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner.</p>

<p>You should call NHS 111 or a sexual health centre immediately if you have a rash with blisters. Do not go to a sexual health clinic without contacting them first. Stay at home and avoid close contact with other people until you’ve been told what to do.</p>

<p>Dr Ruth Milton, Senior Medical Advisor at&nbsp;<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<h3>Seventy-one additional monkeypox cases identified in England</h3>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has detected 71 additional cases of monkeypox in England.</p>

<p>The latest cases, as of 29 May, bring the total number confirmed in England since 7 May to 172.</p>

<p>There are currently 4 confirmed cases in Scotland, 2 in Northern Ireland and 1 in Wales, taking the UK total to 179.</p>

<p>The risk to the UK population remains low, but we are asking people to be alert to any new rashes or lesions, which would appear like spots, ulcers or blisters, on any part of their body.</p>

<p>Although this advice applies to everyone, the majority of the cases identified to date have been among men who are gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men, so we are asking these people in particular to be aware of the symptoms, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner.</p>

<p>You should call NHS 111 or a sexual health centre immediately if you have a rash with blisters and either, you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>have been in close contact with someone who has or might have monkeypox (even if they have not been tested yet) in the past 3 weeks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have been to West or Central Africa in the past 3 weeks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>are a man who has sex with men</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Tell the person you speak to if you have had close contact with someone who has or might have monkeypox, or if you’ve recently travelled to central or west Africa.</p>

<p>Do not go to a sexual health clinic without contacting them first. Stay at home and avoid close contact with other people until you’ve been told what to do.</p>

<p>Additionally, today, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> has published <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/principles-for-monkeypox-control-in-the-uk-4-nations-consensus-statement">guidance principles agreed across all 4 UK nations</a> on how to effectively limit transmission of monkeypox and limit onward transmission when cases are identified.</p>

<p>This includes <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/public-health-agencies-issue-monkeypox-guidance-to-control-transmission">advice and protocols</a> for those testing positive for monkeypox, their close contacts and anyone involved in their treatment or care, including healthcare workers. The principles are already in use in response to the outbreak, and today’s publication confirms the UK’s aligned response.</p>

<p>Dr Ruth Milton, Senior Medical Advisor at <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are continuing to work closely with our colleagues in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to ensure we are aligned in our approach to reducing the risk of transmission of monkeypox in the UK.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We are reminding people to look out for new spots, ulcers or blisters on any part of their body. If anyone suspects they might have these, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, they should limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service as soon as possible, though please phone ahead before attending in person. This will help us to limit the virus being passed on.</p>

<h3>Thirty-six more cases of monkeypox identified by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has detected 36 additional cases of monkeypox in England.</p>

<p>The latest cases bring the total number of monkeypox cases confirmed in England since 7 May to 56.</p>

<p>The virus does not usually spread easily between people, but it can be passed on through close person-to-person contact or contact with items used by a person who has monkeypox, such as clothes, bedding or utensils. Monkeypox is usually a self-limiting illness and most people recover within a few weeks.</p>

<p>While the current outbreak is significant and concerning, the risk to the UK population remains low.</p>

<p>Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, should immediately contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service.</p>

<p>A notable proportion of cases detected have been in gay and bisexual men, so <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> continues to urge this community to be alert to monkeypox symptoms.</p>

<p>People should notify clinics ahead of their visit and can be assured their call or discussion will be treated sensitively and confidentially.</p>

<p>Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alongside reports of further cases being identified in other countries globally, we continue to identify additional cases in the UK. Thank you to everyone who has come forward for testing already and supported our contact tracing efforts – you are helping us limit the spread of this infection in the UK.</p>

  <p>Because the virus spreads through close contact, we are urging everyone to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service if they have any symptoms.</p>

  <p class="last-child">A notable proportion of recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men so we are particularly encouraging these men to be alert to the symptoms.</p>

<h3>Eleven more cases of monkeypox identified by&nbsp;<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has detected 11 additional cases of monkeypox in England.</p>

<p>The latest cases bring the total number of monkeypox cases confirmed in England since 6 May to 20.</p>

<p>The infection can be passed on through close contact or contact with clothing or linens used by a person who has monkeypox.</p>

<p>However, the virus does not usually spread easily between people and the risk to the UK population remains low.</p>

<p>Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, should contact NHS 111 or call a sexual health service if they have concerns.</p>

<p>We continue to engage with partners across the sector at pace to deliver training webinars about monkeypox to clinicians to increase knowledge and awareness of this infection which is unusual in clinical settings in the UK. The first of these was hosted earlier this week by British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (<abbr title="British Association for Sexual Health and HIV">BASHH</abbr>) and was attended by over 900 people.</p>

<p>A notable proportion of early cases detected have been in gay and bisexual men and so <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is urging this community in particular to be alert.</p>

<p>People should notify clinics ahead of their visit and can be assured their call or discussion will be treated sensitively and confidentially.</p>

<p>Monkeypox is usually a mild self-limiting illness, spread by very close contact with someone with monkeypox and most people recover within a few weeks.</p>

<p>Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser,&nbsp;<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We anticipated that further cases would be detected through our active case finding with NHS services and heightened vigilance among healthcare professionals.</p>

  <p>We expect this increase to continue in the coming days and for more cases to be identified in the wider community. Alongside this we are receiving reports of further cases being identified in other countries globally.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>We continue to rapidly investigate the source of these infections and raise awareness among healthcare professionals. We are contacting any identified close contacts of the cases to provide health information and advice.</p>

  <p>Because the virus spreads through close contact, we are urging everyone to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact NHS 111 or a sexual health service if they have any concerns.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Please contact clinics ahead of your visit and avoid close contact with others until you have been seen by a clinician.</p>

  <p>A notable proportion of recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men so we are particularly encouraging them to be alert to the symptoms and seek help if concerned.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Clinicians should be alert to any individual presenting with unusual rashes without a clear alternative diagnosis and should contact specialist services for advice.</p>

<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>Initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion.</p>

<p>A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body including the genitals.</p>

<p>The rash changes and goes through different stages – it can look like chickenpox or syphilis, before finally forming a scab which later falls off.</p>

<h3>Wednesday 18 May 2022</h3>

<h3>Two more cases of monkeypox identified by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has detected 2 additional cases of monkeypox, one in London and one in the South East of England.</p>

<p>The latest cases bring the total number of monkeypox cases confirmed in England since 6 May to 9, with recent cases predominantly in gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men (<abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr>).</p>

<p>The 2 latest cases have no travel links to a country where monkeypox is endemic, so it is possible they acquired the infection through community transmission.</p>

<p>The virus spreads through close contact and <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is advising individuals, particularly those who are gay, bisexual or <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr>, to be alert to any unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, and to contact a sexual health service if they have concerns.</p>

<p>Monkeypox has not previously been described as a sexually transmitted infection, though it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. It can also be passed on through other close contact with a person who has monkeypox or contact with clothing or linens used by a person who has monkeypox.</p>

<p>The 2 new cases do not have known connections with <a href="#previous">previous confirmed cases</a> announced on 16, 14 and 7 May.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is working closely with the NHS and other stakeholders to urgently investigate where and how recent confirmed monkeypox cases were acquired, including how they may be linked to each other.</p>

<p>The virus does not usually spread easily between people. The risk to the UK population remains low.</p>

<p>Anyone with concerns that they could be infected with monkeypox is advised to contact NHS 111 or a sexual health clinic. People should notify clinics ahead of their visit. We can assure them their call or discussion will be treated sensitively and confidentially.</p>

<p>Monkeypox is a viral infection usually associated with travel to West Africa. It is usually a mild self-limiting illness, spread by very close contact with someone with monkeypox and most people recover within a few weeks.</p>

<p>Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser,&nbsp;<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These latest cases, together with reports of cases in countries across Europe, confirms our initial concerns that there could be spread of monkeypox within our communities.</p>

  <p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> has quickly identified cases so far and we continue to rapidly investigate the source of these infections and raise awareness among healthcare professionals.</p>

  <p>We are particularly urging men who are gay and bisexual to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service without delay if they have concerns. Please contact clinics ahead of your visit.</p>

<h3>Four more cases of monkeypox indentified by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has detected 4 additional cases of monkeypox, 3 in London and one linked case in the&nbsp;North East of England.</p>

<p>The 4 new cases do not have known connections with the previous confirmed&nbsp;cases <a href="#fourteen-may">announced on 14 May</a> and the case <a href="#seven-may">announced on 7 May</a>.</p>

<p>Investigations are underway to establish links between the latest 4 cases, who all appear to have been infected in London. All 4 of these cases self-identify as gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men (<abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Currently, common contacts have been identified for 2 of the 4 latest cases. &nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no link to travel to a country where monkeypox is endemic, and exactly where and how they acquired their infections remains under urgent investigation, including whether they have further links to each other.</p>

<p>Those patients needing medical care are all in specialist infectious disease units at the Royal Free Hosptial, Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne and Guys’ and St Thomas’. The individuals have the West African clade of the virus, which is mild compared to the Central African clade.</p>

<p>These latest cases mean that there are currently 7 confirmed monkeypox cases in the UK, diagnosed between 6 and 15 May.</p>

<p>Due to the recent increase in cases and uncertainties around where some of these individuals acquired their infection, we are working closely with NHS partners to identify if there may have been more cases in recent weeks, as well as international partners to understand if similar rises have been seen in other countries.</p>

<p>Monkeypox is a viral infection usually associated with travel to West Africa. It is usually a mild self-limiting illness, spread by very close contact with someone with monkeypox and most people recover within a few weeks.</p>

<p>The virus does not spread easily between people and the risk to the UK population is low. However, the most recent cases are in&nbsp; gay, bisexual and other <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> communities, and as the virus spreads through close contact, we are advising these groups to be alert to any unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, and to contact a sexual health service if they have concerns.</p>

<p>Anyone with concerns that they could be infected with monkeypox is advised to make contact with clinics ahead of their visit. We can assure them their call or discussion will be treated sensitively and confidentially.</p>

<p>Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser,&nbsp;<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is rare and unusual.&nbsp;<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is rapidly investigating the source of these infections because the evidence suggests that there may be transmission of the monkeypox virus in the community, spread by close contact.</p>

  <p>We are particularly urging men who are gay and bisexual to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service without delay.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We are contacting any potential close contacts of the cases to provide health information and advice.</p>

<h3>Two additional cases of monkeypox identified in London</h3>

<p>Two individuals have been diagnosed with monkeypox in London, the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has confirmed.</p>

<p>The cases live together in the same household. They are not linked to the previous confirmed <a href="#seven-may">case announced on 7 May</a>. Where and how they acquired their infection remains under investigation.</p>

<p>Monkeypox is a rare viral infection that does not spread easily between people. It is usually a mild self-limiting illness and most people recover within a few weeks. However, severe illness can occur in some people.</p>

<p>The infection can be spread when someone is in close contact with an infected person, however, there is a very low risk of transmission to the general population.</p>

<p>One of the cases is receiving care at the expert infectious disease unit at St Mary’s Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London. The other case is isolating and does not currently require hospital treatment.</p>

<p>As a precautionary measure, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> experts are working closely with the individuals and NHS colleagues and will be contacting people who might have been in close contact to provide information and health advice.</p>

<p>People without symptoms are not considered infectious but, as a precaution, those who have been in close proximity to the individuals are being contacted to ensure that, if they do become unwell, they can be treated quickly.</p>

<p>Dr Colin Brown, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have confirmed 2 new monkeypox cases in England that are not linked to the case announced on May 7. While investigations remain ongoing to determine the source of infection, it is important to emphasise it does not spread easily between people and requires close personal contact with an infected symptomatic person. The overall risk to the general public remains very low.</p>

  <p>We are contacting any potential close contacts of the case. We are also working with the NHS to reach any healthcare contacts who have had close contact with the cases prior to confirmation of their infection, to assess them as necessary and provide advice.</p>

  <p class="last-child"><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and the NHS have well established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed.</p>

<h4>Symptoms</h4>

<p>Initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion.</p>

<p>A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, particularly the hands and feet.</p>

<p>The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.</p>

<h3>7 May 2022</h3>

<h3>Monkeypox case confirmed in England</h3>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) can confirm an individual has been diagnosed with monkeypox in England.</p>

<p>The patient has a recent travel history from Nigeria, which is where they are believed to have contracted the infection, before travelling to the UK.</p>

<p>Monkeypox is a rare viral infection that does not spread easily between people. It is usually a mild self-limiting illness and most people recover within a few weeks. However, severe illness can occur in some individuals.</p>

<p>The infection can be spread when someone is in close contact with an infected person; however, there is a very low risk of transmission to the general population.</p>

<p>The patient is receiving care at the expert infectious disease unit at the Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, London.</p>

<p>As a precautionary measure, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> experts are working closely with NHS colleagues and will be contacting people who might have been in close contact with the individual to provide information and health advice.</p>

<p>This includes contacting a number of passengers who travelled in close proximity to the patient on the same flight to the UK. People without symptoms are not considered infectious but, as a precaution, those who have been in close proximity are being contacted to ensure that if they do become unwell they can be treated quickly. If passengers are not contacted then there is no action they should take.</p>

<p>Dr Colin Brown, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is important to emphasise that monkeypox does not spread easily between people and the overall risk to the general public is very low.</p>

  <p>We are working with NHS England and NHS Improvement (NHSEI) to contact the individuals who have had close contact with the case prior to confirmation of their infection, to assess them as necessary and provide advice.</p>

  <p class="last-child"><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and the NHS have well established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Nicholas Price, Director <abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr> High Consequence Infection Diseases (airborne) Network&nbsp;and Consultant in Infectious Diseases at Guy’s and St Thomas’, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The patient is being treated in our specialist&nbsp;isolation unit&nbsp;at St Thomas’ Hospital by expert clinical staff with&nbsp;strict&nbsp;infection prevention procedures.&nbsp;This is a good example of the way that the High Consequence Infectious Diseases national network and <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> work closely together in responding swiftly and effectively to these sporadic cases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Initial symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.</p>
