<p>A Level 2 health-alert in 3 regions of the country has today been issued by the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), with the Met Office forecasting high temperatures throughout next week.</p>

<p>The alert is in place from 9am on Monday 11 July until 9am on Friday 15 July, and covers the East of England, South East and London regions.</p>

<p>Dr Agostinho Sousa, Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection at <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We want everyone to enjoy the hot weather when it arrives, but also to check in on their vulnerable family, friends and neighbours to make sure they are prepared for the warm conditions ahead.</p>

  <p class="last-child">High temperatures are predicted for a prolonged period, so make sure to follow our simple health advice to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/heatwave-plan-for-england/beat-the-heat-keep-cool-at-home-checklist">beat the heat</a>, such as covering windows exposed to direct sunlight and making sure that fridges, freezers and fans are working properly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>David Oliver, Deputy Chief Meteorologist at the Met Office, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re at the start of a stretch of warm weather for much of England and Wales, that could last for much of next week.</p>

  <p class="last-child">In the short term, many can expect temperatures in the mid to high 20s Celsius over the weekend and then in the low 30s Celsius during the start of next week. Much of next week will remain warm for the time of year, as well as dry and sunny.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To prepare for the warm weather ahead, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>shade or cover windows exposed to direct sunlight – external shutters or shades are very effective, internal blinds or curtains are less effective but cheaper and easier to install</li>
  <li>check that windows or vents can be opened</li>
  <li>if applicable, check mechanical ventilations systems are switched on and operating in summer mode</li>
  <li>check that fridges, freezers and fans are working properly</li>
  <li>check medicines can be stored according to the instructions on the packaging</li>
</ul>

<h3>Thursday 16 June 2022</h3>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) and the Met Office have today issued a Level 3 heat-health alert for London, East of England and the South East.</p>

<p>This alert follows the Level 2 alert issued on Tuesday and confirms that the Met Office’s threshold temperatures for an alert will be reached in 3 regions from Friday. A Level 2 alert remains in place for the East Midlands and South West.</p>

<p>Temperatures in these regions are expected to rise throughout the week and peak on Friday 17 June, with the alerts remaining in place until midnight on Saturday 18 June.</p>

<p>For more information on the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heat-exhaustion-heatstroke/#:~:text=Immediate%20action%20required%3A%20Call%20999,temperature%20of%2040C%20or%20above" rel="external">common signs and symptoms</a> of heat exhaustion and heatstroke, visit NHS.UK.</p>

<h3>Tuesday 14 June 2022</h3>

<p>This is the first <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/heat-health/?tab=heatHealth&amp;season=normal" rel="external">Level 2 heat-health alert</a> of the year, with high temperatures expected across the Midlands and the south of the country later this week.</p>

<p>The alert, which comes into place at midnight on Thursday 16 June until midnight on Saturday 18 June, covers the East Midlands, East of England, London, South East and South West regions.</p>

<p>Dr Agostinho Sousa, Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection at <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>High temperatures are expected in some parts of the Midlands and the south on Friday. We want everyone to enjoy the hot weather safely when it arrives and be aware of good health advice for coping with warmer conditions.</p>

  <p class="last-child">During periods of hot weather, it is especially important to keep checking on those who are most vulnerable, such as older people and those with heart or lung conditions. Make sure to look out for signs of <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heat-exhaustion-heatstroke/" rel="external">heat exhaustion</a> and follow our simple health advice to beat the heat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dan Rudman, Deputy Chief Meteorologist at the Met Office, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Temperatures will continue to rise as we go through the week, becoming well above-average by Friday, when many parts of the southern half of the UK are likely to exceed 30°C or even reach 34°C in some places.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This is the first spell of hot weather this year and it is unusual for temperature to exceed these values in June. Many areas will also see some warm nights with minimum temperatures expected to be in the high teens or even low 20s for some overnight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The top ways for staying safe when the heat arrives are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>look out for those who may struggle to keep themselves cool and hydrated – older people, those with underlying conditions and those who live alone are particularly at risk</li>
  <li>stay cool indoors by closing curtains on rooms that face the sun – and remember that it may be cooler outdoors than indoors</li>
  <li>drink plenty of fluids and avoid excess alcohol</li>
  <li>never leave anyone in a closed, parked vehicle, especially infants, young children or animals</li>
  <li>try to keep out of the sun between 11am to 3pm, when the <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr> rays are strongest</li>
  <li>walk in the shade, apply sunscreen and wear a wide-brimmed hat, if you have to go out in the heat</li>
  <li>avoid physical exertion in the hottest parts of the day</li>
  <li>make sure you take water with you if you are travelling</li>
  <li>take care and make sure to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/environment-agency-warns-thames-users-to-stay-safe-on-the-river-this-summer">follow local safety advice</a> if you are going into the water to cool down</li>
</ul>
