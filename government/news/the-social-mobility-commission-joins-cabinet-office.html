<p>On 1 April 2021 the Social Mobility Commission moved to the Cabinet Office. Previously sponsored by the Department for Education, the Social Mobility Commission is an independent statutory body that exists to create a United Kingdom where the circumstances of birth do not determine outcomes in life.</p>

<p>The move ensures that the Social Mobility Commission is at the heart of the government and enables the Commission to have increased influence and leverage in addressing social and regional inequality.</p>

<p>The Social Mobility Commission is now sponsored by the Minister for Women and Equalities as part of the Equality Hub, which already includes the Government Equalities Office, the Race Disparity Unit and the Disability Unit, to drive meaningful progress on equalities in the UK.</p>

<p>The Commission is led by Sandra Wallace and Steven Cooper who were appointed as interim chairs of the Social Mobility Commission on a job share basis in July 2020. Their interim appointment has been recently extended for a period of up to six months. The appointment will ensure accountability and strong leadership are maintained until the conclusion of an open recruitment process to appoint a permanent chair.</p>

<h3>More key information about the Social Mobility Commission’s move:</h3>
