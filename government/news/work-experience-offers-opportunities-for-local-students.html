<p>Over the summer we have had different groups of young people join us on our work experience programme for young nuclear design engineers.</p>

<p>Around 80 Year 10/11 and 12/13 students from local schools and colleges in the Warrington area got an insight into what design engineering involves and the range of opportunities available in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers.</p>

<p>Using a multi-discipline project and individual tasks delivered by our own engineers, graduates and degree apprentices, the students completed 4 engineering modules designed to inform and inspire the workforce of the future.</p>

<p>Their placements were in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>process</li>
  <li>mechanical</li>
  <li>control electrical and instrumentation</li>
  <li>civil and structural engineering design</li>
</ul>

<p>Our ground-breaking work experience programme has had many successes over the years it’s been running.</p>

<p>Those successes include Lorna Sowerbutts who came to our Warrington offices to take part in our work experience programme with no idea what she wanted to do as a career.</p>

<p>After completing her work experience, she joined us as an apprentice in 2017 and has recently graduated with a first class honours degree in civil engineering.</p>

<p>She is now working as a civil engineer in our Infrastructure Strategic Alliance.</p>

<p>Lorna’s story shows the impact that successful work experience can have on young people who are considering their future choices.</p>

<p>Lewis Stanley, one of the students on this year’s programme, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This has been a really good experience. My background is film and media so I’ve enjoyed talking to people who work in engineering to understand the work they do.</p>

  <p>If you’re interested in engineering I would definitely recommend this programme, especially if you’re studying science and design/technology.</p>

  <p class="last-child">There’s lots of different things to learn about and the team explained how to enter engineering and the different routes for qualifications and jobs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simon Wittridge, head of project functions, Sellafield Ltd said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This really is an exceptional programme and a great way of showing the next generation the opportunities that are available to them – seeing young people embrace opportunities like this is a personal highlight for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mark Duffy, engineering and education development manager added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This programme is an excellent springboard for early career talent into the organisation.&nbsp; Through the structured delivery format which mimics the approach to project delivery, the participants have a lens into engineering which brings alive their theoretical studies.</p>

  <p>Next year, we are hoping to run the programme throughout multiple holiday periods, to increase opportunities for engagement and to open up the programme to more students.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We are also exploring working with other functions within Sellafield Ltd to widen to scope of our programme.</p>
