</div>

<p>In total, more than 31,000 customers submitted their 2020 to 2021 tax return between Christmas Eve and Boxing Day – getting it in early ahead of the deadline on 31 January 2022, and most festive filers completed their return on 24 December:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Christmas Eve: 19,802 tax returns were filed. The peak time for filing was 11:00 to 11:59 when 2,914 returns were received</li>
  <li>Christmas Day: 2,828 tax returns were filed. The peak time for filing was 12:00 to 12:59 when 227 returns were received</li>
  <li>Boxing Day: 8,641 tax returns were filed. The peak time for filing 12:00 to 12:59 when 821 returns were received</li>
</ul>

<p>Myrtle Lloyd, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Director General for Customer Services, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Filling in a tax return won’t have been on many people’s to-do lists for Christmas, but please don’t leave it until the end of January either. We have videos, guidance and helpsheets to support you – just search ‘Self Assessment’ on GOV.UK to find out more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has created resources to help customers complete their tax return including a playlist on <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8EcnheDt1ziQSjJNRITtCf7XD_ne-_lQ">YouTube</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/help-and-support-for-self-assessment">webinars</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-forms-and-helpsheets" class="govuk-link">helpsheets and guidance</a> available on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Some Self Assessment customers may feel worried or anxious about paying any tax owed by the deadline. If they cannot pay in full, customers can set up their own <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/difficulties-paying-hmrc/pay-in-instalments">Time to Pay arrangement</a> online if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have filed their 2020 to 2021 tax return</li>
  <li>owe less than £30,000</li>
  <li>are within 60 days of the payment deadline</li>
  <li>plan to pay their debt off within the next 12 months or less</li>
</ul>

<p>If customers owe more than £30,000, or need longer to pay, they should call the Self Assessment Payment Helpline on 0300 200 3822.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> urges everyone to be alert if they are contacted out of the blue by someone asking for money or personal information. Customers should always type in the full online address www.gov.uk/hmrc to get the correct link for filing their Self Assessment return online securely and free of charge. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> sees high numbers of fraudsters emailing, calling or texting people claiming to be from the department. If in doubt, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> advises not to reply directly to anything suspicious, but to contact them straight away and to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/identify-hmrc-related-scam-phone-calls-emails-and-text-messages">search GOV.UK for ‘<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> scams’</a>.</p>
