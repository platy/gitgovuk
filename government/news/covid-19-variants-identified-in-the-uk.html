          <h2>Latest update</h2>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has announced the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant known as B.1.1.529 as a variant under investigation (<abbr title="variant under investigation">VUI</abbr>).</p>

<p>The first genomes of this variant were uploaded to the international GISAID database on 22 November. Genomes have now been uploaded from South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong but the extent of spread is not yet determined. No cases have been identified in the UK.</p>

<p>B.1.1.529 has a large number of mutations in the gene coding for the spike protein, and also in other parts of the viral genome.&nbsp; These are potentially biologically significant mutations which may change the behaviour of the virus with regards to immune escape, transmissibility or susceptibility to treatments, but this has not been proven. More investigation is required to fully determine the extent of these mutations’ impact.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is monitoring the situation closely, in partnership with scientific and public health organisations across the world.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investigation-of-sars-cov-2-variants-technical-briefings"><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>’s most recent variant technical briefing</a> can be found on GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>Previous</h2>

<h3>Friday 22 October 2021</h3>

<h3>Delta sub-lineage AY.4.2 designated as a variant under investigation  by UK Health Security Agency</h3>

<p>The Delta variant sub-lineage known as Delta AY.4.2 was designated a variant under investigation (<abbr title="variant under investigation">VUI</abbr>) by the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) on 20 October 2021 and has been given the official name <abbr title="variant under investigation">VUI</abbr>-21OCT-01.</p>

<p>The designation was made on the basis that this sub-lineage has become increasingly common in the UK in recent months, and there is some early evidence that it may have an increased growth rate in the UK compared to Delta. More evidence is needed to know whether this is due to changes in the virus’ behaviour or to epidemiological conditions.</p>

<p>The genome of <abbr title="variant under investigation">VUI</abbr>-21OCT-01 does not have many mutations compared to Delta. However, a small change may be enough to cause a difference in the virus properties in some circumstances. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is monitoring this closely.</p>

<p>The original Delta variant remains overwhelmingly dominant in the UK, making up approximately 99.8% of all cases. As of 20 October, there were 15,120 cases of <abbr title="variant under investigation">VUI</abbr>-21OCT-01 confirmed by whole genome sequences in England since it was first detected in July. In the last week, <abbr title="variant under investigation">VUI</abbr>-21OCT-01 accounted for approximately 6% of all Delta cases. Cases have been confirmed through whole genome sequencing in all 9 regions of England.</p>

<p>While evidence is still emerging, so far it does not appear this variant causes more severe disease or renders the vaccines currently deployed any less effective. As is routine for any new variants under investigation, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>&nbsp;is carrying out laboratory and epidemiological investigations to better understand the properties of this variant.</p>

<p>Dr Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Viruses mutate often and at random, and it is not unexpected that new variants will continue to arise as the pandemic goes on, particularly while the case rate remains high. It is testament to the diligence and scientific expertise of my colleagues at <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, and the genomic sequencing capacity developed through the pandemic, that this new variant has been identified and analysed so quickly. However, it should serve as objective evidence that this pandemic is not over.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The public health advice is the same for all current variants. Get vaccinated and, for those eligible, come forward for your third or booster dose as appropriate as soon as you are called. Continue to exercise caution. Wear a mask in crowded spaces and, when meeting people indoors, open windows and doors to ventilate the room. If you have symptoms take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test and isolate at home until you receive a negative result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> continues to examine all available data relating to SARS-CoV-2 variants in the UK and abroad. We constantly assess the genetic diversity within the known variants of concern (<abbr title="variants of concern">VOCs</abbr>) to inform our ongoing public health response to the pandemic. New sub-lineages within Delta continue to be identified. This is to be expected and <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is monitoring the situation closely.</p>

<h3>Friday 1 October 2021</h3>
