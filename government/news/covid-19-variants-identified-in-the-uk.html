<h3>A further 2 cases of Omicron variant confirmed</h3>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has identified 2 further cases of COVID-19 with mutations consistent with B.1.1.529 in England, in addition to the previous 3 confirmed cases of the SARS-CoV-2 variant known as B.1.1.529 on 27 and 28 November. The total number of confirmed cases in England is now 5.</p>

<p>The individuals that have tested positive are not connected to each other and are not linked to the previously confirmed cases. Both have links to travel to Southern Africa. One case is located in Camden, London, and one case is located in Wandsworth, London. The individuals and their households have been told to self-isolate. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is carrying out targeted testing at locations where the positive cases were likely to be infectious.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.scot/news/omicron-variant/">Six cases of the SARS-CoV-2 variant known as B.1.1.529</a> have also been identified in Scotland, with 4 cases in the Lanarkshire area and 2 in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area.</p>

<p>Dr Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are continuing our efforts to understand the effect of this variant on transmissibility, severe disease, mortality, antibody response and vaccine efficacy.</p>

  <p>Vaccination is critical to help us bolster our defences against this new variant – please get your first, second or booster jab without delay.</p>

  <p>The guidance on vaccination is changing to help all of us bolster our defences in the face of this new variant. Everyone should complete a primary course as soon as possible – for most this will be a first and second dose. For some more vulnerable a third dose is available.</p>

  <p>Following the change in JCVI advice today, a booster dose for everyone over 18 years is now recommended and will be available at a minimum of 3 months from your last primary course jab. Please take up this offer as soon as you are eligible to protect yourself, your families and your communities.</p>

  <p>It is very likely that we will find more cases over the coming days as we are seeing in other countries globally and as we increase case detection through focused contact tracing. That’s why it’s critical that anyone with COVID-19 symptoms isolates and gets a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test immediately.</p>

  <p class="last-child"><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is acting to get scientific information available as quickly as possible in order to inform the right balance of interventions to prevent transmission and protect lives. This will include analysing live samples of the new variant in our laboratories to investigate properties such as response to current vaccines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As viruses mutate often and at random, it is not unusual for small numbers of cases to arise featuring new sets of mutations. Any variants showing evidence of spread are rapidly assessed.</p>

<h3>Sunday 28 November 2021</h3>

<h3>A further case of Omicron variant confirmed</h3>

<p>Following the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-uk-cases-of-omicron-variant-identified">first 2 confirmed cases</a> of the SARS-CoV-2 variant known as B.1.1.529 on 27 November, the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has identified one further case of COVID-19 with mutations consistent with B.1.1.529 in the UK.</p>

<p>The individual tested positive after travel to the UK and is linked to travel to Southern Africa. The individual is no longer in the UK, but <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is carrying out targeted testing at locations where the positive case visited when they were likely to have been infectious. While in the UK, the individual was in Westminster, London.</p>

<p>Dr Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our advanced sequencing capabilities enable us to find variants and take rapid action to limit onward spread. It is very likely that we will find more cases over the coming days as we are seeing in other countries globally and as we increase case detection through focussed contact tracing.</p>

  <p>We are continuing our efforts to understand the effect of this variant on transmissibility, severe disease, mortality, antibody response and vaccine efficacy.</p>

  <p>It’s critical that anyone with COVID-19 symptoms isolates and gets a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test immediately.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Vaccination is critical to help us bolster our defences against this new variant – please get your first, second or booster jab without delay. Wear a mask in crowded places, including public transport and shops, to ensure we all help break the chains of transmission and slow the spread of this new variant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> designated variant B.1.1.529 as a variant under investigation (<abbr title="variant under investigation">VUI</abbr>) on Thursday 25 November.&nbsp; It was designated a  variant of concern (<abbr title="variant of concern">VOC</abbr>) on Saturday 27 November.</p>

<p>The B.1.1.529&nbsp;variant includes a large number of spike protein mutations as well as mutations in other parts of the viral genome. These are potentially biologically significant mutations which may change the behaviour of the virus with regards to vaccines, treatments and transmissibility.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, in partnership with scientific bodies across the globe, is constantly monitoring the status of SARS-CoV-2 variants as they emerge and develop worldwide. We are particularly grateful to health protection specialists and the government of South Africa for early sharing of local information on the omicron variant in an exemplary way to support global health security.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is acting to get scientific information available as quickly as possible in order to inform the right balance of interventions to prevent transmission and protect lives. This will include analysing live samples of the new variant in our laboratories to investigate properties such as response to current vaccines.</p>

<p>As viruses mutate often and at random, it is not unusual for small numbers of cases to arise featuring new sets of mutations. Any variants showing evidence of spread are rapidly assessed.</p>

<h3>Friday 26 November 2021</h3>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has announced the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant known as B.1.1.529 as a variant under investigation (<abbr title="variant under investigation">VUI</abbr>).</p>

<p>The first genomes of this variant were uploaded to the international GISAID database on 22 November. Genomes have now been uploaded from South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong but the extent of spread is not yet determined. No cases have been identified in the UK.</p>

<p>B.1.1.529 has a large number of mutations in the gene coding for the spike protein, and also in other parts of the viral genome.&nbsp; These are potentially biologically significant mutations which may change the behaviour of the virus with regards to immune escape, transmissibility or susceptibility to treatments, but this has not been proven. More investigation is required to fully determine the extent of these mutations’ impact.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is monitoring the situation closely, in partnership with scientific and public health organisations across the world.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investigation-of-sars-cov-2-variants-technical-briefings"><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>’s most recent variant technical briefing</a> can be found on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>Friday 22 October 2021</h3>

<h3>Delta sub-lineage AY.4.2 designated as a variant under investigation  by UK Health Security Agency</h3>

<p>The Delta variant sub-lineage known as Delta AY.4.2 was designated a variant under investigation (<abbr title="variant under investigation">VUI</abbr>) by the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) on 20 October 2021 and has been given the official name <abbr title="variant under investigation">VUI</abbr>-21OCT-01.</p>

<p>The designation was made on the basis that this sub-lineage has become increasingly common in the UK in recent months, and there is some early evidence that it may have an increased growth rate in the UK compared to Delta. More evidence is needed to know whether this is due to changes in the virus’ behaviour or to epidemiological conditions.</p>

<p>The genome of <abbr title="variant under investigation">VUI</abbr>-21OCT-01 does not have many mutations compared to Delta. However, a small change may be enough to cause a difference in the virus properties in some circumstances. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is monitoring this closely.</p>

<p>The original Delta variant remains overwhelmingly dominant in the UK, making up approximately 99.8% of all cases. As of 20 October, there were 15,120 cases of <abbr title="variant under investigation">VUI</abbr>-21OCT-01 confirmed by whole genome sequences in England since it was first detected in July. In the last week, <abbr title="variant under investigation">VUI</abbr>-21OCT-01 accounted for approximately 6% of all Delta cases. Cases have been confirmed through whole genome sequencing in all 9 regions of England.</p>

<p>While evidence is still emerging, so far it does not appear this variant causes more severe disease or renders the vaccines currently deployed any less effective. As is routine for any new variants under investigation, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>&nbsp;is carrying out laboratory and epidemiological investigations to better understand the properties of this variant.</p>

<p>Dr Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Viruses mutate often and at random, and it is not unexpected that new variants will continue to arise as the pandemic goes on, particularly while the case rate remains high. It is testament to the diligence and scientific expertise of my colleagues at <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, and the genomic sequencing capacity developed through the pandemic, that this new variant has been identified and analysed so quickly. However, it should serve as objective evidence that this pandemic is not over.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The public health advice is the same for all current variants. Get vaccinated and, for those eligible, come forward for your third or booster dose as appropriate as soon as you are called. Continue to exercise caution. Wear a mask in crowded spaces and, when meeting people indoors, open windows and doors to ventilate the room. If you have symptoms take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test and isolate at home until you receive a negative result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> continues to examine all available data relating to SARS-CoV-2 variants in the UK and abroad. We constantly assess the genetic diversity within the known variants of concern (<abbr title="variants of concern">VOCs</abbr>) to inform our ongoing public health response to the pandemic. New sub-lineages within Delta continue to be identified. This is to be expected and <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is monitoring the situation closely.</p>
