          <h2>Latest update</h2>

<h3>
<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> publishes updated Omicron hospitalisation and vaccine efficacy analysis</h3>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has published the latest <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investigation-of-sars-cov-2-variants-technical-briefings">variant technical briefing</a>. It contains updated analysis on Omicron hospitalisation risk, vaccine efficacy against symptomatic disease from Omicron, and the COVID-19 reinfection rate.</p>

<p>As of 20 December,&nbsp;132&nbsp;individuals with confirmed Omicron have been admitted to or transferred from emergency departments. Over 40% of hospital admissions were in London. Of those patients admitted to hospital,&nbsp;17&nbsp;had received a booster vaccine, 74 people had 2 doses and 27 people were not vaccinated. The vaccination status was unknown for 6 people, while 8 had received a single dose. Fourteen people are reported to have died within 28 days of an Omicron diagnosis, ranging in age from 52 to 96 years old.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> analysis shows that the risk of hospital admission for an identified case with Omicron is reduced compared to a case of Delta. This analysis excludes individuals with confirmed previous COVID-19 infection. An individual with Omicron is estimated to be between 31 and 45% less likely to attend A&amp;E compared to Delta, and 50 to 70% less likely to be admitted to hospital. This analysis is preliminary and highly uncertain because of the small numbers of Omicron cases currently in hospital, inability to effectively measure all previous infections and the limited spread of Omicron into older age groups. This is consistent with analysis published yesterday by Imperial College London and the University of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The population rate of people becoming infected with Omicron after having previously contracted COVID-19 has increased sharply. Of those with Omicron, 9.5% have had COVID-19 before, which is likely to be a substantial underestimate of the proportion of reinfections, as many prior infections will have been asymptomatic and not picked up by the analysis.</p>

<p>Vaccine efficacy analysis continues to show lower effectiveness for symptomatic Omicron disease. There is evidence that protection against symptomatic disease wanes after the second dose of vaccine, and then improves after the booster. But the latest data suggests this extra protection starts to wane more rapidly, being about 15 to 25% lower from 10 weeks after the booster dose. There are insufficient severe cases of Omicron&nbsp;as yet&nbsp;to analyse vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation, but this is more likely to be sustained, particularly after a booster.</p>

<p>Omicron continues to grow faster than Delta, with an increased risk of transmission, particularly in contacts outside of the household. Therefore, although early suggestions are that individuals may be less likely to require hospitalisation, many more people are likely to become infected. Even if a smaller proportion of these individuals require hospitalisation, these are still large numbers of people requiring hospital care and pressures on the NHS will increase. It is therefore vital that people continue to exercise caution in order to limit the transmission of the virus.</p>

<p>Dr Jenny Harries, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> Chief Executive, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our latest analysis shows an encouraging early signal that people who contract the Omicron variant may be at a relatively lower risk of hospitalisation than those who contract other variants. However, it should be noted both that this is early data and more research is required to confirm these findings.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Cases are currently very high in the UK, and even a relatively low proportion requiring hospitalisation could result in a significant number of people becoming seriously ill. The best way that you can protect yourself is to come forward for your first 2 doses of vaccine, or your booster jab and do everything you can to stop onward transmission of the infection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This new <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> data on Omicron is promising – while 2 doses of the vaccine aren’t enough, we know boosters offer significant protection against the variant and early evidence suggests this strain may be less severe than Delta.</p>

  <p>However, cases of the variant continue to rise at an extraordinary rate – already surpassing the record daily number in the pandemic. Hospital admissions are increasing, and we cannot risk the NHS being overwhelmed.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This is early-stage analysis and we continue to monitor the data hour by hour. It is still too early to determine next steps, so please stay cautious this Christmas and get your booster as soon as possible to protect yourself and your loved ones.</p>

<h3>Friday 17 December</h3>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has published the latest <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investigation-of-sars-cov-2-variants-technical-briefings">Variant Technical Briefing</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> has performed an initial laboratory evaluation of the current lateral flow devices (<abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFDs</abbr>) for COVID-19 in current use in the UK. Initial data suggests that <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFDs</abbr> are as likely to detect Omicron as other variants including Delta, which has been the dominant variant in the UK from May to December 2021.</p>

<p>Of 5,153 individuals identified with an Omicron infection between 1 November and 11 December 2021, 305 were linked to a previous confirmed infection and had an interval from the previous positive test of 90 days or more. The data so far suggests an increase in overall reinfection rates, alongside an increase in first infections.</p>

<p>Dr Jenny Harries, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> Chief Executive, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our data shows that <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests are similarly able to detect COVID-19 in individuals who have been exposed to Omicron as in those exposed to previous variants. This is very encouraging. As we all work to limit the high levels of transmission of this variant over the Christmas period, we are urging people to test regularly, particularly before attending social gatherings.</p>

  <p class="last-child">As always, the booster vaccine remains the best protection against infection. Please come forward to receive your booster as soon as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Monday 13 December</h3>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) can confirm that 10 people have been hospitalised with the Omicron variant in England; the individuals were diagnosed on or before admission. These people are spread around the country and are a mix of age ranges between 18 to 85 years – the majority had received 2 doses of vaccination.</p>

<p>One individual diagnosed in hospital has sadly died.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser at <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hospitalisations always lag a few weeks behind infections, therefore it isn’t surprising that we have started to see people being admitted to hospital with the Omicron variant.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Our data shows that getting the booster vaccine is more effective against this variant than 2 doses alone. Everyone over 18 is now able to walk into a vaccine centre, so do not hesitate to get yours.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Friday 10 December</h3>

<p>The latest variant technical briefing suggests that Omicron continues to grow rapidly in all regions of England as measured by confirmed cases and S gene target failure (<abbr title="S gene target failure">SGTF</abbr>). None of the cases to date is known to have been hospitalised or died.</p>

<p>Studies of contacts show that Omicron is transmitting more effectively than Delta. The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) estimates that if Omicron continues to grow at the present rate, the variant&nbsp;will become the dominant strain, accounting for more than 50% of all COVID-19 infections in the UK by mid-December. It is projected that if current trends continue unchanged, the UK will exceed one million infections a day by the end of this month.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investigation-of-sars-cov-2-variants-technical-briefings">technical briefing</a> also includes early analysis of vaccine effectiveness against the Omicron variant compared to Delta.</p>

<p>The analysis looked at 581 people with confirmed Omicron. It showed that the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines provided much lower levels of protection against symptomatic infection compared to the protection that they provide against Delta. However, the preliminary data showed effectiveness against the new variant appears to increase considerably in the early period after a booster dose, providing around 70% to 75% protection against symptomatic infection.</p>

<p>The analysis included very small numbers of cases as only a few people in the UK currently have this variant, meaning <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investigation-of-sars-cov-2-variants-technical-briefings">this data should be interpreted with caution</a> until more cases have been studied. Due to the early nature of the findings, all estimates are subject to significant uncertainty and are subject to change. The early observations for 2 doses of AstraZeneca&nbsp; are particularly likely to be unreliable as they are based on small numbers and are likely to reflect an older population and a population with more co-morbidities than those given the Pfizer vaccine.</p>

<p>There are differences in the populations that have received different vaccines. AstraZeneca was the main vaccine used early in the programme in care homes and among those in clinical risk groups. These groups have been prioritised for booster doses since the start of the rollout in September to increase their protection. The percentage of people to have received a booster dose will also already be higher in older age groups and those with underlying health conditions due to prioritisation of the rollout so far.</p>

<p>Vaccine effectiveness against severe disease from Omicron is not yet known but is expected to be significantly higher than protection against symptomatic disease. Data on this won’t be available for several weeks.</p>

<p>It is vital that everyone over the age of 40 who is eligible for a booster jab comes forward as soon as possible to get increased protection against this new variant. Those aged 18 to 39 should wait to be called.</p>

<p>Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These early estimates should be treated with caution but they indicate that a few months after the second jab, there is a greater risk of catching the Omicron variant compared to Delta strain.</p>

  <p>The data suggests this risk is significantly reduced following a booster vaccine, so I urge everyone to take up their booster when eligible. We expect the vaccines to show higher protection against the serious complications of COVID-19, so if you haven’t yet had your first 2 doses please book an appointment straight away.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Working from home where possible, consistently wearing masks in crowded or enclosed spaces, washing your hands regularly and isolating and getting tested if you feel unwell are also vitally important in reducing the impact of COVID-19 this winter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> has also published a breakdown of confirmed Omicron cases and <abbr title="S gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> cases by local authority. The most affected local authorities are West Northamptonshire, where there are 49 confirmed cases and 68 <abbr title="S gene target failure">SGTF</abbr>, and Manchester, where there are 7 confirmed cases and 61 <abbr title="S gene target failure">SGTF</abbr>.</p>

<p>Evidence continues to show that Omicron is transmitting more rapidly than the dominant Delta variant. Studies&nbsp;of households and contacts&nbsp;have found that there is a higher risk of transmission to contacts from an Omicron case, when compared to Delta.</p>

<p>Dr Jenny Harries, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> Chief Executive, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once again, we urge everyone who is able to get a booster jab to come forward and do so. It is the best defence we have against this highly transmissible new variant.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It is also absolutely critical that we all do what we can to reduce transmission in the community so that we have time to administer as many booster doses as possible. Please make sure you follow all the available guidance. Work from home if you are able to, wear a mask indoors around other people, and ventilate indoor spaces well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sajid Javid, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today’s new data shows how important booster jabs are to protect us against this variant.</p>

  <p class="last-child">They are our best defence and we have turbocharged our rollout programme inviting 7 million more people over the age of 40 to get their booster jab so even more people get protection from this disease. I urge you to come forward as soon as you’re eligible to help keep yourself and your loved ones safe.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Wednesday 8 December</h3>

<h3>
<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> publishes update on Omicron risk assessment, S gene target failure and local case numbers</h3>

<p>The assessment suggests that Omicron is displaying a significant growth advantage over Delta, meaning that it is likely to outcompete Delta in the UK and become the dominant variant.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investigation-of-sars-cov-2-variants-of-concern-variant-risk-assessments">This assessment is based on analysis of UK data</a> showing increased household transmission risk, increased secondary attack rates (such as the chance of each case infecting another individual) and increased growth rates compared to Delta.</p>

<p>If the growth rate and doubling time continue at the rate we have seen in the last 2 weeks, we expect to see at least 50% of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases to be caused by Omicron variant in the next 2 to 4 weeks.</p>

<p>The risk assessment also suggests that Omicron displays a reduction in protection offered by having had a previous infection or vaccination. Whilst there are insufficient data to quantify either vaccine effectiveness or risk of reinfection in the UK exactly, the observed growth, case distribution and early analyses in both South Africa  and the UK are consistent with some loss of immune protection against infection. New studies are being undertaken to assess this further.</p>

<p>There is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investigation-of-sars-cov-2-variants-technical-briefings">insufficient data to make any assessment</a> of protection against severe disease, or to assess the severity of illness caused by Omicron. Further studies are underway in the UK and abroad.</p>

<p>In addition, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> has published data which shows the detection of cases exhibiting S-gene target failure (<abbr title="S gene target failure">SGTF</abbr>) in recent weeks across the country. Approximately half of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests in the UK are able to detect <abbr title="S gene target failure">SGTF</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="S gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> is a useful indicator of the presence of Omicron, because as a rule Delta cases have the S-gene and Omicron cases do not. However, it is not confirmatory as there are a number of other reasons that a sample might exhibit <abbr title="S gene target failure">SGTF</abbr>. For example, there are still a small number of cases of other variants, such as Alpha, in the UK which would also result in S-gene dropout or there is a lower amount of virus present in the sample where S-gene dropout cannot be confirmed.</p>

<p>Positive tests with sufficient virus detected from people arriving in the UK are sent for confirmation through Whole Genome Sequencing, regardless of the presence or absence of <abbr title="S gene target failure">SGTF</abbr>.</p>

<p>As part of <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>’s routine genomic surveillance, approximately 15 to 20% of all positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests are also sent for sequencing.</p>

<p>Until the week beginning 23 November 2021, the weekly count of cases with <abbr title="S gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> was routinely less than 150, making up less than 0.1% of all cases. Analyses of sequenced <abbr title="S gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> samples has indicated that until mid-November, more than 99% of these were Delta cases.</p>

<p>In the most recent week of data (specimen dates from 30 November 2021 reported as of 6 December), the number of cases with <abbr title="S gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> has increased to 705. The majority of these cases are located in London and the South East.</p>

<p>Trends in <abbr title="S gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> over and time are however affected by the coverage of laboratories contributing to this surveillance data.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> Chief Medical Advisor, Dr Susan Hopkins said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is increasingly evident that Omicron is highly infectious and there is emerging laboratory and early clinical evidence to suggest that both vaccine-acquired and naturally acquired immunity against infection is reduced for this variant. It is therefore absolutely critical that we all do everything that we can to help break the chains of transmission and slow the spread of this new variant.</p>

  <p>Vaccination is critical to help us bolster our defences against becoming severely ill from this new variant – please get your first, second, third or booster jab without delay. Please also make sure to follow all Government guidance to reduce the spread of infection.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It remains vital that anyone with COVID-19 symptoms isolates and gets a&nbsp;<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>&nbsp;test immediately.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Saturday 4 December</h3>

<p>The latest number of COVID-19 cases with mutations consistent with B.1.1.529 in England are published on <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>’s <a rel="external" href="https://twitter.com/UKHSA?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">social media channels</a>.</p>

<p>Further information is also available in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investigation-of-sars-cov-2-variants-technical-briefings">latest variant technical briefing</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is gathering scientific information as quickly as possible in order to inform the right balance of interventions to prevent transmission and protect lives. This includes analysing live samples of the new variant in our laboratories to investigate properties such as response to current vaccines.</p>

<p>Where individuals&nbsp;are suspected or confirmed to have the&nbsp;Omicron variant&nbsp;as the result of testing, their close contacts will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace, required to self-isolate and asked to take a&nbsp;<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>&nbsp;test,&nbsp;regardless of whether they have been vaccinated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyone who is contacted because of a link to a probable or possible Omicron case will be asked to take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, even if they have received a positive COVID-19&nbsp;<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>&nbsp;test&nbsp;within the last 90 days.</p>

<p>Dr Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of&nbsp;<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are continuing our efforts to understand the effect of this variant on transmissibility, severe disease, mortality, antibody response and vaccine efficacy.</p>

  <p>Vaccination is critical to help us bolster our defences against this new variant – please get your first, second, third or booster jab without delay.</p>

  <p>A booster dose for everyone over 18 years is now recommended and will be available at a minimum of 3 months from your last primary course jab. Please take up this offer as soon as you are eligible to protect yourself, your families and your communities.</p>

  <p>Please make sure to wear a mask in line with government guidance, including on public transport and in shops, to help break the chains of transmission and slow the spread of this new variant.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It’s critical that anyone with COVID-19 symptoms isolates and gets a&nbsp;<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>&nbsp;test immediately.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Friday 3 December</h3>

<h3>A further 75 cases of Omicron variant confirmed</h3>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has identified 75 further cases of COVID-19 with mutations consistent with B.1.1.529 in England, in addition to the previous 29 confirmed cases of the SARS-CoV-2 variant known as B.1.1.529.</p>

<p>The total number of confirmed cases in England is now 104.</p>

<p>The individuals who have tested positive and their contacts have been asked to self-isolate. Work is underway to identify any links to travel. We have now identified cases in the East Midlands, East of England, London, North East, North West, South East, South West and West Midlands.&nbsp;<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>&nbsp;is carrying out targeted testing at locations where the positive cases were likely to be infectious.</p>

<p>1 case has been identified in Wales. A further 16 cases have been identified in Scotland, bringing the total in Scotland to 29. There are no confirmed cases in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Dr Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of&nbsp;<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Increased case detection through focused contact tracing has led to more cases of the Omicron variant being identified and confirmed, as we have seen in other countries globally.</p>

  <p>We are continuing to monitor the data closely. Teams nationally and locally are working at pace to identify and trace all close contacts of every Omicron case. It is critical that anyone with COVID-19 symptoms isolates and gets a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test immediately.</p>

  <p>We have started to see cases where there are no links to travel, suggesting that we have a small amount of community transmission. That’s why it’s so important that everybody, everywhere, takes simple steps to protect themselves from infection.&nbsp; Please wear face coverings in line with government guidance, let in fresh air when mixing indoors and wash your hands regularly.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Vaccination is critical to help us bolster our defences against this new variant so please get your first, second, third or booster jab as soon as you are eligible to protect yourself, your families and your communities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where individuals are identified as being a possible or probable case of Omicron, their close contacts will be contacted and advised they are required to isolate for 10 days, regardless of whether they have been vaccinated or received a negative COVID-19 test result. Everybody who is contacted or has symptoms should take a&nbsp;<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>&nbsp;test as soon as possible, even if they have received a positive COVID-19&nbsp;<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>&nbsp;test within the last 90 days.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>&nbsp;is acting to get scientific information available as quickly as possible in order to inform the right balance of interventions to prevent transmission and protect lives. This will include analysing live samples of the new variant in our laboratories to investigate properties including its response to current vaccines.</p>

<p>As viruses mutate often and at random, it is not unusual for small numbers of cases to arise featuring new sets of mutations. Any variants showing evidence of spread are rapidly assessed.</p>

<h3>Friday 3 December</h3>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has published a new variant technical briefing describing ongoing work on the Omicron variant. It includes a complete list of studies planned and already under way into the emerging variant. A&nbsp;new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investigation-of-sars-cov-2-variants-of-concern-variant-risk-assessments">risk assessment for Omicron&nbsp;<abbr title="variant of concern">VOC</abbr>-21NOV-01 (B.1.1.529)&nbsp;has also been published and is available here</a>.</p>

<p>Delta remains the predominant variant&nbsp;in England, accounting for over 99% of all COVID-19 cases. As of 30 November 2021, there are 22 confirmed cases of Omicron (B.1.1.529), identified through sequencing or genotyping in England. None of these cases are known to have been hospitalised or died. More recent <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/covid-19-variants-identified-in-the-uk">data on Omicron cases is published regularly here</a>.</p>

<p>Available data are limited at this early stage, but it remains likely that the cases identified so far are a result of a number of separate introductions into the country.</p>

<p>Omicron has a deletion at&nbsp;position&nbsp;69/70&nbsp;of the spike protein&nbsp;which allows it to be tracked through S gene target failure&nbsp;(<abbr title="S gene target failure">SGTF</abbr>)&nbsp;in some <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests.&nbsp;Currently, approximately half of all tests conducted in the UK are able to detect <abbr title="S gene target failure">SGTF</abbr>. <abbr title="S gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> is not a 100% accurate test for Omicron and results are regularly evaluated against sequencing to ensure they are interpreted correctly. However, increases in <abbr title="S gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> can give a useful early indication of variant spread.</p>

<p>The proportion of test results displaying <abbr title="S gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> has been very low in recent months but an increase has been observed in the past week. This is still a very small number of cases but is being investigated carefully to understand whether it is related to travel, any other variant or whether there is evidence of spread of Omicron beginning in the community.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> Chief Executive, Jenny Harries said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to thank everyone who has been working globally and locally to help us act incredibly quickly in response to the Omicron variant. Thanks to very high levels of vaccine coverage we already have a robust wall of defence against COVID-19 as new variants emerge. We are working as fast as possible to gather more evidence about any impact the new variant may have on severity of disease or vaccine effectiveness. Until we have this evidence, we must exercise the highest level of caution in drawing conclusions about any significant risks to people’s health.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The most important thing everyone can do now is to get any vaccine dose that you are eligible for – it is by far the most effective action you can take to protect yourself, your families and your communities. It is also vital to continue with all the other precautions we have become used to throughout the pandemic – keep indoor areas well ventilated, wear a face covering in enclosed spaces, and take a rapid lateral flow (or <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) test before a situation where you may be at high risk of catching or passing on the virus.</p>

<h3>A further 7 cases of Omicron variant confirmed</h3>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has identified 7 further cases of COVID-19 with mutations consistent with B.1.1.529 in England, in addition to the previous 22 confirmed cases of the SARS-CoV-2 variant known as B.1.1.529.

<h4>A further case of Omicron variant confirmed</h4>

<p>Following the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-uk-cases-of-omicron-variant-identified">first 2 confirmed cases</a> of the SARS-CoV-2 variant known as B.1.1.529 on 27 November, the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has identified one further case of COVID-19 with mutations consistent with B.1.1.529 in the UK.</p>

<p>The individual tested positive after travel to the UK and is linked to travel to Southern Africa. The individual is no longer in the UK, but <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is carrying out targeted testing at locations where the positive case visited when they were likely to have been infectious. While in the UK, the individual was in Westminster, London.</p>

<p>Dr Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> designated variant B.1.1.529 as a variant under investigation (<abbr title="variant under investigation">VUI</abbr>) on Thursday 25 November.&nbsp; It was designated a  variant of concern (<abbr title="variant of concern">VOC</abbr>) on Saturday 27 November.</p>

<p>The B.1.1.529&nbsp;variant includes a large number of spike protein mutations as well as mutations in other parts of the viral genome. These are potentially biologically significant mutations which may change the behaviour of the virus with regards to vaccines, treatments and transmissibility.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, in partnership with scientific bodies across the globe, is constantly monitoring the status of SARS-CoV-2 variants as they emerge and develop worldwide. We are particularly grateful to health protection specialists and the government of South Africa for early sharing of local information on the omicron variant in an exemplary way to support global health security.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is acting to get scientific information available as quickly as possible in order to inform the right balance of interventions to prevent transmission and protect lives.

<h3>Friday 26 November 2021</h3>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has announced the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant known as B.1.1.529 as a variant under investigation (<abbr title="variant under investigation">VUI</abbr>).</p>

<p>The first genomes of this variant were uploaded to the international GISAID database on 22 November. Genomes have now been uploaded from South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong but the extent of spread is not yet determined. No cases have been identified in the UK.</p>

<p>B.1.1.529 has a large number of mutations in the gene coding for the spike protein, and also in other parts of the viral genome.&nbsp; These are potentially biologically significant mutations which may change the behaviour of the virus with regards to immune escape, transmissibility or susceptibility to treatments, but this has not been proven. More investigation is required to fully determine the extent of these mutations’ impact.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is monitoring the situation closely, in partnership with scientific and public health organisations across the world.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investigation-of-sars-cov-2-variants-technical-briefings"><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>’s most recent variant technical briefing</a> can be found on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>Friday 22 October 2021</h3>

<h4>Delta sub-lineage AY.4.2 designated as a variant under investigation  by UK Health Security Agency</h4>

<p>The Delta variant sub-lineage known as Delta AY.4.2 was designated a variant under investigation (<abbr title="variant under investigation">VUI</abbr>) by the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) on 20 October 2021 and has been given the official name <abbr title="variant under investigation">VUI</abbr>-21OCT-01.</p>

<p>The designation was made on the basis that this sub-lineage has become increasingly common in the UK in recent months, and there is some early evidence that it may have an increased growth rate in the UK compared to Delta. More evidence is needed to know whether this is due to changes in the virus’ behaviour or to epidemiological conditions.</p>

<p>The genome of <abbr title="variant under investigation">VUI</abbr>-21OCT-01 does not have many mutations compared to Delta. However, a small change may be enough to cause a difference in the virus properties in some circumstances. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is monitoring this closely.</p>

<p>The original Delta variant remains overwhelmingly dominant in the UK, making up approximately 99.8% of all cases. As of 20 October, there were 15,120 cases of <abbr title="variant under investigation">VUI</abbr>-21OCT-01 confirmed by whole genome sequences in England since it was first detected in July. In the last week, <abbr title="variant under investigation">VUI</abbr>-21OCT-01 accounted for approximately 6% of all Delta cases. Cases have been confirmed through whole genome sequencing in all 9 regions of England.</p>

<p>While evidence is still emerging, so far it does not appear this variant causes more severe disease or renders the vaccines currently deployed any less effective. As is routine for any new variants under investigation, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>&nbsp;is carrying out laboratory and epidemiological investigations to better understand the properties of this variant.</p>

<p>Dr Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Viruses mutate often and at random, and it is not unexpected that new variants will continue to arise as the pandemic goes on, particularly while the case rate remains high. It is testament to the diligence and scientific expertise of my colleagues at <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, and the genomic sequencing capacity developed through the pandemic, that this new variant has been identified and analysed so quickly. However, it should serve as objective evidence that this pandemic is not over.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The public health advice is the same for all current variants. Get vaccinated and, for those eligible, come forward for your third or booster dose as appropriate as soon as you are called. Continue to exercise caution. Wear a mask in crowded spaces and, when meeting people indoors, open windows and doors to ventilate the room. If you have symptoms take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test and isolate at home until you receive a negative result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> continues to examine all available data relating to SARS-CoV-2 variants in the UK and abroad. We constantly assess the genetic diversity within the known variants of concern (<abbr title="variants of concern">VOCs</abbr>) to inform our ongoing public health response to the pandemic. New sub-lineages within Delta continue to be identified. This is to be expected and <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is monitoring the situation closely.</p>
