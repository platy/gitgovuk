<ul>
  <li>almost 50 per cent rise in ex-offenders quickly finding jobs</li>
  <li>Greggs the latest household name to join drive – helping to cut reoffending</li>
  <li>more than half of prisons now benefit from business mentors, 1 year after launch</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>One year after Employment Advisory Boards were established - linking business bosses to prisons to provide advice on jobs skills - the number of former offenders in work 6 weeks after release has increased by nearly half.</p>

<p>In a further boost to the scheme, Greggs has become the latest household name to sign up – joining the likes of TalkTalk and Lotus Cars in helping governors to ensure that offenders are job-ready when they walk through the prison gate.</p>

<p>The government is now on track to roll out boards to all 91 ‘resettlement’ prisons by spring 2023, with 50 already up and running across England and Wales.</p>

<p>This will play a crucial role in tackling the £18 billion annual cost of reoffending and protecting the public, with ex-prisoners in steady employment being nine percentage points less likely to commit further crime.</p>

<p>Deputy Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, Dominic Raab said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re getting more offenders into work than ever before which is key to cutting crime and making our streets safer.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Along with our work to tackle addiction, improve education and maintain vital family ties, this will set ex-offenders on a sustainable path away from crime – helping to protect the public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Roisin Currie, Chief Executive, Greggs said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At Greggs, we believe that by not overlooking any potential employees because of their past, we can select the right person and develop them to their full potential.</p>

  <p>We’ve been working with people leaving prison for a number of years through our dedicated Fresh Start programme, and more recently have signed up to the Employment Advisory Board scheme to enable us to do even more.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The passion and energy for work that comes from people who are given an opportunity to kick-start their careers, or to turn their lives around is clear for all to see and as a business, we feel extremely motivated to do all we can to give these people a fresh start.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As part of the Prisons White Paper, published last December, the government has committed to investing £200 million per year on reducing reoffending by 2023, including on prison leaver employment schemes.</p>

<p>Employment Advisory Boards are just one area where rapid progress is being made in getting ex-offenders into work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>46 Employment Hubs - which mirror Job Centres in the community - have launched in prisons. Through the Hubs, prisoners can access career advice, get help with their CV and enquire about job adverts put up on noticeboards.</li>
  <li>71 Employment Leads have been appointed to manage jobs programmes in resettlement prisons, working with the Prison Service’s national team, the <a href="https://gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewfuturesnetwork.gov.uk%2F&amp;data=05%7C01%7CSLally%40no10.gov.uk%7Cef2003fbed0e4143db1e08da65877992%7C29c8cbb9d9af4c7eb28b470f15275e47%7C1%7C0%7C637933929773144092%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=6rWyIetWiNbii0sCNjSdt6KAId3ZtJd8IcJdA9A24AE%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="external">New Futures Network</a>. They act as a point of contact between the prison and employers and can put forward prisoners for interviews with employers with vacancies, based on their skills and experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ex-offenders are working in a host of areas including construction, retail, catering and manufacturing, which is helping prisoners turn their backs on crime and plug labour market gaps across firms of all sizes.</p>

<p>Greggs has seen huge benefits from employing prison leavers, with 120 taken on by the firm since 2012.</p>

<p>Polling commissioned by the Ministry of Justice found that over 90 percent of businesses who employ ex-offenders said they are reliable, good at their job, punctual and trustworthy.</p>
