<p>The UK government is committed to supporting communities across Northern Ireland to ensure that no community is left behind and to seek to build a more prospectus and stable future as we recover from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>A number of new funds were announced at Budget to help build local economic growth and strengthen communities across the whole of the United Kingdom (including Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland). Each of these funds has been designed to account for Northern Ireland’s unique place within the United Kingdom.</p>
