  <li>She will serve as the independent chair of a new advisory panel</li>
  <li>Panel’s work will inform a new public libraries strategy due in 2023</li>
</ul>

<p>Baroness Elizabeth Sanderson of Welton has been appointed by the Government to help develop a new strategy to make sure public libraries are providing the best possible service for their communities.</p>

<p>Libraries provide a vital service and the strategy will help establish ways in which they can improve to meet the needs of people in their area.</p>

<p>Baroness Sanderson is an experienced former journalist and government adviser who joined the Government benches in the House of Lords in 2019.</p>

<p>She has been appointed as the independent chair of a new advisory panel and will be expected to provide a fresh, challenging and impartial perspective on libraries to help formulate innovative new policy ideas.</p>

<p>Through the autumn and winter she will lead a number of sessions with the advisory panel of contributors who will be drawn from the library sector and beyond. Participants in the panel sessions will be confirmed in due course.</p>

<p>All sessions will be attended by representatives from Arts Council England, Libraries Connected, and the cross-party Local Government Association.</p>

<p>The sessions will help gather information to inspire a set of recommendations which will form part of a new government public libraries strategy for 2023, succeeding the previous <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/libraries-deliver-ambition-for-public-libraries-in-england-2016-to-2021">strategy</a> which came into force in 2016.</p>

<p>Input into the development of the recommendations will also come from the British Library, local authority library services and community-managed libraries, as well as other government departments, to bring in a wide range of views and insights.</p>

<p>Libraries Minister Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Libraries have a unique and precious role in communities across the country — something which was thrown into relief during the pandemic. As we bounce back from that, we want to make sure we are drawing on a wide range of expertise and best practice to give them the support they need to keep serving the public so well.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Baroness Sanderson and the panel of expert and outside voices will help us achieve this and I look forward to seeing the recommendations they put forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Baroness Sanderson said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m thrilled to be taking up this new role. Libraries play such an important part in our lives, be that instilling a love of reading in childhood or encouraging economic, social and mental wellbeing throughout adulthood and into old age.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Too often undervalued, they are one of the most critical forms of social infrastructure we have and I look forward to working alongside the experts, and listening to a wide range of voices, so that we may help develop ideas as to how we may promote and protect our libraries into the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notes to editors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The role is unpaid.</li>
  <li>Participants in the advisory panel sessions will be confirmed in due course.</li>
  <li>While responsibility for managing library services sits with local authorities, the Government has a duty to ensure councils are meeting their statutory duty to provide a comprehensive and efficient library service, as well as providing support to councils looking for ways to improve their service.</li>
  <li>
    <p>DCMS funds Arts Council England, which is the national development agency for public libraries. ACE is delivering the Government’s £20.5 million Libraries Improvement Fund, which will transform library services in England by helping them upgrade their buildings and improve digital infrastructure. Awards made through the scheme this year include £495,000 for the Sandwell Library and Information Service in the West Midlands and Sheffield Libraries which was given £340,000.</p>
