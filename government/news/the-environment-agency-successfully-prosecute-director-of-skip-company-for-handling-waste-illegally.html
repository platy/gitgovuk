  <li>Mr Connell, director of CK Waste limited, failed to operate within their permit and managed waste without a set of procedures that identified and minimised risk of pollution.</li>
  <li>Mr Connell appeared at court on Friday 7th January 2022 where he was sentenced to 22 weeks, imprisonment suspended for 12 months, ordered to pay costs of £8,132.45 and a victim surcharge of £115. Mr Connell was also&nbsp;disqualified from being a director of a company for 3 years</li>
</ul>

<p>The Environment Agency has successfully prosecuted Mr Connell an Oldham based man, for the illegal storage and treatment of approximately 6,000 cubic metres of waste, equivalent of roughly 12,000 standard 6x4 trailers, on an industrial estate on the outskirts of Manchester.</p>

<p>The case was brought against Mr Connell, director of CK Waste Limited, when he allowed an environmental offence to occur. The site failed to operate within their permit and managed waste without a set of procedures that identified and minimised risk of pollution and was therefore handling waste illegally.</p>

<p>Mr Connell was also issued with an enforcement notice as excessive piled waste posed a serious fire risk after being stored for too long. Following the issue of the enforcement notice, Mr Connell failed to take steps to reduce the piled waste on site and failed to provide a fire prevention plan.</p>

<p>Mr Connell was sentenced to 22 weeks, imprisonment suspended for 12 months, ordered to pay costs of £8,132.45 and a victim surcharge of £115. Mr Connell was also&nbsp;disqualified from being a director of a company for 3 years</p>

<h3>
An Environment Agency spokesperson said:</h3>

<p>“The Environment Agency welcome the result of this prosecution for the offences committed by Mr Connell, director of CK Waste Limited. Mr Connell was offered extensive advice and guidance from Environment Agency officers but despite this, failed to take steps to reduce piled waste at the site in Dukinfield, Manchester.</p>

<p>“We all create waste, and we all have a responsibility to ensure our waste is handled correctly. This prosecution sends out a strong signal to others that we will continue to fight tirelessly to combat illegal waste crime and bring those responsible to justice. Businesses and householders also need to do everything possible to ensure that waste doesn’t end up in the hands of operators who break the law by checking the online register <a rel="external" href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fenvironment.data.gov.uk%2Fpublic-register%2Fview%2Fsearch-waste-carriers-brokers&amp;data=04%7C01%7CCharlotte.Barlow%40environment-agency.gov.uk%7C8139654a1ce34dfd307d08d9d127c9ee%7C770a245002274c6290c74e38537f1102%7C0%7C0%7C637770791079969393%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=UKVMhH6M1ky%2BU1exMwSAsk6GJEVZLXFxZ0jkRgo2Aeg%3D&amp;reserved=0">Waste carriers, brokers and dealers (data.gov.uk)</a>”</p>
