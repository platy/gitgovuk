        <p>The Lord Chancellor, the Rt Hon Robert Buckland QC, has appointed Sir Ashley Fox to be the first chair of the Independent Monitoring Authority for the Citizens’ Rights Agreements (IMA) for a tenure of 4 years. His appointment commenced on 8 December 2020 and run until 7 December 2024.</p>

<p>Sir Ashley’s appointment follows a Justice Select Committee pre-appointment hearing on 24 November and the publication of the Committee’s report into the same on 3 December. The Lord Chancellor and Sir Ashley have noted the report’s contents and recommendations.</p>

<p>The Lord Chancellor has also made the following Non-Executive Member Appointments.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Punam Birly has been appointed as non-executive member of the IMA for a 2 year tenure;</li>
  <li>Marcus Killick has been appointed as non-executive member with knowledge about conditions in Gibraltar relating to citizens’ rights for a 3 year tenure; and</li>
  <li>Leo O’Reilly has been appointed as non-executive member with knowledge about conditions in Northern Ireland relating to citizens’ rights for a 3 year tenure.</li>
</ul>

<p>The appointees all commenced their tenure on 8 December 2020.</p>

<p>Non-executive appointments to the IMA are not currently regulated by the Commissioner for Public Appointments.</p>

<p>However, the Chair and Members have been appointed following fair and open competitions run in line with the process set out in the Governance Code on Public Appointments.</p>

<p>Further campaigns are currently underway to appoint a member with knowledge of the conditions in Scotland relating to the rights of citizens under the EU Withdrawal Agreement and EEA EFTA Separation Agreement, and a member with knowledge of the conditions in Wales relating to those rights, with the appointments expected to be announced by the end of January and the end of February 2021, respectively.</p>

<h3 id="independent-monitoring-authority-for-the-citizens-rights-agreements">Independent Monitoring Authority for the Citizens’ Rights Agreements</h3>

<p>The IMA is a brand-new public body, which has been established under the <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/1/contents/enacted">EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 (EUWAA)</a>. The IMA needs to be operational by the end of 2020. The chair of the IMA will play a crucial role in establishing the IMA’s early direction and effectiveness, and in winning the confidence of its stakeholders.</p>

<p>Under the provisions set out in EUWAA, the IMA will have the power to receive complaints, launch inquiries and initiate legal proceedings. The IMA will also have a role in reviewing the effectiveness of the citizens’ rights legislative framework, for instance by reviewing draft legislation. The legislation also provides that it is important for the IMA to focus on general or systemic failures in the implementation of the citizens’ rights agreements, as well as receiving and investigating individual complaints. The IMA will have to publish guidance on how it will exercise its functions.</p>
