  <li>Ten innovative schemes from across the UK have won government funding to look at new ways of using location-based data to help people in their everyday lives</li>
  <li>One project will look at ways to use crowdsourced information to create indoor maps to help people find their way around public buildings, such as universities and hospitals</li>
  <li>Other winners will create a UK database of trees and map the safest routes for cyclists to take through cities</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>New systems designed to highlight the safest roads for cyclists to use in busy cities, create a database of all the UK’s trees, and launch an indoor mapping system to help people find their way around public buildings, could soon be created thanks to a government competition designed to find new ways to use data.</p>

<p>In November, the Minister for Implementation, Oliver Dowden, announced a £1.5 million competition to help organisations find innovative ways to use crowdsourcing and location-based data.</p>

<p>Among the 10 winners are schemes including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Communitree - a Scottish project to collect data on trees from across the UK to create a publicly-accessible database</li>
  <li>Ride - a London-based project to help cyclists find the safest routes around busy cities</li>
  <li>Pinpoint - a project to create an indoor mapping system to help people find their way around complex public buildings, such as hospitals and universities</li>
</ul>

<p>The Minister for Implementation, Oliver Dowden, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are investing in location-based data technology to improve public services and the way people experience them.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I’m delighted to see such innovative ideas come forward, which will help people in their everyday lives and keep the UK at the forefront of this exciting new technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>London-based Cartographix is one of the organisations which have been awarded funding through the crowdsourcing competition, which was led by the government’s Geospatial Commission in partnership with Innovate UK.</p>

<p>By using existing infrastructure, such as WiFi hotspot locations and smartphone sensors, the programmers at Cartographix hope to create a sat-nav-style system for people to use as they walk around public buildings. Organisations would volunteer to have their buildings included on the system and the maps would be made available through existing phone apps.</p>

<p>Anu Joy from Cartographix said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The aim of our mapping system is to make life easier for people. And we would not be able to do this work without the funding we are receiving from the government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also receiving funding are projects to highlight mobile phone signal blackspots, help tackle travel problems experienced by disabled people, and boost public understanding of the planning system.</p>

<p>The projects will be worked on by organisations across the UK and see research carried out by University College London, the University of Warwick, the University of Exeter and the Open University.</p>

<p>A full list of all the winners of the competition can be found below.</p>

<h2 id="notes-for-editors">Notes for editors</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/geospatial-commission">Geospatial Commission</a> is an impartial, expert committee within the Cabinet Office, set up in April 2018 and supported by £80 million of funding. The Geospatial Commission is chaired by Sir Andrew Dilnot. Nigel Clifford is the Deputy Chair.</p>

<p>The commission has been set up to drive the use of location-linked data more productively, to unlock up to £11 billion of extra value for the economy every year. The commission is currently developing the UK’s national geospatial strategy, that it will publish at the end of this year. It is running a range of projects to inform this work.</p>
