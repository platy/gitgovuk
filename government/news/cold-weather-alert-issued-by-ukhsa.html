<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>&nbsp;issues cold weather alert for northern regions</h3>

<p>With cold weather forecast across parts of the country over the coming days, the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) is encouraging people to stay warm and look out for those most at risk from the effects of cold weather.</p>

<p>The Met Office is warning that the North East of England, North West of England and Yorkshire and the Humber regions will experience cold weather from 9am on Sunday 19 December to 12pm on Friday 24 December.</p>

<p>Agostinho Sousa, Consultant in Public Health Medicine at&nbsp;<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is important to try to heat your home to at least 18 Celsius, 64.4 Fahrenheit, particularly if you have reduced mobility, are 65 and over, or have a health condition.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Please check on those who are more vulnerable to cold weather such as elderly or frail friends and family, especially if they live alone or with a serious illness. This can make all the difference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Met Office Expert Operational Meteorologist Dan Rudman said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As we head into next week, we will see a fall in temperatures as colder, clearer air moves across much of the UK. Northern areas will feel the cold most keenly, with maximum temperatures likely to sit in the single figures.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Towards the middle and end of the week, there is an increasing chance of more unsettled and windier weather affecting the UK with rain, and perhaps snow, possible for some places.</p>

<p>If people can’t heat all the rooms they use, it’s important to heat the living room during the day and the bedroom just before going to sleep. Wearing a few thin layers is better at trapping heat than wearing one thick layer. Having plenty of hot food and drinks is also effective for keeping warm.</p>

<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> issues cold weather alert for North, East and Midlands</h3>

<p>With cold weather forecast across parts of the country over the coming days, the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) is encouraging people to stay warm and look out for those most at risk from the effects of cold weather.</p>

<p>The Met Office is warning that the North East of England, North West of England, East of England, Yorkshire and the Humber, West Midlands and East Midlands regions will experience cold weather from 9am on Wednesday 1 December to midnight on Friday 3 December.</p>

<p>Agostinho Sousa, a Consultant in Public Health Medicine at&nbsp;<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As we experience low temperatures this winter it’s important to remember to check on those who are more vulnerable to cold weather. A call or socially distanced doorstep visit to look out for old or frail friends and family, especially if they live alone or with a serious illness, can make all the difference.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Remind them to heat their home to at least 18 Celsius, 64.4 Fahrenheit and to wear shoes with a good grip if they need to go outside.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Met Office Expert Operational Meteorologist Helen Caughey said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Temperatures are set to drop once again for much of the UK in the coming days, with cooler air being brought down from the north accompanied by some gusty winds.</p>

  <p class="last-child">With winds forecast to be in excess of 40mph in some areas it will feel much colder than temperatures indicate, especially in exposed coastal locations. There is also a chance of some snow, predominantly over high ground, but which may reach lower levels at times, mainly as sleet.</p>

<h3>26 November 2021</h3>

<p>With a risk of severe cold weather, icy conditions and heavy snow across parts of the country, the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) is encouraging people to stay warm and look out for those most at risk from the effects of cold weather.</p>

<p>The Met Office is warning that the North East of England, North West of England, South East of England, East of England, Yorkshire and the Humber, West Midlands and East Midlands regions will experience cold weather from 6pm on Friday 26 November to 3pm on Monday 29 November.</p>

<p>Agostinho Sousa, a Consultant in Public Health Medicine at <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cold weather can have a serious impact on health, particularly for older people and those with heart and lung problems, as it increases the risks of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections.</p>

  <p>It’s really important to keep checking on older neighbours or relatives, especially those living alone or those who have serious illness.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Make a call, or a socially-distanced doorstep visit if they live close by, to remind them to heat their home to at least 18 Celsius, 64.4 Fahrenheit and to keep up to date with the forecast. It’s also helpful to check they have enough food and drinks and any medicines they need.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Will Lang, Head of Civil Contingencies at the Met Office, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The UK will see temperatures drop to below average in the coming days, as cold air is drawn in from the north. This is coupled with the strong winds associated with Storm Arwen, which means it will feel especially cold in the wind.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Areas in the north will see temperatures below freezing overnight, with daytime maximum temperatures only getting into the low single figures. It’s important to note that strong wind speeds, in excess of 65mph in exposed locations, will exacerbate the cold temperatures we’ll be seeing over the weekend.</p>
