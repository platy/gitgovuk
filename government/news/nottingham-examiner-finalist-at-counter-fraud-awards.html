<p>Sam Powdrill, an Examiner based in the Insolvency Service’s Nottingham Office, was a finalist in the best apprentice or newcomer of the year category at the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://counterfraudconference.co.uk/counter-fraud-award-categories/" rel="external">Public Sector Counter Fraud Awards 2022</a>.</p>

<p>The awards, delivered in collaboration with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://twitter.com/gcfprofession" rel="external">Government Counter Fraud Profession</a>, recognises those who demonstrate commitment, innovation, great team work or going the extra mile in the national fight to protect people against fraud.</p>

<p>Sam Powdrill works in Official Receiver Services, with responsibility to investigate personal bankruptcy and company liquidation cases on behalf of the Official Receiver.</p>

<p>The Best Apprentice or Newcomer Award is presented to apprentices or new recruits into the Counter Fraud sector who have made impressive progress and demonstrated huge potential to go further.</p>

<p>Having completed his Examiner qualification in May 2021, 3 months ahead of schedule, Sam has demonstrated outstanding commitment to learning and development while also successfully delivering his demanding and challenging workload.</p>

<p>Sam joined the Insolvency Service from HMRC in 2018 and since the beginning of 2019, Sam has obtained an incredible 54 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bankruptcy-restrictions-orders-and-undertakings">bankruptcy restrictions orders and undertakings</a>.</p>

<p>At the same time, Sam has dutifully administered several bankruptcy estates, some of which required lengthy court proceedings. Sam took a lead role in briefing and preparing solicitors and counsel in these hearings – performing a role usually conducted by a more senior examiner.</p>

<p>Sam has also taken the time to share his skills with colleagues across the numerous Official Receiver offices across the country and has been instrumental in designing and delivering masterclasses on how best to investigate people who abuse bankruptcy proceedings.</p>

<p>Sam Powdrill said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was extremely inspiring to attend the Counter Fraud Awards and to hear of the great work being done by the community to stop fraud and reduce its impact. So while I didn’t win, it was still a great honour to be nominated for ‘Newcomer of the Year’ and be a part of this fantastic community.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I have had so much support from my manager Alan Draycott and the whole Nottingham office, which made it possible to achieve the results, as well as nomination. I look forward to continuing to play my role as part of the Counter Fraud community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alan Draycott, Sam’s line manager and Deputy Official Receiver, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sam’s commitment to public service and fighting fraud has been outstanding and he is someone everyone would want in their team.</p>

  <p>Sam treats everyone fairly, finds information in an expedient fashion, produces outstanding work and goes the extra mile by sharing his skills and knowledge with his colleagues. His excellence means that his colleagues also excel in their own work.</p>

  <p class="last-child">As his line manager, I have greatly benefitted from Sam’s qualities and that is why I am so proud that he was a finalist at the Public Sector Counter Fraud Awards – congratulations.</p>
