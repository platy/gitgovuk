<p>The Regulator of Social Housing has launched a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-the-introduction-of-tenant-satisfaction-measures" class="govuk-link">consultation</a>) today (9 December 2021) on tenant satisfaction measures. The proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> would provide data about social housing landlords’ performance and the quality of their services. This is intended to help tenants hold their landlord to account and help <abbr title="Regulator of Social Housing">RSH</abbr> in its future consumer regulation role, as part of implementing the package of changes to consumer regulation set out in the Social Housing White Paper.</p>

<p><abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> will apply to all social housing landlords, including local authorities, housing associations and other registered social housing providers.</p>

<p>The consultation sets out 22 proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> for consultation across the five themes in the White 
Paper:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keeping properties in good repair</li>
  <li>maintaining building safety</li>
  <li>effective complaints handling</li>
  <li>respectful and helpful tenant engagement, and</li>
  <li>responsible neighbourhood management.</li>
</ul>

<p>They include both tenant perception measures, collected through landlords’ surveys of tenants, and 
landlord management information measures. The details of the draft measures have been shaped 
by early discussions with stakeholders, including tenants and landlords.</p>

<p>Alongside the proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, and the detailed proposals for their collection and measurement, 
<abbr title="Regulator of Social Housing">RSH</abbr> has also published the draft text for the consumer standard which would require landlords to 
collect, publish and submit information about their performance against the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Regulator of Social Housing">RSH</abbr> is now seeking views on its <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> proposals from landlords, tenants and anyone with an 
interest in social housing by 3 March 2022.</p>

<p>Fiona MacGregor, Chief Executive of <abbr title="Regulator of Social Housing">RSH</abbr> said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our proposed tenant satisfaction measures aim to give clear and comparable data about the
quality of services tenants in social housing receive. We want them to be a valuable source of 
information for tenants, local communities, and landlords as well as forming part of the wider picture 
that informs our consumer regulation.</p>

  <p class="last-child">By consulting now, we can take into account the views of tenants, landlords and other stakeholders
to refine the final measures and also allow time for local authorities, housing associations and other
social housing providers to prepare for their implementation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-the-introduction-of-tenant-satisfaction-measures" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> consultation</a> is available on the <abbr title="Regulator of Social Housing">RSH</abbr> website.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="Regulator of Social Housing">RSH</abbr> set out its initial thinking about how it will put in place the changes to consumer 
regulation described in the social housing white paper, including tenant satisfaction 
measures, in Reshaping consumer regulation: our principles and approach. Many of these 
changes can only be made when Parliament has passed legislation to change our objectives 
and legal powers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> would apply to registered providers of social housing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This consultation relates to the draft <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> Standard, <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> and related requirements that the 
regulator is proposing to set, and the draft guidance that the regulator is proposing to 
publish. Alongside this, <abbr title="Regulator of Social Housing">RSH</abbr> has published a plain English summary of the consultation and 
proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>. It will make an easy read version of the summary available on its website 
shortly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the conclusion of this consultation, <abbr title="Regulator of Social Housing">RSH</abbr> intends to publish an Equality Impact 
Assessment and a Regulatory Impact Assessment alongside the final <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> documents. It is
sharing drafts of these assessments as part of this consultation and welcomes comments on 
these.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Regulator of Social Housing promotes a viable, efficient and well-governed social 
housing sector able to deliver homes that meet a range of needs. Its role is defined in 
legislation to have an economic regulation objective relating to private registered providers, 
and a consumer regulation objective relating to both local authority providers and private 
registered providers. In line with current legislation, <abbr title="Regulator of Social Housing">RSH</abbr> regulates consumer standards 
reactively.</p>
