<p>Emma Wade-Smith OBE has today been appointed Her Majesty’s Consul General to New York and Her Majesty’s Trade Commissioner (HMTC) for North America.</p>

<p>Wade-Smith – who is currently HM Trade Commissioner for Africa and has previously held senior diplomatic roles in the US – will begin in November 2021. She will lead on promoting British trade and investment in the US and Canada, with the aim of accelerating job creation and opportunities across the UK, and working with businesses across North America to support growth and innovation.</p>

<p>The UK collaborates intensively with New York across a wide range of spheres, including arts, science, sports and education. As Consul General New York, Wade-Smith will work to support and strengthen these diverse partnerships between the UK and the US across the states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut, as well as supporting British nationals in this wide region.</p>

<h3>International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>I’m delighted to welcome Emma as Trade Commissioner for North America and HM Consul General in New York. She will bring a wealth of experience and insight to the roles as we look to deepen our economic, cultural and diplomatic ties in the region.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I look forward to working with her to break down barriers to trade and support jobs, growth and opportunities for our superb British businesses.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The UK’s partnership with North America is vital for delivering jobs, growth, and a free and secure world.</p>

  <p>Emma brings a wealth of knowledge from her previous role, and will continue to strengthen our political, economic and cultural links in New York - whilst deepening transatlantic ties between the UK and our allies.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Boosted by the expected lifting of US travel restrictions, Emma will play a vital role in taking the relationship between the UK and North America to the next level as we forge ahead with a forward-looking Global Britain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The UK and US enjoy a thriving trade and investment relationship, with 1.4 million people in the UK working for US firms and 1.2 million people in America working for British companies, making the UK the biggest foreign employer in the US. The US is also the UK’s largest single trading partner, with total trade reaching £196.3 billion in 2020.</p>

<p>Canada is an important strategic partner for the UK, with total trade reaching £17.7 billion last year, and we look forward to building on our relationship, including through a more ambitious UK-Canada trade agreement and through future membership of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.</p>

<h3>Emma Wade-Smith OBE, HM Trade Commissioner for North America and Consul General New York, said:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>I am thrilled to be appointed as Her Majesty’s Trade Commissioner for North America and Consul General New York.</p>

  <p>Supporting, enabling, and developing stronger business links between the UK and North America is critical to creating more jobs and spurring sustainable economic growth for both sides of the Atlantic. Together we can help and promote our world-class companies to build cleaner and more inclusive economies that we want to live and work in, including through innovation in digital, tech and clean growth.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I am committed to using my energy, experience and enthusiasm to lead our trade and investment work across North America, as well as bring creativity and drive to furthering the education, science, arts and people links between the UK and the States of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.</p>
</blockquote>
