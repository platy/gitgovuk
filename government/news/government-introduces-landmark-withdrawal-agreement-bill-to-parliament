<p>The Government has today introduced its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eu-withdrawal-agreement-bill">landmark Brexit bill</a>, which enshrines the new deal we have negotiated with the EU in UK law.</p>

<p>This deal abolishes the backstop in the old deal. The Government put forward a reasonable compromise, based on the key principles of consent for the people of Northern Ireland, and the UK leaving the EU Customs Union whole and entire, which was agreed at European Council last week. The EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill puts those internationally agreed obligations into domestic law.</p>

<p>This week MPs will have the chance to pass this bill, to respect the result of the referendum and to leave with a deal on October 31 in an orderly and friendly way. MPs voted overwhelmingly to trigger Article 50 in 2017 to start the process of leaving the EU and supporting this bill is the final stage to make that happen. This will allow the country to move on and for the Government to return its focus to delivering on the people’s domestic priorities: investing in the NHS, tackling serious and violent crime, and levelling up funding on schools.</p>

<p>The bill will implement the new deal agreed with the EU in UK law:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Delivering Brexit, with a deal, on October 31</li>
  <li>Ending vast annual payments to Brussels</li>
  <li>Protecting the integrity of the UK as we leave the EU, without the need for the backstop</li>
  <li>Protecting the rights of EU, EEA and Swiss citizens in UK law so that they can continue to live, study and work in the UK</li>
  <li>Securing an implementation period to give businesses continuity and greater certainty as they prepare for the change in relationship we will have with the EU.</li>
</ul>

<p>Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay, said:</p>

<p>“The Prime Minister has successfully negotiated a great new deal without the anti-democratic backstop which many said would be impossible.</p>

<p>“MPs and Peers  today have in front of them a bill that will get Brexit done by October 31, protect jobs and the integrity of the UK, and enable us to move onto the people’s priorities like health, education and crime.</p>

<p>“This is the chance to leave the EU with a deal on October 31. If Parliament wants to respect the referendum, it must back the bill.”</p>
