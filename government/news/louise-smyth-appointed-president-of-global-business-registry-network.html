<p>Louise Smyth will take up a prestigious role as president of a global network of business registries.</p>

<p>Louise, who’s also the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales, will take up the position with the Corporate Registers Forum (CRF) after being formally appointed at the organisation’s annual general meeting today.</p>

<p>The CRF is a leading international association of business registries from more than 50 nations across the world.  Members meet regularly to share ideas, benchmark performance and access specialist experience.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the CRF held its 16th annual conference where delegates met to discuss topics ranging from the use of blockchain technology to combatting financial crime to the challenges posed by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>

<p>The event was staged virtually, hosted by the Ugandan Registration Services Bureau (URSB) and attended by delegates from across the globe.</p>

<p>Louise Smyth said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m delighted and honoured to have been named president of the Corporate Registers Forum.</p>

  <p>The CRF is a unique organisation which gives business registry professionals from all over the world an opportunity to share innovation and best practice in the spirit of positive international collaboration.</p>

  <p>We know Companies House is highly regarded as the UK’s corporate registry, and to get such high endorsement from international colleagues is a great honour.</p>

  <p>I’m very much looking forward to the next 2 years as CRF President and ensuring that Companies House continues to contribute to the UK’s reputation as a world-leading place to do business.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I’d also like to thank the outgoing CRF Secretary Michael Brosnahan. Michael has served the organisation with distinction for many years and leaves a tremendous legacy for the CRF to build on. We wish him well for his retirement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Louise Smyth, who will serve as CRF President for an initial 2-year term, joined Companies House in 2017, and is overseeing an ambitious 5-year transformation programme.</p>

<p>The Companies House register was searched 9.8 billion times in 2020 and supports millions of business decisions each year. Research estimates the value of Companies House data to users and the wider economy at up to £3 billion per year.</p>

<p>Last year Companies House published its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/companies-house-strategy-2020-to-2025" class="govuk-link">2020 to 2025 strategy</a>, in which it outlined its vision to be the most open, trusted and innovative register in the world.</p>

<p>Michael Brosnahan, outgoing CRF Secretary, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am delighted to announce that members have appointed Louise Smyth as CRF President for the next 2 years.</p>

  <p>Louise has been a valued executive member since joining the organisation in 2017 and brings a wealth of leadership experience and corporate knowledge to the role.</p>

  <p class="last-child">On behalf of all CRF members and the executive, I’d like to congratulate Louise for securing this very important and prestigious role.</p>
