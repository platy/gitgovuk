    <p>Businesses encouraged to sign up to attend week of UK-wide events, activities and announcements hosted by trade experts</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Week will give businesses the advice they need to begin, or further, their exporting journey, and showcase available support</p>
  </li>

    <p>Part of Government push to encourage more businesses to start exporting so they can benefit from global trade</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Today, the Department for International Trade (DIT) announces the first International Trade Week. It will include business and sector led activities, showcasing events and workshops available to businesses of all sizes, all sectors and across the UK hosted by expert trade advisors, Parliamentarians and Ministers.</p>

<p>Businesses across the country who are considering exporting for the first time are being encouraged to join the ambitious, new week-long event to get the advice they need to take the plunge.</p>

<p>The event will take place from 15th – 19th November across the UK, aiming to encourage UK businesses to export and sell to the world, and showcase the long-term support that is available to help them do so.</p>

<p>Figures show that businesses who export are more productive and pay their staff more. But only one in ten British businesses currently export, with DIT Ministers keen to boost this figure through a broad package of tailored support.</p>

<p>Minster for Exports, Mike Freer MP, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We want to help more businesses across the UK start exporting so they can seize the wins on offer in the world’s fastest growing markets.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I’m delighted to announce DIT’s first International Trade Week. Exporting is crucial to the government’s plans to level up and build back better, and this week of events is a great opportunity for businesses to get involved, share advice and learn from the experts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Andy Burwell, Confederation of British Industry (CBI) International Director, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">There has never been a more important time to talk trade, for businesses to embrace it and for all to realise the prizes exporting brings - increased revenue, jobs, innovation and productivity.  The International Trade Week must be a launchpad to get our nation exporting.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">It will require a renewed partnership between business and government, not just at a national level but at a local level as well.  Government ambition, the practical tools, information and advice, matched with business action is the recipe for success.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shevaun Haviland, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">When the BCC was set up in the 19th Century its aim was to help businesses grow by trading internationally, and that hasn’t changed. More than 60% of Chamber members export overseas compared to just 10% of all businesses UK-wide.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We agree wholeheartedly with the government that to turn the UK into the global economic powerhouse it deserves to be, then we need to get our businesses exporting. Taking that first step may seem daunting but the BCC, and its network of Accredited Chambers of Commerce in the UK and British International Chambers across the world, are here to help you.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Once you open the door to international trade the possibilities for expansion are endless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Head of International Affairs James Sibley said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Small businesses are constantly on the lookout for new opportunities to grow and thrive, and for many of them exporting is the way forward. Currently more than 25 per cent of FSB members export, and this has the potential to grow further with the right support in place.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Small firms are the backbone of our economy, and as we sign new trade deals around the world, it’s vital that these businesses have the support and information they need to become successful small exporters as part of the government’s global Britain and levelling up ambitions.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We look forward to engaging with Government to unlock the vast export potential of the UK’s SME community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>DIT is committed to helping UK businesses seize international trade opportunities.</p>

<p>Exports are central to the government’s ambition to level up every part of the UK and help businesses build back better; government commissioned research estimated that exports supported 6.5 million jobs across the UK in 2016, 74% of which were outside London.</p>

<p>International Trade Week will launch on the 15th November, and businesses can sign up <a rel="external" href="https://www.events.great.gov.uk/internationaltradeweek" class="govuk-link">here</a> for virtual/physical events in their local area.</p>
