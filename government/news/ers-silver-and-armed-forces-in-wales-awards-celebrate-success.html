<blockquote>

  <p>These employers have been recognised for their exemplar support to the armed forces community.

<blockquote>

  <p>We’re thrilled to be the recipients of a Silver Employer Recognition Scheme (<abbr title="Employer Recognition Scheme">ERS</abbr>) Award from the Ministry of Defence this year.</p>

  <p>We want to be the employer of choice whatever your background, and we value the diverse skillsets that Armed Forces personnel bring to our business.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We are proud to support those with armed forces associations, enabling them to pursue a Reservist role, transition out of the Armed Forces, or work flexibly whilst their military spouse or partner is away.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Karl Gilmore, Rail Infrastructure Director &amp; Armed Forces Champion at Transport for Wales said:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p class="last-child">At Transport for Wales we continue to support our armed forces community and are proud to have achieved silver status of the Employer Recognition Scheme. By signing the armed forces covenant, we acknowledge, understand and support those who have served in the armed forces or continue to do so in a Reservist capacity, their families or those who are Cadet Force Adult Volunteers, should be treated with fairness and respect in the community, society and the workplace.</p>

</blockquote>
