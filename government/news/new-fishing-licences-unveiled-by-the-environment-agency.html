<p>The Environment Agency (EA) has released new fishing licence images designed by British Fish and Wildlife Artist, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.davidmillerart.co.uk/" rel="external">David Miller</a>.</p>

<p>Ahead of the start of this year’s fishing season, David has designed new and unique images of three of the nation’s most beloved species: the grayling; perch; and salmon. All new paper licences purchased on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/fishing-licences/buy-a-fishing-licence">gov.uk</a> will now include these images.</p>

<p>Two of the species, the grayling and the perch, are regarded to be the ‘beauty and the beast’ of fishing. While the grayling is the ‘lady of the stream’ on every anglers’ bucket list, the perch is the underwater predator that is a favourite first catch for most anglers. The grayling is depicted on the trout and coarse 2 rod licence, whilst the perch is depicted on the trout and coarse 3 rod licence.</p>

<p>This year, the Environment Agency is continuing the popular <a class="govuk-link" href="https://anglingtrust.net/getfishing/a-licence-to-chill/" rel="external">A Licence to Chill</a> campaign for a second year running, aiming to welcome more people into the angling community and showcase the wide variety of benefits that fishing can provide. Fishing is not only an opportunity to get outside, but allows anglers to exercise, socialise, relax and unwind. Many anglers have found this benefits their mental health and as a result has led to new anglers taking up the sport.</p>

<h4>Kevin Austin, Deputy Director Agriculture, Fisheries and the Natural Environment at the Environment Agency said:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are thrilled with the images that David has created for our fishing licences this year. The new licence images capture the beauty of our much-loved salmon, grayling and perch and I hope this encourages our anglers and aspiring anglers, to get outside and go fishing.</p>

  <p class="last-child">All of the income we receive from fishing licence sales is re-invested into vital work to protect and restore fish habitats across the country, and to ensure that we are able to provide anglers with the best possible experiences, services, and facilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Environment Agency reinvests rod licence income directly back into vital work to benefit anglers and the natural environment. This includes projects to protect and improve fish stocks, tackle illegal fishing, and improve facilities and services for anglers. Last week, the EA announced that that through the use of rod licence income, Calverton Fish Farm restocked a record-breaking 600,000 fish into rivers, lakes and ponds across England. This restocking has provided an essential boost to fish stocks recovering from pollution incidents or poor environmental quality.</p>

<p>In order to fish legally and responsibly, anglers must purchase a rod licence which are easy to buy <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/fishing-licences/buy-a-fishing-licence">online</a>. Annual licences start from only £30, whilst juniors go free and a one-day licence is available from £6.</p>

<h4>Further information:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>We have created a new way to view your fishing licence. You can now get your licence digitally, as an email or a text message, or you can continue to get your licence card decorated with David Miller’s artwork in the post.</li>
  <li>The revenue generated by over one million licence sales in 2020/21 funded a range of initiatives, including 45 fish pass projects, the construction of facilities such as accessible toilets and improved access to fisheries sites for wheelchair users, and the training of new coaches to facilitate 495 participation events which saw around 5,000 people try fishing for the first time. The income was also boosted by government funding and partner contributions to deliver £33 million through the Water Environment Improvement Fund (WEIF), to enhance the environment which fish stocks rely on to thrive.</li>
