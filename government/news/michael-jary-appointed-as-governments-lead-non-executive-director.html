<p>Michael Jary has been appointed by the Prime Minister as the Government’s Lead Non-Executive Director (NED).</p>

<p>He will work closely with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Cabinet Secretary, the Civil Service Chief Operating Officer, and other senior civil servants across Government. He will join the board of the Cabinet Office. Michael Jary takes over from Lord Nash, who had held the post since July 2020.</p>

<p>Non-Executive Boards Members are drawn from outside Government including from business, academia, think tanks and the voluntary sector, to sit on departmental boards. Their role is to support ministers and officials to strengthen the governance of departments, by bringing a commercial or independent perspective. They help provide constructive scrutiny and internal challenge to the work of Government.</p>

<p>The Government Lead Non-Executive will bring non executives from different departments together to ensure shared issues and concerns are being pursued across Government.</p>

<p>Michael Jary will play a key role in building leadership and management skills in departments, recruiting new non-executive directors and supporting the Cabinet Office and departments to transform the way public services are delivered.</p>

<p>Michael Jary has had a varied career, with extensive experience in both the public and private sector. He was one of the founding team of OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants and was previously the firm’s Worldwide Managing Partner. He has been a strategy advisor for over 35 years. His other roles are non-executive director of Barclays Bank UK plc, chair of Itad Ltd, and chair of Duchy Originals. He is a trustee of The Prince’s Foundation and of Opera Holland Park. He has been the Lead Non-Executive Director at the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities since February 2019.</p>

<p><strong>Chief Operating Officer for the Civil Service and Permanent Secretary of the Cabinet Office Alex Chisholm said</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our Non-Executive Directors provide independent expertise, challenge and scrutiny to the work of departments. They bring invaluable external insight to support the Government to achieve its objectives and deliver for UK citizens.</p>

  <p>Michael Jary brings a huge wealth of experience from business and Government to the role, and I look forward to working together on the Government’s top priorities.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Lord Nash for his drive and commitment in leading the non-executive board cadre over the last two years.</p>
