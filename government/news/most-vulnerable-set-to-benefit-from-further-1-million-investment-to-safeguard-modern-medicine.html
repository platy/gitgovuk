<p>People most vulnerable to life-threatening bacterial infections, including newborns, elderly and those in hospital are set to benefit from an extra £1 million boost to support the development of innovative treatments for antibiotic-resistant infections.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/the-global-amr-innovation-fund" class="govuk-link">Global Antimicrobial Resistance Innovation Fund (<abbr title="Global Antimicrobial Resistance Innovation Fund">GAMRIF</abbr>)</a>, part of the Department of Health and Social Care, is investing further funding to help the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (<abbr title="Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership">GARDP</abbr>) efforts to tackle antimicrobial resistance (<abbr title="antimicrobial resistance">AMR</abbr>), one of the greatest threats to global health.</p>

<p>The new investment represents a contribution to all <abbr title="Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership">GARDP</abbr> programmes, including to the development of SECURE, a new antibiotics initiative co-developed by <abbr title="Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership">GARDP</abbr> and the World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with other international bodies.</p>

<p>SECURE’s mission is to expand access to essential antibiotics to prepare countries for the silent pandemic of drug-resistant bacterial infections. These essential medicines will include new antibiotics to combat drug-resistant infections, but also existing antibiotics that are not widely available or suffer from frequent supply chain interruptions and shortages.</p>

<p>The unchecked growth of drug-resistant infections has long-term implications. Resistant infections kill an estimated 700,000 people a year, a number projected to increase exponentially as drug resistance grows and imperils our ability to treat even common infections. The consequences of not addressing this now could result in a future where we are unable to treat common infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections and infections in newborns.</p>

<p>Lord Bethell, Minister for Innovation, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Antimicrobial resistance is one of the biggest threats to global health, making common infections more difficult to treat and risking lives. This is a key focus of our G7 presidency and I am looking forward to further discussions on this with the world’s major democracies at the health ministers’ meetings in June.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Our additional funding will continue to support the fantastic work of <abbr title="Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership">GARDP</abbr> in the development of vital treatments to treat drug-resistant infections. This will help safeguard the future of modern medicine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seamus O’Brien, <abbr title="Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership">GARDP</abbr> Director of Research and Development, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are extremely pleased by the UK’s increased contribution at a time when COVID-19 has demonstrated the critical importance of preventing and preparing for pandemics, including the pandemic of drug-resistant infections.</p>

  <p class="last-child">By investing an additional £1 million, the UK is again demonstrating leadership in efforts to accelerate the development and delivery of life-changing and life-saving treatments for every person who needs them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the UK’s 2021 G7 presidency prioritising global health threats, this funding recognises that effective antibiotics underpin modern healthcare, and reinforces the partnership between the UK and <abbr title="Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership">GARDP</abbr> to ensure that such antibiotics are available now and for future generations.</p>

<p>The funding comes on top of £13 million previously committed by the UK government to <abbr title="Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership">GARDP</abbr>. Funding both <abbr title="Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership">GARDP</abbr>’s pipeline and the development of SECURE reflects the shared belief of <abbr title="Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership">GARDP</abbr> and <abbr title="Global Antimicrobial Resistance Innovation Fund">GAMRIF</abbr> that developing new treatments and ensuring responsible access for all in need are inseparable.</p>
