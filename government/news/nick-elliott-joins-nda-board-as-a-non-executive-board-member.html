        <p>The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) has today announced the appointment of Nick Elliott to its Board as a non-executive board member for a 3-year term from 15 March 2021.</p>

<p>This appointment has been made by Kwasi Kwarteng, the Secretary of State for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, in consultation with Scottish Ministers.</p>

<p>Dr Ros Rivaz, the Chair of the NDA, said:</p>

<p>“I am delighted that Nick is joining us to support our vital and complex work to decommission the UK’s 17 earliest nuclear sites.&nbsp;He will be a great addition to the NDA Board given his wealth of experience in leading major infrastructure and defence projects.</p>

<p>“We are incredibly thankful to Rob Holden who steps down from his role as a Non-Executive on 30 April. His insight, guidance and commitment have been extremely valuable.”</p>

<p>Nick Elliott said:</p>

<p>“It is a great honour to be joining the NDA’s board. I am hugely excited and privileged to be part of the NDA’s world-leading work in nuclear decommissioning and I am looking forward to playing a part in that mission.”</p>

<p>Nick is an executive and board director with significant experience in leading major businesses across infrastructure, railways and defence. His specialisms include programme and project management, commercial and logistics.</p>

<p>His role on the NDA Board will see him chair its Project and Programmes Committee.</p>

<p>In April 2020, he took on the role of Director General of the UK Vaccine Taskforce before joining Turner &amp; Townsend, the global professional services and programme management specialists, in March 2021 where he is currently Director.</p>

<p>Nick initially trained as a civil engineer and went on to serve as an officer in the Royal Engineers on combat engineering, construction and bomb disposal operations and projects worldwide. He is now a serving member of the Staff Corps, a reserve organisation of business leaders which provides specialist advice to the Armed Forces.</p>

<p>His career includes senior roles in Network Rail and the National Supply Chain organisation. He has previously served as a Non-Executive Director on the Board of the Submarine Delivery Agency and as a Council Member of the Rail Supply Group.</p>
