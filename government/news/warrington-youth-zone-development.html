<p>Sellafield Ltd is one of the Founder Patrons of the new facility that is located in the town centre of Warrington, and is due to open in Spring 2022.</p>

<p>Pauline Deans, Sellafield Ltd’s Community Liaison Officer said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our support to this exciting new venue is part of our SiX Social Impact Multiplied programme, and will ensure every young person in Warrington, regardless of their circumstance or background, can access first-rate facilities alongside expert mentoring and employability programmes.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The facility will help to tackle specific issues that might otherwise hold back young people, with the aim of making them happier, healthier and better equipped with the skills they need for the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Building on the success and legacy of Warrington Youth Club, the building is being developed by the national charity OnSide which has a network of 13 similar Youth Zones across the county.</p>

<p>It aims to raise the aspirations, enhance prospects and improve health and wellbeing for youngsters by providing affordable access to a wide range of programmes, services and activities including sports, arts, music, media, dance, drama and mentoring as well as offering hot meals for just £1.</p>

<p>The building will also have a dedicated enterprise and employability suite, which aims to support people who are not in education, employment or training, by equipping them with skills for the future.</p>

<p>Young People’s Development group member Izzy Murphy said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I thought it was really cool, I really like all the different rooms. The Youth Zone will be really good for young people in Warrington, it’s going to give them something to do, it’s not going to cost a lot to go in and it is easily accessible because we are right near the bus and train station.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Warrington Youth Zone CEO Dave McNicholl said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was fantastic to take young people and supporters inside the building so they can see how spectacular it will be.</p>

  <p>Having a state-of-the art building will enable us to welcome thousands of young people from all across Warrington, providing them with over 20 activities every evening as well as the vital support they need and deserve.</p>

  <p class="last-child">None of this would be possible without the support of Warrington Borough Council and our fantastic group of funders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pauline added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">It is great to see the building taking shape and I am sure the young people of Warrington will be wowed by all the activities on offer, and the support that will be provided for their health, wellbeing and development of future skills.</p>
