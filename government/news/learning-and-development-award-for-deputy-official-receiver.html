<p>Kevan Glaysher, a Deputy Official Receiver based in our Manchester office, has won a special achievement award at the Operational Delivery Profession Awards 2022 after he was nominated by colleagues for delivering excellent learning and development and improving the skills of others.</p>

<p>The prestigious awards ceremony took place on 24 May 2022 at Lancaster House, London, and Kevan attended the event to collect his prize.</p>

<p>Following 25 years in the banking industry, Kevan joined the Insolvency Service in 2009 as a trainee examiner dealing with bankruptcies, liquidations, Bankruptcy Restriction Orders and director disqualifications.</p>

<p>Kevan soon went onto mentor new trainee examiners and remains heavily involved in mentoring his colleagues in the Manchester Official Receiver office, while carrying out his duties as a Deputy Official Receiver.</p>

<p>Colleagues nominated Kevan because they wanted to celebrate his achievements in training and developing his colleagues.</p>

<p>Kevan’s nomination said that he creates a safe space where colleagues can bring any questions or problems they might have about the work, and Kevan happily talks through the problem to find a solution. He has also hosted regular surgeries for colleagues to help train them up.</p>

<p>Deputy Official Receiver, Kevan Glaysher, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This has been a total yet welcome surprise to win a special achievement award at the Operational Delivery Profession Awards.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Working for Official Receiver Services is challenging as the work is not only complex but the things you do has a real impact on people’s lives. That’s why I take learning and development so seriously, as I want to ensure my colleagues not only improve their skills but also deliver excellent customer service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Robin Dury, Official Receiver for the Manchester office, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I am really happy for Kevan being nominated for the award which recognises his considerable commitment to not only his own role but developing those around him and promoting a positive and supportive culture within the office.</p>
</blockquote>
