<p>The first community projects to be awarded funding from the Geological Disposal Facility (GDF) Community Investment Funding (CIF) have been announced. A BMX ‘Pump Track’ at Seascale, the Beckermet Reading and Recreation Rooms and Seascale Cricket Club have received confirmation that they will receive a total of over £65,000 from the up to £1million a year funding which is made available to benefit local communities engaged in discussions about hosting a GDF.  A range of other projects for Community Investment Funding are also currently being discussed in West Cumbria.</p>

<p>The Mid Copeland GDF Community Partnership in Cumbria, which formed in November 2021, is the first community to benefit from this funding which is for initiatives that support the local economy, improve community well-being, or enhance the local environment. Anyone can apply to the Community Partnership for grant funding for projects that benefit people living in the area it covers.</p>

<p>GDF Community Partnerships have also formed in South Copeland and in Allerdale, Cumbria, with discussions beginning in Theddlethorpe, Lincolnshire, through a GDF Working Group. The formation of these groups signifies real progress in the nationwide search for a suitable host site for a GDF. These groups also provide a vital platform for long-term community engagement, local investment funding, and investigations into site suitability.</p>

<p>Seascale Parish Councillor Lizzie Mawson applied for the funding to revamp the local BMX Pump Track in Seascale which received £47,801. She said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">It’s absolutely wonderful to have the funding for this local facility – the children come from far and wide to use it. This grant will enable us to do much needed work before the track falls into disrepair. I would encourage others to apply, there are no end of projects which could be done in our area.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simon Hughes, Director of Community Engagement and Siting at Nuclear Waste Services, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am delighted to see the Mid Copeland GDF Community Partnership approving funding for local projects that will have a positive impact on the lives of people in the area for years to come. In forming a GDF Community Partnership, we have made up to £1million of funding available every year, for local initiatives which ensure local people and organisations enjoy immediate tangible benefits from participating in discussions about the potential for them to host a GDF.</p>

  <p class="last-child">It’s been a privilege to join early discussions with people in communities across the country about geological disposal. I’m looking forward to continuing these discussions and seeing more Community Partnerships realise the benefits of engaging in the process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Beckermet Reading and Recreation Rooms received £9,576 to draw up refurbishment plans and Seascale Cricket Club were awarded £8,122 for an electronic scoreboard.</p>

<p>The GDF Programme is making available £1million of community investment funding for each Community Partnership, as set out in Government policy.  A Community Partnership will consider  the grant applications, make awards and develop locally specific funding priorities.</p>

<p>GDF Community Partnerships increase public engagement in the GDF programme, and along with triggering community investment funding, help communities create a long-term vision for themselves, which could include better transport links, broadband, education, healthcare facilities or environmental initiatives.
The search for a suitable site in England or Wales is a nationwide process based on community consent and includes detailed site investigations over a number of years.</p>
