<blockquote>
  <p>I am delighted that Sir Robert Chote will take up this important role as Chair of the UK Statistics Authority. Sir Robert has all the attributes, experience and independence of judgement needed to lead the UKSA Board and the regulation of UK statistics.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I would like to thank Sir David Norgrove for his work over the previous five years and Ms Sian Jones for her short period of cover as interim Chair from April to May.</p>
