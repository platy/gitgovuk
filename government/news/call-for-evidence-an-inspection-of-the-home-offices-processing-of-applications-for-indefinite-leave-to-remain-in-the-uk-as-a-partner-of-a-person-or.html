<p>The Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration (ICIBI) has begun an inspection of the Home Office’s processing of family visas and invites anyone with relevant knowledge or experience to submit their evidence to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:familyvisas@icibi.gov.uk?subject=Family%20Visas%20%E2%80%93%20Call%20for%20Evidence.&amp;body=%0D%0A%0D%0A%20I%20consent%20to%20the%20Independent%20Chief%20Inspector%20of%20Borders%20and%20Immigration%20retaining%20and%20processing%20the%20information%20and%20data%20in%20this%20email.">familyvisas@icibi.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>This inspection will focus on the Home Office’s processing of applications for indefinite leave to remain in the UK as a partner of a person or parent of a child already settled in the UK (SET (M)).
It will examine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the efficiency of the process and the quality of decisions made on applications for indefinite leave to remain, as the partner or spouse of a British or settled person (SET (M))</li>
  <li>the accessibility of the application process for applicants</li>
  <li>the impact on an applicant (and their family) when an application for settlement is not successful, but they are placed on a 10-year route, and whether it is proportionate</li>
  <li>what assurance is in place to ensure that recommendations from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/windrush-lessons-learned-review" class="govuk-link">‘Windrush Lessons Learned Review’</a> are being considered, and that discretion is being exercised in decision making where appropriate, putting the applicant at the forefront of the process</li>
</ul>

<p>The Chief Inspector would welcome evidence in relation to any of the above points. He would be particularly interested to hear from those with first-hand experience of the family route to settlement, regarding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their experience of submitting an application for indefinite leave to remain in the UK as a partner of a person or parent of a child already settled in the UK (SET (M))</li>
  <li>whether the eligibility requirements were easy to understand and the application process was simple to follow</li>
  <li>whether decisions were received within the service standard</li>
  <li>whether decisions were easy to understand</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note: The ICIBI’s statutory remit does not extend to investigating or making decisions about individual cases. This remains a Home Office responsibility. However, inspectors are keen to hear about individual cases, insofar as they serve to illustrate particular points, issues or trends.</p>

<p>The call for evidence will close on 17 November 2021.</p>
