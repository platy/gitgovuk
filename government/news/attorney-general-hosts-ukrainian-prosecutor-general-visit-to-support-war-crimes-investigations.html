<p>The Attorney General, the Rt Hon Suella Braverman QC MP, will host a visit of the Ukrainian Prosecutor General, Iryna Venediktova today (Thursday 26 May) to reiterate the UK’s support for Ukraine’s war crimes investigations.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian Prosecutor General will spend two days in the UK for ministerial and official meetings to discuss what more the UK can do to support her work to bring war criminals to justice.</p>

<p>The visit is part of an of ongoing dialogue between the UK and Ukraine to help Ukraine seek justice for Russia’s atrocities. Earlier this month the Attorney visited the Prosecutor General in Ukraine, leading <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fnews%2Fattorney-general-visits-ukraine-to-support-investigation-of-russian-war-crimes&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cemma.hutchison%40fco.gov.uk%7C51d8a71c7659435fda1208da3e33b96d%7Cd3a2d0d37cc84f52bbf985bd43d94279%7C0%7C0%7C637890689125000696%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=SMz4iP1acBZMl1%2Fl5qwujyi4xMejbULlsFYBzu7ZVNY%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="external">a delegation of UK war crimes experts</a> to the region. The visit also follows Wednesday’s launch of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-statement-eu-us-and-uk-establish-atrocity-crimes-advisory-group-aca-for-ukraine">Atrocity Crimes Advisory group</a>, a joint mechanism between the UK, the US and the EU to coordinate support for Ukraine in its war crimes investigations.</p>

<p>As part of the visit the Attorney General and Prosecutor General will meet the Deputy Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Dominic Raab MP, to discuss the UK’s support for international accountability efforts, particularly at the International Criminal Court.</p>

<p>The Prosecutor General will also meet Minister of State and the Prime Minister’s Special Representative on Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Lord Ahmad to discuss the UK’s wider spectrum of support to Ukraine.</p>

<p>Commenting ahead of the visit, the Attorney General, Suella Braverman QC MP, said:</p>

<p>“Russia’s illegal invasion has brought barbarity to Ukraine and justice must and will be done.</p>

<p>“It is an honour to host the Ukrainian Prosecutor General, Iryna Venediktova in London following my visit to Ukraine earlier this month.</p>

<p>“I am determined that British expertise will help Ukraine uncover the truth and hold those responsible in Putin’s regime to account for their actions.”</p>

<p>Speaking about her visit to London, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General, Iryna Venediktova said:</p>

<p>“It is a great pleasure to be in London, to continue my important dialogue with Attorney General Braverman, and meet the Deputy Prime Minister and Lord Ahmad. I, and the people of Ukraine, deeply appreciate the United Kingdom’s support as we search for justice together.”</p>

<p>Speaking ahead of the meeting the Deputy Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor, and Secretary of State for Justice Dominic Raab MP said:</p>

<p>“Russian commanders carrying out war crimes should know they cannot act with impunity.</p>

<p>“The UK stands shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine and we have provided £1 million and specialist expertise to support the International Criminal Court’s investigation so these war criminals are held to account.”</p>

<p>Speaking ahead of his meeting Minister of State and the Prime Minister’s Special Representative on Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Lord Ahmad said:</p>

<p>“The Russian invasion of Ukraine has been characterised by despicable crimes, including sexual violence and the murder of innocent civilians. We’re committed to ensuring the perpetrators are held accountable.</p>

<p>“Today’s meetings with Iryna Venediktova will be vital in discussing how the UK can support Ukraine in its investigations. This includes our deployment of war crimes experts to the region, and by working closely with our US and EU partners in the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group, launched this week. We will not rest until justice is served.”</p>
