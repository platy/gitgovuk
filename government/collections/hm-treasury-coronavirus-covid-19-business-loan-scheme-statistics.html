<h2>Publication plans</h2>

<p>HMT has published management information for each of the four schemes (CBILS, CLBILS, BBLS, Future Fund), including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the total number of applications</li>
  <li>the number of approved applications</li>
  <li>the value of loans approved</li>
</ul>

<p>These schemes (CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS) close to new applications on the 31 March 2021. A final update will be published once all applications have been processed. Data on the new Recovery Loan Scheme (RLS), which opens to applications on 6 April 2021, will be published by the British Business Bank in due course.</p>

<p>The applications figure includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>approved applications</li>
  <li>applications that are still to be processed</li>
  <li>applications that have been declined or turn out not to be eligible</li>
  <li>withdrawn applications, where borrowers decide not to proceed</li>
</ul>

<p>For CBILS, this number will also include a number of applications that have subsequently been converted to applications for the BBLS scheme.</p>

<p>For Future Fund, the number of applications includes only those where both a company and their lead investor have submitted information.</p>

<p>The CBILS scheme launched on 23 March 2020. This management information only begins from 10 May. UK Finance published data before this period on lending by UK Finance members. This information is available <a rel="external" href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/sites/default/files/uploads/Data%20(XLS%20and%20PDF)/CBILS%20Data%20Table%207%20May%202020.xlsx" class="govuk-link">here.</a></p>

<p>*The value of BBLS facilities approved includes BBLS loans which have been ‘topped-up’ – that is, as announced on 2 November, BBLS borrowers who took out less than their maximum under the scheme rules (the lesser of £50,000 or 25% of their turnover) in their first loan application can top-up their loan up to the maximum. As of 21 March 2021, 101,666 BBLS top-ups had been approved worth £0.91 billion.</p>

<p>One topped up loan will still be reported as one loan to avoid double counting the number of facilities approved. (e.g. if there were previously two facilities worth £40,000 each and subsequently one had been topped up to £50,000, this would now be reported as two facilities worth a total of £90,000).</p>

<p>The Future Fund closed on 31 January 2021 and is no longer accepting new applications. The scheme is still processing applications submitted prior to closure.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ol>
  <li>The management information for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS is reported on behalf of accredited lenders. For Future Fund this is reported on behalf of the British Business Bank. HM Treasury accepts no responsibility for the accuracy of these figures.</li>
  <li>Figures for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS show cumulative applications and approvals up to close of business on 21 March 2021 by accredited lenders, as reported to HM Treasury by close of business 22 March 2021.</li>
  <li>A full list of accredited lenders for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-scheme-cbils-2/current-accredited-lenders-and-partners/" rel="external">here.</a>
</li>
  <li>Management information (MI) are not classified as statistics. The MI in this release reflects timely information and do not suffer from lag effects. However, the trend from weekly figures may show some volatility. Moreover, these are initial figures which have not been rigorously quality assured and do not include data from all accredited lenders.</li>
  <li>UK Finance have also previously published MI on CBILS, but this only covers accredited lenders which are members of UK Finance. This data is available <a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/sites/default/files/uploads/Data%20(XLS%20and%20PDF)/CBILS%20Data%20Table%207%20May%202020.xlsx" rel="external" class="govuk-link">here.</a>
</li>
  <li>Future Fund opened for applications on 20 May 2020. Provided that applicants provide the information required during the application process in a timely manner, it is expected that the process will take a minimum of 21 days from initial application to funding being made available. Convertible loans are reported as approved at the point the Convertible Loan Agreement document is issued by Future Fund for signature. The time to applicants subsequently receiving funds will depend on the speed with which they complete the documentation.</li>
  <li>The Code of Practice for Statistics (the Code) is built around 3 main concepts, or pillars: trustworthiness, quality, and value. The following explains how we have applied the pillars of the Code in a proportionate way.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Trustworthiness - the figures are based on management information supplied to HM Treasury by accredited lenders for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS and by British Business Bank for Future Fund and represent their best estimates of the published totals. To support the management of departmental business, figures have been seen in advance by ministers and officials. This is in line with the Code, where pre-release access does not apply for releases based on routine management information – as covered in paragraph 3.6 of the National Statistician’s guidance.</li>
  <li>Quality - the information presented is provided by accredited lenders for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS and by British Business Bank for Future Fund based on their management information. Quality assurance processes are built in the design of the templates and the data production processes in the Treasury.</li>
  <li>Value - in publishing this data, we aim to support the information needs of society, parliamentarians and stakeholders. Business loan schemes are one part of the unprecedented support for public services, workers and businesses the Government has implemented to protect against the current economic emergency.</li>
</ul>
