      <p>There would be changes if you visit the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland and the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal.</p>

<p>It would mean that from 12 April 2019, the rules for passports, driving, <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> cards, pet travel and more would change. Check if you need to act now to make sure you can travel as planned.</p>

<p>There would be no immediate changes to travel if the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> agrees a deal to leave the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. The rules would be the same until at least 2020.</p>

<h2 id="passports-check-if-you-need-to-renew">Passports: check if you need to renew</h2>

<p>You may need to renew your British passport earlier if you’re travelling after 12 April and there’s no deal.</p>

<p>On the day you travel, you’ll need your passport to both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have at least 6 months left</li>
  <li>be less than 10 years old (even if it has 6 months or more left)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not renew it, you may not be able to travel to most <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries and Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.</p>

<p>You can use a tool to <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">check whether your passport is valid</a> for the country you’re visiting.</p>

<p>It usually takes 3 weeks if you need to <a href="/renew-adult-passport/renew">renew your passport</a>. There’s a premium service if you need it sooner.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>These rules do not apply to travel to Ireland. You can continue to use your passport as long as it’s valid for the length of your stay.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="entering-other-countries">Entering other countries</h2>

<h3 id="visas-you-should-not-need-one-for-short-trips">Visas: you should not need one for short trips</h3>

<p>If there is a deal, there will be no changes to how you enter the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland until at least 31 December 2020. You will continue to be able to travel or work without a visa during this time.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, you will not need a visa for short trips, according to European Commission proposals. You could stay for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. You may need a visa or permit to stay for longer, or to work or study.</p>

<p>Check back for updates.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>When the rules are confirmed, information about how to get a visa if you need one will be on each country’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice</a> page.</p>
</div>

<p>Travel to Ireland will not change, even if there’s no deal. You’ll continue to be able to travel and work there in the same way as before.</p>

<h3 id="border-control-you-may-have-to-show-your-return-ticket-and-money">Border control: you may have to show your return ticket and money</h3>

<p>There will be other changes from 12 April 2019 if there’s no deal.</p>

<p>At border control, you may need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>show a return or onward ticket</li>
  <li>show you have enough money for your stay</li>
  <li>use separate lanes from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> and Swiss citizens when queueing</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="healthcare-check-youre-covered">Healthcare: check you’re covered</h2>

<p>Whether there’s a deal or not, you should always get appropriate travel insurance with healthcare cover before you go abroad.</p>

<p>If there’s a deal, you’ll continue to get state-provided healthcare in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> if you have a free <a href="https://www.gov.uk/european-health-insurance-card">European Health Insurance Card</a> (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) card. The scheme also covers Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> card may not be valid.</p>

<p>It’s particularly important you get travel insurance with the right cover if you have a pre-existing medical condition. This is because the <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> scheme covers pre-existing conditions, while many travel insurance policies do not.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can read advice on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance">buying travel insurance with the right cover</a>.</p>

<h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>

<p>There may be changes from 12 April if there’s no deal. What these are depend on how you’re travelling.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Help" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>However you travel, check before you leave for any delays or disruption.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="driving-you-may-need-extra-documents">Driving: you may need extra documents</h3>

<p>If there’s a deal, you can continue to drive in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland in the same way as before. Bring your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> driving licence, and your V5C (log book) if you’re taking your vehicle from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>You’ll need some extra documents if there’s no deal.</p>

<p>If you’re taking your vehicle, you’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a free ‘green card’ - allow 1 month to get this from your car insurance company</li>
  <li>a <abbr title="Value Added Tax">GB</abbr> sticker for your car</li>
  <li>an International Driving Permit (<abbr title="International Driving Permit">IDP</abbr>) - get this over the counter in participating Post Offices (each permit costs £5.50)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re hiring a vehicle abroad, you’ll need an <abbr title="International Driving Permit">IDP</abbr> - get this before you leave.</p>

<p>You will not need an <abbr title="International Driving Permit">IDP</abbr> to drive in Ireland.</p>

<p>Follow the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/prepare-to-drive-in-the-eu-after-brexit">preparing to drive after Brexit</a> for more information. This includes changes to which <abbr title="International Driving Permit">IDP</abbr> you need to drive in other European countries.</p>

<h3 id="flights-will-continue-as-normal">Flights: will continue as normal</h3>

<p>Even if there’s no deal, the government says that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>flights will continue as normal</li>
  <li>airport security procedures will not change for direct flights to and from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
  <li>there should not be delays at airport security if you change flights in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> airports</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="coach-travel-check-back-to-confirm">Coach travel: check back to confirm</h3>

<p>Existing regular bus and coach services will continue to run.</p>

<p>The government is working with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to make sure coach holidays and tours continue.</p>

<p>Check back for updates.</p>

<h3 id="channel-tunnel-trains-will-continue-to-run">Channel tunnel: trains will continue to run</h3>

<p>Travel on Eurostar and Eurotunnel will continue to run even if there’s no deal.</p>

<h3 id="ferries-and-cruises-will-continue-to-run">Ferries and cruises: will continue to run</h3>

<p>Even if there’s no deal, ferries and cruises will continue to run.</p>

<h3 id="compensation-if-your-travel-is-disrupted">Compensation if your travel is disrupted</h3>

<p>Some travel insurance policies only cover certain types of disruption. Check your provider’s terms and conditions to make sure you have the cover you need if your travel is cancelled or delayed.</p>

<p>Your consumer rights will not change, even if there’s no deal. This means that if your travel is cancelled or delayed you may be able to claim a refund or compensation. Check your booking’s terms and conditions to find out more.</p>

<h2 id="pet-travel-allow-4-months-to-arrange">Pet travel: allow 4 months to arrange</h2>

<p>If there’s no deal, you will not be able to use the existing pet passport scheme.</p>

<p>Instead you’ll need to follow a different process, which takes 4 months.</p>

<p>Follow the guidance about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pet-travel-to-europe-after-brexit">pet travel to Europe after Brexit</a>.</p>

<h2 id="mobile-data-roaming-free-roaming-may-end">Mobile data roaming: free roaming may end</h2>

<p>If there’s no deal, the guarantee of free mobile phone roaming throughout the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway will end.</p>

<p>Check with your phone operator to find out about any roaming charges you might get after 12 April.</p>

<p>A new law means that you’re protected from getting mobile data charges above £45 without you knowing.</p>

<p>Once you reach £45, you need to opt in to spend more so that you can continue using the internet while you’re abroad. Your phone operator will tell how you can do this.</p>

<h2 id="if-your-travel-company-goes-out-of-business">If your travel company goes out of business</h2>

<p>You’re protected if you buy a package holiday and the company goes out of business.</p>

<p>You get this cover even if it’s an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> company and there’s no deal, as long as the company targets <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> customers.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you can claim compensation if you used your credit card. You’ll continue to be able to claim for payments between £100 and £30,000.</p>

<h2 id="other-brexit-changes">Other Brexit changes</h2>

<p>There are other changes that may apply when the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you’re a business:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you may need to make a customs declaration if you <a href="/take-goods-sell-abroad">take goods with you to sell abroad</a>
</li>
  <li>find out what else you need to do to <a href="/business-uk-leaving-eu">prepare your business for Brexit</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s different guidance if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/staying-uk-eu-citizen">an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> national and you want to continue living in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a></li>
