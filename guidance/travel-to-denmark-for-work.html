<p>This guide is for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality">British citizens</a> travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa, work permit or residence permit.</p>

<h2>Entry requirements</h2>

<p>If you’re going to Denmark to work (or any other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">EU country</a>, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#passports-check-if-you-need-to-renew">make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attend business meetings. These are usually covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re going for other types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.</p>

<p>Denmark’s authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You must always <a class="govuk-link" href="https://um.dk/en/travel-and-residence/" rel="external">check with Denmark’s government</a> before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re working in more than one country you’ll need to check the entry rules of each country.</p>

<p>If you need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe">passport</a>, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.</p>

<h3>Visa and permit documents</h3>

<p>This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in Denmark. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.</p>

<p>It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with Denmark’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://um.dk/en/travel-and-residence/" rel="external">immigration authorities</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a>.</p>

<p>You must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>translated</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">‘legalised’ (apostillised)</a> or notarised</li>
  <li>originals, or if copies are acceptable</li>
  <li>signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)</li>
  <li>dated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application</li>
</ul>

<p>Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa.</p>

<p>This guide uses the same terms used in Denmark, so you know which ones to use when speaking to Denmark’s authorities.</p>

<h2>Check if you need a visa or permit</h2>

<p>You do not need a visa or permit if you’re travelling to Denmark for up to 90 days in a 180-day period for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meeting clients or customers (including entertainment like eating at a restaurant)</li>
  <li>meeting colleagues, contractors or sellers</li>
  <li>giving or receiving training</li>
  <li>negotiating deals or contracts</li>
  <li>leisure travel, such as holidays or visiting friends or family</li>
</ul>

<p>These activities are covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<h3>Border checks</h3>

<p>At the border, you may be asked to show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets</li>
  <li>health insurance that covers your stay</li>
  <li>proof of accommodation for your entire stay</li>
  <li>enough money for the duration of your trip</li>
  <li>an invitation letter explaining your trip</li>
</ul>

<h2>Check Denmark’s exemptions</h2>

<p>Certain types of work and activities do not require a visa or permit because they’re exempt. 
All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.</p>

<p>The following may <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/Words%20and%20Concepts%20Front%20Page/SIRI/Work%20without%20permit" rel="external">not require a visa or permit</a> in Denmark:</p>

<ul>
  <li>diplomats and those with similar diplomatic rights, including families and staff employed in the personal household</li>
  <li>work carried out on trains and motor vehicles in international traffic</li>
  <li>work carried out on Danish commercial ships in international traffic – the ship cannot stop at Danish ports more than 25 times a year or at a Danish shipyard more than 3 times a year</li>
  <li>board members working in Denmark for up to 40 days a year</li>
  <li>guest teachers working in Denmark for up to 5 days in a 180-day period</li>
</ul>

<h3>Special work assignments for up to 90 days</h3>

<p>Special work assignments are exempt if they’re for no more than 90 days, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>researchers and lecturers invited to teach</li>
  <li>researchers working with a Danish university or company</li>
  <li>PhD candidates attending a screening process</li>
  <li>artists, musicians and other entertainers with an essential role in an important artistic event</li>
  <li>representatives of UK organisations in Denmark on business trips to set up contracts, or to buy and sell products or services – you’ll need a work permit if you work for a company in Denmark</li>
  <li>domestic employees of non-Danish employers visiting Denmark</li>
  <li>professional athletes and coaches participating in major athletic events or trying out for a sports club – you’ll need a work permit if you sign an employment contract</li>
</ul>

<h4>After-sales installation work</h4>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/Words-and-concepts/SIRI/The-fitter-rule/?anchor=3CA935D73A004521AADDD4A3105BC179&amp;callbackItem=50A40B4E5C5D4EF686F3A1FCF095C1AC&amp;callbackAnchor=7AE7D25EB2174101B814C716E90D44E13CA935D73A004521AADDD4A3105BC179" rel="external">Fitters, consultants or instructors</a> also don’t need a visa or permit for fitting and installation work covered by a new after-sales agreement.</p>

<p>This includes fitting, installing, inspecting, repairing and providing information on machinery or software. You must be employed by the company that manufactured the equipment.</p>

<p>You can check if any work you want to carry out is exempt with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/Contact-us/Contact-SIRI" rel="external">Danish Agency for International Recruitment and Integration (SIRI)</a>.</p>

<p>Exemptions would be covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">visa waiver</a>.</p>

<h3>Show proof of exemption</h3>

<p>You need to be able to show proof that you’re exempt to the authorities on request. This could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an assignment letter</li>
  <li>an employment confirmation letter</li>
  <li>a contract</li>
  <li>proof of required qualifications, such as a degree or professional certificate, or proof of artistic activities</li>
  <li>CV</li>
</ul>

<h3>Further checks</h3>

<p>If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">Danish embassy</a>.</p>

<h2>Applying for a visa or permit</h2>

<p>This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit to help you prepare, but you’ll need to check the exact rules and processes with Denmark’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a> or immigration authorities.</p>

<h3>Taking your family</h3>
<p>If you have a spouse, civil partner or cohabiting partner, and children under 18 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/You-want-to-apply/Family" rel="external">they can join you</a> with the permits in this guide. They will also be allowed to work in Denmark.</p>

<h3>Short and long-term permits</h3>

<p>You can get a short-term residence and work permit if you’ve been offered work with a company in Denmark that’s been <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/You-want-to-apply/Work/Certification/?anchor=1CD3374B94AE4039968A09EE304FE297&amp;callbackItem=B9144367D2334F96846AFDE18478DEEC&amp;callbackAnchor=45858563538B41608C9872058AD4A87D1CD3374B94AE4039968A09EE304FE297" rel="external">fast-track certified by SIRI</a>.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="#fast-track">fast-track scheme</a> makes it easier and quicker for certified companies in Denmark to recruit employees with special qualifications from outside Denmark.</p>

<p>You can also get a longer-term residence and work permit under the scheme.</p>

<p>You need to apply for a long-term permit if you’re in Denmark because you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#transfer">transferring long-term to a Danish branch of a UK-based company, or employed on a Danish contract</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#startup">a start-up entrepreneur</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#research">conducting research work</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#agriculture">working as a herdsperson or farm manager in agriculture</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#specialised">working as an artist, athlete or a specialised chef</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Long-term permits are valid for up to 4 years depending on which one you need.</p>

<p>If you’re self-employed you can only work in Denmark if you qualify for the <a class="govuk-link" href="#startup">Start-up Denmark</a> scheme.</p>

<h2>Short-term permit for employees of fast-track certified companies</h2>

<p>To qualify for a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/Applying/Work/Fast%20track" rel="external">fast-track certified permit</a> the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/You-want-to-apply/Work/Certification/?anchor=1CD3374B94AE4039968A09EE304FE297&amp;callbackItem=B9144367D2334F96846AFDE18478DEEC&amp;callbackAnchor=45858563538B41608C9872058AD4A87D1CD3374B94AE4039968A09EE304FE297" rel="external">company you work for must be certified</a>.</p>

<p>You must meet the same eligibility criteria as for the <a class="govuk-link" href="#pay-limit">pay limit scheme</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="#positive">positive list</a> work permits.</p>

<p>It normally takes 1 month to get, but you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/Applying/Work/Fast%20track" rel="external">apply for a quick job start</a>. With the quick job start scheme you can get an interim work permit while your application is processing.</p>

<p>It’s valid for up to 90 days in a year. You can use the 90 days across several stays in Denmark. You can’t extend it but there are longer-term permits available under the scheme.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>You need to check with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">Denmark’s embassy or consulate</a> on the exact process. This is a rough guide to help you prepare.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>You or your employer <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/You-want-to-apply/Work/Fast-track?anchor=howtoapply" rel="external">applies for your residence and work permit online to SIRI</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You attend a biometrics appointment at the Danish consulate in the UK, or at a biometrics centre in Denmark within 14 days of applying for your permit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ihcph.kk.dk/artikel/apply-your-cpr-number-here" rel="external">apply online for a central person register number (CPR) number</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You attend an appointment with the international citizens service in Denmark.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Application documents</h3>

<p>Danish authorities may request different documents at different stages of the process. Usually, they need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>copy of UK passport for you and any dependants, including all empty pages and the passport’s front and back cover</li>
  <li>proof of application fee payment</li>
  <li>employment contract, recent job offer, or assignment agreement (dated within 30 days), including salary information, employment conditions and a job description</li>
  <li>relevant degree or qualification certificates and transcripts</li>
  <li>marriage certificate, if married</li>
  <li>birth certificates of any children</li>
  <li>proof of accommodation in Denmark, such as a lease agreement (required after arrival)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Transferring to a branch in Denmark, or employed on a Danish contract</h2>
<p>You need to apply for one of the following permits if your UK-based employer is transferring you to a branch in Denmark, or if you’ve been offered employment with a company in Denmark:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#positive">Positive List residence and work permit for skills-shortage jobs</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#pay-limit">Pay Limit Scheme residence and work permit for high salary jobs</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Positive List</h3>
