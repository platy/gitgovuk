<p>For a period of two years from 1 January 2021, when determining an application for a Great Britain Marketing Authorisations (<abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr>), the MHRA may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission (<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>) on the approval of a new <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> in the centralised procedure.</p>

<p>Great Britain refers to England, Scotland and Wales.</p>

<p>This route – the <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> Decision Reliance Procedure (<abbr title="European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure">ECDRP</abbr>) - is available to <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> approved via the centralised procedure.</p>

<p>The intended operation of the <abbr title="European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure">ECDRP</abbr> is submission of the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the MHRA immediately on receipt of a positive Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (<abbr title="Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr>) opinion, although applications can be submitted any time after the approval of a European Union Marketing Authorisation.</p>

<p>The MHRA aims to determine the Great Britain <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> as soon as possible after <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> approval. A delay in submission may affect the delivery of a decision within the 67-day timeline.</p>

<h2>How to apply</h2>

<p>If the Applicant intends to apply for an <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> in Great Britain via the <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> Decision Reliance Procedure they should inform the MHRA at the earliest opportunity by emailing <a href="mailto:ECDRP@mhra.gov.uk" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure">ECDRP</abbr>@mhra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>If the company does not have a 5-digit company number, to allow registration on the MHRA Submissions Portal, then this should be requested from <a href="mailto:Reference.Data@mhra.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">Reference.Data@mhra.gov.uk</a>. A PLGB number can then be obtained through MHRA Submissions or by emailing <a href="mailto:PLNumberAllocation@mhra.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">PLNumberAllocation@mhra.gov.uk</a> prior to submission.</p>

<h3>Letter of intent</h3>

<p>To facilitate scheduling, prior to receiving a positive <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> opinion, companies should submit a ‘letter of intent to submit an <abbr title="European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure">ECDRP</abbr>’ to the MHRA at least 4 weeks before submission of the <abbr title="European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure">ECDRP</abbr> MAA. This should be submitted to the <a href="mailto:ECDRP@mhra.gov.uk" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure">ECDRP</abbr> mailbox</a> once a positive <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> opinion is anticipated, for example after receiving confirmation that no major concerns remain.</p>

<p>The letter should state when the company intends to submit the application and should be accompanied by all iterations of the <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> assessment reports that have been received to date.</p>

<p>The letter should also state whether the company intends to apply for an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/orphan-medicinal-products-in-great-britain">orphan designation</a> in Great Britain. Fees will be payable only after the dossier is received and not during this pre-procedure stage.</p>

<h3>MAA Submission</h3>

<p>On receipt of the positive <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> opinion, or as soon as possible after this date, the <abbr title="European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure">ECDRP</abbr> MAA should be submitted to the MHRA as one <a href="http://esubmission.ema.europa.eu/ectd/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">electronic Common Technical Document</a> sequence through <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-to-make-submissions-to-the-mhra" class="govuk-link">MHRA Submissions</a>.</p>

<p>The submission should include the entire dossier as reviewed by the <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> (and approved by the <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> if the <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> decision has already been received), including the full responses to <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> questions. If the entire dossier has already been submitted to the MHRA as Northern Ireland, and no changes are required for the <abbr title="European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure">ECDRP</abbr> MAA dossier, the dossier need not be submitted for the <abbr title="European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure">ECDRP</abbr> MAA.</p>

<p>The Working Documents Folder should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all iterations of the <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> assessment reports and the <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> opinion for the initial MAA and any subsequent variations,</li>
  <li>the proposed product information in Microsoft Word format.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Orphan designation</h3>
<p>If an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/orphan-medicinal-products-in-great-britain">orphan designation is sought</a>, the Great Britain Orphan Drug Designation Application Form should be submitted in module 1.2 of the <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr>. Email <a href="mailto:IPUenquiries@mhra.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">IPUenquiries@mhra.gov.uk</a> if you have any questions about submitting your application.</p>

<h3>Paediatric requirements</h3>
<p>For submissions which will trigger paediatric requirements, applicants should ensure the latest European Union and/or Great Britain-<abbr title="Paediatric Investigation Plan">PIP</abbr> / waiver opinion / decision or class waiver decision is included in the dossier. If the application has been subject to a European Union or Great Britain compliance check the outcome documents should be included in the dossier.</p>

<p>The applicant should also indicate any parallel, ongoing or previous applications containing paediatric data relevant for the full <abbr title="Paediatric Investigation Plan">PIP</abbr> compliance verification (if applicable). An overview table of the <abbr title="Paediatric Investigation Plan">PIP</abbr> results, indicating in which application(s) they were/are going to be submitted, status of the application(s), as well as their location in the present application must be included.</p>

<h3>Cover letter</h3>
<p>The cover letter accompanying the application should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>clearly state the regulatory route as <abbr title="European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure">ECDRP</abbr> to ensure appropriate handling, including the relevant procedure number for the centralised MAA.</li>
  <li>include a declaration of conformity of the Great Britain application with the dossier that received a positive opinion from the <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> (and was approved by the <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> if the <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> decision has already been received), including approved variations.</li>
  <li>include a declaration that all iterations of the <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> assessment reports and End of Procedure documents have been submitted. These assessment reports should also be listed.</li>
  <li>include a declaration that the proposed product information is identical to that which received a positive opinion from the <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> (and was approved by the <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> if the <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> decision has already been received), and that the product information in Microsoft Word format has been included with the submission.</li>
  <li>confirm that the Great Britain Orphan Drug Designation Application Form has been submitted in module 1.2 of the <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr>, if an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/orphan-medicinal-products-in-great-britain">orphan designation is sought</a>
</li>
  <li>indicate whether paediatric requirements will be triggered, and if so, that the paediatric information is included in the dossier. The applicant should indicate if this application has been subject to a European Union or Great Britain-<abbr title="Paediatric Investigation Plan">PIP</abbr> compliance check and confirm whether any <abbr title="Paediatric Investigation Plan">PIP</abbr> studies were due to initiate or complete since compliance verification.</li>
  <li>if the procedure includes an <abbr title="Active Substance Master File">ASMF</abbr>, include a declaration that the <abbr title="Active Substance Master File">ASMF</abbr> Holder has submitted the Applicant’s and Restricted Parts of the <abbr title="Active Substance Master File">ASMF</abbr>, including approved variations and all iterations of the assessment reports on the Applicant’s and Restricted Parts.</li>

  <li>state any conditions associated with the Marketing Authorisation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fees</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mhra-fees">submission will attract a fee</a>.</p>

<h2>Assessment procedure</h2>

<p>When a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/marketing-authorisation-application-submission-dates-for-150-days-national-and-european-commission-decision-reliance-procedures">submission is made</a> within 5 days of <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> positive opinion, the date of <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> positive opinion will be designated Day 0 of the <abbr title="European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure">ECDRP</abbr>, and the MHRA will aim to determine the Great Britain <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> as soon as possible after <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> approval, and by Day 67 at the latest provided that <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> decision has been received.</p>

<p>If the application is submitted more than 5 days after the <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> positive opinion, Day 0 of the <abbr title="European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure">ECDRP</abbr> will be the date of MAA validation, and determination may be delayed.</p>

<p>All applications will be reviewed to ensure they comply with Great Britain regulatory requirements, including those related to Great Britain <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reference-medicinal-products-rmps">Reference Medicinal Products</a>, product name, labelling, patient information legibility, supply status, controlled drug scheduling where necessary, and paediatric and orphan medicine requirements, where relevant.</p>

<p>Any concerns relating to the approvability in Great Britain will be raised with the Applicant at the earliest opportunity. If it is found during the assessment phase that the dossier is incomplete or assessment reports have been omitted, this will be raised as a Point for Clarification, and may cause a delay to the timetable.</p>

<p>The Applicant is responsible for confirming the <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> decision to the MHRA; the <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> decision letter should be forwarded to the <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ECDRP@mhra.gov.uk"><abbr title="European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure">ECDRP</abbr> mailbox</a> on the day that it is received.</p>

<p>For orphan medicines, the Applicant is also responsible for confirming the <abbr title="Committee on Orphan Medicinal Products">COMP</abbr> (Committee on Orphan Medicinal Products) decision using the <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ECDRP@mhra.gov.uk"><abbr title="European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure">ECDRP</abbr> mailbox</a>. Any delay in providing these confirmations will impact the timing of the Great Britain application determination.</p>

<p>Any issues identified during assessment will be communicated to the applicant by Day 46 and should be resolvable within the 67-day timetable without clock-stop.</p>

<h2>If Major Objections are raised</h2>

<p>If Major Objections are identified or substantial amendments to the product information are necessary, the timetable will move to the standard National Procedure timetable. It is anticipated that this will be necessary only on rare occasions.</p>
