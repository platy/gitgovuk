<p>This guide is for successful applicants who have been awarded a Farming Transformation Fund (<abbr title="Farming Transformation Fund">FTF</abbr>) grant. It explains the steps you must follow to comply with the funding rules for your grant.</p>

<h2>About your Grant Funding Agreement</h2>

<p>Your Grant Funding Agreement (<abbr title="Grant Funding Agreement">GFA</abbr>) is the legally binding agreement between the agreement holder and the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>). It contains:</p>

<p>Part 1: agreement letter and annexes</p>

<p>Part 2: terms and conditions</p>

<p>You should read both parts of your <abbr title="Grant Funding Agreement">GFA</abbr> carefully and in full, so that you understand your legal rights and responsibilities under the agreement.</p>

<p>If you need more information about your agreement or if you think your project is not on track to meet the conditions, outputs, or payment profile, you should contact your project management team (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) as soon as possible.</p>

<p>These terms are used in the <abbr title="Farming Transformation Fund">FTF</abbr> application process:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Term used</th>
      <th scope="col">Definition</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>The applicant</td>
      <td>applies for an <abbr title="Farming Transformation Fund">FTF</abbr> grant</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>The agreement holder</td>
      <td>is the person in overall control of the project and who takes responsibility for meeting the <abbr title="Farming Transformation Fund">FTF</abbr> rules. In most cases, the single point of contact for the project is the agreement holder.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>The project management team</td>
      <td>is the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> team you contact for your project. The contact details are in your <abbr title="Farming Transformation Fund">FTF</abbr> <abbr title="Grant Funding Agreement">GFA</abbr>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>The agreement</td>
      <td>is a legally binding grant funding agreement between the agreement holder and <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>. It’s made up of: <br>- Part 1: agreement letter and annexes<br>- Part 2: terms and conditions</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The important points of your agreement letter and annexes in Part 1 include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the total expenditure, which is eligible for funding, a list of items eligible for grant funding and the grant rate (%)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>details of your grant claims by date and amount, based on the information in your application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the outputs which your project should achieve and any special conditions you must meet</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must meet the terms and conditions in Part 2 as a condition of receiving the grant.</p>

<p>You should read both parts of your agreement carefully and in full, so that you understand your legal rights and responsibilities under the agreement.</p>

<p>If you need more information about your agreement or it seems that your project is not on track to meet conditions, outputs, or financial profile, you should contact your project management team as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>How VAT is handled</h3>

<p>Your <abbr title="Grant Funding Agreement">GFA</abbr> tells you how VAT will be handled in the project. This is based on the information you gave in your application. If your VAT status changes within the period of the contract, you must tell <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> straight away. If you do not, we may recover funds.</p>

<p>Agreement holders are fully responsible for their own VAT affairs.</p>

<h3>Your Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>) number</h3>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> uses the <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr> number you registered your business against to pay your claims. You must make sure that your business bank details are also registered with <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>, otherwise payment of your claim will be delayed. If you need to check that we have your business bank details, please call us on 03000 200 301.</p>

<h2>Submitting claims</h2>

<p>You should follow the claims schedule in Part 1 of your agreement to submit claims.</p>

<h3>When to make a claim</h3>

<p>You can submit a claim earlier than the scheduled date.</p>

<p>If you think there will be a delay in submitting any claims, you must discuss this with <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> as soon as possible. In some circumstances <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> may agree to a written request to delay the timing of your claim.</p>

<h3>Completing the claim form</h3>

<p>You must keep accurate records of all expenditure which you wish to claim grant on.</p>

<p>You will receive a claim form that must be completed by the person(s) who signed the agreement or someone who has permission to ‘Make legal changes’ or ‘Full permissions’ for the business as detailed on the Rural Payments service.</p>

<p>More guidance on making a claim will be published when available.</p>

<p>Expenditure is eligible where it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contributes directly to the operation and delivery of the project</li>
  <li>is listed in Part 1 of your agreement</li>
  <li>is exclusively for the project</li>
  <li>is incurred after the project start date</li>
  <li>is for items which have been fully paid for by the agreement holder business and evidence is provided with the claim, for example, the business bank statement</li>
</ul>

<p>Payments will not be accepted if they are made from personal accounts or a different business account.</p>

<h3>Supporting your claim</h3>

<p>You must provide the following documents to support your claim.</p>

<h4>Invoices</h4>

<p>You must include invoices that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fully describe the work done and cost out each item, or describes work separately</li>
  <li>are addressed to the same person or business as detailed in the <abbr title="Grant Funding Agreement">GFA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>show the supplier’s name, address, VAT number and date</li>
</ul>

<p>If an invoice is emailed to you from a supplier, you should forward the original email with the invoice attached.</p>

<h4>Bank statements</h4>

<p>You must submit original or true copies of business bank statements showing the invoice payment being made and the cheque number of the payment, if applicable.</p>

<p>You can submit screenshots from an online account showing payment details and bank logos, or a certified report printed from a banking system. <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> cannot accept edited bank statements.</p>

<p>Bank statements should include the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bank’s name and logo</li>
  <li>account holder’s name in full</li>
  <li>account number</li>
  <li>sort code</li>
  <li>transaction date</li>
  <li>transaction type (including payee ref and cheque number)</li>
  <li>transaction amount</li>
  <li>date bank evidence generated</li>
</ul>

<h4>BACS payments</h4>

<p>For BACS payments, <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will need to see the full audit trail including the report that details all of the invoices in the BACS payment. <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will only need to see the invoices that relate to the claim.</p>

<h4>Credit card purchases</h4>

<p>For items purchased by credit cards, you will need to show that the item has been purchased in full by a credit card linked to the agreement holder business. If any other credit card is used, there must be evidence to show that the item is transferred to the ownership of the agreement holder before a claim is made.</p>

<h4>Hire purchase</h4>

<p>For items paid for by hire purchase, you will only be able to claim for these items once the final instalment has been made and the item is delivered and in your ownership.</p>

<h4>Deposits</h4>

<p>Deposits – you can only claim for deposits on items if you have previously discussed and agreed them with us and they are outlined in your agreement. These deposits should not be more than 40% of the value of the item.</p>

<h4>Multiple invoices or payments</h4>

<p>Where an invoice includes a number of items but not all are eligible, you must explain which items you intend to claim for on that invoice. <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will only pay grants for these eligible items. Invoices must be paid in full.</p>

<p>If you’ve made a payment to a supplier that covers more than one invoice, you need to provide copies of all the invoices included in the payment.</p>

<h4>Payments in any other currency</h4>

<p>If your claim includes payments made in any currency other than pound (£) sterling, you will need to convert these to pound (£) sterling on your claim form using the exchange rate on the date the invoice was paid. Find the  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-exchange-rates-for-2022-monthly">exchange rate using HMRC exchange rates</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>If the exchange rate on the day the invoice was paid means you have paid less than the cost listed in part 1 of your agreement, this is the amount you are eligible to claim. If the exchange rate on the day the invoice was paid means you have paid more than the cost listed in part 1 of your agreement, you can only claim grant up to the amount offered in pound (£) sterling in your agreement for the work or item.</p>

<h4>Cash payments</h4>

<p>You must not make cash payments for any items on which you wish to claim grant. This is because you cannot provide a satisfactory audit trail for cash payments. <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will reject cash payments included in your grant claim.</p>

<h4>Asset Register</h4>

<p>The Asset Register records capital assets bought as part of the project. You should keep this for a minimum of 5 years from the final payment date and submit a copy as part of the final claim submission.</p>

<h4>Record keeping</h4>

<p>As evidence of project outputs, you will need to keep a full record of project progress and collect evidence of the outputs, milestones and conditions achieved. This information will need to be provided with grant claims.</p>

<h3>How <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> process your claim</h3>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will check your claim form and supporting evidence and may need to ask you for more information in support of your claim.</p>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> aims to pay complete claims within 30 working days. You may need to account for this if it will affect the cash flow of your project or business. Claims that are incomplete or need a site visit may take longer to process.</p>

<p>For projects with more than one claim, <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will make the final payment once the project is complete. This will be for at least 15% of your total grant.</p>

<p>You must follow the payment profile set out in your agreement and make sure that the minimum claim value is not less than £2,000. You must not claim more than 85% of your grant before the final claim. If you claim more than the amount profiled for each budget heading, or for each claim, we will reduce your grant accordingly.</p>

<p>If you have any other queries when preparing your claim, please contact <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> for advice.</p>

<h2>Errors and late claims</h2>

<p>If you make a mistake, you can resubmit your claim form if <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> has not already told you about the error. If you have any questions or concerns about completing the claim form correctly, contact <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> before you submit your claim.</p>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will work out the claim payment on what is eligible in the claim. If there are errors, it will remove any ineligible amounts from the claim.</p>

<p>If your claim does not reach <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> on time, is incomplete or not in accordance with the scheme rules and guidance, then it may take enforcement action, such as withholding payment or reducing part or all of your grant.</p>

<h2>Progress reports by the agreement holder</h2>

<p>You must start the grant funded project within 3 months of the start date in your agreement. You must discuss any delay in the start date with <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> as soon as possible. In some circumstances <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> may agree to a written request to change the timing of the start date.</p>

<p>You must complete progress reports and provide evidence of the outputs and conditions met for the duration of the <abbr title="Grant Funding Agreement">GFA</abbr>.</p>

<p>More guidance on completing progress reports and providing evidence of outputs and conditions met will be published when available.</p>

<h2>Report a change of circumstance</h2>

<p>You must notify <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> as soon as possible and request a variation to your contract of any change of circumstance which might affect your project or <abbr title="Grant Funding Agreement">GFA</abbr>. This should be before the change takes place. <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will assess all variation requests and write to you with the results.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> agrees to the change, it will write to you and inform you of any changes to your agreement.</p>

<p>In some cases, <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> may need more information before making a decision. For example, if you want to use a different supplier from the preferred supplier identified in your application, you will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure that any new supplier meets the requirements in the ‘How to fill in a full application’ guidance</li>
  <li>submit a quote from the new supplier for the same specification of item or works</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you receive written consent before making any changes. In some cases, you will receive a ‘variation acknowledgment’ from us. You must complete the form and return it to <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> may refuse to pay your claim, or it may reclaim payments if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you make changes without written consent</li>
  <li>there is a change of circumstance that affects the progress of the project</li>
  <li>you do not comply with the grant agreement</li>
  <li>you’re not entitled to the payment</li>
</ul>

<p>You must continue to notify <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> of changes for 5 years after the date of your final grant payment.</p>

<p>You must notify <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> before:</p>

<ul>
  <li>making any changes in the ownership of the business that applied for grant aid</li>
  <li>making any changes in the ownership of the grant aided items</li>
  <li>the business or grant aided enterprise/activity ceases trading or fundamentally changes the nature of its activities</li>
  <li>any grant aided assets are sold, become redundant, or cease to be used for the purpose for which they were grant aided</li>
  <li>granting any legal charge over any land or other asset funded in whole or in part by the grant</li>
</ul>

<p>If you make changes to your project during the term of your agreement without our prior consent, the grant may be reclaimed pro-rata, effective for 5 years from the date of your final grant payment.</p>

<h2>Good reasons for a breach of agreement</h2>

<p>If the delivery of your project is affected by events outside your control which leads to a breach of the agreement, you must write to <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> as soon as possible but no longer than 8 weeks after the event.</p>

<p>Examples of good reasons for a breach may include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>natural events, such as prolonged adverse weather conditions, flooding, or animal or plant disease</li>
  <li>if you are seriously ill</li>
  <li>the death of an agreement holder</li>
  <li>unforeseen loss of management control of land, for example when a tenancy is terminated, or because of the compulsory purchase of land by a third party</li>
  <li>financial circumstances, such as bankruptcy</li>
  <li>supply chain problems - you must provide evidence of this</li>
  <li>criminal damage by a third party, such as arson or vandalism</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re aware of the issue when entering into your agreement, it is unlikely <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will consider it to be a good reason for a breach.</p>

<p>You should explain the circumstances of your case and include any documentary evidence to support this.</p>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will consider any breach on a case-by-case basis and decide whether to relieve the agreement holder of their obligation(s) under the agreement or if enforcement action is required.</p>

<h2>Breaching your agreement</h2>

<p>If you breach your agreement and it is not deemed to be a reason outside of your control, or if you have committed an offence, <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will investigate and may withhold grant payments until it has made a decision. It will keep you informed and allow you to make a representation before it reaches its decision.</p>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will decide on the severity of the breach before deciding on what action it will take. <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> could:</p>

<ul>

<h2>Keeping records and site visits</h2>

<p>The agreement holder must keep all project records for at least 7 years from the date of the final payment of grant. This includes invoices, receipts and bank statements and information related to project outputs.</p>

<p>Defra, <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>, or an organisation appointed by them, may complete a site visit during the lifetime of the project to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>track expenditure through your records and bank statements</li>
  <li>check all <abbr title="Farming Transformation Fund">FTF</abbr> grant funded buildings and equipment</li>
  <li>interview the person who has managed the project</li>
  <li>check staff records, if appropriate</li>
</ul>

<p>You will also need to provide evidence that the project is meeting the agreed outputs described in your agreement.</p>

<h2>Post-payment monitoring</h2>

<p>When your project is complete and all grant payments have been made, you will need to submit a post-payment monitoring report to us. You will be sent a template to complete at appropriate timescales compared to your outputs or project specific conditions. This is your opportunity to tell us how your project is progressing against the outputs agreed in your agreement.</p>

<h2>Publicity requirements</h2>

<p>You need to follow any guidance from <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> about acknowledgement and publicity of the grant. This includes using templates or materials if provided. It may also include a statement on an agreement holder’s business website or poster, plaque or billboard on their land or premises.</p>
