<h2>
<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID Pass - show your COVID-19 vaccination status</h2>

<p>An <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID Pass shows your coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination details or test results. This is your COVID-19 vaccination status.</p>

<p>You can use the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID Pass to prove your vaccination status when you enter another country while travelling abroad.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h2>Before booking a flight</h2>

<p>Before you book an international flight, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">government travel advice for the latest information on COVID-19 entry requirements and travel warnings</a> for the country you are travelling to</li>
  <li>check <a href="#covid-19-testing-and-quarantine" class="govuk-link">what you will need to do if you will be returning to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a>
</li>
  <li>speak to your travel insurer</li>
</ul>

<p>Where possible, your airline will inform you on measures to minimise transmission of coronavirus.</p>

<p>In line with other medical conditions, airlines have the right to refuse travel to anyone they believe is not fit to fly.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> test and trace</h3>

<p>You must not travel if you have been advised that you must self-isolate by the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> test and trace service:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works" class="govuk-link">test and trace in England</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-and-contact-tracing" class="govuk-link" rel="external">test and trace in Northern Ireland</a></li>

  <li><a href="https://gov.wales/contact-tracing" class="govuk-link" rel="external">test and trace in Wales</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You should not travel if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are experiencing any <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms" rel="external" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 symptoms</a> or have in the last 7 days, even if your symptoms are mild</li>
  <li>are self-isolating as a result of COVID-19 symptoms</li>
  <li>are sharing a household with somebody who has experienced COVID-19 symptoms in the past 10 days</li>
</ul>

<h2>Online check-in</h2>

<p>Where possible, check in online to avoid face-to-face contact at the airport.</p>

<p>You are strongly encouraged to check in baggage to the aircraft hold and minimise any hand baggage. This will speed up boarding and disembarking and minimise the risk of transmission.</p>

<p>Make sure any luggage you intend to check in does not contain any lithium batteries (in equipment such as laptops, or stand-alone batteries such as powerbanks), valuable or essential items (such as cash, credit cards, keys and medicines), or other prohibited items.</p>

<p>Follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers#public-transport" class="govuk-link">safer travel guidance</a> during your journey to the airport.</p>

<h2>Arriving at the airport</h2>

<p>Non-passengers should only enter the airport where needed. For example, accompanying or picking up a passenger requiring assistance, such as a disabled person or an unaccompanied child.</p>

<p>In England, it is a legal requirement to wear face coverings at airports. Some people, including children under 11, are exempt from having to wear face coverings. Anyone with a health condition or disability, which means they cannot wear a face covering, has a reasonable excuse for not wearing a face covering.</p>

  <li><a href="https://gov.wales/face-coverings-guidance-public" class="govuk-link" rel="external">face coverings in Wales</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Customers should follow the rules and guidance set by transport operators during all stages of their journey.</p>

</ul>

<h2>At check-in</h2>

<p>Where possible, avoid touching surfaces in the airport. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds after using self-service check-in, luggage trollies and other frequently touched surfaces.</p>

<p>Depending on the airport you fly from and where you are flying to, you may need to have your temperature checked before flying.</p>

<h2>At the security checkpoint</h2>

<p>Follow advice in the airport to prepare for security checks.</p>

<h2>At the departure lounge/ terminal airside area/ arrival areas</h2>

<p>Where possible, avoid walking around the airport and mixing with people you do not normally meet.</p>

<p>In shops at the airport, where possible, pay by contactless card.</p>

<h2>On board the aircraft</h2>

<p>Your airline will advise you on measures in place for your flight.</p>

<p>In England it is recommended and expected that passengers wear face coverings onboard aircraft.</p>

<p>In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland passengers must wear a face covering onboard aircraft.</p>

<p>During the flight, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>remain seated as much as possible</li>
  <li>follow instructions and guidance from crew</li>
  <li>use contactless payment where possible</li>
  <li>be aware there is likely to be a reduced food and drink service</li>
  <li>make the cabin crew aware if you become ill</li>
</ul>

<h2>On arrival in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</h2>

<p>What coronavirus (COVID-19) testing and quarantine rules you need to follow depends on your vaccination status and where you have been in the 10 days before you arrive. Find out what to do if youâ€™re:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h2>Transiting through England</h2>

<p>There are different rules for <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-international-travel-quarantine/pages/overview" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Scotland</a>, <a href="https://gov.wales/rules-foreign-travel-and-wales-coronavirus-covid-19-html" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Wales</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-travel-advice" rel="external">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>Passing through an airport in England as part of an international journey is called â€˜transitingâ€™.</p>

<p>What you need to do when you transit through England depends on whether you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>transit <a class="govuk-link" href="#airside-transit">airside</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="#landside-transit">landside</a>
</li>
  <li>qualify as fully vaccinated for travel to England</li>
  <li>have been in a red list country in the 10 days before you arrive</li>
</ul>

<p>The rules are different if <a class="govuk-link" href="#within-uk">your final destination is within the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, Ireland, Channel Islands or the Isle of Man</a>.</p>

<h3>Airside transit</h3>

<p>Airside transit is when you do not pass through <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> border control. You remain â€˜airsideâ€™ before you leave the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> on your connecting journey.</p>

<p>If you transit airside, you do not need to take a COVID-19 test before you travel to England if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>qualify as fully vaccinated for travel to England</li>
  <li>have not been in a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories">red list country or territory</a> in the 10 days before you arrive in England</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not qualify as fully vaccinated or you have been in a red list country, you need to take a COVID-19 test in the 3 days before you travel to England.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19#check-if-you-qualify-as-fully-vaccinated">Check separate guidance to see if you qualify as fully vaccinated for travel to England</a>.</p>

<p>You do not need to complete a passenger locator form before travel to England.</p>

<p>When you are in England you do not need to quarantine or take any COVID-19 travel tests.</p>

<h3>Landside transit</h3>

<p>Landside transit is when you pass throughâ€¯<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>â€¯border control on arrival, but you leave theâ€¯<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>â€¯shortly after (usually within 24 hours). You may leave from the same airport, railway station or port where you arrived, or from a different one, so long as you travel directly to that port of departure.</p>

<p>If you transit landside, you do not need to take a COVID-19 test before you travel to England if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>qualify as fully vaccinated for travel to England</li>
  <li>have not been in a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories">red list country or territory</a> in the 10 days before you arrive in England</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not qualify as fully vaccinated or you have been in a red list country, you need to take a COVID-19 test in the 3 days before you travel to England.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19#check-if-you-qualify-as-fully-vaccinated">Check separate guidance to see if you qualify as fully vaccinated for travel to England</a>.</p>

<p>You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk">complete a passenger locator form</a> before you travel to England.</p>

<p>You need to do the following when you complete your passenger locator form.</p>

<ul>
  <li>select â€˜Stay in theâ€¯<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>â€™ under the Your travel plans section</li>
  <li>reply â€˜I will be travelling for an exempt reasonâ€™ to the question about whether you are required to self-isolate on arrival</li>

<p>You must either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>remain within your port of entry until your departure from England</li>
  <li>travel directly from your port of entry to another port of departure in England</li>

<h3>Travelling on within the Common Travel Area (<abbr title="common travel area - Ireland, the UK, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man">CTA</abbr>) after an international journey</h3>

<p>If you will be travelling on from England to Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, the Channel Island or the Isle of Man after an international journey, you must follow the rules for testing and quarantine in those places.</p>

<p>If you have been in a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories">red list country</a> in the 10 days before you arrive, you must quarantine in a managed hotel at the airport where you arrive in England.</p>

<h2>Social distancing</h2>

<p>Social distancing rules apply in airports between disembarkation andâ€¯border control. This is toâ€¯manage the risk of variants of concern being transmitted between individuals and imported into the country.</p>

<p>The risk of transmission increases the closer you are to another person with COVID-19 and the longer you spend in close contact. Wherever possible and practical, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep 2 metres away from people outside your household or support bubble, where relevant</li>
  <li>minimise the time you spend near other people</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow instructions from airport and airline staff, which may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where to sit</li>
  <li>how to queue when getting off the plane or when waiting to pass through the border</li>
  <li>instructions on screens, barriers or floor markings</li>
  <li>requests to move to less busy areas</li>
</ul>

<h2>Social contact</h2>

<p>There are different rules about social contact in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Read more about:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h2>Hand washing</h2>

<p>Washing your hands is one of the most effective ways to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wash your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after touching surfaces, for example, luggage trolley handles, self-service check-in and security trays</li>
  <li>use hand sanitiser if hand washing facilities are not available</li>
  <li>be aware of the surfaces you touch</li>
  <li>be careful not to touch your face, mouth or eyes</li>
  <li>cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow when coughing or sneezing</li>
  <li>consider bringing your own supply of hand sanitiser for the flight, within the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/hand-luggage-restrictions" class="govuk-link">hand luggage restrictions for liquids</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Face coverings</h2>

<h3>At the airport</h3>

<p>In England, it is a legal requirement to wear face coverings at airports. Some people, including children under 11, are exempt from having to wear face coverings. Anyone with a health condition or disability, which means they cannot wear a face covering, has a reasonable excuse for not wearing a face covering.</p>

<p>Read more about:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-face-coverings" class="govuk-link" rel="external">face coverings in Northern Ireland</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-public-use-of-face-coverings/" rel="external">face coverings in Scotland</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/face-coverings-guidance-public" class="govuk-link">face coverings in Wales</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Customers should follow the rules and guidance set by transport operators during all stages of their journey.</p>

<h3>On board aircraft</h3>

<p>In England, it is recommended and expected that you wear a face covering during commercial air flights. Airlines are free to determine their own face coverings policy based on their own health and safety risk assessments. Customers should follow the rules and guidance set by transport operators during all stages of their journey.</p>

<p>In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, you must wear a face covering on board commercial air flights.</p>

<h3>People who donâ€™t have to wear a face covering</h3>

<p>Some people donâ€™t have to wear a face covering, for reasons of health, age or equality. See more information about:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-face-coverings" class="govuk-link">people who donâ€™t have to wear a face covering in Northern Ireland</a></li>

</ul>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information" role="note">
<p>Government and some operators have produced <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">cards and badges</a> that you can choose to wear or carry to show you are not wearing one for a specific reason.</p>
</div>

<p>There is no requirement to do this, though, and transport staff should not ordinarily ask for such evidence.</p>

<p>You should remove your face covering if asked to do so by police, border control or airport security.</p>

<p>It is important toâ€¯<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#how-to-wear-a-face-covering">use face coverings properly</a>. Wash or sanitise your hands before putting them on and after taking them off. Store face coverings hygienically when not in use.</p>

<p>You should bring your own face covering for use throughout your journey. Bring spare face coverings for longer journeys.</p>

<p>Bring plastic bags to store used face coverings and dispose of them properly. Use a â€˜black bagâ€™ waste bin or litter bin to dispose of face coverings. You should not put face coverings in a recycling bin or drop them as litter.</p>

<p>Some international destinations may require different face coverings or masks to theâ€¯<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> â€“ you should check before you travel.</p>

<p>Be aware that wearing a face covering may make it harder for people who rely on lip reading, facial expressions and clear sound to understand.</p>
