<h3>Transiting within the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, Ireland, Channel Islands or Isle of Man</h3>

<p>Read about what you need to do if you are <a class="govuk-link" href="#transiting-through-england">transiting within the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, Ireland, Channel Islands and Isle of Man after international travel</a>.</p>

<h2>Before booking a flight</h2>

<p>Before you book an international flight, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">government travel advice for the latest information on COVID-19 entry requirements and travel warnings</a> for the country you are travelling to</li>
  <li>check <a class="govuk-link" href="#covid-19-testing-and-quarantine">what you will need to do if you will be returning to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a>
</li>
  <li>speak to your travel insurer</li>
</ul>

<p>Where possible, your airline will inform you on measures to minimise transmission of coronavirus.</p>

<p>In line with other medical conditions, airlines have the right to refuse travel to anyone they believe is not fit to fly.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> test and trace</h3>

<p>You must not travel if you have been advised that you must self-isolate by the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> test and trace service:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works">test and trace in England</a></li>

  <li><a href="https://gov.wales/contact-tracing" rel="external" class="govuk-link">test and trace in Wales</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You should not travel if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are experiencing any <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms" rel="external" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 symptoms</a> or have in the last 7 days, even if your symptoms are mild</li>
  <li>are self-isolating as a result of COVID-19 symptoms</li>
  <li>are sharing a household or support bubble with somebody who has experienced COVID-19 symptoms in the past 10 days</li>
</ul>

<h2>Online check-in</h2>

<p>Where possible, check in online to avoid face-to-face contact at the airport.</p>

<p>You are strongly encouraged to check in baggage to the aircraft hold and minimise any hand baggage. This will speed up boarding and disembarking and minimise the risk of transmission.</p>

<p>Make sure any luggage you intend to check in does not contain any lithium batteries (in equipment such as laptops, or stand-alone batteries such as powerbanks), valuable or essential items (such as cash, credit cards, keys and medicines), or other prohibited items.</p>

<p>Follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers#public-transport" class="govuk-link">safer travel guidance</a> during your journey to the airport.</p>

<h2>Arriving at the airport</h2>

<p>Non-passengers should only enter the airport where needed. For example, accompanying or picking up a passenger requiring assistance, such as a disabled person or an unaccompanied child.</p>

<p>In England, the legal requirements to wear a face covering have been lifted in all settings. However, the government still recommends and expects that people wear face coverings in enclosed and crowded spaces where they come into contact with people they donâ€™t normally meet â€“ such as at airports and on public or international transport.</p>

<p>Airports are free to determine their own face coverings policy based on their health and safety risk assessments. Customers should follow the rules and guidance set by transport operators during all stages of their journey.</p>

<p>In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland you must wear a face covering in airports.</p>

<p>Read more about:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h2>At check-in</h2>

<p>Where possible, avoid touching surfaces in the airport. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds after using self-service check-in, luggage trollies and other frequently touched surfaces.</p>

<p>Depending on the airport you fly from and where you are flying to, you may need to have your temperature checked before flying.</p>

<h2>At the security checkpoint</h2>

<p>Follow advice in the airport to prepare for security checks.</p>

<h2>At the departure lounge/ terminal airside area/ arrival areas</h2>

<p>Where possible, avoid walking around the airport and mixing with people you do not normally meet.</p>

<p>In shops at the airport, where possible, pay by contactless card.</p>

<h2>On board the aircraft</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> has a wide range of aircraft flying to many different international and domestic destinations. Measures to control COVID-19 transmission will depend on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the technical features of your aircraft</li>
  <li>any specific requirements of your destination</li>
  <li>the individual risk controls identified by your airline</li>
</ul>

<p>Your airline will advise you on measures in place for your flight.</p>

<p>In England it is recommended and expected that passengers wear face coverings onboard aircraft.</p>

<p>In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland passengers must wear a face covering onboard aircraft.</p>

<p>During the flight, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>remain seated as much as possible</li>
  <li>follow instructions and guidance from crew</li>
  <li>use contactless payment where possible</li>
  <li>be aware there is likely to be a reduced food and drink service</li>
  <li>make the cabin crew aware if you become ill</li>
</ul>

<h2>On arrival in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</h2>

<p>What coronavirus (COVID-19) testing and quarantine rules you need to follow depends on where you have been in the 10 days before you arrive. Find out what to do if youâ€™re:</p>

<h2>Transiting through England</h2>

<p>There are different rules for <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-international-travel-quarantine/pages/what-you-must-do" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Scotland</a>, <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/rules-foreign-travel-and-wales-coronavirus-covid-19-html">Wales</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-travel-advice" rel="external">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>Passing through an airport in England while on the way to another country is called â€˜transitingâ€™. Some travellers call it a â€˜layoverâ€™.</p>

<p>There are 2 types of transiting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>â€˜airsideâ€™ - you do not pass through <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> border control before you leave on your connecting journey</li>
  <li>â€˜landsideâ€™ - you do pass through <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> border control, but come back through it and leave the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> within a short amount of time (usually 24 hours)</li>

<p>If you will be transiting through England, you need to complete the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk">passenger locator form</a>.</p>

<p>You will also need to take a COVID-19 test in the 3 days before you travel, if you either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do not <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19#check-if-you-qualify-as-fully-vaccinated">qualify as fully vaccinated for travel to England</a>
</li>
  <li>have been in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories">a red list country</a> in the 10 days before you arrive in England</li>
</ul>

<p>If you will be transiting landside through England you need to do the following when you complete your passenger locator form.</p>

<ul>
  <li>select â€˜Stay in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>â€™ under the Your travel plans section</li>
  <li>reply â€˜I will be travelling for an exempt reasonâ€™ to the question about whether you are required to self-isolate on arrival</li>
  <li>select the Exemption options, and then select â€˜Transit Exemptionâ€™</li>
</ul>

<p>This includes if you are transiting onto the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. You may need to show evidence of onward travel and where you will be staying at the border .</p>

<h3>When you transit through England to international destinations</h3>

<p>You do not need to quarantine on arrival or take a COVID-19 test on or before day 2 and day 8. This applies if you are transiting airside or landside.</p>

<p>You must either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>remain within your port of entry until your departure from England, or</li>
  <li>travel directly from your port of entry to another port of departure in England</li>
</ul>

<h3>Travelling on within the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, Ireland, the Channel Islands and Isle of Man</h3>

<p>If you will be travelling on to Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, the Channel Island or the Isle of Man, you must follow the rules for testing and quarantine in those places.</p>

<p>If you have been in a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories">a red list country</a> in the 10 days before you arrive, you must quarantine in a managed hotel at the airport where you arrive in England.</p>

<p>You should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/booking-and-staying-in-a-quarantine-hotel-when-you-arrive-in-england">book your managed hotel package</a> before you travel.</p>

<h2>Travelling within the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</h2>

<h2>Social distancing</h2>

<p>Social distancing rules are being lifted in the vast majority of settings, but still applies in airports between disembarkation andâ€¯border controlâ€¯in order toâ€¯manage the risk of variants of concern being transmitted between individuals and imported into the country.</p>

<p>The risk of transmission increases the closer you are to another person with COVID-19 and the longer you spend in close contact. Wherever possible and practical, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep 2 metres away from people outside your household or support bubble, where relevant</li>
  <li>minimise the time you spend near other people</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow instructions from airport and airline staff, which may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where to sit</li>
  <li>how to queue when getting off the plane or when waiting to pass through the border</li>
  <li>instructions on screens, barriers or floor markings</li>
  <li>requests to move to less busy areas</li>
</ul>

<h2>Social contact</h2>

<p>There are different rules about social contact in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Read more about:</p>

</ul>

<h2>Hand washing</h2>

<p>Washing your hands is one of the most effective ways to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wash your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after touching surfaces, for example, luggage trolley handles, self-service check-in and security trays</li>
  <li>use hand sanitiser if hand washing facilities are not available</li>
  <li>be aware of the surfaces you touch</li>
  <li>be careful not to touch your face, mouth or eyes</li>
  <li>cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow when coughing or sneezing</li>
  <li>consider bringing your own supply of hand sanitiser for the flight, within the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/hand-luggage-restrictions" class="govuk-link">hand luggage restrictions for liquids</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Face coverings</h2>

<h3>At the airport</h3>

<p>In England, the legal requirements to wear a face covering have been lifted in all settings. However, the government still recommends and expects that people wear face coverings in enclosed and crowded spaces where they come into contact with people they donâ€™t normally meet â€“ such as at airports and on public or international transport.</p>

<p>Airports are free to determine their own face coverings policy based on their own health and safety risk assessments. Customers should follow the rules and guidance set by transport operators during all stages of their journey.</p>

<p>In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland you must wear a face covering in airports.</p>

</ul>

<h3>On board aircraft</h3>

<p>In England, it is recommended and expected that you wear a face covering during commercial air flights. Airlines are free to determine their own face coverings policy based on their own health and safety risk assessments. Customers should follow the rules and guidance set by transport operators during all stages of their journey.</p>

<p>In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, you must wear a face covering on board commercial air flights.</p>

<h3>People who donâ€™t have to wear a face covering</h3>

<p>Some people donâ€™t have to wear a face covering, for reasons of health, age or equality. See more information about:</p>

</ul>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information" role="note">
<p>Government and some operators have produced <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">cards and badges</a> that you can choose to wear or carry to show you are not wearing one for a specific reason.</p>
</div>

<p>There is no requirement to do this, though, and transport staff should not ordinarily ask for such evidence.</p>

<p>You should remove your face covering if asked to do so by police, border control or airport security.</p>

<p>It is important toâ€¯<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#how-to-wear-a-face-covering">use face coverings properly</a>. Wash or sanitise your hands before putting them on and after taking them off. Store face coverings hygienically when not in use.</p>

<p>You should bring your own face covering for use throughout your journey. Bring spare face coverings for longer journeys.</p>

<p>Bring plastic bags to store used face coverings and dispose of them properly. Use a â€˜black bagâ€™ waste bin or litter bin to dispose of face coverings. You should not put face coverings in a recycling bin or drop them as litter.</p>

<p>Some international destinations may require different face coverings or masks to theâ€¯<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> â€“ you should check before you travel.</p>

<p>Be aware that wearing a face covering may make it harder for people who rely on lip reading, facial expressions and clear sound to understand.</p>
