<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This guide explains how to complete 2021 to 2022 P11D and P11D(b) forms.</p>

<p>Submitting your P11D and P11D(b) Online is faster and more secure.</p>

<p>You can use either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>commercial software</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/paye-online">PAYE online service</a> service</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find out more detailed information about expenses and benefits in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/480-expenses-and-benefits-a-tax-guide">480 expenses and benefits guide</a>.</p>

<p>You do not need to submit a P11D form for an employee if youâ€™re paying tax on all their benefits through your payroll.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll still need to submit a P11D(b) form so you can pay any Class 1A National Insurance you owe.</p>

<h3>When you need to complete a P11D form</h3>

<p>At the end of each tax year, you must provide details about any employees or directors (including their families or households) you have given:</p>

<ul>
  <li>expenses payments</li>
  <li>benefits</li>
  <li>facilities</li>
</ul>

<p>For most purposes â€˜family or householdâ€™ is defined as the employeeâ€™s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>spouse or civil partner</li>
  <li>children â€” including their spouses or civil partners</li>
  <li>parents</li>
  <li>servants</li>
  <li>dependants</li>
  <li>guests</li>
</ul>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/legal-background-to-expenses-payments-and-benefits-480-chapter-1#benefits-provided-for-the-family-or-household-of-an-employee">paragraph 1.11 of the 480 expenses and benefits guide</a> for further information.</p>

<p>You must use a separate form P11D for each director or relevant employee. You must also give the information you enter on the P11D to each director and relevant employee.</p>

<p>Do not complete a P11D if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>there are no taxable expenses, payments or benefits to be returned for an individual</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the expenses and benefits have been taxed through your payroll</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>PAYE settlement agreements and exempt payments</h3>

<p>You do not need to show expenses, payment or benefits in kind covered by a PAYE settlement agreement or covered by the exemption for paid or reimbursed expenses on a P11D.</p>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/480-expenses-and-benefits-a-tax-guide">chapters 2 and paragraph 4.4 of chapter 4 of the 480 expenses and benefits guide</a> for further information.</p>

<h3>When you need to complete a form P11D(b)</h3>

<p>Use the form P11D(b) to declare the amounts of Class 1A National Insurance contributions youâ€™re due to pay for the year.</p>

<p>You must also complete and sign a form P11D(b) if youâ€™re liable to return any expenses payments or benefits on form P11D.</p>

<p>If you do not receive a form, or if you need a replacement, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/employer-enquiries">contact HMRC</a>.</p>

<p>The form P11D(b) is split into 4 sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>section 1 is the return of Class 1A National Insurance contributions due for the year, read paragraph 14 in part 3 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cwg5-class-1a-national-insurance-contributions-on-benefits-in-kind">Class 1A National Insurance contributions on benefits in kind (CWG5) guide</a>  for further information</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>section 2 is the declaration covering the return of Class 1A National Insurance contributions and expenses and benefits</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>section 3 gives important information on how to complete the form</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>section 4 is for any adjustments needed to the total benefits liable to Class 1A National Insurance contributions as shown on forms P11D, read paragraph 18 in part 4 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cwg5-class-1a-national-insurance-contributions-on-benefits-in-kind">Class 1A National Insurance contributions on benefits in kind (CWG5) guide</a> for further information</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Amount made good, or from which tax has been deducted</h3>

<p>In boxes with this heading on the form P11D enter any amounts which have been made good by the director or employee on or before 6 July 2022 and from which tax has been deducted under PAYE.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll need to make a matching adjustment to the total benefits reported on form P11D(b), if you enter an amount from which tax has been deducted under PAYE where the benefit is liable to Class 1A National Insurance contributions.</p>

<h3>Schedules and lists</h3>

<p>Enter all the relevant information on a separate schedule if there is not enough space on form P11D.</p>

<p>Read paragraph 25.6 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-on-completion-of-forms-p11d-480-chapter-25#information-in-list-form">480 expenses and benefits guide</a> for further information.</p>

<h3>Effects of VAT</h3>

<p>Include the full amount of VAT on the form P11D even if it may not be recovered in whole or in part by you from HMRC.</p>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-on-completion-of-forms-p11d-480-chapter-25#effects-of-vat">paragraph 25.10 of the 480 expenses and benefits guide</a> for further information.</p>

<h3>Penalties</h3>

<p>There are penalties if you do not make returns or if you submit incorrect returns on forms P11D and P11D(b), either carelessly or deliberately. The return date for the P11D and P11D(b) for 2021 to 2022 is 6 July 2022.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>From 6 April 2017 special rules determine the amount of a benefit which is treated as earnings from the employment, where the benefit is provided as part of an optional remuneration arrangement.</p>

<p>Optional remuneration arrangements are arrangements where an employee gives up the right, or future right, to salary (commonly called salary sacrifice), or the right to some other form of cash remuneration in return for the benefit. They include flexible benefit packages with a cash option.</p>

<p>Where a benefit is chosen instead of some form of salary or pay, the taxable value of the benefit and the amount liable for National Insurance contributions is the greater of the amount of salary foregone and the taxable value of the benefit under the normal benefit in kind rules, ignoring any amount made good. Enter the amount foregone or relevant amount in the appropriate box.</p>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/optional-remuneration-arrangements-480-appendix-12">appendix 12 of the 480 expenses and benefits guide</a> for further information.</p>

<h2>Assets transferred (cars, property, goods or other assets)</h2>

</ul>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/valuation-of-company-benefits-480-chapter-6">chapter 6 of the 480 expenses and benefits guide</a> for further information.</p>

<h2>Payments made on behalf of the employee</h2>

<p>Enter any amounts that your employee should have paid, but you paid instead.</p>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/remuneration-in-non-cash-form-480-chapter-26">chapter 26 of the 480 expenses and benefits guide</a> for further information.</p>

<h3>Tax on notional payments</h3>

<p>PAYE applies to employment income taxable under new Part 7A ITEPA 2003 (certain income provided through third party arrangements), given in the form of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a cash voucher</li>
  <li>vouchers and credit tokens which are used to acquire assets or are themselves readily convertible to cash</li>
  <li>a readily convertible asset</li>
</ul>

<p>PAYE also applies to employment income paid by an intermediary of the employer.</p>

<h2>Vouchers and credit cards</h2>

<h2>Living accommodation</h2>

<p>You must enter the cash equivalent of the living accommodation provided for the director or employee or their family or household by reason of the employment.</p>

<p>If the accommodation is rented, use the amount of rent payable (including any amount attributed to a lease premium) instead of the gross rateable value.</p>

<p>If the property did not have a gross rateable value, use your estimate of what the gross rateable value would have been if rates had continued.</p>

<p>Different rules apply in Scotland.</p>

<h2>Cars and car fuel</h2>

<h3>Car benefit charge</h3>

<p>Give details of cars made available for private use and the total car benefit charge.</p>

<p>The list price of a car will usually be the UK list price of the car on the day before the date of first registration, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>VAT</li>
  <li>car tax (where appropriate)</li>
  <li>delivery charges</li>
  <li>number plates</li>
</ul>

<p>If the car had no list price when it was first registered, use the notional price. This is the price that might reasonably be expected to be the carâ€™s list price if its manufacturer, importer or distributor had published a list price for an equivalent car for single retail sale in the UK.</p>

<p>Accessories must be added at their list price including VAT, fitting and delivery charges, including any:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>optional accessories with the car when it was first made available to the director or employee, whether or not they were available at any time in this tax year</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>accessories added to the car after it was first made available to the employee, as long as they were added after 31 July 1993 and had a price of Â£100 or more</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Capital contributions (payments made by the director or employee towards the cost of the car and accessories) are deducted from the price of the car and accessories (maximum deduction Â£5,000).</p>

<p>This figure is multiplied by the â€˜appropriate percentageâ€™ to give the car benefit charge for a full tax year.</p>

<p>The appropriate percentage for cars registered on or after 1 January 1998 depends on the carbon dioxide (<abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr>) emissions of the car and the type of fuel used. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/company-car-benefit-the-appropriate-percentage-480-appendix-2">Company car benefit â€“ the appropriate percentage (480: Appendix 2)</a> for further information.</p>

<p>From 6 April 2020 to work out the appropriate percentage of the car you will need the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>date first registered</li>
  <li>hybrid cars â€˜zero emission mileageâ€™ if the <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> emissions figure is between 1 and 50g/k</li>

<p>A small number of cars will not have an approved <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> emissions figure. These will probably be rare or one-off models of cars, or cars imported from outside the UK or EU. Supplements and reductions for the type of fuel also apply to these cars if they were first registered after 1998.</p>

<p>If the car was unavailable for part of the year the car benefit charge for that car is reduced proportionately. Any payments by the director or employee which are required for private use and have been paid in 2021 to 2022 are then deducted.</p>

<p>Full details, including the separate rules for calculating the benefit of cars which run on alternative fuels and classic cars are explained in chapter 12 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-work-out-the-benefit-of-a-company-car-480-chapter-12">480 expenses and benefits guide</a>.</p>

<p>This covers the common rules on deciding the prices used for tax purposes, on how to find the approved <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> emissions figure and how to decide the appropriate percentage. It also covers the special rules for disabled drivers.</p>

<p>Read chapters 11,12,15 and appendix 1 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/company-car-benefit-examples-480-appendix-1">480 expenses and benefits guide</a> for further information.</p>

<h3>Car fuel benefit charge</h3>

<p>There will be no benefit charge if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>fuel was provided solely for business travel</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the director or employee was required to make good the whole of the cost of the fuel used for private motoring (including travel between home and work)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a mileage allowance was paid covering no more than the cost of fuel used on business travel â€” if an allowance was paid which covered fuel costs for private travel, for example between home and work, a car fuel benefit charge will arise</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the provision of free fuel is withdrawn, the benefit charge is reduced in proportion to the number of days the car is available after the date of withdrawal.</p>

<p>There is no reduction if free fuel is reinstated later in the tax year.</p>

<p>Enter the total car fuel benefit charge for all cars available. Remember that the type of fuel or power used must be entered whether or not a car fuel benefit charge applies.</p>

<h2>Vans and van fuel</h2>

<h3>Van benefit charge</h3>

<p>The van benefit charge is Â£3,500 for 2021 to 2022.</p>

<p>The charge is reduced for periods when a van is unavailable. Any payments by a director or employee who are required to use the van for private use and have been paid in 2021 to 2022 are then deducted. If 2 or more directors or employees share private use of the van, the standard charge for each should be reduced on a just and reasonable basis.</p>

<p>If the employees sharing the van are members of the same family or household and one of them is in an excluded employment, the fact that the van is available to that person should to be disregarded when making the sharing reduction to the benefit charge on the other employees.</p>

<h3>Van fuel benefit charge</h3>

<p>The van fuel benefit charge is Â£669 for 2021 to 2022. This is charged on all vans when any private fuel is provided and the van benefit charge (before any reductions) is more than zero.</p>

<p>The rules in section F of the P11D under â€˜Car fuel benefit chargeâ€™ apply equally to the van fuel benefit charge.</p>

<h4>Relocation Expenses</h4>

<p>Include here any relocation expenses payments (gross amounts less any amount from which tax is deducted), which are exempt expenses (listed in appendix 7 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/480-expenses-and-benefits-a-tax-guide">480 expenses and benefits guide</a>) but which were paid after the â€˜relevant dayâ€™ or which fail one of the other qualifying conditions.</p>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/non-taxable-payments-and-benefits-480-chapter-5">chapter 5 of the 480 expenses and benefits guide</a> for further information.</p>

<h4>Non-qualifying relocation expenses</h4>

<p>Expenses which are not exempt expenses and are not listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/480-expenses-and-benefits-a-tax-guide">appendix 7 of the 480 expenses and benefits guide</a> should be entered at section N of the P11D.</p>

<p>A beneficial bridging loan given to an employee as part of a relocation package will not qualify for relief under Section 271 ITEPA 2003. Some alternative relief may be due to the director or employee under Section 288 ITEPA 2003 if qualifying relocation expenses and benefits total less than Â£8,000.</p>

<h3>Prescribed limits</h3>

<p>Normally payments of expenses of a personal nature are taxable. However where such payments are made to employees staying away from home overnight on business, they are exempt as long as the travel to that they relate to qualifies for relief and provided the amounts involved are within the prescribed limits.</p>

<p>These limits (which include VAT) are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Â£5 per night for overnight stays anywhere within the UK</li>
  <li>Â£10 per night for overnight stays outside the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>If incidental expenses are made up of different elements (for instance, a cash payment and a benefit in kind) the different elements must be aggregated to decide whether the prescribed limits have been exceeded.</p>

<p>If you make payments for incidental overnight expenses which are over the limits, the whole amount (not just the excess) is liable to tax and National Insurance contributions under the normal rules.</p>

<p>You only need to include an amount in section M of the P11D if part or all of such a payment consists of a benefit in kind.</p>

<h3>Employer provided childcare</h3>

<p>The following are exempt from tax and National Insurance contributions and do not need to be shown on form P11D:</p>

<ul>
