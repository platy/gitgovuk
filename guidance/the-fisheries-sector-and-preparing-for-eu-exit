<h2 id="access-to-waters">Access to waters</h2>

<p>Access to waters will change if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.</p>

<h3 id="rules-for-access-to-uk-waters">Rules for access to UK waters</h3>

<p>The UK government will control and manage access to fish in UK waters, and be responsible for managing the UK’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>territorial waters (out to 12 nautical miles)</li>
  <li>Exclusive Economic Zone (out to 200 nautical miles or the median line with other states)</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-UK vessels, including EU registered EEA or Switzerland vessels, will no longer have the automatic right to fish in UK waters.</p>

<p>Non-UK vessels will still be able to sail through UK waters under their right of safe passage set out in The United Nations Convention of the Sea (<abbr title="United Nations Convention of the Sea">UNCLOS</abbr>).</p>

<h3 id="eu-and-non-eu-third-country-waters">EU and non-EU (third country) waters</h3>

<p>There will be no automatic access for UK-registered vessels to fish in EU or third country waters, including EEA waters. This will be subject to any existing agreements covering territorial waters.</p>

<p>Future access to fish in EU and other coastal state waters in the event of a no deal scenario is still under negotiation.</p>

<p>If you are an owner or skipper of a fishing vessel, you must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/fishermen-urged-to-be-brexit-ready-by-registering-with-the-imo">apply for an <abbr title="International Maritime Organisation">IMO</abbr> number now</a> to prepare for all EU Exit scenarios if your vessel either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>weighs 100 gross tons or more</li>
  <li>is 12 metres or longer</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="western-waters">Western Waters</h3>

<p>The current <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manage-your-fishing-effort-western-waters-crabs">Western Waters effort regime</a> and days at sea effort baselines will continue to apply in UK waters after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<h3 id="fishing-in-uk-waters">Fishing in UK waters</h3>

<p>There’ll be no change to your rights and responsibilities if you have a UK-registered vessel fishing in UK waters. You must continue to comply with the law and the conditions of your licence, including <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/changes-to-the-assessment-economic-link-conditions">the economic link criteria</a> and discard policy.</p>

<h2 id="quota-allocations-and-fishing-opportunities">Quota allocations and fishing opportunities</h2>

<p>The UK fisheries administrators will tell you what your allocation will be. There will be no automatic right for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the UK to exchange fishing opportunities (quota and effort) with EU member states</li>
  <li>EU member states to exchange fishing opportunities with the UK</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="control-and-enforcement-regime">Control and Enforcement regime</h2>

<p>The Marine Management Organisation (<abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>) will provide increased sea surveillance with support from other bodies including the Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authorities (<abbr title="Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authorities">IFCA</abbr>), the Royal Navy and Border Force.</p>

<p>The Maritime and Coastguard agency will provide increased aerial surveillance, and more warranted Marine Enforcement Officers.</p>

<h2 id="regional-fisheries-management-organisations">Regional fisheries management organisations</h2>

<p>The UK will join all relevant regional fisheries management organisations (<abbr title="Regional Fisheries Management Organisations">RFMOs</abbr>) as quickly as possible after EU Exit. The joining process may take up to six months so there may be a gap in the UK’s membership. During this time, UK vessels may not be able to fish in international waters covered by <abbr title="Regional Fisheries Management Organisations">RFMOs</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="access-to-ports">Access to ports</h2>

<p>UK vessels will no longer have automatic rights to land fish in any EU port unless there is a case of distress or an unexpected event. All landings must go through an EU <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/sites/fisheries/files/docs/body/list_neafc_ports_en.pdf">designated point of entry</a>.</p>

<h3 id="eu-and-non-eu-third-country-vessels-landing-into-uk-ports">EU and non-EU (third country) vessels landing into UK ports</h3>

<p>Non-UK vessels will no longer have automatic rights to land in any UK ports unless there is a case of distress or an unexpected event. EU vessels fishing in North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission Convention Area and landing into the UK will need to complete a <a rel="external" href="https://psc.neafc.org/welcome">Port State Control 1 form</a>.</p>

<h2 id="importing-and-exporting">Importing and exporting</h2>

<p>There are some actions you’ll need to take if you import or export products between the UK and EU.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-for-disruption-to-trade-at-the-uk-eu-border">Preparing for disruption to trade at the UK-EU border</h3>

<p>To minimise disruption to your business at border points you should take the following steps:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-a-uk-eori-number-to-trade-within-the-eu">Get a UK Economic Operator Registration and Identification (<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>) number</a> so you can continue to import or export goods and apply for authorisations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decide if you want to hire an import-export agent, or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/declaring-your-goods-at-customs-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-with-no-deal">make the declarations yourself</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact the organisation that moves your goods (for example, a haulage firm) to find out what information they need to make the declarations for your goods, or if you will need to make them yourself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do not import and export products directly check that any agent or business you use is prepared.</p>

<p>Read the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/customs-procedures-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-without-a-deal">simplified customs procedures for trading with the EU if we leave without a deal</a>.</p>

<p>Further information is provided in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/no-deal-brexit-advice-for-businesses-only-trading-with-the-eu">HMRC’s advice for businesses trading with the EU</a>.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-to-move-goods-between-ireland-and-northern-ireland">Preparing to move goods between Ireland and Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, goods moving between Ireland and Northern Ireland will face different procedures compared to other UK-EU trade.</p>

<p>Read the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/customs-procedures-for-goods-moving-between-ireland-and-northern-ireland-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-without-a-deal">customs procedures</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-on-goods-you-move-from-ireland-to-northern-ireland-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-without-a-deal">VAT</a> for goods moving between Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-for-changes-to-existing-trade-agreements">Preparing for changes to existing trade agreements</h3>

<p>Check the way you currently trade with non-EU countries. When the UK leaves the EU the way you access existing favourable arrangements with these countries may change. Changes may be different for each country.</p>

<p>Read the guidance <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/existing-trade-agreements-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-without-a-deal/existing-trade-agreements-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-without-a-deal">on changes to trading with non-EU countries that have a free trade agreement with the EU</a>.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-for-changes-to-import-tariffs">Preparing for changes to import tariffs</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the UK would implement a temporary tariff regime. This would apply for up to 12 months while a full consultation, and review on a permanent approach, is undertaken.
Under the temporary tariff regime the majority of UK imports would be tariff-free.</p>

<p>In certain sectors, tariffs would be maintained to support the most sensitive agricultural industries, vulnerable industries exposed to unfair global competition, and to maintain the UK government’s commitment to developing countries.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-temporary-rates-of-customs-duty-on-imports-after-eu-exit">Check the temporary rates of customs duty on imports after EU Exit</a>.</p>

<h3 id="exporting-fish-and-fishery-products-to-the-eu">Exporting fish and fishery products to the EU</h3>

<p>To export wild-caught marine fish or fishery products to the EU if there’s no Brexit deal you’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exporting-and-importing-fish-if-theres-no-brexit-deal#catch-certificate">catch certificate</a>
</li>
  <li>an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exporting-animals-animal-products-fish-and-fishery-products-to-the-eu-after-eu-exit#ehc">export health certificate</a>, except for direct landings from UK-flagged fishing vessels</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a prior notification form</li>
  <li>a pre-landing declaration</li>
  <li>a storage document</li>
  <li>a processing statement</li>
</ul>

<p>The EU uses these documents to monitor fishing activity and to detect illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.</p>

<p>Read the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exporting-and-importing-fish-if-theres-no-brexit-deal">exporting and importing fish if there’s no Brexit deal</a>.</p>

<h3 id="direct-landings">Direct landings</h3>

<p>Vessel owners or skippers making direct landings off UK vessels into EU ports will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide a catch certificate</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exporting-and-importing-fish-if-theres-no-brexit-deal">pre-notify EU designated ports</a> 4 hours before you plan to land</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/landing-obligation-2019-rules-and-regulations">The discard ban</a> will remain the same.</p>

<p>You will not need an Export Health Certificate for direct landings in an EU port from a UK flagged fishing vessel.</p>

<h3 id="importing-eu-caught-fish-and-fishery-products-to-the-uk">Importing EU-caught fish and fishery products to the UK</h3>

<p>If you import fish to the UK from the EU you’ll need a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exporting-and-importing-fish-if-theres-no-brexit-deal#catch-certificate">catch certificate</a> and supporting documents validated by the country of export. These will vary as they are produced by the exporting country. If the fish you are importing has been stored, you’ll need a storage document. If it’s been processed, you’ll need a processing statement from the exporter.</p>

<p>You will not need an Export Health Certificate for imports of fish or fish products from the EU for at least 6 months after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<h3 id="eels-and-eel-products">Eels and eel products</h3>

<p>Trade in the European eel (Anguilla anguilla), within and outside the EU, will remain subject to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (<abbr title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species">CITES</abbr>). This means the UK will not be able to import or export European eel unless following <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cites-imports-and-exports"><abbr title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species">CITES</abbr></a> processes.</p>

<h2 id="european-maritime-and-fisheries-fund">European Maritime and Fisheries Fund</h2>

<p>The UK government has guaranteed that all <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/european-maritime-and-fisheries-fund-emff-before-you-apply">European Maritime and Fisheries Fund</a> (<abbr title="European Maritime and Fisheries Fund">EMFF</abbr>) projects approved before 31 December 2020 will be fully funded.</p>

<h2 id="labelling-and-marketing-of-fishery-and-aquaculture">Labelling and marketing of fishery and aquaculture</h2>

<p>The rules for what you must show on food labels will change for some food and drink products if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Some of the new rules will come into effect from exit day. For others, you’ll have longer to update your food labels.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/food-labelling-and-packaging">labelling requirements</a> for fishery and aquaculture products continue to apply.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/food-labelling-changes-after-brexit">Food labelling changes after Brexit</a> explains how Brexit might affect labelling.</p>

<h2 id="your-employees">Your employees</h2>

<p>There are certain schemes and processes you should be aware of if you employ people.</p>

<h3 id="right-to-work-checks">Right to work checks</h3>

<p>Until January 2021 you should continue the same right to work checks on all EU/EEA and Swiss citizens, by using their passport or national identity card.</p>

<p>You will not need to distinguish between EU/EEA and Swiss citizens who were resident in the UK before or after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>Find out how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-job-applicant-right-to-work">check an applicant’s right to work</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/employing-eu-eea-and-swiss-citizens-and-their-family-members-after-brexit#right-to-work">read the guidance on employing EU, EEA and Swiss citizens after Brexit</a>.</p>

<h3 id="eueea-and-swiss-citizens-living-in-the-uk-before-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">EU/EEA and Swiss citizens living in the UK before the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, EU/EEA and Swiss citizens who are resident in the UK before the UK leaves the EU will be able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families">apply to the EU Settlement Scheme</a> to get settled or pre-settled status. This will mean they can continue to live, work and study in the UK.</p>

<p>EU/EEA and Swiss citizens must apply by 31 December 2020 if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eu-settlement-scheme-employer-toolkit">EU Settlement Scheme guidance for employers</a> to give further information to your employees.</p>

<h3 id="eueea-and-swiss-citizens-who-arrive-in-the-uk-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">EU/EEA and Swiss citizens who arrive in the UK after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, EU, EEA and Swiss citizens arriving in the UK from exit day to 31 December 2020 can continue to come to the UK, to live, work and study without applying for a visa in advance.</p>

<p>After free movement ends, if they want to stay for longer than 3 months, they can read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/european-temporary-leave-to-remain-in-the-uk">guidance on staying in the UK</a> to find out what they’ll need to do.</p>

<p>Irish citizens can continue to live, work and study in the UK, just as before.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>From 1 January 2021, a new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uks-future-skills-based-immigration-system">skills-based immigration system</a> will launch.</p>
</div>

<p>For non-EU nationals, EU Exit will not affect the application process for work visas.</p>

<h3 id="employing-seasonal-workers">Employing seasonal workers</h3>

<p>You’ll still be able to employ seasonal workers from the EU. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/european-temporary-leave-to-remain-in-the-uk">European Temporary Leave to Remain</a> will allow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">EEA citizens</a> arriving in the UK after 31 October 2019 to live, work and study in the UK if there’s no Brexit deal.</p>

<p>EEA citizens who are granted European Temporary Leave to Remain will be able to stay in the UK for 36 months from the date of their application.</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/employing-eu-seasonal-workers-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">EU seasonal worker information for employers</a> to give further details to your employees.</p>

<h2 id="data-protection">Data protection</h2>

<p>Your business will need to make sure it follows data protection law if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.</p>

<p>If you operate across the EU or exchange personal data with organisations in the EEA, there may be changes that you need to make before the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-protection-eu-exit-guidance/leaving-the-eu-without-a-deal-6-steps-to-take">6 step process</a> and the <a rel="external" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-and-brexit/data-protection-if-there-s-no-brexit-deal">data protection guidance from the Information Commissioner’s Office (<abbr title="Information Commissioner’s Office">ICO</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>You can also check if you can use <a rel="external" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-and-brexit/standard-contractual-clauses-for-transfers-from-the-eea-to-the-uk-interactive-tool/">standard contractual clauses (SCCs)</a> for transfers from the EEA to the UK.</p>
