<h2 id="access-to-waters">Access to waters</h2>

<p>As an independent coastal state after Brexit, the UK government will be responsible for managing the UK’s territorial waters (out to 12 nautical miles) and the Exclusive Economic Zone (out to 200 nautical miles or the median line with other states).</p>

<h3 id="fishing-in-uk-waters">Fishing in UK waters</h3>

<p>There’ll be no change to the rights and responsibilities of UK-registered vessels fishing in UK waters. All vessel owners must continue continue to comply with the law and the conditions of their licence, including current reporting requirements (such as logbooks),  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/changes-to-the-assessment-economic-link-conditions">the economic link criteria</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/landing-obligation-2019-rules-and-regulations">discard policy</a>.</p>

<h3 id="access-to-uk-waters">Access to UK waters</h3>

<p>Non-UK vessels, including EU or EEA registered vessels, will not be permitted to fish in UK waters, unless there is an access agreement and the vessels have the  appropriate license.</p>

<p>The London Fisheries Convention, which gives access for specific countries to fish in the UK’s 6 to 12 nautical mile zone, will not apply to the UK.</p>

<p>Non-UK vessels will still be able to sail through UK territorial waters under their right of ‘innocent  passage’ set out in The United Nations Convention of the Sea (<abbr title="United Nations Convention of the Sea">UNCLOS</abbr>).</p>

<h3 id="eu-and-non-eu-third-country-waters">EU and non-EU (third country) waters</h3>

<p>There will be no automatic access for UK-registered vessels to fish in EU, EEA  or third country waters. All forms of fishing gear must be removed before Brexit. Any fishing activity outside of UK waters will be considered Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU).</p>

<p>The right to transit through the waters of another coastal state will continue to apply allowing UK vessels to sail through (but not fish in) EU waters or those of other countries.</p>

<h3 id="norway-and-faroe-islands">Norway and Faroe Islands</h3>

<p>The UK government has signed continuity agreements with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-fisheries-agreement-signed-with-norway">Norway</a> (on 30 September) and with <a rel="external" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-fisheries-agreement-signed-with-the-faroe-islands&sa=D&ust=1571395349426000&usg=AFQjCNELK5MyjI5P_UxGbOwWp9c75ZUv_g">Faroe Islands</a> (on 15 October) to allow UK fishermen to continue to access and catch fishing quotas in Norwegian and Faroese waters after Brexit. These agreements will remain in place until the end of 2019.</p>

<h2 id="quota-allocations-and-fishing-opportunities">Quota allocations and fishing opportunities</h2>

<p>The UK government will honour the current quota allocations and effort limits for the remainder of 2019. Quota for 2020 will be negotiated at the end of 2019.
International swaps for quota and effort will stop when the UK leaves the EU. There will be no cross-year swaps.</p>

<h3 id="western-waters">Western Waters</h3>

<p>The current <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manage-your-fishing-effort-western-waters-crabs">Western Waters effort regime</a> and days at sea effort baselines will continue to apply in UK waters after Brexit.</p>

<h2 id="licensing-arrangements">Licensing arrangements</h2>
<p>The Marine Management Organisation (<abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>) and devolved administrations will vary licences to restrict UK fishing vessels to fish in UK waters only. This will take effect from the day we leave the EU.</p>

<p>If an agreement on access is reached, UK vessels will need a licence to fish in other countries’ waters. This will be issued by the newly established Single Issuing Authority (<abbr title="Single Issuing Authority">SIA</abbr>), set up by the UK Fisheries Authorities. The <abbr title="Single Issuing Authority">SIA</abbr> will also license foreign vessels to fish in UK waters, if access is agreed.</p>

<p>Fishers in the over 12m fleet must ensure their vessel has an IMO (International Maritime Organisation) number to fish outside of UK waters.</p>

<h2 id="access-to-eu-ports">Access to EU ports</h2>

<p>UK vessels will no longer have automatic rights to land fish in any EU port unless there is a case of distress or an unexpected event. UK vessels will only be permitted to land their catch in designated <a rel="external" href="https://psc.neafc.org/designated-contacts">North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (<abbr title="North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission">NEAFC</abbr>) ports in the EU</a>.</p>

<p>To land in an EU designated port, vessels must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>register with the <a rel="external" href="https://www.neafc.org/mcs/psc"><abbr title="North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission">NEAFC</abbr>’s electronic Port State Control system</a>
</li>
  <li>complete Port State Control forms (PSC1 or PSC2) before landing</li>
</ul>

<p>Check with the <abbr title="North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission">NEAFC</abbr> to find out how much notice is needed. This will vary depending on the country and if the fish is fresh or frozen.</p>

<h3 id="eu-and-non-eu-third-country-vessels-landing-into-uk-ports">EU and non-EU (third country) vessels landing into UK ports</h3>

<p>Non-UK vessels will no longer have automatic rights to land in any UK ports unless there is a case of distress or an unexpected event.</p>

<p>EU vessels fishing in <abbr title="North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission">NEAFC</abbr> Convention Area and landing into the UK will need to complete a <a rel="external" href="https://psc.neafc.org/welcome">Port State Control 1 form</a>.</p>

<h2 id="regional-fisheries-management-organisations">Regional fisheries management organisations</h2>

<p>The UK will join all relevant regional fisheries management organisations (<abbr title="Regional Fisheries Management Organisations">RFMOs</abbr>) as quickly as possible after Brexit.</p>

<p>The joining process may take up to 6 months so there may be a gap in the UK’s membership. During this time, UK vessels may not be able to fish in international waters covered by <abbr title="Regional Fisheries Management Organisations">RFMOs</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="north-east-atlantic-fisheries-commission-neafc-convention-area">North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (<abbr title="North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission">NEAFC</abbr>) Convention Area</h3>

<p>The UK will  join the <abbr title="North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission">NEAFC</abbr> after Brexit.</p>

<p>For UK-registered vessels to continue fishing in the convention area, and landing into the EU, you must hold a current UK domestic licence. You’ll need this before you can apply for an international licence from the relevant fisheries authority.</p>

<p>Contact your local fisheries authority office if you want further guidance on fishing internationally. You’ll also need to register with the <a rel="external" href="https://psc.neafc.org/welcome"><abbr title="North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission">NEAFC</abbr>’s electronic Port State Control system</a> and complete the Port State Control  forms (PSC1 or PSC2) before landing.</p>

<h2 id="importing-and-exporting">Importing and exporting</h2>

<p>There are some actions you’ll need to take if you import or export products between the UK and EU.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-for-disruption-to-trade-at-the-uk-eu-border">Preparing for disruption to trade at the UK-EU border</h3>

<p>To minimise disruption to your business at border points you should take the following steps:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-a-uk-eori-number-to-trade-within-the-eu">Get a UK Economic Operator Registration and Identification (<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>) number</a> so you can continue to import or export goods and apply for authorisations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decide if you want to hire an import-export agent, or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/declaring-your-goods-at-customs-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-with-no-deal">make the declarations yourself</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact the organisation that moves your goods (for example, a haulage firm) to find out what information they need to make the declarations for your goods, or if you will need to make them yourself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do not import and export products directly check that any agent or business you use is prepared.</p>

<p>Read the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/customs-procedures-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-without-a-deal">simplified customs procedures for trading with the EU if we leave without a deal</a>.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-to-move-goods-between-ireland-and-northern-ireland">Preparing to move goods between Ireland and Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>Goods moving between Ireland and Northern Ireland will face different procedures compared to other UK-EU trade in a no-deal Brexit.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-for-changes-to-import-tariffs">Preparing for changes to import tariffs</h3>

<p>The UK will implement a temporary tariff regime in a no-deal Brexit. This will apply for up to 12 months while a full consultation, and review on a permanent approach, is undertaken.
Under the temporary tariff regime the majority of UK imports will be tariff-free.</p>

<h3 id="exporting-fish-and-fishery-products-for-human-consumption-to-the-eu">Exporting fish and fishery products for human consumption to the EU</h3>

<p>To export wild-caught marine fish or fishery products to the EU in a no Brexit deal you’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exporting-animals-animal-products-fish-and-fishery-products-to-the-eu-after-eu-exit#ehc">export health certificate</a>, for all fish and seafood, including aquaculture products, except for direct landings from UK-flagged fishing vessels</li>
  <li>a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exporting-and-importing-fish-if-theres-no-brexit-deal#catch-certificate">catch certificate</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a prior notification form</li>
  <li>a pre-landing declaration</li>
  <li>a storage document</li>
  <li>a processing statement</li>
</ul>

<p>The EU uses these documents to monitor fishing activity and to detect illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.</p>

<p>Read the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exporting-and-importing-fish-if-theres-no-brexit-deal">exporting and importing fish if there’s no Brexit deal</a>.</p>

<h3 id="direct-landings">Direct landings</h3>

<p>Vessel owners or skippers landing fresh fish into EU ports will need to:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/landing-obligation-2019-rules-and-regulations">The discard ban</a> will remain the same.</p>

<p>Fresh fish landings from vessels which are not approved food establishments will not need an Export Health Certificate.</p>

<h3 id="special-requirements-for-uk-approved-fishing-vessels">Special requirements for UK approved fishing vessels</h3>
<p>Local Authority approved freezer, reefer or factory vessels that land frozen or processed fish directly into the EU will require:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a Captain’s Certificate signed by the Captain who is authorised by <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> (Animal and Plant Health Agency) or <abbr title="Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs]">DAERA</abbr> (Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs)</li>
  <li>the fish to be landed into a Border Inspection Post (<abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr>) approved for the landed fishery product</li>
</ul>

<p>Food approved vessels include freezer, reefer and factory vessels. ‘Processing’ includes activities such as wrapping, mincing, freezing and filleting.</p>

<p>Non-food approved registered vessels that land fresh fish directly into the EU at a <abbr title="North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission">NEAFC</abbr> designated port will not require an Export Health Certificate or to pass through a <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr>. They will still be subject to any normal official controls within the port. ‘Fresh fish’ may have undergone primary production, which may include de-heading or gutting.</p>

<h3 id="importing-eu-caught-fish-and-fishery-products-to-the-uk">Importing EU-caught fish and fishery products to the UK</h3>

<p>For EU imports, you’ll need a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exporting-and-importing-fish-if-theres-no-brexit-deal#catch-certificate">catch certificate</a> for each:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consignment</li>
  <li>direct landing of fish or fishery products</li>
</ul>

<p>Your exporter will have to submit the certificate to the Port Health Authorities or relevant fisheries authority.</p>

<p>The certificate will need to be checked at least 3 working days before the estimated arrival time into the UK. This deadline may change case by case depending on the type of fishery or distance from grounds to port.</p>

<p>If the fish you’re importing has been stored, you’ll need a storage document.</p>

<p>If it’s been processed, you’ll need a processing statement from the exporter.</p>

<p>You’ll need an Export Health Certificates for imports of fish that originate outside of the EU. You will not need an Export Health Certificate for imports of fish or fish products from the EU  after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<h3 id="eels-and-eel-products">Eels and eel products</h3>

<p>The UK will not be able to import or export European eel unless following <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cites-imports-and-exports"><abbr title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species">CITES</abbr></a> processes.</p>

<h2 id="european-maritime-and-fisheries-fund">European Maritime and Fisheries Fund</h2>

<h2 id="labelling-and-marketing-of-fishery-and-aquaculture">Labelling and marketing of fishery and aquaculture</h2>

<p>The rules for what you must show on food labels will change for some food and drink products in a no-deal Brexit. Some of the new rules will come into effect from exit day. For others, you’ll have longer to update your food labels.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/food-labelling-and-packaging">labelling requirements</a> for fishery and aquaculture products continue to apply.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/food-labelling-changes-after-brexit">Food labelling changes after Brexit</a> explains how Brexit might affect labelling.</p>
