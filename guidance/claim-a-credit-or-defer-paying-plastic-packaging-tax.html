<p>You may be able to defer the liability to pay the tax, or claim tax back on your tax return if the packaging is either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>exported</li>
  <li>converted into different packaging</li>
</ul>

<h2>When you can claim a credit</h2>

<p>You can claim a credit or relief for finished plastic packaging components which are exported from the UK if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you pay Plastic Packaging Tax when you manufacture or import finished plastic packaging components and they are subsequently exported by you or someone else — you can then claim back the tax for up to 2 years from the date that you manufactured or imported the finished plastic packaging components</li>
  <li>at the point you manufacture or import the finished plastic packaging components, you intend to export the finished plastic packaging components yourself</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You cannot claim relief for transport packaging used to export goods from the UK.</p>
</div>

<h3>Claiming a credit for tax you’ve paid</h3>

<p>You can claim a credit if you’ve paid Plastic Packaging Tax for finished plastic packaging components you have manufactured or imported which are then either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>exported and you have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/record-keeping-and-accounts-for-plastic-packaging-tax#claiming-a-credit">records</a> to show this</li>
  <li>converted into a different finished plastic packaging component — this will stop the tax being paid twice</li>
</ul>

<p>The credit must be claimed within 2 years of the finished plastic packaging components being either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>manufactured</li>
  <li>imported</li>
  <li>converted into a different packaging</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the finished plastic packaging components have been exported or converted into different packaging, and you have evidence to show this, you can account for the credit on your next tax return.</p>

<p>Find out how to claim a credit on your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/completing-your-plastic-packaging-tax-return">Plastic Packaging Tax return</a>.</p>

<div class="example">
<h3>Example of how to claim a credit for finished plastic packaging components which have been exported in a previous accounting period</h3>

<p>Your business accounts for 20 tonnes of finished plastic packaging components on your January to March 2023 quarterly tax return.</p>

<p>You paid the £4,000 tax due in April 2023.</p>

<p>In May 2023, a business customer provides evidence that they exported 5 tonnes of the finished plastic packaging components they bought.</p>

<p>As your business paid the Plastic Packaging Tax, you are allowed to claim a credit for the 5 tonnes (5 tonnes × £200 = £1,000) on your next tax return.</p>

<p>Your Plastic Packaging Tax liability in the next accounting period is 30 tonnes.</p>

<p>You are allowed to reduce this liability by claiming the credit on your April to June 2023 quarterly tax return.
To do this, you enter £1,000 in the credit box on your tax return.</p>
</div>

<p><br></p>
<div class="example">
<h3>Example of how to claim a credit for finished plastic packaging components exported in the same accounting period</h3>

<p>Your business imports 20 tonnes of finished plastic packaging components in January 2023, fills 18 tonnes of them with goods and exports them in March 2023.</p>

<p>You should include the 20 tonnes of finished plastic packaging components in your total weight of imported finished plastic packaging components in your January 2023 to March 2023 tax return.</p>

<p>The 18 tonnes of chargeable finished plastic packaging components that have been exported will be included in the credit box as £3,600 (18 tonnes × £200 = £3,600) on your January 2023 to March 2023 quarterly tax return, as the export has been completed in the same accounting period.</p>
</div>

<p><br></p>
<div class="example">
<h3>Example of how to claim a credit when finished plastic packaging components are converted into different packaging components</h3>

<p>Your business accounts for 30 tonnes of finished plastic packaging components manufactured on your April to June 2023 quarterly tax return.</p>

<p>You paid the £6,000 tax due in July 2023.</p>

<p>You then supply 10 tonnes of the finished plastic packaging components to another business.</p>

<p>The other business uses the finished plastic packaging components to manufacture new finished plastic packaging components, which are also subject to Plastic Packaging Tax.</p>

<p>Once you receive evidence confirming the plastic has been converted into a different finished plastic packaging component, you are allowed to claim a credit for the 10 tonnes (10 tonnes × £200 = £2,000) on your next tax return.</p>

<p>To do this, you should enter £2,000 in the credit box on your next tax return.</p>

<p>You also need to have the original documents to show you have accounted for and previously paid the tax.</p>
</div>

<h2>When you can defer payment</h2>

<p>If you know at the time you manufacture or import the finished plastic packaging components that you intend for it to be exported by your business, and you have records to show this, you can defer paying Plastic Packaging Tax for up to 12 months.</p>

<p>If you export the finished plastic packaging components within 12 months of manufacture or import, you do not need to pay Plastic Packaging Tax for those finished plastic packaging components.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/record-keeping-and-accounts-for-plastic-packaging-tax#claiming-a-credit">keep records</a> to show the weight of the finished plastic packaging components and the date it was exported.</p>
</div>

<p>If you do not export the packaging within 12 months or you decide you are not going to export the packaging, you will be liable for Plastic Packaging Tax from the date it is known the packaging will not be exported.</p>

<div class="example">
<h3>Example of what to do if you’ve deferred paying the tax but have not exported the packaging within 12 months</h3>

<p>Your business manufactures finished plastic packaging components on 23 August 2022. You intend to export the finished plastic packaging components yourself within the next 12 months.</p>

<p>You account for the finished plastic packaging components on your July to September 2022 quarterly tax return as being directly exported.</p>

<p>No tax was paid as your business intended to directly export the packaging.</p>

<p>By 23 August 2023 the export has not taken place. This means Plastic Packaging Tax must be paid, as the finished plastic packaging components have not been directly exported within 12 months.</p>

<p>Plastic Packaging Tax must be accounted for and paid on your business’s next tax return, which will be on your July to September 2023 quarterly tax return.</p>
