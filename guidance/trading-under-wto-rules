<p>From 1 January 2021, if no trade agreement exists between the UK and another country, trade with that country will take place under World Trade Organization (<abbr title="World Trade Organization">WTO</abbr>) rules.</p>

<p>Find out which <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-trade-agreements-with-non-eu-countries-in-a-no-deal-brexit" class="govuk-link">trade agreements the UK has signed</a>. This page will be kept updated.</p>

<p>Some developing countries are eligible to get trade preferences through the UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/trading-with-developing-nations-from-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">Generalised Scheme of Preferences</a>.</p>

<h2 id="wto-and-the-most-favoured-nation-rule">
<abbr title="World Trade Organization">WTO</abbr> and the Most Favoured Nation rule</h2>

<p><abbr title="World Trade Organization">WTO</abbr> rules state that the same trading terms must be applied to all <abbr title="World Trade Organization">WTO</abbr> members, unless there is a trade agreement between 2 or more countries. This is known as <a rel="external" href="https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact2_e.htm" class="govuk-link">Most Favoured Nation (<abbr title="Most Favoured Nation">MFN</abbr>) treatment</a>.</p>

<p>Most Favoured Nation (<abbr title="Most Favoured Nation">MFN</abbr>) means that the UK cannot offer better trading terms to one country and not another, unless through a trade agreement.</p>

<p>The UK currently trades with many countries on <abbr title="World Trade Organization">WTO</abbr> terms, for example China, India, Brazil and Saudi Arabia. Your trade with these countries will remain on an <abbr title="Most Favoured Nation">MFN</abbr> basis.</p>

<h2 id="what-youll-have-to-do-differently-when-you-are-trading-under-wto-rules">What you’ll have to do differently when you are trading under <abbr title="World Trade Organization">WTO</abbr> rules</h2>

<p>From 1 January 2021, the way you trade with some countries will change.  Where the UK had been covered by an EU trade agreement but a replacement agreement has not been negotiated, trade will take place under <abbr title="World Trade Organization">WTO</abbr> rules.</p>

<p>You may need to act on some of the information below. This list is not exhaustive but outlines the major issues. It is for information only.</p>

<h3 id="customs-procedures-and-declarations">Customs procedures and declarations</h3>

<p>From 1 January 2021, you will still be required to complete customs procedures and declarations for imports to the UK.</p>

<p>Find out more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/starting-to-import/importing-from-noneu-countries" class="govuk-link">using customs procedures</a>.</p>

<h3 id="goods-in-transit">Goods in transit</h3>

<p>When goods are being transported, they will pay the tariff at the rate on the day that they are imported into the UK. From 1 January 2021, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-tariffs-from-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">the UK Global Tariff</a> will apply to imports into the UK unless a preferential agreement like an FTA applies. The <abbr title="Most Favoured Nation">MFN</abbr> tariff of the country of destination will apply to exports from the UK, unless the UK has preferential trading arrangements in place with that country.</p>

<p>At the end of 2020, the UK will transition to <abbr title="World Trade Organization">WTO</abbr> terms with all those nations it doesn’t have a preferential trade agreement with.</p>

<h3 id="establish-the-uk-origin-of-your-goods-for-tariff-purposes">Establish the UK origin of your goods for tariff purposes</h3>

<p>From 1 January 2021, how you establish the origin of your goods for tariff purposes may change. The UK and the EU will be separate territories for rules of origin purposes.   </p>

<p>Trade under <abbr title="World Trade Organization">WTO</abbr> rules does not require you to prove preferential origin.</p>

<h4 id="non-preferential-rules-of-origin">Non-preferential rules of origin</h4>

<p>When trading with countries with whom the UK does not have a trade agreement, non-preferential rules of origin will apply from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>This means that when you are importing a good you will need to declare the origin of your goods.  If you are exporting, you will need to apply the non-preferential rules of origin as set by the destination country.</p>

<p>If required, you will be able to apply for a non-preferential certificate of origin from the British Chambers of Commerce.</p>

<h3 id="paying-tariffs-on-imports-into-the-uk">Paying tariffs on imports into the UK</h3>

<p>From 1 January 2021, the tariffs you pay may be different. We have introduced the UK Global Tariff policy on <abbr title="Most Favoured Nation">MFN</abbr> imports into the UK, which will enter in force from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>Find out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-tariffs-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">what tariff rates apply</a> to specific goods imported into the UK from 1 January 2021.</p>

<h3 id="paying-tariffs-on-exports-from-the-uk">Paying tariffs on exports from the UK</h3>

<p>Overseas importers may need to pay different tariff rates on exports from the UK. The tariffs will vary by country and product. Many are duty free under <abbr title="World Trade Organization">WTO</abbr> terms.</p>

<p>Find out <a rel="external" href="https://www.check-duties-customs-exporting-goods.service.gov.uk/selectdest" class="govuk-link">what tariff rates apply</a> in every country.</p>

<p>The UK will accept most goods that meet EU requirements on product safety for a time limited period from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>If you are selling goods to another country, you will need to continue to meet the regulatory requirements as set out in the law of that country.</p>

<h3 id="protect-your-intellectual-property">Protect your intellectual property</h3>

<p>Some trade agreements give extra protection for intellectual property above a ‘baseline’ level required of all <abbr title="World Trade Organization">WTO</abbr> members. If there is no longer a trade agreement between the UK and another country, that country’s protection for your intellectual property may go down to that baseline level. This is most relevant to UK Geographical Indications, which may no longer be protected in the other country when we are trading under <abbr title="World Trade Organization">WTO</abbr> rules.</p>

<h3 id="changes-to-trade-in-services">Changes to trade in services</h3>

<p>To provide services in other countries, you will need to continue to follow the terms set out in the legislation of the host country.</p>

<p>If there is no trade agreement between the UK and host country, you will trade under terms set out in the host country’s <abbr title="World Trade Organization">WTO</abbr> General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). The terms are set out in the <a rel="external" href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/serv_e/serv_commitments_e.htm" class="govuk-link">schedule of specific commitments and list of Article II (<abbr title="Most Favoured Nation">MFN</abbr>) exemptions</a>. This page includes guidance on interpreting services schedules.</p>

<p>Where there is no longer a trade agreement, the host country may impose new restrictions on trade. You may no longer have the right to provide some services, or to provide some services in particular ways, to that country from 1 January 2021. If in doubt, you should contact the relevant regulatory body in the host country.</p>

<h4 id="get-business-visas">Get business visas</h4>

<p>If you are a UK national, you will need to check what type of visa, work, or residence permit is required in the country in which you are intending to provide services. You should comply with the immigration controls for the country in which you are providing services.</p>

<p>You can read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">advice about travelling to specific countries</a>, including travel entry requirements and how to stay safe while you’re there.</p>

<h4 id="make-sure-your-professional-qualification-is-recognised">Make sure your professional qualification is recognised</h4>

<p>From 1 January 2021, you’ll need to have your UK professional qualification officially recognised if you want to work in a profession that is regulated in the country in which you are selling services.</p>

<p>Your professional qualification will need to be recognised by the relevant regulator in each country where you intend to work. You’ll need to do this even if you’re providing temporary or occasional professional services.</p>

<h3 id="government-procurement-contracts">Government procurement contracts</h3>

<p>The World Trade Organization Agreement on Procurement Agreement (<abbr title="Government Procurement Agreement">GPA</abbr>) opens up government procurement markets among its parties. From 1 January 2021, the UK will become an independent member of the <abbr title="Government Procurement Agreement">GPA</abbr>. This means that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>UK businesses can continue to bid for procurement opportunities in the other parties’ territories</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>businesses from those parties can continue to bid for certain procurement opportunities in the UK</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/gproc_e/gp_app_agree_e.htm" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="World Trade Organization">WTO</abbr> website</a> sets out which markets are covered by the <abbr title="Government Procurement Agreement">GPA</abbr> and what types of procurement opportunities are covered in each market.</p>

<p><abbr title="Government Procurement Agreement">GPA</abbr> parties use their own online platforms for publishing procurement opportunities.
