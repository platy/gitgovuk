<p>This guidance explains the changes to <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law as a result of the Withdrawal Agreement that preserve existing design and international rights. It also covers other legislative changes required to effectively administer and implement the new rights.</p>

<p>Designs are a form of intellectual property. They protect the appearance of the whole or part of a product resulting from the features of, in particular, its lines, contours, colour, shape, texture, materials and ornamentation.
A design can be protected if it is new and has individual character compared to designs that are already in the public domain.</p>

<p>Trade marks enable consumers and businesses to differentiate the goods and services of one trader from another. They commonly take the form of words, logos, or a combination of both.</p>

<p>Trade marks are registered rights, with protection in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> granted by the Intellectual Property Office (<abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr>), or via an international registration filed under the Madrid Protocol at the World Intellectual Property Organisation (<abbr title="World Intellectual Property Organisation">WIPO</abbr>).</p>

<h2>What changed after the end of the transition period</h2>

<p>When the transition period relating to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s exit from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> ended on 1 January 2021, registered Community designs (<abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr>) and unregistered Community designs (<abbr title="unregistered Community designs">UCDs</abbr>) were no longer valid in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>These rights were immediately and automatically replaced by <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> rights. If you owned an existing right, you did not need to take any action.</p>

<p>Design protection can currently be obtained via a registered right in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registered design granted by the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> (protection in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>)</li>
  <li>a registered Community design granted by the <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr> (protection in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>)</li>
  <li>an international registration designating either the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, filed under the Hague Agreement at <abbr title="World Intellectual Property Organisation">WIPO</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The following unregistered design protection is also available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> design unregistered design right</li>
  <li>supplementary unregistered design (in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> unregistered Community design</li>
  <li>continuing unregistered designs provide protection in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> for any unregistered community designs which existed before 1 January 2021 for the remainder of the 3 year term</li>
</ul>

<p>Since 1 January 2021, any existing <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr>, <abbr title="unregistered Community designs">UCDs</abbr>, European Union Trade Marks (<abbr title="European Union Trade Mark">EUTM</abbr>), and International (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) designs and trade marks only provide protection in the remaining <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states.</p>

<h2>Registered design</h2>

<h3>Creation of the re-registered design</h3>

<p>All registered and published <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> now have re-registered <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> designs, which are recorded on the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> register. These are treated as if they had been applied for and registered under <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law.</p>

<p>The legislative changes introduced in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> ensured that the holder of an <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> was provided with an equivalent <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> right. They retained the registration and application dates recorded against the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> and inherited any priority dates.</p>

<p>As fully independent <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> rights, they may be challenged, assigned, licensed or renewed separately from the original <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>.</p>

<p>Re-registered designs were created at no cost to the <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> holder, and we have ensured that minimal administrative burden was placed upon the right holder.</p>

<h3>Pending applications</h3>

<p>On 1 January 2021, there were small number of <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> applications that were still pending in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> system.</p>

<p>If you held a pending <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> application on 1 January 2021, you were able to apply to register a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> design in the nine months after the end of the transition period (up to and including 30 September 2021) and retain the earlier filing date of the pending <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>.</p>

<p>To do so, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> application had to relate to the same design as that filed in the pending <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> application.
If the details of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> application did not match those of the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> application, then the earlier <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> date(s) were not recognised.</p>

<p>These applications were treated as <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registered design applications. They were examined under <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law. In these circumstances, the standard <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> fee structure applied.</p>

<h3>Effect of priority claims</h3>

<p>A priority date claimed under the Paris Convention which was recorded against the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> was inherited by the re-registered design. The date of that priority claim will have effect where proceedings involve a re-registered design with a priority claim inherited from the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Pending invalidation actions at the <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Registered designs can be challenged by third parties under the grounds of invalidation. If this action succeeds, then the right is removed fully or partially from the register.</p>

<p>At the end of the transition period, we created <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> re-registered designs for all registered Community designs (<abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr>) registered at 31 December 2020. This included registered Community designs which were subject to invalidation proceedings.</p>

<p>The Withdrawal Agreement requires that where a registered Community design (<abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>) is subject to ongoing invalidation proceedings at the end of the transition period, and is subsequently invalidated, the outcome shall be applied to the corresponding <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> re-registered right.</p>

<p>This means that if you own a <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> that is subject to invalidation proceedings at the end of the transition period and that right is subsequently invalidated, whether wholly or partially, your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> re-registered right will also be invalidated to the same extent.</p>

<p>If you are a party that has succeeded in invalidating a <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> and this action was ongoing at the end of the transition period, the invalidation will be applied to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> re-registered right, without the need for you to bring a new invalidation action before the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr>.</p>

<p>There is an exception where the grounds for invalidating the <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> would not apply in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. In this case the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> right will not be invalidated. This is referred to as a derogation.</p>

<p>All re-registered Community designs which were subject to ongoing invalidity proceedings at the end of the transition period have been recorded on a dedicated list on the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> website.</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1054717/Designs-Invalidity-Procedure-Pending-at-EUIPO-at-31st-Dec-2020.xlsx">Designs - Invalidity Procedure Pending at <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr> at 31 December 2020</a> (<span class="type">MS Excel Spreadsheet</span>, <span class="file-size">25.1 KB</span>)</span></li>
</ul>

<p>When a final decision in the proceedings against the <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> is reached, meaning that no further appeals are possible, an invalidation notice may be sent to us by any person. We will also initiate the invalidation of a re-registered right or direct another party do to so if we become aware that the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> has been invalidated.</p>

<p>If you are the owner of the re-registered design sending us an invalidation notice, and you wish to claim the derogation, you must send the derogation notice with the invalidation notice.</p>

<p>If a third party sends us an invalidation notice, we will send this to the owner of the re-registered design. If they believe that the invalidation should not apply in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, they must file a derogation notice within a period of one month following receipt of the invalidation notice. If we become aware that an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> right is cancelled, then we will write to the owner of the re-registered design and give them the same notice to file a derogation.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> Tribunal will then decide whether or not the re-registered design should be invalidated in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. Some examples of how a derogation is likely to succeed or not succeed are set out below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>derogation is likely to succeed where the invalidation of a design on the grounds of public policy and/or morality was based on words within the design the meaning of which would not be known in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
  <li>derogation is unlikely to succeed where the registered Community design was invalidated for lack of novelty</li>
</ul>

<p>If an invalidation action against a registered community design fails at <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> level, you can contact the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> to let us know this. We will then update the list.</p>

<h2>Changes to legislation related to <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> design and international design and trade mark law</h2>

<h3>How <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> design and international design and trade mark law currently works</h3>

<p>The Withdrawal Agreement covers the changes set out above in relation to <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> and International Trade Marks (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>).  Other changes were made to <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> legislation on designs and trade marks for the effective administration and implementation of re-registered designs and comparable rights.</p>

<p>The primary <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> legislation on registered designs is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/88/contents" rel="external">The Registered Designs Act 1949</a>. There is also secondary legislation, mainly contained within the Registered Design Rules 2006, together with amending and standalone regulations.</p>

<p><abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> and <abbr title="unregistered Community designs">UCDs</abbr> are defined by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://euipo.europa.eu/tunnel-web/secure/webdav/guest/document_library/contentPdfs/law_and_practice/cdr_legal_basis/62002_cv_en.pdf" rel="external">Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr>) No 6/2002 on Community designs</a>. Registered and unregistered Community designs both have effect in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>The Community Design Regulation has been amended to apply the Hague System for the international registration of industrial designs to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Separately, the Registered Designs Act has been amended to apply the Hague System to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> as an individual country.</p>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> legislation on trade marks is primarily contained in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/26/contents" rel="external">Trade Marks Act 1994</a>. Secondary legislation appears in the Trade Marks Rules 2008 and other amending and standalone regulations.</p>

<h3>Why we changed <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> design and trade mark law</h3>

<p>Since 1 January 2021, all existing <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr>, <abbr title="unregistered Community designs">UCDs</abbr>, EUTMs and international design and trade mark registrations designating the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> no longer provide protection in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>As a result, we amended existing legislation to ensure that <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> protection granted by these rights was preserved and to allow <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law to continue to function effectively.</p>

<p>In addition, it was necessary to remove or amend many of the existing references to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, European Economic Areas (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>), and Member States that had become redundant or inappropriate.</p>

<h3>Numbering of re-registered design</h3>

<p>The number allocated to the re-registered design consists of the full <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> number prefixed with the digit ‘9’.</p>

<p>This provides users with a means of identifying re-registered rights created from <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> and distinguishing them from existing <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registered designs.</p>

<p>The following examples demonstrate how re-registered <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> designs are codified:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Existing RCD number</th>
      <th scope="col">Re-registered UK design number</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>004048098-0004</td>
      <td>90040480980004</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>000000021-0001</td>
      <td>90000000210001</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Opt out</h3>

<p>We created approximately 700,000 re-registered designs on 1 January 2021 and we recognise that some <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> holders may not have wanted to have been granted such a right.</p>

<p>Holders of the new right can ‘opt out’ of holding it. Opting out means that the re-registered design is treated as if it had never been applied for or registered under <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law.</p>

<p>You may not exercise an opt out right in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you have assigned, licensed or entered into an agreement in relation to the re-registered design if you have already launched proceedings based upon it</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to request an opt out</h3>

<p>To request an opt out, you must submit a short notice providing us with the <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> number, along with details of any persons with an interest in the right. The new law requires that notice to interested third parties must be given for opt out to have effect.</p>

<p>Therefore, where needed, you must confirm that such action has been taken.</p>

<p>We have created a notice template which you should use when requesting an opt out.</p>

<p>The template is available on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/trade-mark-forms-and-fees/trade-mark-forms-and-fees#other-forms">trade mark forms</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/design-forms-and-fees/design-forms-and-fees#other-forms">design form</a> webpages. Once we have received a request, we will send you confirmation that the right has been removed from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> register.</p>

<h3>Renewals and restoration</h3>

<p>A separate renewal fee will apply for each re-registered <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> design. Both <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registered designs and <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> can be renewed every 5 years up to a maximum of 25 years.</p>

<p>A separate renewal fee applies to both the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> right and the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>. The fees will need to be paid separately to <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> and to <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>.</p>

<p>For the purposes of future renewal, the re-registered design retains the existing renewal date of the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>. Under existing <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law, we send a renewal reminder to any <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registered design owner whose right is due to expire, and we do so in advance of the expiry date. This practice is retained for all re-registered designs with renewal dates which fall more than six months after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>However, where the re-registered design expires within the six month period that falls after 1 January 2021, we adopted a new procedure.</p>

<p>We also changed the law to accommodate <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> that expired in the six months before 1 January 2021, and which were still in their late renewal period after we left the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Designs which expired six months after 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>The same procedure for renewal and late renewal of registered designs under the Registered Designs Act and the Registered Designs Rules applies to re-registered designs.</p>

<p>You would have been sent a reminder renewal notice on the actual day of expiry (or as soon as is practicable after that date). This notice informed you that the re-registered design had expired, and provided you with a further six-month period, running from the date of the notice, in which the right could be renewed.</p>

<p>Where the re-registered design expired within six months after 1 January 2021, the usual additional renewal fee was not payable.</p>

<p>In addition to the new reminder notice being sent on or soon after the day of expiry, those with re-registered designs that expired within the fourth, fifth and sixth months after 1 January 2021 also received the conventional advance reminder notice in the usual manner.</p>

<p>Where the re-registered design was not renewed, it was removed from the register. It may be restored at a later date in accordance with existing <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law.</p>

<p>Where an <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>’s renewal date falls after 1 January 2021, early payment of the renewal fee at <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>, on a date prior to 1 January 2021, had no effect in respect of the re-registered design.</p>

<p>Any re-registered design with a renewal date falling at any time after 1 January 2021 is subject to a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> renewal action and fee. This is regardless of whether a renewal action was taken on the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> before 1 January 2021.</p>

<h3>Designs which expired before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>We also created a re-registered design from any <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>expired in the six months prior to 1 January 2021</li>
  <li>had not been subject to a late renewal action at <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr> by was still within its six-month late renewal period on 1 January 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>These re-registered designs held an ‘expired’ status. Their continued effect in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> was dependent upon late renewal of the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> at <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> was subject to late renewal, that renewal also had effect on the expired re-registered design. This means that the re-registered design was automatically renewed as a result of the <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>’s late renewal.</p>

<p>In this scenario, you were not be required to pay any renewal fees in respect of your first (<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>) renewal of the re-registered design.</p>

<p>If the expired <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> was not late-renewed at <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>, then the re-registered design (which was created on 1 January 2021 in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>) was removed from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> register on expiry of the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>’s late renewal period.</p>

<p>It was then treated as if it had never been applied for or registered under <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> registrations and applications reinstated after 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>Under the Community Design Regulation, a right that has been struck from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> register because of the applicant or owner’s failure to meet a deadline may be reinstated later and treated as if it had continuous legal effect.</p>

<p>Re-registered designs were only created from <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> which are registered within six months of its renewal date prior to 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>Therefore, <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rights which were not registered on that date but which were subject to reinstatement did not automatically result in the grant of re-registered designs. To address this, the new law provided holders and applicants of reinstated <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rights with the means to preserve those rights in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> are reinstated after 1 January 2021, and the proprietor notified us of such action, we would have created a re-registered design.</p>

<p>Reinstatement of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rights could only occur where the application was made to the <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr> within one year of the missed deadline.</p>

<p>If you held an <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> which was reinstated after 1 January 2021, and you were not granted a re-registered design, you should have informed us within six months of the <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>’s restoration.</p>

<p>If you held a pending <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> application which was reinstated after 1 January 2021 and it held a filing date prior to 1 January 2021, you could have submitted a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registered design application claiming the earlier <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> filing and/or priority date.</p>

<p>You could have done this within nine months beginning with the date on which the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> application was restored.</p>

<h2>Deferred publication</h2>

<h3>Where publication of the <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> is deferred at <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Under the new law, an <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> that was deferred on exit day was treated as being equivalent to a pending application. The publication of an <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> may be deferred at <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr> for up to thirty months.</p>

<p>Where deferment is requested, <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr> will not publish the design until either the holder has paid a publication fee and the deferment period has elapsed, or the holder requests publication before such expiry.</p>

<p>Whilst the deferment period is ongoing, <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr> will only publish basic details about the right holder and the filing date.</p>

<p>The holder of a deferred <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> could preserve its earlier filing and priority dates in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> by filing an equivalent registered design application in the nine months after the end of the transition period, that being up to and including 30 September 2021.</p>

<p>The application would not have been the subject of a substantive examination, because the <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> had already been examined by <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Applying for the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registered design to be deferred</h3>

<p>There is currently no framework in <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> legislation creating the right to defer publication of a registered design. As a matter of practice, the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> permits applicants to defer publication of their design by up to 12 months.</p>

<p>The examples below explain when a design will be published where the <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> was subject to deferment at the <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>, and a corresponding <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> application was made which seeks to retain the earlier <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> dates and requested <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> deferment.</p>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registered design applications, that do not seek to retain earlier filing and priority dates of a corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> that was deferred on 1 January 2021, may request <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> deferment in the normal manner.</p>

<p>In such cases, a period of twelve months deferment will run from the date on which the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> application was filed. This is regardless of whether that date falls inside or outside of the nine months after the end of the transition period.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> design and international design and trade mark law</h2>

<p>The primary <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> legislation on registered designs is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/88/contents" rel="external">The Registered Designs Act 1949</a>. There is also secondary legislation, mainly contained within the Registered Design Rules 2006, together with amending and standalone regulations.</p>

<p><abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> and <abbr title="unregistered Community designs">UCDs</abbr> are defined by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?%20uri=CELEX%3A32002R0006" rel="external">Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr>) No 6/2002 on Community designs</a>. Registered and unregistered Community designs both have effect in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>The Community design regulation has been amended to apply the Hague System for the international registration of industrial designs to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Separately, the Registered Designs Act has been amended to apply the Hague System to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> as an individual country.</p>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> legislation on trade marks is primarily contained in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/26/contents" rel="external">Trade Marks Act 1994</a>. Secondary legislation appears in the Trade Marks Rules 2008 and other amending and standalone regulations.</p>

<h3>We have changed <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> design and trade mark law</h3>

<p>After 1 January 2021, international design and trade mark registrations designating the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> no longer provided protection in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>Further information on the protection of these rights after 1 January 2021 is available:</p>
