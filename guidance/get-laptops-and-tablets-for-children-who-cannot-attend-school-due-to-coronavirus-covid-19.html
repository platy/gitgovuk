<h2>When laptops and tablets can be ordered</h2>

<h2>When laptops and tablets cannot be ordered</h2>

<ul>
  <li>apprentices</li>
  <li>adult learners (other than those aged 19 and over with an <abbr title="education, health and care plan">EHCP</abbr> and in receipt of free meals)</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to order devices</h2>

<h3>Ordering for pupils in years 3 to 13</h3>

<p>Academy trusts, local authorities, schools and 16 to 19 academies in England can use the <a href="https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/start" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Get help with technology service</a> to submit details of who will place orders. Local authorities and academy trusts have the option to manage the ordering process themselves or to delegate this to the education settings they are responsible for.</p>

<h3>Ordering for students in further education</h3>

<p>Eligible <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> colleges and other <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> institutions can use the <a rel="external" href="https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/start" class="govuk-link">Get help with technology service</a> to nominate who will place orders. Those nominated will receive an email once they’re able to order devices.</p>

<h3>Ordering for pupils in any year group who are shielding or attending a hospital school</h3>

<p>Academy trusts, local authorities, schools, 16 to 19 academies, <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> colleges and other <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> institutions can contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/devices/device-allocations#how-to-request-devices-for-children-and-young-people-who-are-shielding-or-attending-hospital-school" rel="external">get help with technology team</a> to request devices for disadvantaged pupils and students in any year group who:</p>

</li>
  <li>attend a hospital school</li>
</ul>

<h2>How device allocations have been decided</h2>

<p>Schools, 16 to 19 academies, colleges and other <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> institutions will receive an allocation of devices to be used to support disadvantaged children and young people who are otherwise unable to access remote education.</p>

<p>Examples of disadvantaged children and young people who may need support include those:</p>

<ul>
  <li>with no digital devices in their household</li>
  <li>whose only available device is a smartphone</li>
  <li>with a single device in their household that’s being shared with more than one other family member</li>
</ul>

<p>The number of devices available to order through the <a rel="external" href="https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/start" class="govuk-link">Get help with technology service</a> reflects the number of laptops and tablets we estimate are needed by each school, college or other <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> institution.</p>

<p>For schools, this calculation is based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of children in years 3 to 13</li>
  <li>free school meals data</li>
  <li>an estimate of the number of devices a school or college already has</li>
</ul>

<p>For <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> colleges and other <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> institutions, this calculation is based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>free meals data</li>
  <li>an estimate of the number of devices a further education provider has</li>
</ul>

<p>This allocation can be used as part of preparing to deliver remote education. However, the exact number and type of devices available will be confirmed at the time of ordering based on stock availability.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/devices/device-allocations">Information on device allocations</a> and how to query them is available.</p>
