<p>UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr>, the UK’s independent chemicals regulatory framework, starts on 1 January 2021. Anyone making, selling or distributing chemicals in the UK and the EU needs to follow UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> and EU <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> rules.</p>

<p>UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> will maintain EU <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr>’s aims and principles. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the “no data, no market” principle</li>
  <li>the “last resort” principle on animal testing</li>
  <li>access to information for workers</li>
  <li>the precautionary principle</li>
</ul>

<p>The government intends to extend the deadlines for submitting data under UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> transitional provisions subject to scrutiny by parliament and the devolved administrations. This guidance includes these extension dates rather than those currently provided in UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> legislation.</p>

<h2 id="uk-reach-for-business">UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> for business</h2>

<p>Under UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr>, manufacturers and importers have a duty to register chemicals that access the UK market.  GB-based companies currently registered with EU <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> will no longer be able to sell into the EEA market without transferring their registrations to an EU/EEA-based organisation.</p>

<p>Businesses must review their roles in the EU and UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> systems, and their current supply chains. They’ll need to take certain actions to access the EU/EEA and UK markets.</p>

<p>Under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the process for Northern Ireland businesses moving goods to and from the European Union under EU <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> will not change from 1 January 2021. Further guidance will be published for NI businesses moving goods into the GB market.</p>

<h2 id="uk-held-registrations-grandfathering">UK held registrations: ‘grandfathering’</h2>

<p>EU <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> registrations held by UK-based companies will carry across directly into UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr>, legally ‘grandfathering’ the registrations into the new regime.</p>

<p>UK-based holders of existing EU <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> registrations may continue the ‘grandfathering’ process by providing basic information to the Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) by 30 April 2021.</p>

<p>Holders must  complete the grandfathering process  within 2, 4 or 6 years of 28 October 2021, depending on their <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-comply-with-reach-chemical-regulations#Tonnage-band-deadlines" class="govuk-link">Tonnage Band Deadlines</a>.</p>

<p>The information UK-based holders need to provide will be the same or very close to what holders previously provided. Defra will publish any changes to the information needed in September 2020.</p>

<h2 id="eu-held-registrations-uk-downstream-users">EU held registrations: UK downstream Users</h2>

<p>UK downstream users (who do not hold an EU <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> registration) currently importing chemicals from an EU/EEA country  need to ensure the substances they purchase are covered by a valid UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> registration.</p>

<p>Businesses currently relying on a registration held by an EU/EEA-based company can continue importing substances as they do now on 1 January 2021. They will need to take subsequent actions to ensure that the chemical is registered for UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> purposes.</p>

<p>These UK downstream users must notify the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> using a Downstream User Import Notification (<abbr title="Downstream User Import Notification">DUIN</abbr>) of their intention to continue importing substances from the EU/EEA by 27 October 2021.</p>

<p>A new registration must then be submitted to the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> within 2, 4 or 6 years of 28 October 2021.
Alternatively, UK downstream users can encourage their EU/EEA supplier to appoint a UK-based Only Representative (<abbr title="Only Representative">OR</abbr>), or change their source to a UK registered supplier.</p>

<p>It’s possible to submit DUINs if a chemical is covered by a registration held by an EU/EEA-based <abbr title="Only Representative">OR</abbr> and then sold into the UK.</p>

<h2 id="tonnage-band-deadlines">Tonnage band deadlines</h2>

<p>Under UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr>, deadlines for the full submission of data to underpin registration dossiers will be staggered over a period of 6 years. These deadlines start from 28 October 2021, the end of the <abbr title="Downstream User Import Notification">DUIN</abbr> submission period.</p>

<p>These bands have been set to ensure those chemicals manufactured or imported at high tonnage, and those substances with particularly hazardous properties are registered first.</p>

<p>The tonnage bands are:</p>

<table>

    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Deadline Post 28 October 2021</th>

<h2 id="authorisations">Authorisations</h2>

<p>As the UK will be operating an independent regulatory system, UK downstream users will no longer be able to rely on EU <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> authorisation decisions addressed to companies in the EU/ EEA from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>All existing authorisations which have gone through the full authorisation process (and have a review date) will be recognised by  UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr>. This means that chemicals can continue to be used by UK companies who rely on these authorisations. New authorisation applications, and authorisations waiting for EU/<abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr> approval,  must be submitted to UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="eu-market-access-for-uk-business">EU market access for UK business</h2>

<p>GB-based entities currently holding EU <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> registration can continue exporting substances or mixtures to the EU/and EEA markets by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>transferring their registrations to an EU/EEA-based entity</li>
  <li>supporting their EU/EEA-based importers to become registrants</li>
</ul>

<p>GB-based entities currently holding EU <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> registrations also need a valid UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> registration to maintain access to the UK market.</p>

<p>The European Chemical Agency (<abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr>)  explain how to <a rel="external" href="https://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13552/how_to_transfer_uk_reach_registrations_en.pdf/1fb443ce-79de-6596-aae5-3f1033f1a5fb" class="govuk-link">transfer your UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> registrations</a> before 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>Under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the process for Northern Ireland businesses moving goods to and from the European Union under EU <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> will not change from 1 January 2021.</p>

<h2 id="comply-with-uk-reach">Comply with UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr>
</h2>

<p>The online service ‘Comply with UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr>’ will go live on 1 January 2021.  Businesses can use the service to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>validate existing UK-held EU registrations (‘Grandfathering’)</li>
  <li>submit downstream user import notifications (<abbr title="Downstream User Import Notification">DUIN</abbr>)</li>
  <li>submit new substance registrations</li>
  <li>submit new product and process orientated research and development (PPORD) notifications</li>
</ul>

<p>Businesses will need to coontact the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> to ensure that they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>validate existing UK-held product and process orientated research and development (PPORDs), known as ‘grandfathering’</li>
  <li>provide information on any authorisation matter,including new authorisation application, grandfathering of existing authorisations, and downstream user notifications of authorised uses</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="importing-from-the-eu-to-the-uk">Importing from the EU to the UK</h2>

<p>EU/EEA based companies who import chemicals into the UK under UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> must ensure that they are covered by a valid UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> registration.</p>

<p>These companies can register the substance under UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> through a UK-based <abbr title="Only Representative">OR</abbr> or an affiliate UK importer.</p>

<p>If the EU/EEA company takes on registration obligations through a UK-based entity, their UK customers will retain their downstream user status.</p>
