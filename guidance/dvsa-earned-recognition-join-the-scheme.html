<h2>What is <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition</h2>

<p>The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>) earned recognition scheme is a way to prove you meet driver and vehicle standards.</p>

<p>This means that you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>continuously monitoring your own compliance</li>
  <li>using monitoring systems</li>
  <li>compliant with vehicle and road safety standards</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s a voluntary scheme that’s designed to work for operators of all sizes.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>You need to have a <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>-validated IT system for vehicle maintenance and drivers’ hours. This will monitor whether you’re meeting a set of key performance indicators (<abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr>).</p>

<p>Every 4 weeks, your system will tell <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> if you’ve missed any of the <abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr> by a set amount. If this happens, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> will work with you to fix any problems.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>DVSA will not have direct access to any of your data or systems.</p>
</div>

<h3>Monitoring systems you can use from 1 April 2022</h3>

<p>From 1 April 2022, you can use one of these options for your vehicle maintenance monitoring systems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fully digital electronic reporting systems for maintenance and vehicle <abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr>, approved by <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>a mixture of manual maintenance and vehicle systems or a mixture of digital maintenance systems (both internal systems and external programmes), alongside digital reporting, all validated by <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>manually send maintenance and vehicle reporting information to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>What are the benefits</h2>

<p>As a <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition operator you’ll:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be an exemplary operator, and be able to prove this when you bid for contracts</li>
  <li>be less likely to have your vehicles stopped at the roadside for inspections</li>
  <li>be less likely to have <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> enforcement staff visit your premises</li>
  <li>be able to use the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition logo on your website and other publicity materials (but not on your vehicles)</li>
  <li>be recognised as a <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>-accredited operator on GOV.UK</li>
  <li>have direct access to a dedicated earned recognition team in <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Before you apply you need to make sure that you meet the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’ve had a heavy goods vehicle (<abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr>) or public service vehicle (<abbr title="public service vehicle">PSV</abbr>) operator licence for at least 2 years</li>
  <li>the Traffic Commissioner hasn’t taken any regulatory action (other than a formal warning) on any of your operator licences in the last 2 years</li>
  <li>you have management systems for vehicle maintenance and digital management systems for drivers’ hours, which you can use to track the <abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr> and report if they’re missed</li>
  <li>you meet the earned recognition audit standards</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you have multiple operator licences</h3>

<p>The application can only be made for the whole business - not individual licences. You must report the data for all your operator licences.</p>

<p>If your organisation contains multiple legal entities operating under one group - using the same management systems - you can make a single group application.</p>

<p>The audit standards and key performance indicators would apply and be measured over the group as a whole.</p>

<p>An individual legal entity cannot be removed from the group accreditation unless it changes ownership or no longer exists.</p>

<h3>Extra modules</h3>

<p>You can apply for accreditation for extra modules that show you meet the requirements to work on certain projects. These are optional and require you to meet additional audit standards or to provide extra information to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>.</p>

<p>An application for any of the extra modules can be for the whole entity or at least one operator’s licence with all its operating centres.</p>

<p>You might have to share information related to the extra module – such as <abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr> – with a third party.</p>

<p>You can currently apply for two extra modules on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>

</ul>

<h2>How much it costs</h2>

<p>There’s no application fee to join the scheme.</p>

<h3>Audits</h3>

<p>Your systems and processes must be audited by a <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>-authorised audit provider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>once your application has been reviewed</li>
  <li>every 2 years after you’ve joined the scheme</li>
</ul>

<p>You might need to pay for this, depending on the provider you choose. The providers set their own fees.</p>

<p>You need to tell your audit provider if you’re applying for extra modules.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Extra modules are audited every year.</p>

</div>

<h3>IT systems</h3>

<h2>Apply for extra modules</h2>

<h3>Existing scheme members</h3>

<p>If you’re an existing earned recognition scheme member, you can apply for extra modules at any time.</p>

<p>You’ll need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-to-join-dvsa-earned-recognition-or-add-extra-modules">fill in one copy of the application form</a> for each module you apply for and say what operator licences you want to include on the extra modules.</p>

<p>The audit can be completed either before or after the application has been submitted.</p>

<h3>Non-scheme members</h3>

<ul>
  <li>apply for extra modules at the same time as you submit your application for the earned recognition scheme</li>
  <li>have the audit for the extra modules conducted with your main audit</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to send an application form for each extra module with the main application form.</p>

<h2>Arrange an audit</h2>

<p>You can have an audit up to 3 months before or 3 months after <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> receives your application.</p>

<p>After <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> has your reviewed your application, they may ask for more checks to be carried out. Or, if the application fails to meet the necessary requirements, it may be rejected.</p>

<h3>Get an audit done by video call</h3>
<p>You can choose to have an audit by video call rather than in person.</p>

<p>You’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a mobile phone, tablet or other device with a working camera and microphone that can run video calling software such as Microsoft Teams or Zoom</li>
  <li>a stable internet connection</li>
</ul>

<p>To set up an audit by video call, contact your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dvsa-earned-recognition-authorised-audit-providers">auditor</a>.</p>

<h3>What the audit involves</h3>

<p>The auditor will look at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the processes involved in your transport management systems</li>
  <li>how you manage them</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll be audited against the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dvsa-earned-recognition-vehicle-operator-standards"><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition standard for <abbr title="heavy goods vehicles">HGVs</abbr> or <abbr title="public service vehicles">PSVs</abbr></a>, depending on which licences you have. There are different earned recognition audit standards for each.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You’ll be audited against HGV and PSV standards if you have both types of licence.</p>
</div>

<p>Each standard has 10 sections plus optional modules.</p>

<p>The audit might need to be done at one or more locations, depending on your operating systems, the number of operating centres you have, and your fleet size.</p>
</div>

<h3>Audit process</h3>

<p>On the day of the audit, you need to make sure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all the information the authorised audit provider needs is available</li>
  <li>the transport manager or other responsible person is available</li>
  <li>any questions the authorised audit provider asks can be answered</li>
  <li>the completed audit document is signed</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need to be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>show the systems you have in place to meet the standards</li>
  <li>comply with any requests from the authorised audit provider</li>
</ul>

<h3>Audit sampling</h3>

<p>As part of the audit, a sample of your vehicles and systems will be checked.</p>

<p>The audit sampling will be based on these 3 areas of your business:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vehicles</li>
  <li>drivers</li>
  <li>operating centres</li>
</ul>

<p>It will take into consideration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the type of management system and the area of responsibility</li>
  <li>whether <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> wants to direct the audit, or ask for specific measures to be checked</li>
  <li>that audits should only be carried out at operating centres that have an administrative or management function</li>
  <li>that where the main site is non-operational, an additional operating centre should be included in the audit</li>
  <li>that the auditor check should include a minimum of one month’s operator analysis and subsequent actions</li>
  <li>that, in addition to the audit at the main operating centre, any audit checks at other operating centres must be rotated at the periodic audit</li>
  <li>that maintenance records should conform with the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-maintaining-roadworthiness">guide to maintaining roadworthiness for commercial goods and passenger carrying vehicles</a>
</li>
  <li>that the sample must be representative of your fleet and include all types of vehicles and trailers across your vehicle age range</li>
  <li>that audit checks must be sampled across all types of maintenance providers: for example, manufacturers, independents and in-house providers</li>
  <li>sampling from each operator licence</li>
</ul>

<h2>Monitor your performance</h2>

<p>Your IT system will automatically measure and monitor the <abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr>, which will help you manage your business.</p>

<p>All <abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr> are measured over 4-week periods, which start on a Monday and end on a Sunday. This is known as a ‘KPI measurement period’.</p>

<p><abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr> are reported at the end of the period and are sent to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> 4 weeks later. You can either do this manually or your system can send it automatically. When you become a member of the scheme, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> will send you a form to make manual KPI reports.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong>
A measurement period runs from Monday 8 October 2018 to Sunday 4 November 2018. The KPIs are measured on Monday 5 November 2018 and are reported to DVSA on Monday 3 December 2018.</p>
</div>

<h3>About the <abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr>

<p>Grey alerts will automatically be reported to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> at the end of the measurement period.</p>

<h3>KPI automated trigger to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>
</h3>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> will be automatically alerted when an operator:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consistently fails to meet a KPI</li>
  <li>exceeds the KPI tolerance</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> will be alerted if any of the criteria for both maintenance and drivers’ hours are not met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>over three rolling KPI measurement periods, the operator fails to meet any one of the key performance indicators three times by less than one percentage point</li>
  <li>over three rolling KPI measurement periods, the operator fails to meet any one of the key performance indicators twice by one percentage point or more</li>
  <li>during any KPI measurement period, any key performance indicator is exceeded by two percentage points or more</li>
  <li>over 13 rolling KPI measurement periods, any key performance indicator is exceeded more than four times</li>
  <li>a driver has infringed in three consecutive KPI measurement periods</li>
</ul>

<h2>Keeping your earned recognition operator status</h2>

<h3>Monitoring</h3>

<p>The key performance indicators are used to measure your ongoing compliance.</p>

<p>The trigger points are used to indicate when you’re not meeting the key performance indicators.</p>

<p>The key performance indicators and trigger points are set by <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The system will notify <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> when you miss a KPI by more than the acceptable amount.</p>

<p>The key performance indicators are measured on a 4 weekly basis.</p>

<h3>Periodic audit</h3>

<p>As an earned recognition operator, your business must be audited every 2 years.  This must be done by a <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> authorised audit provider. But, if there are any issues with your performance, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> may ask you to arrange one sooner.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> authorised audit provider may charge for this service.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>If you have a concession, you’ll need a partial audit every year.</p>
</div>

<p>As an operator, you need to make sure that the audit is carried out to the agreed timescales. It must be completed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no more than three months before the 2nd anniversary date of entry into the scheme</li>
  <li>no later than 2 years after the anniversary date of entry into the scheme</li>
</ul>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong>
If you were accredited as an earned recognition operator on the 15 September 2018, the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>earliest you can do the audit is the 15 June 2020</li>
  <li>latest you can do the audit is the 15 September 2020</li>

<h3>Audit outcome</h3>

<p>The outcome of your audit will be one of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>standards met</li>
  <li>standards part met</li>
  <li>standards not met</li>
</ul>

<h4>Standards met</h4>
<p>This means that you remain in the scheme as you’ve met all the standards set out in the audit and <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> have agreed with the audit.</p>

<h4>Standards part met</h4>

<p>This means you’ll have to put an action plan in place. Your auditor will discuss what they found with you and send a proposed improvement plan and recommendations to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Standards not met</h4>
<p>This means that you’ve not met all the standards set out in the audit and <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> have agreed with the audit.</p>

<p>What action <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> takes next will depend on how far you’ve failed to meet the standards.</p>

<h2>When you do not meet earned recognition standards</h2>

<p>When you are not meeting the standards, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a key performance indicator has not been met and an alert is triggered</li>
  <li>compliance issues have been identified</li>
  <li>standards not met at periodic audit</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> will discuss the issues with you and consider all the known circumstances. They can use discretion when deciding what to do next. The action they take will depend on the seriousness of the issues.</p>

<p>In most cases, you’ll be given the opportunity to resolve any issues. The action taken may be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a desk-based assessment that may include a request for information</li>
  <li>a discussion at the operator’s request</li>
  <li>a discussion started at <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>’s request - they will ask for more information, data and explanations</li>
  <li>an improvement action plan which may include a further audit</li>
  <li>removal from the scheme</li>
</ul>

<h2>Leaving the scheme</h2>

<h3>If you leave voluntarily</h3>

<p>Membership of the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition scheme is completely voluntary. You can leave at any time. All you have to do is give at least 7 days’ notice.</p>

<p>But, it does mean you’ll:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be removed from the published list of accredited operators</li>
  <li>no longer be entitled to the benefits of being an earned recognition operator</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you’re refused entry to or removed from the scheme</h3>

<h4>Operator behaviour</h4>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> can refuse entry to the scheme or remove membership if it thinks the scheme’s credibility could be damaged by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an operator</li>
  <li>anyone working for or on their behalf</li>
</ul>

<h4>Failure to meet the scheme standards</h4>

<p>You may be removed from the scheme if you fail to meet standards. For example, if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fail to complete a periodic audit within the timeframe</li>
  <li>do not provide access to your maintenance systems and data</li>
  <li>are not able to achieve the <abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>are continually non-compliant and do not improve</li>
</ul>

<h3>The removal process</h3>

<p>If you’re removed from the scheme, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> will: give you 28 days’ notice and tell you the reasons why.</p>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> will not be liable for any of your costs resulting from your removal from the scheme.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="#how-to-appeal">appeal</a> against the decision if you want to.</p>
