<p>Article 29 referrals are triggered when a consensus cannot be reached between Member States on the outcome for a Marketing Authorisation Application (<abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Application">MAA</abbr>) which has been evaluated in a mutual-recognition procedure (<abbr title="mutual-recognition procedure">MRP</abbr>) or decentralised procedure (<abbr title="decentralised procedure">DCP</abbr>), on the grounds of a potential serious risk(s) to public health (<abbr title="potential serious risk(s) to public health">PSRPH</abbr>).</p>

<h2 id="how-we-will-treat-maas-at-different-stages-of-the-process-from-1-january-2021">How we will treat MAAs at different stages of the process from 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>For MAAs that have been referred under Article 29, where either a positive or negative opinion has been taken at the Coordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures - Human (<abbr title="Coordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures - Human">CMDh</abbr>) or the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (<abbr title="the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr>) but no decision issued by 1 January 2021, the MHRA will either grant or refuse the application with regard to the relevant committee decision.</p>

<p>For all pending MAAs submitted in the UK, as a Concerned Member State (<abbr title="Concerned Member State">CMS</abbr>), that have been referred under Article 29 before 1 January 2021 but no opinion has been reached by <abbr title="Coordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures - Human">CMDh</abbr> or <abbr title="the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr>, the MHRA will complete the assessment for Great Britain as a national procedure.</p>

<p>The MHRA assessment will take into account the existing RMS and <abbr title="Concerned Member State">CMS</abbr> assessments with particular focus on the identified <abbr title="potential serious risk(s) to public health">PSRPH</abbr>. If the MHRA are minded to refuse an application based on a <abbr title="potential serious risk(s) to public health">PSRPH</abbr>, consultation with the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) and other relevant expert advisory committees will take place.</p>

<p>On completion of the MHRA assessment, and consultation with expert advisory committees as required, the MHRA will issue its decision on approval or refusal of the Marketing Authorisation.</p>

<p>For applications where the MHRA had a positive opinion at Day 210 of a <abbr title="decentralised procedure">DCP</abbr> or Day 90 of an <abbr title="mutual-recognition procedure">MRP</abbr>, and considered that the risk/benefit of the product is positive in the subsequent referral procedure, a Marketing Authorisation will be granted following receipt of the national product information.</p>

<p>No additional or different fee will be charged for applications that are completed as a national procedure having previously been referred under Article 29. If a Marketing Authorisation applicant does not wish the MHRA to continue with the <abbr title="decentralised procedure">DCP</abbr>/<abbr title="mutual-recognition procedure">MRP</abbr> as a national application, the applicant should submit a withdrawal letter to the UK.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, Northern Ireland will continue to participate in referrals under Article 29 and will be bound by the outcome of the <abbr title="Coordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures - Human">CMDh</abbr> or <abbr title="the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> decision.</p>
