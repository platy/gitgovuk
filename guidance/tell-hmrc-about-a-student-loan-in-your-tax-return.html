<p>You’ll need to complete the student and, or postgraduate loan (<abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr>) repayment section of your Self Assessment tax return if the Student Loans Company (<abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr>) has said your repayments were due to start on or before 6 April of the year you’re completing your return for. If you do not give the correct information, you may have to pay penalties.</p>

<p>Your student loan Plan 1, 2 or 4 deduction will be calculated based on 9% of your total income above the threshold of your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/repaying-your-student-loan">plan type</a>.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deduction will be calculated based on 6% of your total income above the threshold.</p>

<p>You could be repaying Plan 1, 2 or 4 and <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> at the same time. If so, you’ll be due to repay 15% of your total income above the threshold.</p>

<p>Information on your loan or plan type is supplied to HMRC by the <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Give the information on <a class="govuk-link" href="#paper-tax-return">a paper</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="#online-tax-return">online tax return</a>.</p>

<h2>Information you’ll need</h2>

<p>You’ll need details of any amounts already deducted through your employment.</p>

<p>If you have had more than one job in the year, you’ll need to add up the repayments shown on all of your payslips, rather than just those of the most recent job. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/paye-forms-p45-p60-p11d/p60">Your P60</a> will not show the amounts deducted by a previous employer.</p>

<p>If you do not have access to some or all of your payslips, you can contact your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>previous employer</li>
  <li>current employer, if you’re missing a payslip or P60</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve had more than one source of income in the year, you might have to pay more than just your Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) deductions.</p>

<p>You’ll also need to give details of any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tell-hmrc-and-pay-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme-grant-back">Self-Employment Income Support Scheme grants you received</a>.</p>

<h3>Off-payroll working</h3>

<p>If you are subject to the off-payroll working rules for any period during the tax year, your student and postgraduate loan deductions for that period will be calculated through your Self Assessment tax return.</p>

<h2>Paper tax return</h2>

<h3>Box 1</h3>

<p>Put an ‘X’ in box 1 if the <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr> have told you that your repayments started on or before 6 April of the year you’re completing your return for, even if the income is below the threshold for the loan type.</p>

<p>This is the only question you have to answer if you’re repaying your student loan, and or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> and do not have any <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> income.</p>

<h3>Box 2</h3>

<p>Put the total of all student loan Plan 1, 2 or 4 deductions taken from all your employments through <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> in the tax year you’re completing your return for. You will find this information on your P60 or by adding up all the Plan 1, 2 or 4 deductions on your payslips for that year.</p>

<h3>Box 3</h3>

<p>Put the total of all <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions taken from all your employments through <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> in the tax year you’re completing your return for. You will find this information on your P60 or by adding up all the <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions on your payslips for that year.</p>

<p>Recording incorrect deductions will affect the student loan and, or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> charge, and could result in you being charged more.</p>

<h2>Online tax return</h2>

<h3>Section 2 — ‘Tell us about you’</h3>

<p>Select ‘Yes’ then choose:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the type of plan that you’re repaying if the <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr> have told you that your repayments of your student loan started on or before 6 April of the year you’re completing your return for, even if an employer made repayment deductions or your income was below the plan threshold</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> if the <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr> have told you that your repayments of your <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> started on or before 6 April of the year you’re completing your return for, even if an employer made repayment deductions or your income was below the <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> threshold</li>
</ul>

<p>These boxes may already be completed for you.</p>

<p>HMRC systems will then use the information supplied by the <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr> to calculate the correct student loan and, or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> repayment due. If you change the boxes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a warning message will be issued advising that the entry is different from the plan type or loan provided by <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr>, the warning message advises to check the letter from <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr> for the correct loan and or plan type</li>
  <li>an automatic calculation will be issued advising HMRC has changed the loan, plan type and the affect this has had on the calculation</li>
</ul>

<p>Recording incorrectly will affect the student loan and, or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> amount charged, however, HMRC systems will verify the information supplied by <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr> and a calculation will be automatically issued to advise of any changes.</p>

<p>You may be liable to repay Plan 1, 2 or 4 and <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> at the same time.</p>

<p>These are the only questions you have to answer if you’re repaying your student loan and, or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> and do not have any <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> income.</p>

<h3>Section 4 — ‘Fill in your return’</h3>

<p>Put the total of the amounts already deducted through your employment for the tax year you’re completing your return for. You can find these amounts on your P60 or by adding up all the student loan and, or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions on your payslips for that year.</p>

<p>You need to record the student loan plan type deductions and <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions separately in the relevant boxes.</p>

<p>Do not include here any overseas direct debit payments or voluntary payments you have made.</p>

<p>The repayment amount deducted by your employer, may already show here. You need to check the amount is correct even if it’s zero.</p>

<p>If it’s correct, choose ‘Yes’ then ‘Save and continue’.</p>

<p>If it’s not correct, choose ‘No’ and enter the correct amount. Remember to tell us why the figure is different and include the name and date of the document that shows this.</p>

<p>We’ll check the amount given against the information provided by your employer.</p>

<p>Recording incorrect deductions will affect the student loan and, or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> charge and could result in you being charged more.</p>

<h3>YouTube videos</h3>

<p>You can watch YouTube videos to help you complete this section.</p>

<p>Watch a YouTube video about why a tax return asks about Income Contingent Student Loans.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyw-BC2iH7c" rel="external">Why does my tax return ask about Income Contingent Student Loans?</a></p>

<p>Watch a YouTube video about why a tax return asks about Income Contingent Postgraduate Loans.</p>

<p>Watch a YouTube video about how to show Student Loan and Postgraduate Loan on your tax return.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwHLvgfTeyY" rel="external">How do I show Student Loan and Postgraduate Loan on my tax return?</a></p>

<h2>Overseas Direct Debit payments</h2>

<p>If you have been paying Direct Debit payments to the <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr> while you have been abroad your tax return will include your total income.</p>

<p>Your student loan repayments will be calculated on this total income, but will not take into account the Direct Debit payments you have already made to the <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-slc-repayment-enquiries">Contact the <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr></a> after you submit your tax return, they will tell HMRC how much you have paid.</p>

<p>HMRC then uses this figure to reduce the amount of tax you owe.</p>

<h2>Voluntary payments</h2>

<p>If you want to, you can make additional payments to the <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr>. These voluntary payments are separate to amounts collected by your employer or through your tax return, and will not change them.</p>

<p>You cannot choose to make these additional payments instead of your normal payments and voluntary payments cannot be refunded.</p>

<p>Voluntary payments will reduce the overall length of your loan and the interest charged on it.</p>
