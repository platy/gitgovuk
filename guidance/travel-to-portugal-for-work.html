<p>This guide is for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality">British citizens</a> travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa or permit.</p>

<h2>Entry requirements</h2>

<p>If you’re going to Portugal to work (or any other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">EU country</a>, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#passports-check-if-you-need-to-renew">make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attend business meetings. These are usually covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re going for other types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.</p>

<p>Portugal’s authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You must always check with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://imigrante.sef.pt/en/solicitar" rel="external">Portugal’s government</a> before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re working in more than one country you’ll need to check the entry rules of each country.</p>

<p>If you need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe">passport</a>, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.</p>

<h3>Visa and permit documents</h3>

<p>This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in Portugal. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.</p>

<p>It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://imigrante.sef.pt/en/solicitar" rel="external">Portugal’s immigration authorities</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy in the UK</a>.</p>

<p>You must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>translated</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">‘legalised’ (apostillised)</a> or notarised</li>
  <li>originals, or if copies are acceptable</li>
  <li>signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)</li>
  <li>dated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application</li>
</ul>

<p>Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa.</p>

<p>This guide uses the same terms used in Portugal, so you know which ones to use when speaking to Portugal’s authorities.</p>

<h2>Check if you need a visa or permit</h2>

<p>You don’t need a visa or permit if you’re travelling to Portugal for up to 90 days in a 180-day period for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attending business and sales meetings</li>
  <li>running or attending job interviews</li>
  <li>buying goods for sale outside the country</li>
  <li>attending a trade show, seminar or convention</li>
  <li>searching for new suppliers</li>
  <li>negotiating and signing contracts</li>
  <li>touring a company facility</li>
  <li>team building activities</li>
  <li>attending court as a witness</li>
</ul>

<p>These activities are covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<h3>Border checks</h3>

<p>At the border, you may be asked to show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets</li>
  <li>health insurance that covers your entire stay</li>
  <li>proof of accommodation for your entire stay</li>
  <li>enough money for the duration of your trip</li>
  <li>an invitation letter that explains your trip</li>
</ul>

<h2>Check Portugal’s exemptions</h2>

<p>Certain types of work and activities do not require a visa or permit because they’re exempt.</p>

<p>All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.</p>

<p>Portugal does not have any exemptions. However, if you have an EU intra-company transfer permit (EU <abbr title="intra-company transfer">ICT</abbr>) from another country you can work for up to 90 days in a 180-day period. You will not need a Portuguese visa or permit.</p>

<p>You have to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://imigrante.sef.pt/en/#contactos" rel="external">notify Portugal’s immigration office</a> (Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras) within 3 business days of arriving if you’re coming from an EU country. You need to make a telephone appointment to do this.</p>

<h3>Show proof of exemption</h3>

<p>You need to be able to show your EU <abbr title="intra-company transfer">ICT</abbr> permit to the authorities to prove that you’re exempt.</p>

<h3>Further checks</h3>

<p>If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://imigrante.sef.pt/en/solicitar" rel="external">Portuguese immigration authorities</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy in the UK</a>.</p>

<h2>Applying for a visa or permit</h2>

<p>This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit to help you prepare, but you’ll need to check the exact rules and processes with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://imigrante.sef.pt/en/solicitar" rel="external">Portugal’s immigration authorities</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy in the UK</a>.</p>

<h3>Taking your family</h3>

<p>Your family won’t be able to apply for dependant permits for short trips. They may be able to visit you under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://vistos.mne.gov.pt/en/national-visas/general-information/family-reunification#definition-of-family-members" rel="external">Families will be able to join you</a> with the longer-term residence permits listed in this guide.</p>

<h3>Short and long-term visas and permits</h3>

<p>You need a temporary stay visa if you’re in Portugal because you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#temporary">transferring short term from a UK-based company to a branch in Portugal</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#temporary">working for a Portuguese company on a short fixed-term Portuguese contract</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You also need one if you’re <a class="govuk-link" href="#temporary">providing any of the following services to a client in Portugal</a> for up to 1 year:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://vistos.mne.gov.pt/en/short-stay-visas-schengen/required-documentation/seasonal-work-visa" rel="external">seasonal work</a></li>
  <li>independent work</li>
  <li>highly qualified activity</li>
  <li>professional activity</li>
  <li>amateur sports activity</li>
  <li>show business and performing artists</li>
  <li>religious training within a religious congregation</li>
  <li>religious person undertaking studies in a recognised institution</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to apply for a longer-term residence permit if you’re in Portugal because you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#transfer">transferring long term to the Portuguese branch of a UK-based company</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#employment">working for a Portuguese company on a long-term Portuguese employment contract</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#self-employed">carrying out self-employed work</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#investor">investing in Portugal</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#research">conducting research work</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You usually also need to apply for a residency visa.</p>

<h2>Temporary stay visa for short-term work</h2>

<p>To qualify for a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://vistos.mne.gov.pt/en/national-visas/general-information/type-of-visa#temporary-stay-less-than-1-year" rel="external">temporary stay visa</a> you must:</p>
