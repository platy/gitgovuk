<p>As one of the Governments coronavirus (COVID 19) supporting measures, Self Assessment taxpayers were given the option of deferring payment of their July 2020 Payment on Account until 31 January 2021.</p>

<p>If you deferred this payment, you may have had these 3 payments to make on 31 January 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your deferred July 2020 payment on account (if it remains unpaid)</li>
  <li>any 2019 to 2020 balancing charge</li>
  <li>your first 2020 to 2021 payment on account</li>
</ul>

<p>If you had difficulty in making all 3 payments at once you may have chosen to set up a Time to Pay instalment arrangement with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Payment of Class 2 National Insurance contributions through a Time to Pay arrangement</h2>

<p>If you are Self-Employed and Pay Class 2 National Insurance contributions, you will usually pay them as part of your annual balancing payment.</p>

<p>If you are paying the 3 payments mentioned above through a Time to Pay arrangement, your deferred July payment on account will be cleared first, having the oldest due date. This is to minimise the interest you will be charged.</p>

<p>This could result in your 2019 to 2020 Class 2 National Insurance contributions being paid after their due date of 31 January 2021. Where Class 2 National Insurance contributions are paid after that date it can have a detrimental effect on certain contributory benefits claimed.</p>

<p>If this affects you, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/difficulties-paying-hmrc" class="govuk-link">contact <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr></a> as soon as possible for help. We may be able to allocate monies you have already paid for your 2019 to 2020 Self Assessment liabilities against the Class 2 National Insurance contributions that you owe. You may incur a small amount of interest if we do this, but your contributory benefit claim should be protected.</p>

<h3>Pay in instalments</h3>

<p>You can pay your tax by instalments if were unable to pay in full by 31 January 2021. If you have not filed your 2019 to 2020 Self Assessment return, you will need to file it as soon as possible. We will then know what payments you owe and you’ll be able to set up a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/difficulties-paying-hmrc" class="govuk-link">Time to Pay instalment arrangement</a> with us.</p>

<p>If you owe up to £30,000 you can do this online without having to contact us directly.</p>

<p>When you have filed your return you’ll need to wait at least 72 hours before you can set up your Time to Pay arrangement online.</p>

<p>Late payment penalties are charged when tax remains unpaid for 30 days, 6 months and 12 months after the payment due dates. You can avoid the penalties if you enter into a Time to Pay arrangement before they become due and you pay all the tax owing under that arrangement on time.</p>

<p>For Self Assessment payments that were due on 31 January 2021, you will avoid the first late payment penalty if you set up a Time to Pay arrangement by 2 March 2021. The 6 month and 12 month penalties can be avoided if you pay all the tax owing under that arrangement on time</p>

<p>Interest is payable on Time to Pay instalments so you should check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and-allowances-hmrc-interest-rates-for-late-and-early-payments/rates-and-allowances-hmrc-interest-rates" class="govuk-link">interest rates for late and early payments</a>.</p>

<p>Find out about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns/deadlines" class="govuk-link">deadline dates for Self Assessment returns submission</a>.</p>

<h3>Pay by Direct Debit</h3>

<p>If you normally pay by Direct Debit but chose to defer your July 2020 payment on account, you should have cancelled your Direct Debit through your bank so that we did not automatically collect any payment due.</p>

<p>You can re-instate that Direct Debit if you want to resume making payments on account this way in future</p>

<h3>Pay through your tax code</h3>

<p>If you’re paying taxes on an employment or occupational pension through the PAYE system, submit your 2019 to 2020 Self Assessment return online by 30 December 2020. You can ask us to collect any Self Assessment tax owing through an adjustment to your tax coding. Check to see if you’re <a href="https://www.gov.uk/pay-self-assessment-tax-bill/through-your-tax-code" class="govuk-link">eligible through your tax code</a>.</p>

<h2>How to get help</h2>

<h3>If you cannot pay your Self Assessment liabilities in full</h3>

<p>You should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/difficulties-paying-hmrc" class="govuk-link">contact <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr></a> as soon as you can if you are unable to pay your Self Assessment tax. We are determined to help all customers as much as possible. That help may mean setting up a Time to Pay instalment arrangement with you.</p>

<p>If you already have a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/difficulties-paying-hmrc" class="govuk-link">Time to Pay arrangement</a> in place and you are finding it difficult paying the agreed instalments <a href="https://www.gov.uk/difficulties-paying-hmrc" class="govuk-link">contact <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr></a></p>

<h3>Reducing your 2020 to 2021 payments on account.</h3>

<p>Your Payments on Account are based on your previous year’s tax bill. If your financial situation has been impacted by coronavirus, you may have a reduced tax liability arising for the 2020 to 2021 tax year. You may want to apply to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> to reduce your 2020 to 2021 payments on account.</p>
