</div>

<h2 id="healthcare-during-the-transition-period">Healthcare during the transition period</h2>
<p>There will be no changes to healthcare access for UK nationals visiting or living in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland before the end of 2020.</p>

<p>You can continue to use your EHIC during this time, as you did before.</p>

<p>If you’re visiting Spain on 31 December 2020, you can continue to use your EHIC until the end of your visit to that country.</p>

<p>An EHIC is not a replacement for travel insurance. Make sure you have both before you travel.</p>

<h2 id="european-health-insurance-card-ehic">European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h2>
<p>An EHIC covers state healthcare, not private treatment.</p>

<p>With an EHIC you can get medically necessary treatment in Spain on the same basis as a Spanish citizen. This means that you’ll get healthcare services for free or at a reduced cost.</p>

<p>An EHIC is not a replacement for travel insurance – it does not cover everything, such as mountain rescue or being flown back  to the UK. Make sure you have both before you travel to Spain .</p>

<p>You may need to pay in full for treatment if you do not have an EHIC.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-apply">How to apply</h3>
<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" class="govuk-link">Apply for an EHIC for free on the NHS website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-it">How to use it</h3>
<p>Show your EHIC when you visit any state hospital or doctor. You cannot use an EHIC for private healthcare.</p>

<h3 id="replacing-a-lost-or-stolen-ehic">Replacing a lost or stolen EHIC</h3>
<p>If you’re still in the UK, you can <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/travel-health/what-do-i-do-if-i-lose-my-ehic-or-it-gets-stolen/" class="govuk-link">apply for a new EHIC for free on the NHS website</a>.</p>

<p>You’ll need to <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/travel-health/what-do-i-do-if-i-lose-my-ehic-or-it-gets-stolen/" class="govuk-link">apply for a Provisional Replacement Certificate (PRC) if your EHIC is lost or stolen abroad</a>.</p>

<h2 id="travelling-with-a-health-condition">Travelling with a health condition</h2>
<p>Buy travel insurance with healthcare cover for your condition. Your EHIC will cover medically necessary treatment.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/travel-insurance-for-over-65s-and-medical-conditions" class="govuk-link">Read the Money and Pensions Advice Service guidance for buying travel insurance for people with pre-existing medical conditions.</a></p>

<p>Bring any documents about your health condition or what medication you’re taking.</p>

<p>If you need to have treatment while you’re in Spain, you may need to pre-arrange it. For example, if you need <a href="#oxygen-treatment" class="govuk-link">oxygen treatment</a> or dialysis.</p>

<p>Speak to your doctor in the UK for advice before you travel.</p>

<h3 id="getting-prescriptions">Getting prescriptions</h3>
<p>You can use a UK prescription to get medicine from pharmacies in Spain.</p>

<p>Prescription medicines are not free in Spain. With an EHIC you get a reduced rate, but you’ll still pay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>50% of the prescription price</li>
  <li>10% of the prescription price if you have a UK State Pension - you may need to show proof that you’re a pensioner to pay this rate</li>
</ul>

<p>These prescription charges are non-refundable.</p>

<h3 id="oxygen-treatment">If you need oxygen therapy during your visit</h3>

<p>You can get oxygen therapy with an EHIC, but you need to arrange this before you travel.</p>

<p>You must send a written request to the Spanish health authority in the area you plan to visit at least one month before you travel.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/request-oxygen-therapy-while-visiting-spain-template-letter" class="govuk-link">Find out how to request oxygen therapy in Spain.</a> This guide includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a letter template in Spanish that you can download and complete</li>
  <li>a list of contact details for Spanish health authorities</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bringing-medicine-with-you">Bringing medicine with you</h3>
<p>You need a letter to prove your medicine is prescribed to you if it contains a ‘controlled drug’. You may need to show this at the border when you’re entering or leaving the UK.</p>

<p>You may also need a licence for controlled drugs if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your trip is longer than 3 months</li>
  <li>you’re travelling with more than 3 months’ supply</li>
</ul>

<p>Read more about <a href="http://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs" class="govuk-link">travelling with controlled medicines</a>.</p>

<p>You should also contact your <a rel="external" href="http://www.exteriores.gob.es/Embajadas/LONDRES/en/Embajada/ServiciosConsulares/Pages/Consulates-in-the-UK.aspx" class="govuk-link">nearest Spanish consulate</a> before you travel to find out if you need to apply for a Spanish licence.</p>

<h2 id="travelling-to-have-planned-treatment">Travelling to have planned treatment</h2>
<p>You cannot use an EHIC for non-urgent planned treatment. For example, if you’re going abroad to give birth.</p>

<p>You can apply for NHS-funding to have planned treatment. There are 2 ways to do this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>S2 route</li>
  <li>EU directive route</li>
</ul>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/going-abroad-for-medical-treatment/" class="govuk-link">Read the NHS guide to seeking medical treatment abroad</a> for more information on the S2 or EU directive funding routes.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare-for-uk-nationals-visiting-spain-from-1-january-2021">Healthcare for UK nationals visiting Spain from 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>You’ll still be able to access healthcare through EHIC for visits that begin after 1 January 2021 if you’re either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK State Pensioner living in the EU before the end of 2020</li>
  <li>a UK student studying in in the EU before the end of 2020</li>
  <li>a ‘frontier worker’ (someone who works in one state and lives in another) before the end of 2020, for as long as you continue to be a frontier worker in the host state</li>
  <li>an EU national living in the UK before the end of 2020</li>
</ul>
