<h3>Entering Wandsworth</h3>
<p>On your first visit to Wandsworth, you will have your fingerprints taken for the security system. These will be used to confirm your identity on future visits.</p>

<p>You will also need to bring <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> to every visit.</p>

<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison.  Read the list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">acceptable forms of <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> when visiting a prison</a>.</p>

<p>All visitors will need to be given a pat-down search, including children. You may also be sniffed by security dogs.</p>

<p>Wandsworth has a family-friendly dress code which means visitors should dress appropriately. You may be turned away if you are wearing items like vests, low-cut tops, high-cut shorts or dresses or ripped jeans. Additionally, you cannot wear anything with offensive patterns or slogans. You will need to remove scarves, gloves, watches, sunglasses and hats (except religious head coverings) before you go in. Ask in the visitors centre if you have questions about the dress code.</p>

<p>There are currently no refreshments available during visits.</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into Wandsworth. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker or with security. This includes pushchairs and car seats.</p>

<p>You will be told the rules by an officer at the start of your visit. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h3>Visiting facilities</h3>
<p>There is a visitors centre run by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonadvice.org.uk/hmp-wandsworth" rel="external">Prison Advice and Care Trust (PACT)</a> charity. Family and friends can relax, buy refreshments and get advice and support from the staff.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Wandsworth</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with a prisoner during their time at Wandsworth.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners have phones in their rooms and are able to make outgoing calls. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>Phones do not accept incoming calls so they will always have to call you.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies from the prisoner, depending on the rules at Wandsworth.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Wandsworth</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>Friends and family can drop off books, socks and underwear for prisoners at Wandsworth whenever the visitors centre is open. These should be left in the property drop box in the visitors centre.</p>

<p>Prisoners must apply for permission to receive any other items. They can do this using a kiosk.</p>

<p>They are given a list of approved items that can be handed in and can receive one parcel in the first 28 days of custody. After that, they will normally be allowed one parcel a year if they are under 50 or one parcel every six months if 50 or over.</p>

<p>Parcels should be handed in at the property garage next to the visitors centre. The property garage opening times are:</p>

&nbsp;
For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>
