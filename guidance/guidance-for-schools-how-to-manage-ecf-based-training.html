<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Early career teachers are entitled to 2 years of training based on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-the-early-career-framework-ecf-supports-induction#the-early-career-framework">early career framework</a>.</p>

<p>This training is part of statutory induction and is known as ‘<abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training’.</p>

<h2>Setting up your <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training</h2>

<p>For <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> to serve induction at your school, you must have:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#appoint-an-appropriate-body">appointed an appropriate body</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#nominate-an-induction-tutor">nominated an induction tutor</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#report">reported which <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training option you have chosen for those <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/how-to-set-up-your-programme" rel="external">step-by-step guide to setting up your <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training</a>.</p>

<h3>Appoint an appropriate body</h3>

<p>You must appoint an appropriate body for each of your <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Appropriate bodies quality assure induction. They:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirm each <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>’s role is suitable to count towards their statutory induction</li>
  <li>register each <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>’s induction with the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA)</li>
  <li>check your <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> receive their statutory entitlements</li>
  <li>make sure formal assessments are fair and appropriate</li>
</ul>

<p>If your school delivers training using accredited materials or designs and delivers your own training, your appropriate body will check that the training is based on the <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>. This process is known as ‘fidelity checking’. Schools using a <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>-funded training provider will not need to have these checks.</p>

<p>Most schools appoint one appropriate body for all their <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>, but you can appoint a different appropriate body:</p>

<ul>
  <li>as a choice for a new <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>, or group of <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>, due to start induction</li>
  <li>when an <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> did their initial teacher training (ITT) through an accredited provider who cannot then be the appropriate body assuring their induction</li>
  <li>where an <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> is serving their induction in a teaching school hub or appropriate body, who cannot also be the appropriate body assuring their induction</li>
</ul>

<h3>Nominate an induction tutor</h3>

<p>Your school must nominate an induction tutor to be our point of contact. This person is given access to our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">manage training for early career teachers service</a>. Currently you can only nominate one induction tutor at a time.</p>

<p>If your school has not registered an induction tutor with us before, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/nominations/resend-email" rel="external">request a link so you can nominate a new induction tutor</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to change to a new induction tutor, your current induction tutor can sign in to our service to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">nominate someone else to be the induction tutor</a>. This will transfer access to your school’s account to the new induction tutor.</p>

<p>If you’re not sure if you have registered an induction tutor or an induction tutor has left your school without nominating a new induction tutor, email our support team at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk">continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h4>The role of an induction tutor</h4>

<p>Your school induction tutor is responsible for the monitoring and support of your <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>. They also manage progress reviews and coordinate formal assessments.</p>

<p>Ideally your school induction tutor will not mentor an <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> at the same time. This is because the 2 roles have separate and different responsibilities.</p>

<p>Your induction tutor should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hold qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>have the skills and knowledge needed to assess your <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>’s progress against the teachers’ standards</li>
  <li>carry out regular progress reviews</li>
  <li>undertake 2 formal assessment meetings with each <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> during the 2-year induction period, one midway through induction and one at the end</li>
  <li>be able to recognise when early action is needed if an <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> is experiencing difficulties</li>
</ul>

<p>You can read more about the roles and responsibilities of an induction tutor in section 5 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-for-early-career-teachers-england">statutory guidance on <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> induction</a>.</p>

<h3>Report how you run your <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training</h3>

<p>You must tell us about changes to your <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training as soon as possible. This is in addition to any information you give to your appropriate body, lead provider or delivery partner.</p>

<p>Sign into our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">manage training for early career teachers service</a> to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tell us if and when you expect <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> to start their inductions at your school</li>
  <li>choose or change how your school will run your <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training</li>
  <li>change who will be the induction tutor for your school</li>
</ul>

<p>If your school is using a training provider or accredited materials, sign into our service to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tell us the details of each new <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>
</li>
  <li>tell us the details of each new mentor assigned to an <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>, or assign an existing mentor</li>
</ul>

<p>You can add <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> at any time, but they’ll only become eligible for funded training once they have qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>).</p>

<p>For help using the service, email our support team at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk">continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Delivery options for <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training</h2>

<p>Your school has 3 delivery options for <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training.</p>

<p>You can choose to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#option-1">use a <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>-funded training provider</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#option-2">use <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>-accredited materials to deliver your own training</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#option-3">design and deliver your own <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It’s up to your school leaders to decide which option will be best for your <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> and mentors.</p>

<p>Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/funding-and-eligibility-for-ecf-based-training">funding and eligibility for <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training</a>.</p>

<h3>Option 1: use a <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>-funded training provider</h3>

<p>This is where a training provider and a delivery partner provide <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training directly to your <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>. They also train your mentors on how to support <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>.</p>

<p>This option is fully funded by <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>, so there are no costs for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/funding-and-eligibility-for-ecf-based-training#eligible-schools">eligible schools</a>.</p>

<h4>Lead providers</h4>

<p>Schools can choose from 6 training providers. These organisations are known as ‘lead providers’.</p>

<p>The 6 lead providers are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www2.ambition.org.uk/l/330231/2021-02-24/4mvx6" rel="external">Ambition Institute</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bestpracticenet.co.uk/early-career-framework" rel="external">Best Practice Network (home of Outstanding Leaders Partnership)</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.capita.com/expertise/supporting-teachers-in-early-career" rel="external">Capita with lead academic partner the University of Birmingham</a></li>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe-early-career-framework" rel="external">UCL Institute of Education</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The training programmes designed by these lead providers are accredited by <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> and quality assured by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/" rel="external">Education Endowment Foundation (EEF)</a>.</p>

<h4>Delivery partners</h4>

<p>Lead providers work with ‘delivery partners’ to deliver their training programmes to <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> and mentors from schools across England.</p>

<p>Delivery partners include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/teaching-school-hubs">teaching school hubs</a></li>
  <li>trusts</li>
  <li>universities</li>
  <li>other organisations</li>
</ul>

<h4>Ofsted inspection</h4>

<p>Lead providers are regularly inspected by Ofsted on the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>quality of professional development and training</li>
  <li>leadership and management of the lead provider</li>
</ul>

<p>During an inspection, Ofsted inspectors visit a sample of the lead provider’s delivery partners. The inspectors also talk to <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>, mentors and trainers about the programme.</p>

<p>The performance of <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>, mentors and trainers is not inspected.</p>

<h4>Register with a lead provider</h4>

<p>Contact the lead providers to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get more information about their <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training programmes</li>
  <li>register your school for <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training</li>
</ul>

<p>When you register with a lead provider, they will report the partnership to us and also tell us which delivery partner you’ll be using.</p>

<p>You’ll see the lead provider and delivery partner’s names in your account when you sign into our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">manage training for early career teachers service</a>.</p>

<p>If you cannot see their names, ask your lead provider to confirm the partnership with <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Option 2: use <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>-accredited materials to deliver your own training</h3>

<p>Schools choosing this option must use <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training materials from one of 4 suppliers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ambition Institute</li>
  <li>Education Development Trust</li>
  <li>Teach First</li>
  <li>UCL Early Career Teacher Consortium</li>
</ul>

<p>The materials are quality assured by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/" rel="external">Education Endowment Foundation (EEF)</a>. They include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>self-directed study materials</li>
  <li>mentor session guidelines</li>
  <li>training session outlines</li>
</ul>

<p>Your appropriate body will fidelity check your programme to make sure it covers the full depth of the <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>.</p>

<h4>How to access the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>-accredited materials</h4>

<p>To access and compare the training materials from the 4 suppliers, sign into the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">support for early career teachers service</a>. You can create an account for your school if you do not already have one.</p>

<p>We email your <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> and mentors a link to the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>-accredited materials when they pass our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/funding-and-eligibility-for-ecf-based-training#how-dfe-checks-the-eligibility-of-ects-and-mentors">eligibility checks</a>.</p>

<h3>Option 3: designing and delivering your own <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training</h3>

<p>Your school can choose to design and deliver your own 2-year training programme based on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework">the <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>If your school chooses this option, your induction tutor should sign into our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">manage training for early career teachers service</a> to tell us. You do not need to register your <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> and mentors on the service, as there is no requirement for eligibility checks.</p>

<p>Your appropriate body will fidelity check your programme to make sure it covers the full depth of the <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Making changes to an existing training programme</h2>

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
      Changing to a different training delivery method part-way through an ECT’s induction period is not recommended.
    </div>

<p>If you cannot avoid making a change, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>research the change fully, so you can be sure the new delivery method is right for your <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> and mentors</li>
  <li>plan the change for the end of a school year, if possible</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you’re using a training provider</h3>

<p>To change to another lead provider:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Contact your current lead provider directly to discuss your concerns.</li>
  <li>If you decide to change to another lead provider, you’ll then need to register with the new lead provider.</li>
  <li>Contact the current lead provider again. They’ll confirm the end of the partnership with you.</li>
  <li>Send this confirmation to our support team at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk">continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk</a>.</li>
  <li>We’ll send your school an email when we’ve removed your current lead provider from your account.</li>
  <li>Your new lead provider will report the partnership to us. This may take a few weeks. Once they’ve done this, you’ll see the change in your account when you sign into the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> service.</li>
</ol>

<p>To change to another delivery partner but stay with the same lead provider:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Contact your lead provider directly to discuss your concerns.</li>
  <li>If you decide to change to another delivery partner, your lead provider will confirm the change with you.</li>
  <li>Your lead provider will tell us about the change to the new delivery partner. This may take a few weeks. Once they’ve done this, you’ll see the change in your account when you sign into the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> service.</li>
</ol>

<p>To switch from using a training provider to another delivery method:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Contact your lead provider directly to discuss your concerns.</li>
  <li>If you decide to change to another delivery method, your lead provider will confirm the end of the partnership with you.</li>
  <li>Send this confirmation to our support team at: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk">continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk</a>.</li>
  <li>We’ll send your school an email to confirm the change.</li>
  <li>When you receive the email, sign into our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">manage training for early career teachers service</a> and tell us how you plan to continue your <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>’ training.</li>
</ol>

<h3>If you’re using <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>-accredited materials</h3>

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
      Your ECTs and mentors may lose their progress if you make a change to a training programme they have already started.
    </div>

<p>Email our support team at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk">continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk</a> to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>change to a different set of <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>-accredited materials</li>
  <li>switch to using a <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>-funded training provider</li>
  <li>tell us you want to design and deliver your own training programme</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you’re designing and delivering your own training programme</h3>

<p>You do not need to tell <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> about a redesign of your training programme. Your appropriate body will still fidelity check the programme to make sure it covers the full depth of the <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>.</p>

<p>To switch from your own training programme to another delivery method:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sign into the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">manage training for early career teachers service</a> to change your programme.</li>
  <li>Follow the instructions in the service to tell us how you plan to continue your <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>’ training.</li>
</ol>

<p>You’ll need to add your <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> and mentors to the service so we can check their eligibility for <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> funding.</p>

<h2>Supporting <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>
</h2>

<p><abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> should participate in <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training as fully as possible, although failing to complete it does not mean they fail their induction.</p>

<p>You can share the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-for-early-career-teachers-ects-ecf-based-training">guidance for <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> on <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training</a> to help your <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> understand how the training works.</p>

<p>You can also read about the expectations for an <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> in section 5 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-for-early-career-teachers-england">statutory guidance on induction for <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3>Part-time induction and reduced induction periods</h3>

<p>If your school uses a training provider, contact your lead provider for their policies on part-time induction and reduced induction periods. You will also need to ask the <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>’s appropriate body to agree to any reduction to their induction period.</p>

<p>If your school uses accredited materials or designs and delivers its own training, contact your appropriate body for advice on part-time induction and reduced induction periods.</p>

<p>When an <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> is serving a reduced induction period, there’s no expectation that they should cover the full depth of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework">the <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr></a>. Your headteacher should work with your induction tutor, appropriate body and training provider (where relevant) to make sure training and support is appropriate for the <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> engagement with training provider programmes</h3>

<p>If your school uses a training provider, the lead provider will have minimum requirements for <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> engagement. This is to make sure <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> receive their statutory entitlement to <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training.</p>

<p>If an <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> cannot meet those engagement requirements, they may be withdrawn from the programme by the lead provider. If this happens, your school may have to provide them with alternative <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training.</p>

<h3>Handling <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>’ concerns and difficulties</h3>

<p>If an <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> is struggling with their training, they should ask their induction tutor for help. If your school is using a training provider, they can speak to them too.</p>

<p>When an <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> has concerns about their induction or statutory entitlements (time off timetable and support from a mentor), they should speak to your school induction tutor first.</p>

<p>If your induction tutor is unable to help, the <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> can speak to their appropriate body. <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> must be given the contact details of a named person at the appropriate body at the start of their induction.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> transfers between schools part-way through induction</h2>

<p>Sign into the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">manage training for early career teachers service</a> to tell us as soon as you know an <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>transferring to your school part-way through their induction</li>
  <li>transferring away from your school part-way through their induction</li>
</ul>

<p>We need this information so both schools receive the correct funding.</p>

<h3>What to do when an <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> transfers to your school</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Report the transfer to the appropriate body you’ve appointed for the <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>. They’ll need to complete some checks and update the <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>’s record with the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA).</li>
  <li>Ask the <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> or their previous school to provide records of any assessments and progress reviews completed so far.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How to continue an <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>’s training</h3>

<p><abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> should continue with their existing <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training programme if at all possible.</p>

<p>Where this is not possible, you’ll need to make arrangements for the <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> to continue their <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training with a different training provider or by another delivery method.</p>

<p>You should discuss these arrangements with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the appropriate body you have appointed for them</li>
  <li>your lead provider, if you’ll use a training provider to continue their training</li>
  <li>their previous lead provider, if their old school used a training provider to deliver their training</li>
</ul>

<h2>Supporting mentors</h2>

<p>It’s important that mentors are given adequate time to carry out their role effectively, so they can meet the needs of their <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>.</p>

<p>You should timetable <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> and mentor sessions during teaching hours wherever possible, as schools receive <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/funding-and-eligibility-for-ecf-based-training#dfe-funding-for-ecf-based-training"><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> funding to cover mentor time off timetable</a>.</p>

<p>In exceptional circumstances, mentoring may take place outside of teaching hours but these sessions should always be scheduled within contracted time.</p>

<h3>Mentor responsibilities</h3>

<p>These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>working with your school to make sure their <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> receives a high-quality induction programme</li>
  <li>meeting regularly with their <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> to provide support and feedback</li>
  <li>providing or arranging mentoring and coaching around specific phases and subject areas</li>
  <li>taking prompt, appropriate action if their <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> is having difficulties</li>
</ul>

<p>You can share the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-for-mentors-how-to-support-ecf-based-training">guidance for mentors on <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training</a> to help your mentors understand their role.</p>

<p>Ideally your school induction tutor will not be assigned as a mentor at the same time. This is because the 2 roles have separate and different responsibilities.</p>

<p>You can read more about the role and responsibilities of mentors in section 5 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-for-early-career-teachers-england">statutory guidance on <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> induction</a>.</p>

<h3>Mentor sessions and observations</h3>

<p><abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> are entitled to mentor support throughout their 2-year induction period. Schools receive <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/funding-and-eligibility-for-ecf-based-training#dfe-funding-for-ecf-based-training"><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> funding to cover mentor time off timetable</a>.</p>

<p>Your headteacher and appropriate body are expected to check that mentors have enough time to meet with their <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> on a regular basis.</p>

<p>If your school uses a training provider, your mentors may be asked to carry out observations as part of <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training. These observations are for professional development purposes and must not be used for formal assessment.</p>

<h3>Mentor training from training providers</h3>

<p>If your school uses a training provider, each mentor will be given 36 hours of mentor training over 2 years. This is to make sure mentors know how to support <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> through an <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training programme.</p>

<p>Every mentor at your school is expected to take part in this training. Schools receive <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/funding-and-eligibility-for-ecf-based-training#backfill-payments-for-mentorship-training"><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> funding for each mentor to backfill time off timetable</a>.</p>

<p>Schools should not send one mentor for training and then expect that mentor to train their colleagues. Your lead provider will have minimum engagement requirements for all the mentors at your school.</p>

<p>If an <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> moves schools or withdraws part-way through their induction, their assigned mentor can continue their training as long as they are ready to work with other <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Mentors without <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> or <abbr title="qualified teacher learning and skills status">QTLS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Mentors are expected to hold <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> and have the necessary skills and knowledge to work successfully in this role.</p>

<p>You can assign a mentor who does not hold <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> or qualified teacher learning and skills status (<abbr title="qualified teacher learning and skills status">QTLS</abbr>), as long as they have the necessary skills and knowledge to support an <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>. Your headteacher should check this decision with the <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>’s appropriate body.</p>

<p>If your school uses a training provider or accredited materials, the mentor without <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> or <abbr title="qualified teacher learning and skills status">QTLS</abbr> may need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/participants/start-registration/get-a-trn" rel="external">apply for a teacher reference number (TRN)</a> if they do not already have one. This is so we can carry out an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/funding-and-eligibility-for-ecf-based-training#how-dfe-checks-the-eligibility-of-ects-and-mentors">eligibility check for funding and access to materials</a>.</p>

<h3>Handling mentors’ concerns and difficulties</h3>

<p>If a mentor has concerns or difficulties, they should contact your school induction tutor.</p>

<p>Tell your appropriate body if a mentor does not have the time or ability to carry out their role effectively.</p>
