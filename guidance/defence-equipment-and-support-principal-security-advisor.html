<p>We provide specialist and relevant advice to reduce security and business continuity risks and amplify Ministry of Defence (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>) and government security policy requirements. These security services are provided to <abbr title="Defence Equipment and Support">DE&amp;S</abbr> and the defence industry. This includes the provision of visit and visitor clearances through the International Visits Control Office (<abbr title="International Visits Control Office">IVCO</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Contact us</h3>

<p>For routine security enquiries please contact the Security Advice Centre: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:DESPSyA-SecurityAdviceCentre@mod.gov.uk">DESPSyA-SecurityAdviceCentre@mod.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>Industry Security Assurance centre: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ISAC-Group@mod.gov.uk">ISAC-Group@mod.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Industry Security Assurance Centre responsibilities</h2>

<p>We are responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assisting UK companies in obtaining Facility Security Clearance (FSC) and/or Industry Personnel Security Assurance (IPSA) status when contractually required to hold classified material at SECRET (Foreign CONFIDENTIAL) or above</li>
  <li>helping UK companies to verify the security status of foreign facilities and citizens through liaison with national security authorities</li>
  <li>approving the hand carriage of classified material being taken overseas by casual courier</li>
  <li>co-ordinating of all international visits, inward and outward; for security cleared UK nationals to <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>, overseas government and defence industry sites</li>
  <li>approving some transportation plans relating to the movement of bulky, classified assets travelling within the UK and overseas</li>
  <li>sponsoring personnel security clearances for primary security controllers and their deputy at an FSC facility and IPSA personnel security controllers and their deputy, if required.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The ISAC Vault</h3>

<p>The ISAC Vault is the website we use to share security advice and policy with FSC and IPSA facilities. The available documentation is to promote effective security governance.</p>

<h3>National security vetting and government contracting</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/united-kingdom-security-vetting">Access more information on security vetting and clearance</a></p>

<h2>Security awareness</h2>

<h3>Understanding UK threat levels</h3>

<p>The threat of international terrorism comes from a diverse range of sources and a threat could manifest itself from a lone individual or group. The terrorist threat can take a number of forms, as terrorists may use a variety of methods of attack to achieve their objectives.</p>

<p>While the UK has faced a variety of terrorist threats in the past, a unique combination of factors place the current threat on a scale not previously encountered.</p>

<p>The terrorists draw their inspiration from a global message articulated by internationally recognisable figures.</p>

<h3>The threat from terrorism when overseas</h3>

<p>Information on threats to personal safety arising from terrorist activities, political unrest, lawlessness, violence, natural disasters, epidemics, anti-British demonstrations and aircraft/shipping safety. It is designed to help you make informed decisions about whether or not to travel to a particular country.</p>

<h3>The threat of espionage</h3>

<p>The UK is a high priority espionage target and a number of countries are actively seeking UK information and material to advance their own military, technological, political and economic programmes.</p>

<h2>The International Visits Control Office</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="International Visits Control Office">IVCO</abbr> is responsibile for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assisting UK defence contractors in obtaining visit clearance</li>
  <li>establishing and maintaining records of the staff cleared for overseas visits</li>
  <li>acting as a focal point to ascertain the permitted levels of access to UK classified material allowed by foreign nationals</li>
  <li>simplifying the procedures for issuing security assurances and for transmitting them to the appropriate authorities</li>
</ul>

<p>It consists of 2 sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Inward: visits to the UK: visits by all foreign nationals to UK defence contractor sites, <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> (HQ) buildings and <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> agencies</li>
  <li>Outward: visits from the UK: visits by security cleared UK nationals to overseas government, contractor and military sites</li>
</ul>

<p>When contacting us:</p>

<ul>
  <li>only contact <abbr title="International Visits Control Office">IVCO</abbr> to speed up existing visit requests if it is absolutely vital. Priority is given to processing requests rather than dealing with telephone calls, which can delay this</li>
  <li>applications for inward and outward visits are dealt with in strict rotation. Please ensure that your request for visit (<abbr title="Request for visit">RfV</abbr>) application forms are submitted correctly completed and don’t submit visit requests which fall out with the agreed timescales</li>
  <li>avoid emergency visit requests unless they really are cases of genuine emergency</li>
  <li>please only contact the <abbr title="International Visits Control Office">IVCO</abbr> office in emergencies, all other queries can be sent by email or fax as listed in the contact us section below</li>
</ul>

<h3>Opening hours:</h3>

<p>Monday to Thursday: 11am to 4pm
Friday: 10am to 3pm.</p>

<p>Please note that we are closed everyday between 12pm and 1pm</p>

<p>Due to severe staff shortages within <abbr title="International Visits Control Office">IVCO</abbr>, and a high volume of short notice visits requests, there may be delays in the processing of visit requests and responding to queries.</p>

<p>Before submitting a query, please note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>guidance on the process for <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> personnel can be found in JSP 440, available from the Defence Intranet</li>
  <li>guidance for UK defence contractors is available in the form of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/defence-contractors-guidance-notes">International visits guidance notes for <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> List X contractors</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Urgent queries only should be emailed to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:despsy1-ivco@mod.gov.uk">despsy1-ivco@mod.gov.uk</a>.  A normal service will resume as soon as possible and we apologise for any inconvenience caused.</p>

<h2>Outward visits</h2>

<p>Personnel who need to travel overseas to access or discuss classified material, including information or sensitive areas in foreign defence establishments and contractor’s facilities need to be aware of the <abbr title="International Visits Control Office">IVCO</abbr> procedures, explained here.</p>

<p>Request for visits are sometimes being submitted to <abbr title="International Visits Control Office">IVCO</abbr> incorrectly which delays the process. As we have a very strict lead time for all visits it results in incorrect visits submissions being rejected.</p>

<p>To avoid this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>please ensure that an up to date index card is attached to the visit request, when the visitors are new to your organisation or if there are new details of their clearance or passport</li>
  <li>if the visit is an emergency, attach a justification letter which must be from the host</li>
  <li>for all amendment visits please state the <abbr title="International Visits Control Office">IVCO</abbr> reference in section 1 of the form and also state which amendment it is (Eg. amendment 1, amendment 2, etc)</li>
  <li>only complete sections 1 to 3, and 5 to 13 of the request for visit form, sections 14 and 15 must remain empty</li>
  <li>on the site to be visited section of the form (Annex A), you must state a full name, fax and email details</li>
  <li>incomplete submissions will result in rejection of this visit by <abbr title="International Visits Control Office">IVCO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>please make sure that the visitor has the relevant clearance to match the required level of classification (section 11 of the form) and that their clearance expiry date matches the entire visit dates (section 7 of the form). If these do not match then the visitor will be removed from the request for visit form</li>
</ul>

<h3>Completion of personal index cards</h3>

<p>Indicate whether it is a new record or an amendment to a previously issued card. A valid ‘proof of vetting’ (<abbr title="Proof of vetting">POV</abbr>) number and date must be quoted.</p>

<h3>Visits where access is required at confidential or above</h3>

<p>RfVs must be submitted where access is confidential or above (except for visits between the parties to the <abbr title="Letter of intent">LoI</abbr> framework).</p>

<p>Visits where access does not exceed restricted:</p>

<ul>
  <li>RfVs must be submitted to <abbr title="International Visits Control Office">IVCO</abbr> for any visits to any country not listed below</li>
  <li>

</ul>

<h2>Inward visits</h2>

<p>Foreign nationals visiting a UK <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> establishment or UK defence contractor site that require access to classified information or access to a senstive area must provide official confirmation of their security clearance in the form of a <abbr title="Request for visit">RfV</abbr>. The lead time for standard visits is 20 working days notice from the day that the <abbr title="Request for visit">RfV</abbr> arrives at <abbr title="International Visits Control Office">IVCO</abbr>.</p>

<p>Visitors should initiate the visit request and must ensure that it is approved by and transmitted through their own national security authorities (<abbr title="National Security Authorities">NSA</abbr>) who should send the <abbr title="Request for visit">RfV</abbr> to their embassy/high commission in London. The embassy/high commission should process the <abbr title="Request for visit">RfV</abbr> to <abbr title="International Visits Control Office">IVCO</abbr>.</p>

<p>Once an <abbr title="Request for visit">RfV</abbr> has been received by <abbr title="International Visits Control Office">IVCO</abbr> it will be forwarded to the relevant <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> project authority. They consider the acceptability of the proposed visit including the clearance level required and advise on any information that can/cannot be seen or areas that can/cannot be accessed by the visitor.</p>

<p>The current lead time for emergency visits (inwards) is 5 working days. This does not include the day the visit is received in <abbr title="International Visits Control Office">IVCO</abbr> or the start date of the visit.</p>

<p>All visits and queries can be sent by <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:despsya-ivco@mod.gov.uk">despsya-ivco@mod.gov.uk</a> or fax: 0117 9234924.</p>

<p>Opening hours are: Monday to Thursday, 11am to 12pm and 1pm to 4pm; and Friday 10am to 12pm and 1pm to 3pm.</p>

<h3>Visits by foreign nationals of <abbr title="Multi-National Industrial Security Working Group">MISWG</abbr>, <abbr title="Letter of intent">LoI</abbr> and NATO member nations, Australia and New Zealand</h3>

<p>Emergency visits require 5 working days notice and can only last for 30 days. A justification letter from the host must be submitted to <abbr title="International Visits Control Office">IVCO</abbr> for all emergency requests.</p>

<h3>Amendments to visit requests</h3>

<p>Visit dates cannot be extended if this change will result in the visit being valid for longer than 1 year. Dates cannot be amended to bring the start date of a visit forward to an earlier date. Only visitors can be amended. Additional sites can not be added to a <abbr title="Request for visit form">RFV</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<h3>What is a security aspects letter?</h3>

<p>The ‘secret matter’ in an invitation to tender (<abbr title="invitation to tender">ITT</abbr>) or contract containing DEFCON 659A must be defined to the contractor in writing. The special obligations laid upon the contractor become legally effective only when the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> has issued a notice in writing, defining which aspects of the <abbr title="invitation to tender">ITT</abbr> or contract are graded at OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE or above. This is achieved by means of a security aspects letter (<abbr title="Security Aspects Letter">SAL</abbr>) written by the contracting authority, or by the inclusion of a security aspects clause in the <abbr title="invitation to tender">ITT</abbr> or contract. A <abbr title="Security Aspects Letter">SAL</abbr> provides a contractual means of ensuring that security is addressed in the work that a Contractor is undertaking. A <abbr title="Security Aspects Letter">SAL</abbr> is not required if the Contractor will not be exposed to any classified material graded above OFFICIAL. In such cases the Contractor must still be informed of their security obligations via DEF CONS included in the contract.</p>

<p>The contractor is required to confirm in writing that he understands and will implement the terms of the <abbr title="Security Aspects Letter">SAL</abbr> or clause. The <abbr title="Security Aspects Letter">SAL</abbr> is the legal instrument under which a UK contractor may be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act. The <abbr title="Security Aspects Letter">SAL</abbr> must therefore be issued to the contractor with the <abbr title="invitation to tender">ITT</abbr> or contract document. <abbr title="Defence Equipment and Support">DE&amp;S</abbr> <abbr title="Principal Security Advisor">PSyA</abbr>’s office must be informed in advance if this is not possible.</p>

<h3>Do I have a designated field adviser?</h3>

<p>In most cases, <abbr title="Defence Equipment and Support">DE&amp;S</abbr> <abbr title="Principal Security Advisor">PSyA</abbr> assurance advisors are assigned by region These regions are: Scotland; England (North); England (East); England (West); England (South East) and London; England (South West) and Wales; and Hampshire. For details of your assurance advisor please contact the Security Advice Centre.</p>

<h3>What are the timescales involved for hand carriages and transportation plans?</h3>

<p>The required notice periods for hand carriages are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>EU/RoW (exc Australia/US) - 2 working days</li>
  <li>US/Australia - 5 working days.</li>
</ul>

<p>For transportation plans the required notice periods are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>within UK - 3 working days notice</li>
  <li>EU (except Italy) - 5 days</li>
  <li>US/Italy/Australia/rest of world - 10 days</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that due to current resource issues we may not be able to approve ‘emergency requests’ with shorter lead times.</p>

<h3>How does my company gain a Facility Security Clearance (FSC)?</h3>

<p>Facility Security Clearance (FSC) formerly known as ‘List X’ refers to contractors or subcontractors which have been formally assessed by the relevant Government authority and reached the required standard as defined in GoVS 007 – Security to hold, process or manufacture materiel at SECRET (foreign CONFIDENTIAL) or above on the company premises. FSC is not available on request, it must be sponsored by a contracting authority (<abbr title="Contracting authority">CA</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Contracting authority">CA</abbr> can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a Ministry of Defence entity: This is extensively, but not invariably, in the form of a project team (PT).</li>
  <li>another government department: A number of UK Government departments, may also award a facility FSC status.</li>
  <li>an existing FSC holding company: An enterprise with an existing government contract may act as a contracting authority to one or more third-party subcontractors who may inherit the responsibility to hold classified assets. Any move to appoint a subcontractor must be approved by the original contracting authority.</li>
  <li>NATO: Where a contract requires a UK enterprise to hold NATO CONFIDENTIAL (or above) information at their facility, the contracting authority will require assurance from <abbr title="Defence Equipment and Support">DE&amp;S</abbr> <abbr title="Principal Security Advisor">PSyA</abbr>’s office that the facility is suitable for FSC status.</li>
  <li>overseas governments and their contractors. In the event that an overseas contracting authority require a UK enterprise to be awarded FSC, the UK government may complete this on their behalf
Key requirements for FSC status:</li>
  <li>a contract at SECRET (foreign CONFIDENTIAL) or above</li>
  <li>a requirement either for the work to be done on the contractor’s premises or for classified information to be held on site</li>
</ul>
