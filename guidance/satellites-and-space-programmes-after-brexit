<p>The UK is leaving the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. This page tells you how to prepare for Brexit and will be updated if anything changes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup?topic=%2Fbrexit">Sign up for email alerts</a> to get the latest information.</p>
</div>

<p>This guidance sets out how the UK’s participation in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> space programmes will be affected if there’s a no-deal Brexit.</p>

<p>These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the European satellite navigation programmes, Galileo and European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (<abbr title="European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service">EGNOS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the Copernicus Earth Observation space programme</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Space Surveillance and Tracking (<abbr title="EU Space Surveillance and Tracking">EUSST</abbr>) programme</li>
</ul>

<p>The UK’s membership of the European Space Agency (<abbr title="European Space Agency">ESA</abbr>) is not affected by leaving the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> as it is not an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> organisation.</p>

<h2 id="galileo">Galileo</h2>

<h3 id="actions-for-businesses-academics-and-researchers">Actions for businesses, academics and researchers</h3>

<p>Any UK businesses, academics and researchers currently contracted or expecting to carry out contracts on programmes where the UK will no longer participate, should contact the relevant contracting authority to make sure that arrangements are in place to comply with the conditions of the contract and to avoid possible penalties.</p>

<p>Businesses, academics and researchers in the UK and in UK overseas territories which currently hold ground infrastructure hosting contracts may wish to contact their contracting authority, such as the European Space Agency or the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Global Navigation Satellite System Agency to verify the future position.</p>

<h3 id="areas-where-uk-involvement-can-continue">Areas where UK involvement can continue</h3>

<p>For the public and most UK, <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and other satellite navigation users, there should be no noticeable impact following a no-deal Brexit. For example, devices that currently use Galileo and <abbr title="European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service">EGNOS</abbr>, such as smart phones, will continue to be able to do so.</p>

<p>UK businesses and organisations will continue to be able to use the freely available ‘open’ signal to develop products and services for consumers, and will be able to continue using the open position, navigation and timing services provided by Galileo and <abbr title="European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service">EGNOS</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> subsidiaries of UK businesses remain eligible to bid for future work on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Global Navigation Satellite System (<abbr title="EU Global Navigation Satellite System">GNSS</abbr>) programmes.</p>

<h3 id="areas-where-uk-involvement-will-end">Areas where UK involvement will end</h3>

<p>The UK will not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use Galileo (including the future Public Regulated Service (<abbr title="Public Regulated Service">PRS</abbr>)) for defence or critical national infrastructure</li>
  <li>have access to the encrypted Galileo Public Regulated Service</li>
  <li>be able to play any part in the development of Galileo</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that UK-based businesses, academics and researchers will not be able to bid for future <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="EU Global Navigation Satellite System">GNSS</abbr> contracts and may face difficulty carrying out and completing existing contracts.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>The UK currently participates in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="EU Global Navigation Satellite System">GNSS</abbr> programmes Galileo and <abbr title="European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service">EGNOS</abbr> as a member of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, and makes financial contributions and provides technical expertise to the programme. <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries may access all services provided by both systems including the encrypted Galileo <abbr title="Public Regulated Service">PRS</abbr> which is expected to be available from the mid-2020s.</p>

<p>Companies based in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> may also bid in open competition for contracts to build, operate and exploit both Galileo and <abbr title="European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service">EGNOS</abbr>.</p>

<p>The Galileo system has begun to offer initial services worldwide but is not expected to be completed until the mid-2020s. <abbr title="European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service">EGNOS</abbr> is already fully operational and provides services across Europe. In addition, the UK hosts ground infrastructure for both Galileo and <abbr title="European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service">EGNOS</abbr>. Currently users in the UK may access all available Galileo and <abbr title="European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service">EGNOS</abbr> signals and services.</p>

<h2 id="copernicus">Copernicus</h2>

<h3 id="actions-for-businesses-academics-and-researchers-1">Actions for businesses, academics and researchers</h3>

<p>The UK will not be able to participate in the parts of the Copernicus programme that are open only to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member States. For example, UK-based businesses, academics and researchers will not be able to bid for future Copernicus contracts tendered through the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, or through any other process using <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> procurement rules.</p>

<p>We expect that UK-based entities holding Copernicus contracts with delivery dates that run past the date of Brexit will continue to be able to deliver that work. We would encourage UK-based entities holding those contracts to confirm arrangements with their relevant contracting authority.</p>

<p>UK-based Copernicus data users should consider the impact that losing access to any data or information not sourced under the free and open data policy may have on their operations.</p>

<h3 id="areas-where-uk-involvement-can-continue-1">Areas where UK involvement can continue</h3>

<p>The UK will remain a member of the European Space Agency (<abbr title="European Space Agency">ESA</abbr>) and will continue its participation in the Copernicus Space Component (<abbr title="Copernicus Space Component">CSC4</abbr>) of the Copernicus programme. This will allow UK entities to continue to be able to bid for contracts tendered through <abbr title="European Space Agency">ESA</abbr> for <abbr title="Copernicus Space Component">CSC4</abbr>, its predecessor the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (<abbr title="Global Monitoring for Environment and Security">GMES</abbr>) programme, or under other programmes such as the Earth Observation Envelope Programme 5 (<abbr title="Earth Observation Envelope Programme 5">EOEP5</abbr>) and Future EO-1.</p>

<p>Copernicus has a free and open data policy which means that the data produced by its satellites (Sentinels) and the Land, Marine, Climate Change and Atmosphere services will continue to be freely available to UK users.</p>

<p>UK membership of the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (<abbr title="European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites">EUMETSAT</abbr>), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (<abbr title="European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts">ECMWF</abbr>) and Mercator Ocean are unaffected. Those organisations will retain access to high-bandwidth data that supports the Land, Marine, Climate Change and Atmosphere services.</p>

<p>UK organisations will continue to be able to bid for Copernicus contracts tendered through <abbr title="European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts">ECMWF</abbr>, <abbr title="European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites">EUMETSAT</abbr> and Mercator Ocean because they operate procurement processes that differ from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> procurement rules.</p>

<p>Subsidiaries of UK organisations that are based in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-based researchers using Copernicus data and services will be unaffected if there’s a no-deal Brexit.</p>

<p>The UK will continue to be part of the Jason Continuity of Service (<abbr title="Continuity of Service">C/S</abbr>) mission. We expect that UK-based entities holding contracts in the Jason <abbr title="Continuity of Service">C/S</abbr> mission with delivery dates that run past the date of Brexit will continue to be able to deliver that work. We would encourage UK-based entities holding those contracts to confirm arrangements with their relevant contracting authority.</p>

<h3 id="areas-where-uk-involvement-will-end-1">Areas where UK involvement will end</h3>

<p>UK-based businesses, academics and researchers will not be able to bid for future Copernicus contracts tendered through the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, or through any other process using <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> procurement rules.</p>

<p>Some UK users may lose the right to high-bandwidth access to the standard data from Copernicus Sentinels. Some UK users may also lose access to data sourced by Copernicus from Contributing Missions.</p>

<h3 id="background-1">Background</h3>

<p>The UK currently participates in the Copernicus Earth Observation space programme as a member of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, as well as through our memberships of <abbr title="European Space Agency">ESA</abbr>, <abbr title="European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites">EUMETSAT</abbr>, <abbr title="European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts">ECMWF</abbr> and Mercator Ocean. The UK contributes to Copernicus financially and UK industry and academia are involved in the delivery and operation of the programme.</p>

<p>UK companies, researchers and public sector organisations use Copernicus data for a wide range of applications. Companies and researchers based in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or in Copernicus Participating states also bid in open competition for contracts to design, build and operate both the physical infrastructure of the programme and its services.</p>

<p>The UK is fully involved in the decision-making of the programme, for example as a member of the main governance Committee. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) leads for the UK government on Copernicus policy. The UK Space Agency leads on policy relating to satellites and the physical data infrastructure of the Copernicus programme for the UK.</p>

<h2 id="space-surveillance-and-tracking">Space surveillance and tracking</h2>

<h3 id="actions-for-businesses-academics-and-researchers-2">Actions for businesses, academics and researchers</h3>

<p>A small number of UK providers may still have programme delivery contracts in place when the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Any companies currently involved in the programme should contact their relevant contracting authority if they have concerns about their contractual status.</p>

<p>Any <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> organisations currently or expecting to carry out contracts which involve partnership arrangements with UK businesses, academics and researchers may wish to contact the relevant contracting authority to make sure that arrangements are in place to ensure continued partnership complies with the conditions of the contract after Brexit and to avoid possible penalties.</p>

<h3 id="areas-where-uk-involvement-will-end-2">Areas where UK involvement will end</h3>

<p>The UK will not be eligible to participate in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Space Surveillance and Tracking programme if there’s a no-deal Brexit.</p>

<p>The UK will continue to receive space, surveillance and tracking data from the US, so there will no impact on space safety.</p>

<p>UK organisations will not be able to contribute to providing services to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Space Surveillance and Tracking, to participate in the scientific and technical groups to develop the programme further or be able to receive grant funding to pay for UK involvement.</p>

<h2 id="more-information">More information</h2>

<p>Businesses, academics and researchers with existing contracts relating to these programmes, or who use data and services, may contact the UK Space Agency <a href="mailto:info@ukspaceagency.gov.uk">info@ukspaceagency.gov.uk</a> with any questions or concerns.</p>

<p>Organisations who get Horizon 2020 research programme funding, or who are bidding for funding, can find more information in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-participation-in-horizon-2020-uk-government-overview">Horizon 2020 guidance</a>.</p>
