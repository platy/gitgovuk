<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>This guidance will be updated if anything changes to how you get state healthcare in Austria.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-austria" class="govuk-link">Sign up for email alerts.</a></p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>This information is about living in Austria. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare" class="govuk-link">There’s different guidance if you’re visiting Austria.</a></p>
</div>

<p>Austria has a state health insurance fund (the Österreichische Gesundheitskasse) that you pay into each month to access state healthcare.</p>

<p>You may still have to pay on top of this to use some parts of the healthcare system.</p>

<p>UK nationals usually access the Austrian healthcare system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>paying for state health insurance through your employer</li>
  <li>paying for state health insurance directly</li>
  <li>using a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) or UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) for temporary stays</li>
  <li>registering a UK-issued <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">S1 form</a> with the state insurance fund</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare if you live and work in Austria</h2>
<p>You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-austria">register as a resident</a> if you’re living in Austria.</p>

<p>If you’re employed or self-employed in Austria it’s compulsory to have health insurance.</p>

<p>If you’re not working, you should take out voluntary insurance.</p>

<p>You can add your dependants to your insurance plan.</p>

<p>Your insurance begins on the day you took out the insurance, but there can be a waiting period of 6 months before you can claim any benefits from your insurer.</p>

<p>There will not be a 6-month wait if you were already insured in another way, either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for the 6 weeks before you took out insurance</li>
  <li>for 26 weeks at any point in the year before you took out insurance</li>
</ul>

<p>You may be entitled to an Austrian <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for travel, including visits to the UK.</p>

<p>You may also have the right to apply for a <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">UK S1</a> if you start drawing a UK State Pension.</p>

<h3>How to register</h3>
<p>You first need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-austria">register as a resident</a>.</p>

<p>You’ll be signed up automatically for health insurance if you’re employed.</p>

<p>If not, contact your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gesundheitskasse.at/cdscontent/?contentid=10007.851829&amp;portal=oegkportal" rel="external">local branch of the Österreichische Gesundheitskasse</a> (website in German).</p>

<p>Once you’ve registered you will be given a card called an ‘e-card’. Show this every time you visit a doctor. You do not need to register with a doctor in Austria.</p>

<p>This card also gives you access to online services. Your Austrian <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is on the back.</p>

<h3>How much you’ll pay</h3>
<p>Your monthly payment increases with your salary and varies across Austria.</p>

<p>Look for a doctor’s surgery that says:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Kassenarzt (‘contracted doctor’)</li>
  <li>Alle Kassen (‘all insurers’)</li>
</ul>

<p>You will not have to pay to see these doctors.</p>

<p>You will still have to pay for some medical services, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>20% of the cost of seeing a private doctor – your insurance scheme should reimburse the rest</li>
  <li>a fee of around 10 to 15 euros for each of your first 28 days in hospital</li>
</ul>

<h2>If your UK employer has sent you to Austria temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A posted worker, also known as a ‘detached worker’, is someone who is employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to a European Economic Area (EEA) country.</p>

<p>UK posted workers can access healthcare in Austria using an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, GHIC or S1 form.</p>

<p>HMRC has a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. They can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h2>UK-funded healthcare: getting and using an S1 form in Austria</h2>

<p>There’s different guidance <a href="#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">if you have an S1 as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you’re an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-austria">Austrian resident</a> and receive a UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 form if you’re a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>If you started living in Austria before 1 January 2021, you may also be entitled to an S1 if you receive some other ‘exportable benefits’.</p>

<div role="note" class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits" class="govuk-link">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus" class="govuk-link">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you have an S1 form, you must register it on the Austrian system.</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants will be entitled to healthcare in Austria on the same basis as an Austrian citizen.</p>

<p>You’ll also get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/">UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> for travel</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">planned treatments</a> in other EU countries</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependants and family members may be classified differently in Austria than the UK.</p>

<p>Check with the local authorities when you register your S1 form.</p>

<h3>How to get an S1 form</h3>
<p>If you have a UK State Pension, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services
<br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
<br>Saturday, 9am to 3pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>How to use an S1 form in Austria</h3>
<p>You must register your S1 form with the state health insurance fund (the ‘Österreichische Gesundheitskasse’ in German).</p>

<p>Once registered, you’ll be given a card called an ‘e-card’. This shows that you’re entitled to healthcare on the same basis as an Austrian citizen.</p>

<p>Show this every time you visit a doctor.</p>

<p>This card also gives you access to online services.</p>

<h2>Studying in Austria</h2>
<p>You can use an <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or GHIC</a> to get medically necessary healthcare until the end of your study period.</p>

<p>You can also choose to register for state health insurance and pay the student rate. You’ll need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-austria">register as a resident</a> first.</p>

<h2>Getting treatment in the UK</h2>
<p>Some former UK residents do not have to pay for NHS treatment when visiting England. This includes UK nationals who started living in the EU before 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>If you return to live in the UK you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>
