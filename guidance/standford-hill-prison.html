<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Standford Hill</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with a prisoner during their time at Standford Hill.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners do not have phones in their rooms so they will always have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>Men can use the phones anytime between 6am and 10pm.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number on the envelope. 
If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Standford Hill</a>.</p>

<p>All post, apart from legal letters, will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>

<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>Prisoners can make an application to have items sent in to them as specified on the facilities list. They can also purchase goods from a range of catalogues and can have property handed in on visits, if the visitor applies prior to the visit.</p>

<p>Friends and families of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.
&nbsp;
For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>

<h2>Life at Standford Hill</h2>
<p>Standford Hill is committed to providing a safe and educational environment where men can learn new skills to help them on release.</p>

<h3>Security and safeguarding</h3>
<p>Every person at Standford Hill has a right to feel safe. The staff are responsible for their safeguarding and welfare at all times.</p>

<p>For further information about what to do when you are worried or concerned about someone in prison <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/pages/category/need-urgent-help?Take=24" rel="external">visit the Prisoners’ Families helpline website</a>.</p>

<p>All safeguarding processes are overseen by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.kent.gov.uk/about-the-council/partnerships/kent-and-medway-safeguarding-adults-board" rel="external">Kent and Medway Safeguarding Adults Board</a>.</p>

<h3>Arrival and first night</h3>
<p>When a prisoner first arrives at Standford Hill, their property will be listed. They will be able to contact a family member by phone. This could be quite late in the evening, depending on the time they arrive.</p>

<p>They will get to speak to someone who will check how they’re feeling and ask about any immediate health and wellbeing needs.</p>

<h3>Induction</h3>
<p>Each person who arrives at Standford Hill gets an induction that lasts about a week. During this week, each prisoner is given a timetable where they can meet professionals who will help them with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>health and wellbeing, including mental and sexual health</li>
  <li>any substance misuse issues, including drugs and alcohol</li>
  <li>personal development in custody and on release, including skills, education and training</li>
  <li>other support (sometimes called ‘interventions’), such as managing difficult emotions</li>
</ul>

<p>Transitioning into open conditions can be challenging for some prisoners so all have access to Samaritans ‘Listeners’ and induction peer support workers.</p>

<h3>Accommodation</h3>
<p>Standford Hill is an open prison and holds over 450 men. It has 3 wings made up of single rooms. Each wing has access to telephones, communal areas with pool and snooker tables, dart boards and cooking facilities.</p>

<h3>Education and work</h3>
<p>The main prison focus is for prisoners to work out in the community. They do repairs or are in paid employment towards the end of their sentence.</p>

<p>In the prison, an education department offers a range of full and part-time learning and vocational training opportunities. Men can take part in further and higher education on site, through distance learning, the local college or on day-release to universities.</p>

<p>Much of the employment throughout the prison involves peer advisors to encourage learning and responsibility, whenever possible.</p>

<h3>Temporary release</h3>
<p>Release on temporary licence (ROTL) is the cornerstone of a resettlement plan. Each man’s needs are considered on an individual basis. They are kept fully informed of
their progress and their family members have a vital role in its success.</p>

<p>Prisoners are eligible for ROTL on arrival at the prison. Eligibility requires risk assessment processes to be applied before any unaccompanied ROTL takes place. These processes can take up to 12 weeks to make sure each ROTL is both individually appropriate while ensuring public safety.</p>

<p>ROTL can be used for resettlement, day release to maintain family ties, work, training and education. Resettlement overnight release is used for getting men back into the community while maintaining their family ties.</p>

<p>A special purpose licence can be used for compassionate family emergencies or medical reasons.</p>
