<p>During the coronavirus outbreak, your role and responsibilities as a deputy or attorney remain the same. However, you must follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus" class="govuk-link">government guidance</a> on social distancing, self-isolation and shielding.</p>

<p>On October 12 the Government introduced a system of Local COVID Alert Levels.  If you live, work or volunteer in an area that is part of Local COVID Alert Level: High or Local COVID Alert Level: Very High, there are additional restrictions which apply to you. Please visit the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-covid-alert-levels-what-you-need-to-know" class="govuk-link">Local COVID Alert Levels page</a> to find out what level your area is in and the additional restrictions that apply.</p>

<p>If you’re not sure about something, or need help making a decision, you can read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/lasting-power-attorney-duties" class="govuk-link">being an attorney</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/become-deputy" class="govuk-link">being a deputy</a>.</p>

<p>You may also find it useful to look at the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-capacity-act-code-of-practice" class="govuk-link">Mental Capacity Act Code of Practice</a>.</p>

<p>If you do still need to contact us, please bear in mind we are receiving a high number of calls and have fewer staff in the office. It may take us longer than normal to respond to calls and emails.</p>

<h2 id="i-cannot-visit-the-person-because-of-shielding-or-self-isolation">I cannot visit the person because of shielding or self-isolation</h2>
<p>If you have to make a decision but want to talk to the person first, think about how urgent it is and whether it could be delayed. If it is urgent, you could use the phone, a video call or have a care worker pass on the information.</p>

<p>You could also think about decisions and written statements the person has made in the past to see if that can help you make the decision.</p>

<h2 id="i-cannot-do-something-for-the-person-because-im-self-isolating-or-shielding">I cannot do something for the person because I’m self-isolating or shielding</h2>
<p>If you are self-isolating or shielding, you must continue to make decisions for the person. You cannot ask anyone else to make those decisions for you.</p>

<p>However, you can make a decision, then have someone help with any tasks you cannot do yourself. For example, they can go to a shop to buy something or to the bank to deposit a cheque. Some supermarkets have volunteer shopping cards that allow someone to buy groceries and other essentials for another person.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-the-persons-health-or-care-providers">Working with the person’s health or care providers</h2>
<p>Being an attorney or deputy does not mean that you can tell a health or care provider they have to use their resources to help the person. This includes resources such as care provision, particular medical equipment or a doctor’s time.</p>

<p>If you’re making a decision about the person’s care or medical treatment and there are different options available, you should choose the one that’s in the person’s best interests.</p>

<p>When you make a decision you should follow the principles of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-capacity-act-code-of-practice" class="govuk-link">Mental Capacity Act</a>. Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/make-decisions-for-someone/making-decisions" class="govuk-link">making decisions for someone else</a>.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-stop-acting-as-an-attorney-or-deputy-temporarily">Can I stop acting as an attorney or deputy temporarily?</h2>
<p>No, you cannot give up your role temporarily.</p>

<p>You do not have to step down just because you cannot visit the person at the moment.</p>

<p>If you’re an attorney, you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/disclaim-a-lasting-power-of-attorney" class="govuk-link">permanently step down</a> from (‘disclaim’) your role.</p>

<p>If you’re a deputy, you can apply to the court to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/become-deputy/end-your-deputyship" class="govuk-link">permanently end your deputyship</a>.</p>

<p>You should think carefully before doing this, as it may leave the person without the support they need.</p>

<h2 id="giving-money-to-family-or-friends">Giving money to family or friends</h2>
<p>As a property and financial affairs deputy or attorney there are rules you must follow about using the person’s money.</p>

<h3 id="using-the-persons-money-to-give-gifts">Using the person’s money to give gifts</h3>
<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/giving-gifts-a-guide-for-deputies-and-attorneys/opg2-giving-gifts-for-someone-else-web-version" class="govuk-link">guidance on gifts</a>. It explains who you can give gifts to and when. It also gives guidance on how much of the person’s money you can spend on gifts.</p>

<p>Remember that loans can count as a gift.</p>

<p>If you want to give a gift that does not fit with the guidance, you must apply to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/courts-tribunals/court-of-protection" class="govuk-link">Court of Protection</a> for permission.</p>

<h3 id="family-care-payments">Family care payments</h3>
<p>If you’re a deputy and want to use the person’s money to pay family or friends for providing care, you may need to apply to the Court of Protection for permission.</p>
