<p>If you are staying more than 3 months, you must apply to your nearest police department for residency.</p>

<p>You will need to provide documentation proving that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have a work contract or are self-employed in Bulgaria, or that you can support yourself through independent means</li>
  <li>you hold personal health insurance or a UK social security form, such as an S1 form</li>
  <li>you are enrolled in an educational programme</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are an immediate family member joining an EU citizen who fulfils one of the above criteria. If you are an immediate family member joining an EU citizen , you will have to present documentary evidence that you are a family member or live together with the EU citizen (for example a marriage certificate or a birth certificate)</li>
</ul>

<p>You will also need to show your passport.</p>

<p>You must check with <a rel="external" href="https://mvr.bg/migration/en/index">Migration Directorate of the Ministry of Interior</a> or with your nearest police department what further documentation you may need to apply for residency.</p>

<p>Once you have been resident in Bulgaria for 5 years, you can apply to Migration Directorate for a permanent residency certificate.</p>

<p>See the <a rel="external" href="https://www.mvr.bg/migration/en">Ministry of Interior’s Migration Directorate website</a> for how to get long-term and permanent residence permits or contact your <a rel="external" href="https://www.mvr.bg/migration">local migration office</a> or call +359 (2) 982 4808, email: <a href="mailto:migration.mvr.bg">migration@mvr.bg</a>.</p>

<h3 id="residency-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Residency after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK and EU have agreed the full legal text of the draft Withdrawal Agreement in principle. The agreement on citizens’ rights will allow UK nationals to stay in their Member State of residence after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>There will be no change to the rights and status of UK nationals living in Bulgaria while the UK remains in the EU.</p>

<p>In a deal scenario and in the event of changes to residency rules or registration processes after the UK leaves the EU, we will update this page as soon as information is available.</p>

<p>In a no deal scenario, the <a rel="external" href="https://www.mvr.bg/en/about-the-ministry/brexit/information-about-brexit">Bulgarian Ministry of Interior have published guidance</a> on residency and the proposed re-registration scheme for UK nationals lawfully residing in Bulgaria by exit date.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/bulgaria">travel advice for Bulgaria</a> and sign up for up-to-date information on local laws and customs, safety and emergencies.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for your British passport from Bulgaria</a>. If you cannot get a passport in time for your trip, you may need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/emergency-travel-document">get an emergency travel document</a> (sometimes called an ´emergency passport´).</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Passports and travel after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The rules for travel to most countries in Europe will change if the UK leaves the EU with no deal. You should <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport?utm_source=fco&utm_medium=referral">check your passport for travel to Europe</a>.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there will be new travel rules.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the European Commission has said <a rel="external" href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-6402_en.htm">you may not need visas for short stays</a> elsewhere in the Schengen area or the EU. You may be able to stay up to 90 days in any EU country, within a 180 day period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<h2 id="applying-for-bulgarian-citizenship">Applying for Bulgarian citizenship</h2>

<p>Once you have been a permanent resident in Bulgaria for 5 years, you can <a rel="external" href="https://newweb.mjs.bg/en/list-of-documents/#art_12">apply for Bulgarian citizenship</a>.</p>

<p>For your Bulgarian citizenship application, you may need <a href="https://www.gov.uk/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate">to order a birth, marriage or death certificate from the UK</a>. You may also need a <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">UK criminal records certificate</a> in the UK.</p>

<p>You may also be required to have these and other UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bulgaria-list-of-translators">documents officially translated</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">legalised</a> (apostilled).</p>

<h3 id="applying-for-bulgarian-citizenship-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Applying for Bulgarian citizenship after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>After EU Exit, UK nationals applying for Bulgarian citizenship will have to renounce their UK citizenship, in both a deal and no deal scenario.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>You can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/bulgaria">travel advice for Bulgaria</a>.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/Healthcareabroad/countryguide/Pages/healthcareinBulgaria.aspx">NHS</a> has more information about healthcare for UK nationals living in and visiting Bulgaria.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bulgaria-list-of-medical-facilities">English-speaking doctors in Bulgaria</a>.</p>

<p>You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check your prescriptions are legal</a> in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>If you are a long-term or permanent resident, you should register with the Bulgarian <a rel="external" href="http://www.en.nhif.bg/web/guest/welcome">National Health Insurance Fund</a> (NHIF) through your <a rel="external" href="http://www.en.nhif.bg/page/rhif-adress">regional office</a>.</p>

<p>If you live in Bulgaria and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate. To apply, call +44 (0)191 218 1999. When you get your form, register with your <a rel="external" href="http://www.en.nhif.bg/page/rhif-adress">Regional Health Insurance Fund office</a> before registering with a GP.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Bulgaria, you should not be using a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the UK to access healthcare in Bulgaria.</p>

<ul>
  <li>you may use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland</li>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/">NHS guidance on healthcare and studying abroad</a>.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Healthcare after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If you plan to visit Bulgaria after the UK leaves the EU, you should continue to buy travel insurance for the health treatment you may need, as you would for a non-EU country. If you have a UK-issued EHIC, it will still be valid until the day the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, your current rights on access to healthcare in Bulgaria will remain the same until 31 December 2020, as long as you remain a resident in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, your access to healthcare may change. If you are a permanent or temporary resident you should review the status of your healthcare cover.</p>

<p>The UK has proposed maintaining current healthcare cooperation with Bulgaria for S1 form holders until the end of December 2020. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, and there is no arrangement with Bulgaria to continue reciprocal healthcare, those receiving coverage through the S1 form will not be covered.</p>

<p>Your EHIC may not be valid in the event the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The UK has offered to maintain the EHIC scheme, however this is reliant on Bulgaria continuing to accept UK EHICs.</p>

<p>If you plan to stay in Bulgaria long-term, make sure to register with the Bulgarian authorities. Your residency status will make you eligible for access to Bulgarian national healthcare. UK nationals will be able to return to UK for treatment.</p>

<p>You should read the NHS guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/Healthcareabroad/countryguide/Pages/healthcareinBulgaria.aspx">healthcare for UK nationals in Bulgaria and how it may change after UK leaves the EU</a>.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-bulgaria">Working in Bulgaria</h2>
<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in another EU country</a>.</p>

<p>Some jobs may require a <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">UK criminal records check</a>, known as a DBS check.</p>

<p>You can get a Bulgarian criminal records certificate from the Judicial Records Register from any Bulgarian Regional Court (Районен съд) or from the Ministry of Justice. You can see details and download application forms at <a rel="external" href="http://www.justice.government.bg/44/">the Ministry of Justice website</a> (in Bulgarian language only).</p>

<h3 id="working-in-bulgaria-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Working in Bulgaria after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves with a deal, your right to work will not change until the end of implementation period.</p>

<p>If you’re planning to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession after the UK leaves the EU, you should read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/bulgaria-providing-services-after-eu-exit">our further guidance</a>.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>You can read our guidance on<a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-right-retire-abroad-return-to-uk">tax if you leave the UK to live abroad</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-uk-income-live-abroad/taxed-twice">tax on your UK income if you live abroad</a>.</p>

<p>The UK has a double-taxation agreement with Bulgaria to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

<p>You can read our guidance about <a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/taxes/income-taxes-abroad/bulgaria/index_en.htm">paying income tax in Bulgaria</a>.</p>

<p>In Bulgaria, you should expect to pay personal income tax and home owners’ tax. Additional taxes exist, including a vehicle tax and a fee for rubbish collection. See <a rel="external" href="http://www.nap.bg/en/page?id=1">National Revenue Agency</a>.</p>

<p>You may be able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">pay National Insurance while abroad</a> in order to protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<p>We recommend you get professional advice on paying tax in Bulgaria.</p>

<h3 id="money-and-tax-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Money and tax after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK’s exit from the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Bulgaria. You should direct individual taxpayer questions about double taxation relief to the relevant tax authority.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it may become more expensive to use your bank card, or other financial service from a UK-based firm in the EU. Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal-information-for-people-living-in-the-eea">using a bank card, insurance or other financial service in the EU.</a></p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>
<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are moving or retiring abroad. See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad">State Pension if you retire abroad</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension">new State Pension</a>.</p>

<p>If you have not worked in Bulgaria, you should claim your UK State Pension by contacting the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/international-pension-centre">International Pension Centre</a>.</p>

<p>If you have worked in several EU countries, see <a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/retire-abroad/state-pensions-abroad/index_en.htm">State Pensions abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you get a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances">‘life certificate’ from the UK Pension Service</a> you need to respond as soon as possible. Your payments may be suspended if you do not.</p>

<h3 id="pensions-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Pensions after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay state pension, child benefits, and disability benefits to eligible UK nationals in the EU after the UK’s exit from the EU. Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on benefits and pensions in a no deal scenario</a>.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Bulgaria, you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Bulgarian pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>You may still be able to claim some UK benefits like child and disability benefits if you live in Bulgaria. Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">claiming benefits if you live, move or travel abroad</a>. Find out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-benefits-abroad">which UK benefits you might be able to get while you’re abroad</a> and how to claim them.</p>

<p>If you are abroad for more than 4 weeks, many income-related benefits such as Pension Credit and Housing Benefit cannot be paid.</p>

<p>You may be eligible to <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1103&langId=en">claim some Bulgarian social security benefits</a>. You can get information about local Bulgarian benefits and pensions from the <a rel="external" href="http://www.nssi.bg/en/faqs">National Social Security Institute</a>.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Benefits after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay child benefits, and disability benefits to eligible people living in the EU after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Bulgaria, your UK social security contributions will be taken into account when applying for Bulgaria contributions-based benefits. This will happen even if you claim contributions-based benefits after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on benefits and pensions in a no deal scenario</a>.</p>
