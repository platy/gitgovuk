<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you are staying more than 3 months, you must apply to your nearest police department for residency.</p>

<p>You will need to provide documentation proving that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have a work contract or are self-employed in Bulgaria, or that you can support yourself through independent means</li>
  <li>you hold personal health insurance or a UK social security form, such as an S1 form</li>
  <li>you are enrolled in an educational programme</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are an immediate family member joining an EU citizen who fulfils one of the above criteria. If you are an immediate family member joining an EU citizen, you will have to present documentary evidence that you are a family member or live together with the EU citizen (for example a marriage certificate or a birth certificate)</li>
</ul>

<p>You will also need to show your passport.</p>

<p>You must check with <a rel="external" href="https://mvr.bg/migration/en/index">Migration Directorate of the Ministry of Interior</a> or with your nearest police department what further documentation you may need to apply for residency.</p>

<p>Once you have been resident in Bulgaria for 5 years, you can apply to Migration Directorate for a permanent residency certificate.</p>

<p>See the <a rel="external" href="https://www.mvr.bg/migration/en">Ministry of Interior’s Migration Directorate website</a> for how to get long-term and permanent residence permits or contact your <a rel="external" href="https://www.mvr.bg/migration">local migration office</a> or call +359 (2) 982 4808, email: <a href="mailto:migration.mvr.bg">migration@mvr.bg</a>.</p>

<h3 id="residency-after-brexit">Residency after Brexit</h3>

<p>There will be no change to the rights and status of UK nationals living in Bulgaria while the UK remains in the EU.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal and in the event of changes to residency rules or registration processes after Brexit, we will update this page as soon as information is available.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the <a rel="external" href="https://www.mvr.bg/en/about-the-ministry/brexit/information-about-brexit">Bulgarian Ministry of Interior have published guidance</a> on residency and the proposed re-registration scheme for UK nationals lawfully residing in Bulgaria by exit date.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/bulgaria">travel advice for Bulgaria</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/bulgaria/email-signup">sign up for up-to-date information</a> on local laws and customs, safety and emergencies.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for your British passport from Bulgaria</a>.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-brexit">Passports and travel after Brexit</h3>

<p>If there is a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. During this time you can continue to travel freely in the EU with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, new travel rules will apply. You should have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>You should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-for-travel-to-europe">check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">renew</a> your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/">UK nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the EU</a>. You will be able to stay up to 90 days in another EU, EEA or EFTA country, within a 180 day period. You should retain evidence of travel (e.g. train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an EU, EEA or EFTA country, you will be able to transit through other EU, EEA or EFTA countries to reach your country of residence. The <a rel="external" href="https://www.mvr.bg/en/about-the-ministry/brexit/information-about-brexit">Bulgarian Ministry of Interior have published guidance</a> on travelling to Bulgaria after Brexit - your passport should be valid for at least 3 months after the date of your departure. We will update this guidance as more information becomes available.</p>

<h2 id="applying-for-bulgarian-citizenship">Applying for Bulgarian citizenship</h2>

<p>Once you have been a permanent resident in Bulgaria for 5 years, you can <a rel="external" href="https://newweb.mjs.bg/en/list-of-documents/#art_12">apply for Bulgarian citizenship</a>.</p>

<p>For your Bulgarian citizenship application, you may need <a href="https://www.gov.uk/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate">to order a birth, marriage or death certificate from the UK</a>. You may also need a <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">UK criminal records certificate</a> in the UK.</p>

<p>You may also be required to have these and other UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bulgaria-list-of-translators">documents officially translated</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">legalised</a> (apostilled).</p>

<h3 id="applying-for-bulgarian-citizenship-after-brexit">Applying for Bulgarian citizenship after Brexit</h3>

<p>If you apply for Bulgarian citizenship after Brexit, you will have to renounce your UK citizenship.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/bulgaria">travel advice for Bulgaria</a>.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/Healthcareabroad/countryguide/Pages/healthcareinBulgaria.aspx">NHS</a> has more information about healthcare for UK nationals living in and visiting Bulgaria.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bulgaria-list-of-medical-facilities">English-speaking doctors in Bulgaria</a>.</p>

<p>You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check your prescriptions are legal</a> in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>If you live in Bulgaria and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate. To apply, call +44 (0)191 218 1999. When you get your form, register with your <a rel="external" href="http://www.en.nhif.bg/page/rhif-adress">Regional Health Insurance Fund office</a> before registering with a GP.</p>

<p>When you travel from Bulgaria for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland, you can use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">read our travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#brexit-update">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are a student, read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/">NHS guidance on healthcare and studying abroad</a>.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-brexit">Healthcare after Brexit</h3>

<p>If you plan to visit Bulgaria after Brexit, you should continue to buy travel insurance as you would for a non-EU country. If you have a UK-issued EHIC, it will still be valid until the day the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If there is a deal, your current rights to access healthcare in Bulgaria will remain the same until the end of the implementation period, as long as you remain a resident in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, your access to healthcare may change. If you are a permanent or temporary resident you should review the status of your healthcare cover.</p>

<p>Your residency status will determine your eligibility for access to Bulgarian national healthcare. If you are a permanent resident, register with the Bulgarian <a rel="external" href="http://www.en.nhif.bg/page/welcome">National Health Insurance Fund</a> (NHIF) through your <a rel="external" href="http://www.en.nhif.bg/page/rhif-adress">regional office</a>. If you are a long-term resident, you must arrange private healthcare cover.</p>

<p>The UK has proposed maintaining current healthcare cooperation with Bulgaria for S1 form holders until the end of December 2020. If there’s no deal, and there is no arrangement with Bulgaria to continue reciprocal healthcare, those receiving coverage through the S1 form will not be covered.</p>

<p>Your EHIC may not be valid in the event there’s no deal. The UK has offered to maintain the EHIC scheme, however this is reliant on Bulgaria continuing to accept UK EHICs.</p>

<p>UK nationals will be able to return to the UK for treatment.</p>

<p>Read the NHS guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-bulgaria/">healthcare for UK nationals in Bulgaria and how it may change after UK leaves the EU</a>.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-bulgaria">Working in Bulgaria</h2>
<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in another EU country</a>.</p>

<p>Some jobs may require a <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">UK criminal records check</a>, known as a DBS check.</p>

<p>You can get a Bulgarian criminal records certificate from the Judicial Records Register from any Bulgarian Regional Court (Районен съд) or from the Ministry of Justice. You can see details and download application forms at <a rel="external" href="http://www.justice.government.bg/44/">the Ministry of Justice website</a> (in Bulgarian language only).</p>

<h3 id="working-in-bulgaria-after-brexit">Working in Bulgaria after Brexit</h3>

<p>If there is a deal, your right to work will not change until the end of implementation period.</p>

<p>If you’re planning to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession after Brexit, you should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/bulgaria-providing-services-after-eu-exit">read our further guidance</a>.</p>

<h2 id="education-and-professional-qualifications">Education and professional qualifications</h2>

<p>For information on education, read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/studying-in-the-european-union-after-brexit">studying in the European Union after Brexit</a>.</p>

<p>The European Commission has published <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/slides_professional-qualifications-ip-justice-consumers_en.pdf">guidance on professional qualifications</a>. If you have already been recognised by an EU country as holding valid professional qualifications, this will remain valid after Brexit. If you hold qualifications gained in the UK before Brexit, you should obtain recognition in a EU27 Member State before Brexit day.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>You can read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-right-retire-abroad-return-to-uk">tax if you leave the UK to live abroad</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-uk-income-live-abroad/taxed-twice">tax on your UK income if you live abroad</a>.</p>

<p>The UK has a double-taxation agreement with Bulgaria to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

<p>You can read our guidance about <a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/taxes/income-taxes-abroad/bulgaria/index_en.htm">paying income tax in Bulgaria</a>.</p>

<p>In Bulgaria, you should expect to pay personal income tax and home owners’ tax. Additional taxes exist, including a vehicle tax and a fee for rubbish collection. See <a rel="external" href="http://www.nap.bg/en/page?id=1">National Revenue Agency</a>.</p>

<p>You may be able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">pay National Insurance while abroad</a> in order to protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<p>We recommend you get professional advice on paying tax in Bulgaria.</p>

<h3 id="money-and-tax-after-brexit">Money and tax after Brexit</h3>

<p>Brexit will not change existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Bulgaria. You should send your taxpayer questions about double taxation relief to the relevant tax authority.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, it may become more expensive to use your bank card, or other financial service from a UK-based firm in the EU. Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal-information-for-people-living-in-the-eea">using a bank card, insurance or other financial services in the EU</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>
<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are moving or retiring abroad.
