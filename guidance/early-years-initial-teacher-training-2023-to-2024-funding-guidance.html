<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) allocate and fund early years initial teacher training (<abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr>) places each academic year. <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> leads to the award of Early Years Teacher Status (<abbr title="early tears teacher status">EYTS</abbr>).</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> provide training bursaries, training grants and employer incentives to attract high-quality graduates to become early years teachers.</p>

<p>This funding can only be used to offer training programmes that help trainees to meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-teachers-standards">teachers’ standards (early years)</a>. The training grant includes the costs of assessment to meet these standards.</p>

<p>Trainees and potential applicants should visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/explore-my-options/become-an-early-years-teacher" rel="external">Get Into Teaching</a> website and our list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-initial-teacher-training-itt-providers-and-school-direct-early-years-lead-organisations"><abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> training providers</a> for more information. Employers should visit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/early-years-initial-teacher-training-itt-a-guide-for-employers"><abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr>: a guide for employers</a>.</p>

<h2>Training routes</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> offer funding for 2 out of the 4 <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> training routes.</p>

<h3>Graduate entry route</h3>

<p>This is for graduates studying full-time. Training is typically over a 1 year period.</p>

<p><abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> providers will receive training grant funding of £7,000 to cover course fees.</p>

<p>Trainees with high academic achievement may be eligible to receive a training bursary. This will be paid to <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> providers to forward to trainees.</p>

<h3>Graduate employment based route</h3>

<p>This is for graduates typically working part-time over a 1 year period:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in paid employment</li>
  <li>in an early years setting</li>
  <li>
    <p>who need training and further experience to demonstrate the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-teachers-standards">teachers’ standards (early years)</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>who have the right to work in the UK for the duration of the training</li>
</ul>

<p>£14,000 is available for this route, made up of a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£7,000 training grant for providers</li>
  <li>£7,000 employer incentive for the trainee’s employer</li>
</ul>

<h3>Undergraduate entry</h3>

<p>Funding is not available from <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> for this route. Trainees should contact <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-student-finance-england">Student Finance England</a> to see if they can receive a tuition fee or maintenance loan.</p>

<p>This route is for undergraduates who want to take a level 6 degree in an early childhood-related subject along with <abbr title="early tears teacher status">EYTS</abbr>.</p>

<p>This route is full-time and takes 3 or 4 years.</p>

<h3>Assessment only</h3>

<p>Funding is not available from <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> for this route. This is a self-funded route for graduates who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are very experienced at working with children from birth to 5 years old</li>
  <li>can demonstrate the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-teachers-standards">teachers’ standards (early years)</a> without any further training</li>
</ul>

<p>This could be an early years teacher who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>practiced overseas</li>
  <li>understands the early years foundation stage</li>
</ul>

<h2>Training bursaries</h2>

<p>Training bursaries are only available to trainees registered on the graduate entry route. Providers should use the trainee’s highest qualification to determine how much they will get, for example:</p>

<p>Tier 1, £5,000: first-class honours degree, doctoral degree</p>

<p>Tier 2, £4,000: 2.1 honours degree, master’s degree</p>

<p>Tier 3, £2,000: 2.2 honours degree</p>

<p>No bursary: third-class honours degree, third honours degree, ordinary degree, aegrotat, no first degree</p>

<p>Trainees who do not hold a degree are not eligible for a bursary.</p>

<p>If a trainee is ineligible for a bursary award but feels that there are extenuating circumstances which impacted their final result, this must be raised with the awarding body of the qualification. Providers must not apply any discretion in these cases.</p>

<p>If the outcome of a qualification, for example a masters or doctoral degree, is not yet known, bursary eligibility must be determined by the highest relevant academic award on the date the training course started. If the trainee is subsequently awarded a higher qualification, their bursary eligibility may be reassessed provided the award of this qualification was made on or before the date the course started.</p>

<p>Please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:eyitt.GENERALENQUIRIES@education.gov.uk">eyitt.GENERALENQUIRIES@education.gov.uk</a> for further guidance in these circumstances.</p>

<h3>Qualifications record keeping</h3>

<p>Providers must keep accurate records of trainees’ qualifications and how they obtained them, especially for overseas qualifications.</p>

<p>Providers should record:</p>

<ul>
  <li>names of all trainees granted a bursary</li>
  <li>details of how you assessed the trainees’ qualifications</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> may ask to see these records at any time. Providers should keep copies of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>original trainee documentation or qualification certificates</li>
  <li>correspondence between them and trainees</li>
  <li>other documentation relating to the decision process</li>
</ul>

<h3>Eligibility</h3>

<p>To receive a training bursary, trainees must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/early-years-initial-teacher-training-a-guide-for-providers#recruiting-trainees">entry requirements</a>
</li>
  <li>take a qualifying postgraduate Graduate Entry course</li>
  <li>hold a UK first degree with at least second-class honours (or equivalent)</li>
  <li>not already hold <abbr title="early tears teacher status">EYTS</abbr> or Early Years Professional Status (<abbr title="Early Years Professional Status">EYPS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>not do any type of paid-teaching work which contributes to their training whilst undertaking a Graduate Entry course, for which the provider received early years funding</li>
  <li>not be registered on another <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> course</li>
</ul>

<p>Providers must also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>notify trainees in writing that they are eligible</li>
  <li>ensure that trainees continue to meet the criteria throughout the course</li>
</ul>

<h2>Training bursary payments</h2>

<p>Providers should pay bursaries in 10 monthly instalments. This table shows providers how to calculate trainees’ monthly bursary instalments.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Bursary award</th>
      <th scope="col">Monthly instalment</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>£5,000</td>
      <td>£500</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>£4,000</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>£2,000</td>
      <td>£200</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Payment eligibility</h3>

<p>Trainees will be entitled to receive the first bursary payment if they are actively engaged on the <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> programme on the first day of the month following their start date.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong>
 A trainee commencing their course in September 2023 will be entitled to their first payment if they are on the programme on 1 October. They will be entitled to the second payment if they are on the programme on 1 November respectively. This is regardless of the provider’s individual payment date.</p>
</div>

<h3>Payments for part-time or modular courses</h3>

<p>Trainees on part-time or modular courses may agree a flexible monthly payment plan, which covers the duration of the part-time programme to avoid financial hardship for the trainee. However, providers must make sure that the bursary payments reflect the proportion of the course that the trainee has completed at any point.</p>

<p>As part-time courses will span more than one academic year, providers may award the bursary beyond the academic year 2023 to 2024. Providers are reminded that any bursary payments made after 31 July of the academic year will be included as expenditure for the following academic year, for example 2024 to 2025.</p>

<h2>Training grant</h2>

<p>Providers must use the training grant funding to meet all training costs for each trainee.</p>

<p>Providers must not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>charge any additional fees</li>
  <li>switch allocated funding to other trainees</li>
</ul>

<h3>Full-time equivalence (<abbr title="full-time equivalence">FTE</abbr>)</h3>

<p>We calculate funding using the <abbr title="full-time equivalence">FTE</abbr> principle:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">FTE equivalence</th>
      <th scope="col">Trainee status</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0.5 or less</td>
      <td>part-time</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0.6 or more</td>
      <td>full-time</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Employer incentive</h3>

<p>The employer incentive is forwarded to the trainee’s employer. It is a contribution towards costs that employers incur, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>supply cover</li>
  <li>salary enhancements</li>
  <li>employment costs</li>
  <li>National Insurance</li>
  <li>additional training costs and other overheads</li>
</ul>

<p>Providers cannot use the employer incentive for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sick pay</li>
  <li>maternity or paternity pay</li>
  <li>costs not related to training such as buying equipment or internal training</li>
  <li>costs that have occurred outside of the training period</li>
</ul>

<p>If there any claims for Employer Incentive which are not covered by the above, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:eyitt.GENERALENQUIRIES@education.gov.uk">eyitt.GENERALENQUIRIES@education.gov.uk</a> for further advice.</p>

<h3>Types of company</h3>

<p>The trainee must be an employee of the early years business. Sole traders and business partners are not eligible for an employer incentive as they are classed as self-employed by HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>).</p>

<p>If the early years business is a limited company, the owners and those working for the company are not classed as self-employed and can be eligible for an employer incentive.</p>

<h2>Withdrawals and deferrals</h2>

<p>If a trainee withdraws or defers, Providers must stop any further payments and update their records immediately in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.register-trainee-teachers.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">Register.</a></p>

<p>Providers can keep some funding if a trainee withdraws or defers. The amount retained should be proportional to how long the trainee attended the course before leaving.</p>

<p>Graduate employment based <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> providers can keep 1/12th of the total training grant and employer incentive funding for each month or part month the trainee remained in training.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>(Graduate employment based)</p>

<p>If a full- time trainee is employed from September 2023 and leaves in March 2024, you can retain 7/12ths of the Training Grant and Employer Incentive funding.</p>
</div>

<p>Graduate Entry trainees who withdraw or defer from a course will be entitled to be paid the training bursary for each month up to, and including, the month in which they formally withdraw. <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> providers can also retain 1/10th of the total training grant for each month or part month the trainee remained in training.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>(Graduate entry)</p>

<p>If a full-time trainee starts in September 2023 and withdraws or defers in January 2024, they will be entitled to 4 payments in total as they were active on the course on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 October 2023</li>
  <li>1 November 2023</li>
  <li>1 December 2023</li>
  <li>1 January 2024</li>
</ul>

<p>Providers can also retain 4/10ths of the Training Grant funding.</p>
</div>

<p>In the event that a Graduate Entry trainee is absent through sickness, providers may only make one further bursary payment following the first day of absence. Providers may also retain an additional 1/10th of the Training Grant.</p>

<p>For Graduate Employment Based trainees, providers may retain an additional 1/12th of the Training Grant and Employer Incentive in this instance.</p>

<p>After this, the absence should be treated as a period of deferral and payments must stop with immediate effect.</p>

<h3>Overpayments</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will recover any overpayments if a trainee withdraws or defers and will not reimburse providers for any payments they make in error. Any overpayments made to trainees or employers will then be an internal matter between providers and the trainee or employer.</p>

<h2>Returning trainees</h2>

<p>Returning trainees who defer and then rejoin their original course, or take any advanced standing or credit to a new <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> course, will only be eligible to receive the remaining <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> funding (training grant or bursary) up to the value which was available in the year they started their original course. A bespoke payment schedule may be agreed for the remaining amount between providers and the trainee.</p>

<p>Where the length of the course is increased, the bursary and training grant instalments can be amended to reflect the longer timeframe. The total amounts, however, are fixed and cannot be increased.</p>

<p>If a trainee leaves one <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> course and joins a new one with no transfer of standing or credit from their previous course, this is viewed as a separate route to <abbr title="early tears teacher status">EYTS</abbr>. They will be entitled to receive a new bursary and training grant, subject to the eligibility criteria and rates set in this guidance.</p>

<p>If the trainee received their full bursary or training grant entitlement during a previous <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> programme, this may impact their eligibility to receive further <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> funding while completing a new programme.</p>

<p>Please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:eyitt.GENERALENQUIRIES@education.gov.uk">eyitt.GENERALENQUIRIES@education.gov.uk</a> for further advice.</p>

<h2>International students</h2>

<p>International students can be offered funded <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> places as long as the applicant meets:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all the academic entry criteria for the <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> course</li>
  <li>the relevant immigration permissions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Academic entry criteria</h3>

<p>These criteria are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They have achieved a standard equivalent to a grade C or 4 in the GCSE examinations in English, Mathematics and a science subject.</li>
  <li>They have achieved a first degree of a UK higher education institution or equivalent qualification.</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>A first degree comprises 300 higher education (HE) credit points of which 60 must be at level 6 of the Qualifications and Credit Framework (QCF). Applicants with a foundation degree will need to supplement this qualification with at least 60 credits at level 6 (HE level 3) in order to attain an equivalent single qualification.</p>
</div>

<p>International students can be awarded <abbr title="early tears teacher status">EYTS</abbr> in the usual way on completion.</p>

<h3>Immigration permissions</h3>

<p>Every international <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> student must have the right to study or work in the UK and must hold the relevant visa before they start their <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> course. This is in line with the standard process for all international students undertaking any course in an English university.</p>

<p><abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> providers can find support on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/recruit-trainee-teachers-from-overseas-accredited-itt-providers">recruiting international students and the requirements needed</a>. Please note that the further support section at the bottom of this guidance is not applicable to <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr>.</p>

<p>Potential international students can check visa eligibility at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa">Check if you need a UK visa</a>.</p>

<h2>How providers will receive their funding</h2>

<p>Providers will be sent a remittance advice from <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> when they have been paid, and providers can use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.register-trainee-teachers.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">Register</a> to review their payment profile.</p>

<p>Providers will be paid in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>11 monthly BACS instalments from September to July</li>
  <li>on the 3rd working day of the month</li>
</ul>

<p>Providers will be paid different amounts until <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> have collected all their data, as set out in this table.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Month</th>
      <th scope="col">Rate</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>September to November 2023</td>

      <td>Actual rate based upon the trainee data providers submit to <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>
</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will recover any overpayments by sending providers an invoice or deducting any future payments.</p>

<h2>Data management</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Grant funding agreement terms and conditions are included in the grant offer letter that DfE send to providers.</p>
</div>

<p>Providers must share data about trainee applications, recruitment and employment outcomes with us if <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> request it.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> may contact providers or visit their premises if we need to clarify any potential discrepancies, especially in relation to unclassified degrees.</p>

<h3>Trainee data</h3>

<p>Providers submit their <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> trainee data via <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.register-trainee-teachers.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">Register</a>.</p>

<p>This is a condition of providers funding. <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will use this data to calculate how much funding providers will get.</p>

<p>Providers must register all trainees with <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> by October 2023 and complete a validation declaration.</p>

<p>Providers must also submit the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>names of all their <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> trainees</li>
  <li>training courses they provide</li>
  <li>outcomes of the training</li>
</ul>

<p>Providers must update records in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.register-trainee-teachers.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">Register</a> if a trainee:</p>

<ul>
  <li>withdraws</li>
  <li>changes their status</li>
  <li>defers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Financial monitoring</h3>

<p>Providers must only use their funding as set out in this guidance.</p>

<p>If providers do not comply with the terms and conditions, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> may withdraw Provider’s accreditation and funding.</p>

<p>Providers must hold full records of all payments made to employers of trainees who get the employer incentive. This information can be audited by <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> at anytime.</p>

<h2>Assurance</h2>

<p>Providers will be asked to complete an Annex G in accordance with published guidance, containing income, expenditure and trainee data. This must be independently audited and countersigned by the Accounting Officer.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will contact providers with further details of the Annex G process after the academic year 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will use the Annex G to reconcile providers’ funding with their declared expenditure.</p>

<p>This also takes in to account the effect of trainees who have withdrawn or deferred so that <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> can recover any funding providers did not spend.</p>

<h3>Non-compliance</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> may withdraw accreditation if providers do not fully comply with funding guidance. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>data collection</li>
  <li>monitoring and assurance requirements</li>
</ul>

<h2>Early years <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> funding cycle</h2>

<p>Key dates in the bursary funding cycle.</p>

<h4>June to July 2023</h4>

<p><abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> providers in their first year of delivery will be contacted in order to submit grant funding agreements (GFAs) to <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>. If other documents, such as letters of variation are required, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will contact individual <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> providers separately.</p>

<h4>August 2023</h4>

<p>A proportion of a Provider’s allocation is incorporated into the funding model, based upon overall recruitment. This allows <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> to make interim payments to providers from September to November 2023.</p>

<h4>September to November 2023</h4>

<p>The first 3 payments will be made if providers have a <abbr title="grant funding agreement">GFA</abbr> in place. Payment profiles are available in Register during this period.</p>

<h4>November 2023</h4>

<p>Provider’s Register data is incorporated into the funding model to confirm payments from December 2023.</p>

<p>This is based on providers trainee registration returns, submitted through Register, along the Graduate Entry and Graduate Employment Based routes on or before the census closure date.</p>

<h4>December 2023 to January 2024</h4>

<p>These payments will be made if providers have a <abbr title="grant funding agreement">GFA</abbr> in place, based on their Register data.</p>

<p>Register is available for providers to see funding summaries and payment profiles.</p>

<h4>February to April 2024</h4>

<p>Provider’s Register data will be updated in the funding model in February 2024 to include any changes that they have submitted through Register since the census was published.</p>

<p>These payments will be made (if providers have a <abbr title="grant funding agreement">GFA</abbr> in place) based on their Register data. Any subsequent changes to Provider’s Register data will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>Register is available for providers to see their funding summaries and payment profiles.</p>

<h4>May to July 2024</h4>

<p>Provider’s Register data will be updated in the funding model in May 2024 to include any changes that they have submitted through Register in April 2024.</p>

<p>These payments will be made (if providers have a <abbr title="grant funding agreement">GFA</abbr> in place) based on their Register data. Any subsequent changes to providers’ Register data will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>Register is available for providers to see their funding summaries and payment profiles.</p>

<h2>Assurance and audit cycle</h2>

<p>Key events in the bursary funding cycle</p>

<h4>June to July 2024</h4>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will send indicative Annex G documents to providers in July 2024.</p>

<p>These should be returned by 31 July 2024.</p>

<h4>September to December 2024</h4>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will send final Annex G documents to providers at the end of the academic year. <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will pre-populate this with the amount of funding providers have received, and the trainees that funding relates to.</p>

<p>The completed document, and Auditor’s report, will help providers to provide <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> with the necessary assurance for both the amount received and the purpose for which it was used. Further guidance on this process will be sent to providers at the same time.</p>

<p>These should be returned by 31 December 2024.</p>

<h4>January to March 2025</h4>

<p>In addition to the audited document and Auditor report, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> also apply a risk-based sampling strategy to gain assurance of the Early Years <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> funding expenditure. This involves assurance checks through the collection of evidence on sampled trainees, including withdrawals, course information, degree class and payment information.</p>

<p>Recoveries and reimbursements will be completed through the payment profile, invoice or credit memo.</p>
