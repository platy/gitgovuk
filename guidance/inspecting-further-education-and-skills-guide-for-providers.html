</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are publicly funded to provide post-16 education and/or training, you will normally be subject to Ofsted inspection.</p>

<p>Inspection may take the form of a monitoring visit or a full or short inspection.</p>

<p>Inspection involves inspectors gathering evidence from the provider to arrive at judgements using the evaluation criteria set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-education-and-skills-inspection-handbook-eif">further education and skills inspection handbook</a>. They will gather that evidence through observing teaching and training, through speaking to managers, teachers, trainers and learners, and through analysing provider documents, data and information.</p>

<h2>Conduct during Ofsted inspections</h2>

<p>Ofsted’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/conduct-during-ofsted-inspections">code of conduct</a> sets out the expectations for both inspectors and providers. At the start of the inspection or monitoring visit (usually during the planning call), the lead inspector will explain these expectations and will ask providers to read the code.</p>

<h2>Notice of an inspection</h2>

<p>We will normally notify providers up to 2 working days before an inspection, unless the inspection is unannounced. However, we will notify the inspection of further education colleges, sixth-form colleges and designated institutions up to 5 or 6 days before an inspection.</p>

<p>We will notify the provider on the morning of the notification day and will email the notification letter. The lead inspector will then contact the provider as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Before the inspection visit</h3>

<p>We will send a short pre-inspection briefing letter that tells providers what to expect during the inspection and setting out the plan for the inspection. The lead inspector will set up a telephone planning meeting to arrange how any further information required will be made available to inspectors. These should be working documents and not prepared specifically for the inspection.</p>

<p>Providers should nominate a senior member of staff to act as a link between staff and the inspectors.</p>

<p>The nominee should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand the provider’s programmes and operations</li>
  <li>ensure the cooperation of staff at all levels</li>
  <li>have authority to carry out the role with autonomy</li>
</ul>

<p>The nominee will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide information for the lead inspector to support inspection planning</li>
  <li>brief the provider’s staff about arrangements</li>
  <li>inform learners and employers about the inspection</li>
  <li>attend team meetings, including the final team meeting</li>
  <li>coordinate feedback arrangements during and at the end of the inspection</li>
  <li>act as a link with the lead inspector and ensure that documents are available and that staff can attend meetings</li>
</ul>

<h3>During the inspection visit</h3>

<p>A full inspection will normally last between 2 and 5 days on site. Short inspections will normally last no longer than 2 days on site and monitoring visits will usually last between 1 and 2 days.</p>

<p>The number of inspectors involved in the inspection will vary according to the size and complexity of the provider.</p>

<p>Inspectors will spend time collecting evidence both on and off site.</p>

<p>Evidence-gathering methods include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>observing teaching, training and assessment in practice</li>
  <li>speaking to trainers, teachers and learners about the education and training provided</li>
  <li>scrutinising learners’ work</li>
  <li>having discussions with learners</li>
  <li>analysing provider and learner records showing planning for, and monitoring of, learners’ individual progress</li>
  <li>meeting with learners, employers, staff, governors, councillors, trustees and the provider’s partners, if appropriate (and in particular in the case of colleges, meeting with skills stakeholders)</li>
  <li>using learner, employer and other surveys</li>
</ul>

<h3>At the time of inspection</h3>

<p>Providers will share a link to an online survey to gather views from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>learners at the provider</li>
  <li>employers using the services of the provider</li>
  <li>parents and carers of learners</li>
  <li>staff at the provider</li>
</ul>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="#survey-questions">read the questions for each survey</a>.</p>

<p>For college inspections, there will also be an online survey for the college’s stakeholders.</p>

<p>There is more information about the main activities that our inspectors carry out when they inspect further education and skills providers in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-education-and-skills-inspection-handbook-eif">further education and skills inspection handbook</a>.</p>

<h2>After the inspection visit</h2>

<p>Following the inspection, the lead inspector will write a report outlining the findings of the inspection or monitoring visit. We will send providers this draft report and will give them the opportunity to comment on its factual accuracy. 
The draft report is confidential at this stage.</p>

<p>We normally <a class="govuk-link" href="http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/" rel="external">publish the report online</a> within 4 to 6 weeks of the end of the inspection.</p>

<p>After the inspection, we will invite providers to complete an online inspection survey. The survey asks for their views on the inspection process, including the impact that the inspection is likely to have in bringing about improvement.</p>

<h2>The grading scale for inspection judgements</h2>

<p>Inspectors use a 4-point grading scale to make judgements during inspections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>grade 1: outstanding</li>
  <li>grade 2: good</li>
  <li>grade 3: requires improvement</li>
  <li>grade 4: inadequate</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequency of inspection</h2>

<p>The information provided below is a brief guide to the frequency of inspection. For full details, including exceptions, please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-education-and-skills-inspection-handbook-eif/further-education-and-skills-handbook-for-september-2022#frequency-of-inspection">‘Frequency of inspection’ section in the further education and skills inspection handbook</a>.</p>

<h3>New providers</h3>

<p>New providers will normally have a monitoring visit within 18 months of being funded. They will then normally receive a full inspection within 18 months of the publication of the monitoring visit report.</p>

<h3>Newly merged colleges</h3>

<p>Newly merged colleges will normally receive a full inspection within 3 years of the merger. They may also receive a monitoring visit. They will normally receive a monitoring visit if we graded any of the predecessor colleges as requires improvement or inadequate at their last inspection. Newly merged colleges will not carry forward any inspection grades from predecessor colleges.</p>

<h3>Providers judged outstanding</h3>

<p>All providers judged outstanding for overall effectiveness at their most recent inspection are now subject to routine inspection and will be inspected by September 2025. Those judged to be outstanding at their previous inspection before September 2015 will normally receive a full inspection. We will prioritise these inspections. All outstanding further education colleges, sixth-form colleges, designated institutions and providers of apprenticeship training (of whatever type) will also receive a full inspection regardless of when they were last inspected. Any other type of outstanding provider that was last inspected after September 2015 will normally receive a short inspection.</p>

<h3>Providers judged good</h3>

<p>The inspection of a good provider will normally take place within 5 years of the publication of the previous inspection report (extended to 7 years where the suspension of routine inspections during the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on inspection activity) and certainly by September 2025. The inspection may be a full or a short inspection depending on the type of provider and/or if risks are identified.</p>

<p>A short inspection will be extended to become a full inspection if inspectors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do not have enough evidence that the provider remains good</li>
  <li>have concerns about effectiveness or safeguarding</li>
  <li>have not been able to gather sufficient evidence to arrive at an overall judgement</li>
  <li>have enough evidence of improved performance to strongly suggest that the provider may be outstanding</li>
</ul>

<h3>Providers judged as requires improvement</h3>

<p>A provider judged as requires improvement will normally have a full re-inspection within 12 to 30 months of the publication of its previous inspection report. We will make a monitoring visit to the provider to assess progress with improvements before the full re-inspection. We will publish the progress judgements and findings from these visits.</p>

<h3>Providers judged inadequate</h3>

<p>We will monitor providers judged as inadequate and re-inspect them within 15 months of publication of their last full inspection report, but only if the provider continues to be funded, and if it remains on the register of apprenticeships training providers if its main funding is for apprenticeships training.</p>

<p>The first monitoring inspection will usually take place within 6 months of the publication date of the provider’s most recent full inspection report, if the provider continues to be funded. A further visit may take place after the first monitoring visit and before the re-inspection.</p>

<h2>Monitoring visits</h2>

<p>A monitoring visit is an interim type of inspection to assess progress and risk and to encourage improvement.</p>

<p>On monitoring visits, inspectors arrive at progress judgements against themes.</p>

<p>These progress judgements are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>insufficient progress</li>
  <li>reasonable progress</li>
  <li>significant progress</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be no learner, employer, parent/carer or staff surveys for monitoring visits. Otherwise, monitoring visits are similar to other inspections and they result in a published report.</p>

<p>If you are a new and directly funded provider of education or training, you will normally receive a monitoring visit first, and normally within 18 months of starting to deliver.</p>

<p>The themes covered will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>leadership and management</li>
  <li>quality of training/education</li>
  <li>safeguarding</li>
</ul>

<p>Each theme will have a progress judgement made against it.</p>

<p>We also carry out monitoring visits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to newly merged colleges</li>
  <li>to providers judged to require improvement</li>
  <li>in certain circumstances, to providers judged to be inadequate</li>
  <li>if we have identified a significant cause for concern</li>
</ul>

<h2>Short inspections of further education and skills providers</h2>

<p>A short inspection will be carried out by one or more inspectors over 1 or 2 days, depending on the size and type of provider.</p>

<p>Inspectors will start a short inspection assuming that the provider remains at its current grade (either good or outstanding). They will test this during the inspection through their inspection activities and talking to leaders, managers and governors.</p>

<p>Inspectors will judge whether or not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the provider continues to provide the same quality of education/training for learners (either good or outstanding) as at their previous inspection</li>
  <li>safeguarding is effective</li>
  <li>careers education and guidance are of a good quality</li>
  <li>leaders, managers and governors have the capacity to make continued improvement and manage change well</li>
</ul>

<p>The report will record the 2 main judgements on quality of education or training and safeguarding and summarise the findings of the short inspection.</p>

<p>A short inspection report will not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make individual graded judgements</li>
  <li>change the provider’s overall effectiveness grade</li>
</ul>

<p>Then short inspection will be extended to a full inspection if inspectors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do not have enough evidence that the provider remains good</li>
  <li>have concerns about effectiveness or safeguarding</li>
  <li>have not been able to gather sufficient evidence to arrive at an overall judgement</li>
  <li>have enough evidence of improved performance to strongly suggest that the provider may be outstanding</li>
</ul>

<h3>Information you may need to share with inspectors</h3>

<p>We do not expect you to prepare anything extra for inspectors.</p>

<p>You should make the following documents available to inspectors, where relevant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lists of learners, their types of provision, subject areas and locations</li>
  <li>lesson, session and workshop timetable information</li>
  <li>staff details</li>
  <li>the current self-assessment report or equivalent and any evaluation of the impact of actions taken to date</li>
  <li>recent data on learners’ outcomes, performance and progress</li>
  <li>details of employers and subcontractors</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of the information is available before the inspection, you can upload it to the inspection portal. The notification of inspection letter includes instructions on using the portal.</p>

<h3>Seeking the views of learners, employers, parents, carers,  staff and stakeholders</h3>

<p>Providers should send survey links to learners, employers, staff and parents so that they can give their views when they are notified of an inspection. In the case of further education colleges, sixth-form colleges and designated institutions inspections, providers should also send survey links to skills stakeholders. This does not apply to monitoring visits.</p>

<p>The links to the surveys will be included in the provider’s inspection notification letter.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="#survey-questions">read the questions for each survey</a>.</p>

<p>There will be no learner, parent or carer, employer, stakeholder, or staff surveys for monitoring visits.</p>

<h2>Full inspections of further education and skills providers</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/education-inspection-framework">education inspection framework</a> sets out the principles that apply to inspection and the main judgements that inspectors make.</p>

<p>Under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/education-inspection-framework">education inspection framework</a>, inspectors will make judgements on the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the quality of education</li>
  <li>behaviour and attitudes</li>
  <li>personal development</li>
  <li>leadership and management</li>
</ul>

<p>They will also grade the following types of provision, when appropriate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>education programmes for young people</li>
  <li>adult learning programmes</li>
  <li>apprenticeships</li>
  <li>provision for learners with high needs</li>
</ul>

<p>These will contribute to the judgement about the overall effectiveness of the provider.</p>

<p>Inspectors will also make a judgement about the effectiveness of the arrangements for safeguarding learners.</p>

<p>In the case of inspections of further education colleges, sixth-form colleges and designated institutions, inspectors will also make a worded sub-judgement on the college’s contribution to meeting skills needs.</p>

<p>The quality of provision for learners with special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND) is also always considered on inspection.</p>

<h3>Information you may need to share with inspectors</h3>

<p>We do not expect you to prepare anything extra for inspectors.</p>

<p>You should make the following information available, where relevant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>details of the courses or programmes you are delivering and their mode of delivery</li>
  <li>timetables for lessons, sessions and workshops or other learning activities during the week</li>
  <li>a list of staff and a diagram of the organisational structure</li>
  <li>the geographical spread of training premises and learners, particularly work-based learners and apprentices, according to regions or sub-regions</li>
  <li>the names and location of employers</li>
  <li>the names and location of subcontractors</li>
  <li>contact information for key staff</li>
  <li>the current number of learners in the following age groups: 14 to 16; 16 to 18; 19+</li>
  <li>the current overall number of learners, excluding apprentices, at level 1 or below, level 2, level 3 and level 4/5, by subject area</li>
  <li>the current number of intermediate, advanced and higher-level apprentices, according to age groups: 16 to 18, 19 to 24, and 25+, by subject area and by apprenticeship framework or standard</li>
  <li>the current number of learners following employability programmes and those who have attended in the previous 12 months</li>
  <li>details of learners who are on a study programme but who are not working towards a substantial qualification</li>
  <li>the current number of learners following traineeships and those who have attended in the previous 12 months</li>
  <li>the current number of learners on community learning programmes and those who have attended in the previous 12 months</li>
  <li>the current number of learners with SEND and the number of learners that receive high-needs funding, and their particular needs</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of the information is available before the inspection, you can upload it onto the inspection portal. The notification of inspection letter includes instructions on using the portal.</p>

<h3>Seeking the views of learners, employers, parents, carers,  staff and stakeholders</h3>

<p>Providers should send survey links to learners, employers, staff and parents so they can give their views when they are notified of an inspection. In the case of colleges, providers should also send survey links to stakeholders. This does not apply to monitoring visits.</p>

<p>The links to the surveys will be included in the provider’s inspection notification letter.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="#survey-questions">read the questions for each survey</a>.</p>

<h2>Your views on the inspection</h2>

<p>After the inspection, we will ask for your views on the inspection process, including any impact that it may have in making improvements.</p>

<h3>Complaints about inspection</h3>

This explains how inspections and monitoring visits are carried out (in part 1) and how inspectors make judgements (in part 2). It also contains the criteria and grade descriptors inspectors use when making their judgements. There is a section on monitoring visits in part 1 and a section on short inspections at the end of part 1.</p>
