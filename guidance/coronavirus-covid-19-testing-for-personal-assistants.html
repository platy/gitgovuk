<h2>Who this applies to</h2>

<p>This guidance applies to anyone working in adult social care who is not part of regular testing at work.</p>

<p>You should continuously order enough boxes of rapid lateral flow tests (<abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr>) to test every day that you are working before you begin work. Alternatively, an employer can order test kits on your behalf.</p>

<h3>Summary of testing</h3>

<p>You should order boxes of  <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr>  to have enough to test every day that you are working, or an employer can order test kits on your behalf</p>

<ul>
  <li>tests will be delivered to your selected delivery address for  you to test daily</li>
  <li>you should take a test every day that you are working, before you start work, and report the results online. If you are a live with the person you provide care and support to, conduct daily <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> as close to the beginning of the day as possible and 24 hours apart. All results must be registered whether negative, positive, or void</li>
  <li>you can view your result within 30 minutes of conducting the test</li>
  <li>if you receive a positive <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> result, follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings">management of staff and exposed residents guidance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you have any queries with any of the steps please call the national COVID-19 contact centre on 119.</p>
</div>

<h3>Why testing is important</h3>

<p>Testing is important because it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifies whether you are likely to have COVID-19 so you can stay at home if positive</li>
  <li>reduces the risk of those receiving care contracting the virus from those who care for them</li>
  <li>prevents and controls the spread of the virus by identifying asymptomatic cases</li>
</ul>

<h3>Eligibility</h3>

<p>You’re eligible if you work in adult social care and are not part of regular testing at work, for example Shared Lives carers, personal assistants, and social workers.</p>

<p>If you believe you match these criteria, follow the guidance below on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-personal-assistants#ordering-test-kits">ordering test kits</a>. Please call 119 if you require any assistance.</p>

<h3>Summary of your involvement</h3>

<p>When accessing testing, your main responsibilities are to:</p>

  <li>conduct  daily <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> on the days you are working before you begin work or if you live with the person you provide care and support to, conduct daily <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> as close to the beginning of the day as possible and 24 hours apart</li>
  <li>register your test results as soon as you have completed them</li>
  <li>if you get a positive result, follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings">management of staff and exposed residents guidance</a>
