<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>NHS Test and Trace is making weekly COVID-19 testing available to personal assistants working in adult social care in England.</p>

<p>For testing purposes, a ‘personal assistant’ is someone who is directly employed by an individual (or self-employed) to provide care and support to enable them to live as independently as possible. This care could include support in the home, or to go out into the community.</p>

<p>Personal assistants will be eligible for testing if they provide care that requires them to come within 2 metres of an adult over the age of 18 who they support.</p>

<p>Personal assistants will be responsible for ordering test kits every 28 days – or an employer can order test kits for their personal assistant.</p>

<h2>Webinars</h2>

<p>For more information, you can join our live webinars. These will be hosted from the week beginning 15 February.</p>

<p>The live webinars will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>talk you through the end-to-end process for personal assistant testing</li>
  <li>include a live question and answer session with the personal assistant team, who will be happy to answer your questions</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://event.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1433378&amp;tp_key=cc65e8ae2d" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Sign up for the webinars</a></p>

<h2>Summary: testing for personal assistants</h2>

<h3>About the service</h3>

<p>The service involves weekly testing of all personal assistants working in adult social care.</p>

<p>Personal assistants should order tests every 28 days for themselves, or an employer can order them for their personal assistant.</p>

<p>Four tests are delivered for each personal assistant to their selected delivery address for a 28-day testing cycle.</p>

<p>Every 7 days a personal assistant should take a test, register it online, and return it by post.</p>

<p>Personal assistants will receive their results in 48 hours by email and text message (SMS).</p>

<h3>Why testing is important</h3>

<p>Testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>identifies homecare workers who currently have COVID-19 so they are able to self-isolate if positive</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>protects those receiving care from infection passed to them by homecare workers who are confirmed positive</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>prevents and controls the spread of the virus by identifying asymptomatic cases</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Eligibility</h3>

<p>You’re eligible as a personal assistant if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’re directly employed by an individual (or self-employed) to provide care and support to enable them to live as independently as possible</li>
  <li>the care you provide requires you to come within 2 metres of an adult over the age of 18 that you support</li>
</ul>

<p>If you believe you match these criteria, follow the guidance below on <a class="govuk-link" href="#ordering-test-kits">ordering test kits</a>, sign up for the webinars and call 119 for any assistance.</p>

<h4>If you’re not eligible right now</h4>

<p>We’re working hard to increase our testing capacity, develop new technologies and reach more people.</p>

<h3>Your involvement: personal assistants</h3>

<p>If you are a ‘personal assistant’ (for testing purposes, defined as someone who is directly employed by an individual (or self-employed) to provide care and support to enable them to live as independently as possible), your key responsibilities are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>register your tests as soon as you have completed them each week</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>return your test kits at a Royal Mail priority post box on the same day that you take the test one hour before the collection time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if you test positive: isolate, notify your employer and provide contacts to NHS Track and Trace – after testing positive, you do not need to test again for 90 days unless you become symptomatic</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>regardless of your result, continue following all infection prevention and control measures such as wearing personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>), washing your hands and socially distancing where possible, even if you or the people you care for have had the vaccine</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>End-to-end process: personal assistants</h2>

<h3>Ordering test kits</h3>

<p>Personal assistants or the individual employer are responsible for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">ordering test kits</a>.</p>

<p>Personal assistants or the individual employer must decide the address their test kits are delivered to. You may want to use a different address if you’re unlikely to be home when the delivery arrives (within 48 hours).</p>

<p>Personal assistants must order 4 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits within the same order. To do so, the ‘add another person’ section needs to be repeated 3 times so that 4 kits are ordered. This is vital as you cannot place another order of test kits for 14 days following an order.</p>

<p>Once you have placed an order, you will receive 4 confirmatory emails from the following email address: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk">organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>If you have any issues ordering test kits, please call 119.</p>

<h3>Delivery and preparation</h3>

<p>Please ensure someone is available to accept the delivery of test kits at your chosen delivery address. Test kits are typically delivered within 48 hours.</p>

<p>Before testing be sure to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read this guidance (‘Coronavirus (COVID-19) testing for personal assistants’)</li>
  <li>read guidance included with your test kit</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-taking-swab-samples/how-to-use-the-self-swabbing-kit-for-a-combined-throat-and-nose-swab-video" class="govuk-link">watch the instructional video for self-swabbing</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Using the test kits</h3>

<p>Personal assistants will conduct a combined throat and nose self-swab for the test.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-taking-swab-samples/how-to-use-the-self-swabbing-kit-for-a-combined-throat-and-nose-swab-video" class="govuk-link">Follow the instructional video on how to do a throat and nasal swab</a></p>

<p>Always leave 7 days between tests where possible.</p>

<p>If possible, please continue testing while on holiday (in the UK) or off work due to an illness not related to coronavirus.</p>

<p>After testing positive, you do not need to test again for 90 days unless you become symptomatic.</p>

<h3>Registering test kits</h3>

<p>Each week you should register your test after you have completed your test.</p>

<p>To register a test kit:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Go to <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://gov.uk/register-home-test">Register a home test kit</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter your order ID number – you will find this 10-digit order ID at the top of the confirmation email you received when your test kit was ordered</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter your name and date of birth</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter or scan your Royal Mail barcode (you will find the barcode on the right-hand side of the label)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter or scan the test kit barcode (please enter carefully and do not copy and paste). You will find barcodes inside the home test kit, either attached to the plastic vial, biohazard bag or return box. Please note these are different from your pre-paid Royal Mail return package barcode on your box</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select the date and time you’ll take your coronavirus test. If you’ve already taken the coronavirus test, tell us the date and time you took it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check your answers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Receive confirmation of registration via email</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If there are any problems with registering a test kit, please call 119.</p>

<h3>Returning test kits</h3>

<p>Each test kit contains a pink pre-paid return label. Please attach these to the delivery packaging next to the security seal. If there is no label in the kit please check in the box that the kits were delivered in. If additional support is needed, please call 119.</p>

<p>Only use a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.royalmail.com/priority-postboxes" rel="external">Royal Mail priority post box</a> to return your test kit. The post box will have a ‘priority box’ label on the front and one of the regional NHS logos. Please do not enter any Post Office with the kit.</p>

<p>To ensure samples reach the laboratories in time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>post the kit at least one hour before the last collection time to ensure that is not missed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.royalmail.com/services-near-you#/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">find your nearest priority post box and collection times</a> in advance of testing – tests should be posted on the day they are completed</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>Some post boxes do not collect post on Sundays, so check if there is a collection available before testing on a Sunday.</p>
</div>

<h3>Receiving results</h3>

<p>The person tested will receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an email</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a text message (if a mobile phone number was provided at registration)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The results will also include guidance on next steps for the person tested.</p>

<p>Personal assistants should inform their employer of a positive result immediately so that they can protect others that the care worker may have come into contact with at work.</p>

<h3>Weekly retesting</h3>

<p>After you have completed your first round of testing, you should continue to test on the same day each week. If you have tested positive, you do not need to retest for 90 days.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>day 1: conduct test on day of planned testing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>day 1: register test online</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>day 1: post completed test kit in priority post box</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>day 3 to 5: receive result</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>repeat testing process every 7 days</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you receive a positive test result, please stay or return home and inform your line manager.</p>

<h3>Support available</h3>

<h4>Operational support for personal assistants</h4>

<p>If a personal assistant tests positive or is instructed to isolate, their individual employer or somebody on their behalf should try to organise different arrangements. This is why contingency plans for the individual employers are so important (see guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-people-receiving-direct-payments/coronavirus-covid-19-qa-for-people-receiving-a-personal-budget-or-personal-health-budget#plan" class="govuk-link">developing a contingency plan</a>). For example, it may be that another <abbr title="personal assistant">PA</abbr> is willing and able to take on further work to provide the individual with the care and support they need.</p>

<p>In cases where arrangements cannot be put in place to provide the individual employers with the care and support they need, the <abbr title="personal assistant">PA</abbr> or somebody on their behalf should contact the local authority or clinical commissioning group immediately. They will support the individual employer in developing a temporary plan to ensure individuals’ needs are met, while you are self-isolating.</p>

<p><abbr title="personal assistants">PAs</abbr> are entitled to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/personal-protective-equipment-ppe-local-contacts-for-care-providers">claim free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> from their local authority or local resilience forum</a>.</p>

<h4>Financial support for personal assistants</h4>

<p>Directly employed personal assistants may also be entitled to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay" class="govuk-link">Statutory Sick Pay (<abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr>)</a> if they are self-isolating or are unwell. <abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr> is paid from the date they sell-isolate. You will need to speak to your individual employer.</p>

<p>If a personal assistant needs to self-isolate, they may be entitled to a £500 payment via their local authority whether they are employed or self-employed. Find out more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme-claiming-financial-support/claiming-financial-support-under-the-test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme" class="govuk-link">claiming financial support under the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme</a>.</p>

<p>Local authorities, at their discretion, may also meet the costs of self-isolation through the Infection Control Fund (<abbr title="Infection Control Fund">ICF</abbr>). However, if a <abbr title="personal assistant">PA</abbr> is receiving their full wage from their employer through the <abbr title="Infection Control Fund">ICF</abbr>, they will not be eligible for the NHS Test and Trace Support Payment scheme.</p>
