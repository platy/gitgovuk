<h2>Who this applies to</h2>

<p>This guidance applies to anyone working in adult social care who is not part of regular testing at work.</p>

<p>You should continuously order enough boxes of rapid lateral flow tests (<abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr>) to test every day that you are working before you begin work. Alternatively, an employer can order test kits on your behalf.</p>

<h3>Summary of testing</h3>

<p>You should continuously order boxes of  <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr>  to have enough to test every day that you are working, or an employer can order test kits on your behalf</p>

<ul>
  <li>tests will be delivered to your selected delivery address for  you to test daily</li>
  <li>you should take a test every day that you are working, before you start work, and report the results online. If you are a live with the person you provide care and support to, conduct daily <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> as close to the beginning of the day as possible and 24 hours apart. All results must be registered whether negative, positive, or void</li>
  <li>you can view your result within 30 minutes of conducting the test</li>
  <li>if you receive a positive <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> result, follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings">management of staff and exposed residents guidance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you have any queries with any of the steps please call the national COVID-19 contact centre on 119.</p>
</div>

<h3>Why testing is important</h3>

<p>Testing is important because it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifies whether you are likely to have COVID-19 so you can self-isolate if positive</li>
  <li>reduces the risk of those receiving care contracting the virus from those who care for them</li>
  <li>prevents and controls the spread of the virus by identifying asymptomatic cases</li>
</ul>

<h3>Eligibility</h3>

<p>You’re eligible if you work in adult social care and are not part of regular testing at work, for example Shared Lives carers, personal assistants, and social workers.</p>

<p>If you believe you match these criteria, follow the guidance below on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-personal-assistants#ordering-test-kits">ordering test kits</a>. Please call 119 if you require any assistance.</p>

<p>Please do not access tests through this route if you are already part of a regular testing regime at work, detailed in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-adult-social-care-settings" class="govuk-link">testing for adult social care settings</a> guidance.</p>

<h3>Summary of your involvement</h3>

<p>When accessing testing, your main responsibilities are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>continuously order boxes of  <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> for yourself,  to be able to test every day you are working</li>
  <li>conduct  daily <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> on the days you are working before you begin work or if you live with the person you provide care and support to, conduct daily <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> as close to the beginning of the day as possible and 24 hours apart</li>
  <li>register your test results as soon as you have completed them</li>
  <li>if you get a positive result, follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings" class="govuk-link">management of staff and exposed residents guidance</a>
</li>
  <li>if you get a negative result, continue to follow infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) measures such as wearing personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>), washing your hands, and socially distancing where possible, even if you or the people you care for have had the vaccine</li>

</li>
</ul>

<h3>Testing within 90 days of a positive result</h3>

<p>If you have tested positive with an <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, the testing you undertake in the following 90 days may be different. Full guidance on what testing to undertake within 90 days of a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> or <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> result can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings">management of staff and exposed residents guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Financial support</h3>

<p>If you need to self-isolate, you may be entitled to a £500 payment via your local authority whether you are employed or self-employed. In order to apply, you will need to have received a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> result. If you have a positive <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> result, you should take a follow up <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme-claiming-financial-support/claiming-financial-support-under-the-test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme">claiming financial support under the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme</a>.</p>

You will need to speak to your individual employer.</p>

<p>Local authorities, at their discretion, may also meet the costs of self-isolation through the Infection Control Fund (<abbr title="Infection Control Fund">ICF</abbr>). However, if you are receiving your full wage from your employer through the <abbr title="Infection Control Fund">ICF</abbr>, you will not be eligible for the NHS Test and Trace Support Payment scheme.</p>
