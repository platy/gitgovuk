<h2>If you were living in the Czech Republic before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>Some parts of this guide only apply if you have been living in the Czech Republic since before 1 January 2021. You should read these in addition to the rest of the guidance in each section.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">Living in Europe page</a> for detailed guidance about citizens’ rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus</h2>
<p>Follow the advice of the Czech Government and your local authority. You should also read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/czech-republic">Czech Republic travel advice</a>.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a UK national in the Czech Republic, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/czech-republic/coronavirus">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>You must tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/czech-republic/entry-requirements">entry requirements for the Czech Republic</a> and read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mvcr.cz/docDetail.aspx?docid=22273706&amp;docType=ART&amp;chnum=3" rel="external">Czech government’s guidance on visas</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency if you were living in the Czech Republic before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>If you have lived in the Czech Republic since before 1 January 2021 you and your family members have rights under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights">Withdrawal Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>You should request a biometric residence card which will show that you have the rights defined in the Withdrawal Agreement. It will also show your right to enter the Czech Republic, and exempt you from the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) and visa requirements.</p>

<p>If you already have a Czech <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/temporary-residence.aspx?q=Y2hudW09MQ%3d%3d" rel="external">residence permit (Potvrzení o přechodném/trvalém pobytu)</a> you must exchange it for the new biometric card before 31 August 2022.</p>

<p>You can apply for the biometric card without having a residency permit. You will need to prove you have been living in the Czech Republic since before 1 January 2021 and continue to do so. You must apply before 31 August 2022.</p>

<p>You must apply for a biometric card through the Ministry of Interior; this requires calling the Ministry and then attending two appointments. First, you need to phone the Ministry of Interior (Odbor azylové a migrační politiky) on +420 974 801 801 to make an appointment so you can provide your biometric data. There is an option to speak to  them in English. You will need to provide your name, passport number and date of birth. You will be given an appointment at which you will be asked to prove you have been living in the Czech Republic since before 1 January 2021 and provide your biometric data. You will then be given a second appointment to collect your new biometric card. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/biometric-data.aspx" rel="external">Czech government guidance on the application process</a>.</p>

<p>Your card will include a note that you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement, this will be listed under ‘Druh povolení’ as one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the wording ‘článek 50 Smlouvy o EU’ for UK nationals,</li>
  <li>the wording ‘RP UK - článek 50 Smlouvy o EU’ for close family members of UK nationals</li>
  <li>the wording ‘ostatní - článek 50 Smlouvy o EU’ for other family members of UK nationals</li>
</ul>

<p>Your rights under the Withdrawal Agreement will not be affected if you do not meet the deadline. However, we recommend that you obtain your new biometric card as soon as possible. If you do not have a biometric card to prove your rights, you may experience delays in, or be refused, government services. Travel within the Schengen area will also be more difficult.</p>

<p>Your close family members continue to be able to join you and settle in the Czech Republic at any time in the future. Read more information on who this applies to in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">Living in Europe guidance</a>.</p>

<p>They must travel to the Czech Republic and then apply as your family member. Nationals of certain non-EU countries may need a visa before travel. The Czech authorities should issue family reunion visas free of charge.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mvcr.cz/docDetail.aspx?docid=22273706&amp;doctype=ART" rel="external">Czech government’s guidance on residency</a>.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-the-czech-republic#coronavirus">Coronavirus travel restrictions</a> may affect travel to and from the Czech Republic.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from the Czech Republic</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/czech-republic/entry-requirements#passport-validity">Czech Republic travel advice</a> for passport validity requirements.</p>

<p>Always carry your passport when travelling within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-area_en" rel="external">Schengen area</a>. If you have citizenship of an EU or European Free Trade Association (EFTA) country, in addition to your British citizenship, you should enter and leave the Czech Republic using your EU or EFTA passport.</p>

<p>If you stay in the Czech Republic with a Czech residence permit or long stay visa, this time does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.</p>

<p>If you visit other Schengen area countries outside the Czech Republic, make sure you do not exceed the visa-free 90 days in any 180-day period. You are responsible for counting how long you stay under the Schengen visa waiver, and you must comply with its conditions.</p>

<p>Different rules apply to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#visas-for-short-trips-you-do-not-need-one-if-youre-a-tourist">EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area</a>. Check each country’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h3>If you were living in the Czech Republic before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>When you travel, carry your biometric residence document, or a temporary or permanent residency card or frontier worker permit, issued under the Withdrawal Agreement, in addition to your passport.</p>

<p>You must proactively show your residence document, or other evidence of residence status, if you are asked to show your passport at border control. Other evidence may be your tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020. If you have applied for, but not yet received, your biometric residence document, show your certificate of registration (usually called a ‘proof of application’).</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you are a resident in the Czech Republic, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the EU. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in the country or countries where you live or work. If a passport is stamped, the stamp is considered null and void when you can show evidence of lawful residence (e.g. biometric card).</p>

<p>If you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement, you can enter and exit the Czech Republic with a valid passport. You do not need any additional validity on the passport beyond the dates on which you are travelling.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>Read our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-the-czech-republic">healthcare in the Czech Republic</a> and make sure you are correctly registered for your circumstances.</p>
