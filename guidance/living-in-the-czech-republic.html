<h2>What you should do</h2>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-the-czech-republic#visas-and-residency">register as a resident</a> in the Czech Republic</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-the-czech-republic#driving-in-the-czech-republic">exchange your driving licence</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Coronavirus</h2>
<p>You should follow the advice of the Czech Government and your local authority. You can also read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/czech-republic">Czech Republic travel advice</a> for our latest guidance.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a UK national in the Czech Republic, see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/czech-republic/coronavirus">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-czech-republic">sign up for email alerts</a> to this guidance</li>
  <li>follow the British Embassy Prague on <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.facebook.com/BritsinCR/">Facebook</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://twitter.com/UKinCR" class="govuk-link">Twitter</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you were legally resident in the Czech Republic before 1 January 2021, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights">your rights will be protected by the Withdrawal Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>You should check that you are correctly registered and should get a new residence document to evidence your rights.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">guidance on living in Europe</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>
<p>If you were legally resident in the Czech Republic before 1 January 2021, you should get a residence document.</p>

<p>To get this document you must report your residence to your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/sluzby-pro-verejnost-informace-pro-cizince-kontakty.aspx" rel="external">local office of the Ministry of Interior</a> by 31 December 2021.</p>

<p>This deadline is indicative which means that your rights under the Withdrawal Agreement will not be affected if you do not meet the deadline. However, we recommend that you obtain your new document as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.mvcr.cz/docDetail.aspx?docid=22273706&amp;doctype=ART">Czech government’s guidance on residency</a>.</p>

<p>We will update these pages with details of the new system as soon as more information is available. You should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-czech-republic">sign up for updates</a> to this guidance.</p>

<h3>Moving to the Czech Republic</h3>

<p>Check the entry requirements for the Czech Republic. Read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.mvcr.cz/docDetail.aspx?docid=22273706&amp;docType=ART&amp;chnum=3" class="govuk-link">Czech government’s guidance on visas</a>.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You should carry your residence permit (i.e. Potvrzení o přechodném pobytu, or Průkaz o povolení k trvalému pobytu), as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your permit, carry a proof of application.</p>

<p>If you have not yet applied for a residence permit, you should carry evidence that you are resident in the Czech Republic. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020.</p>

<p>If you cannot show that you are resident in the Czech Republic, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the Schengen area, and your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in the Czech Republic.</p>

<h3>Passports</h3>
<p>Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport from the Czech Republic</a>.</p>

<p>You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to the Czech Republic, and you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">Renew your passport</a> before you book your travel if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other EU or Schengen area countries. You may have to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. You may also need to show a return or onward ticket.</p>

<h3>Entry requirements</h3>
<p>You can travel to other <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a> countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism.</p>

<p>To stay longer, than 90 days in 180-day period, to work or study, or for business travel, you must meet the entry requirements set out by the country you are travelling to. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit.</p>

<p>Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to EU countries that are not part of the Schengen Area. Check each country’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice</a> page for information on entry requirements.</p>

<p>Travel to the UK and Ireland has not changed.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-the-czech-republic" class="govuk-link">guidance on accessing healthcare in the Czech Republic</a> and make sure you are correctly registered.</p>

<p>If your UK employer has sent you to the Czech Republic temporarily, your access to healthcare is different. Find out how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-the-czech-republic#posted-worker">access healthcare as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<h3>State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you have a registered S1 form and were living in the Czech Republic before 1 January 2021, your rights to access healthcare will stay the same if you are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receiving a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>receiving some other ‘exportable benefits’</li>
  <li>a frontier worker who lives in the Czech Republic and commutes to work in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-the-czech-republic#s1" class="govuk-link">guidance on using an S1 form in the Czech Republic</a> to ensure you are correctly registered for healthcare.</p>

<h3>European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in the Czech Republic, you must not use your UK-issued EHIC for healthcare in the Czech Republic.</p>

<p>If you were living in the Czech Republic before 1 January 2021, you may be eligible for a new UK-issued EHIC if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK student in the Czech Republic</li>
  <li>a UK State Pensioner with a registered S1</li>
  <li>a frontier worker with a registered S1</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/cra/start">Apply now for a new UK EHIC</a></p>

<p>An EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance.</p>

<p>For more information read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare" class="govuk-link">guidance on healthcare when travelling in Europe</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#travel-eu" class="govuk-link">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>

<p>You should also read guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/czech-republic-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners" class="govuk-link">finding an English-speaking doctor in the Czech Republic</a></li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs" class="govuk-link">checking your prescriptions are legal</a> in the Czech Republic</li>
</ul>

<h2>Working in the Czech Republic</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in the Czech Republic before 1 January 2021, you have the right to work, as long as you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>You may need to apply for one or both of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx" class="govuk-link" rel="external">UK criminal records certificate</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.ceskaposta.cz/en/sluzby/egovernment/czechpoint/sluzby-czechpoint" class="govuk-link">extract from the Czech Criminal Register</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you are planning to come to the Czech Republic to work, you may need a visa.</p>

<h3>Frontier workers</h3>

<p>If you live in the Czech Republic and were regularly commuting to work in another EU or EFTA country, before 1 January 2021 you may need a permit to show that you are a frontier worker.</p>

<h2>Education and professional qualifications</h2>
<p>You will be eligible for broadly the same support as Czech nationals, as long as you were legally resident in the Czech Republic before 1 January 2021. Check that you are correctly registered for residency.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-students-in-the-eu-continuing-your-studies">continuing your studies in the EU</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-the-czech-republic#studying-in-the-czech-republic" class="govuk-link">healthcare for students in the Czech Republic</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Moving to the Czech Republic to study</h3>
<p>If you are planning to study in the Czech Republic, make sure you meet all visa requirements before you arrive. Contact the relevant Higher Education provider in the Czech Republic to check what fees you may have to pay.</p>

<p>For more information read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/studying-in-the-european-union-after-brexit">studying in the European Union</a>.</p>

<h3>Professional qualifications</h3>

<p>You may need to get your professional qualification recognised if you want to work in a profession that is regulated in the Czech Republic. When doing this, you will be subject to the third country regulations.</p>

<p>If your qualification was officially recognised by the relevant regulator in the Czech Republic before 1 January 2021, make sure you understand the terms of your recognition decision by checking with that regulator.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.msmt.cz/eu-and-international-affairs/professional-qualifications-after-brexit" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Czech government’s guidance on recognition of professional qualifications</a>.</p>

<h2>Money and tax</h2>

<p>If you work in the Czech Republic, you have the same <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.financnisprava.cz/en/taxes/tax-obligation" rel="external">tax rights and duties</a> as Czech citizens.</p>

<p>The UK has a double taxation agreement with the Czech Republic to ensure you do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. Ask the relevant tax authority your questions about double taxation relief.</p>

<p>Existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in the Czech Republic have not changed.</p>

<p>Read guidance about:</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>You should obtain professional advice on paying tax in the Czech Republic.</p>

<h3>National Insurance</h3>
<p>Find out if you need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad" class="govuk-link">pay National Insurance in the UK or social security contributions</a> in the Czech Republic.</p>

<h3>Banking</h3>
<p>Whether UK banks can provide services to customers living in the EEA is a matter of local law and regulation.
Your bank or finance provider should contact you if they need to make any changes to your product or the way they provide it. If you have any concerns about whether you might be affected, contact your provider or seek independent financial advice.</p>

<p>Read the Money and Pension Service <a rel="external" href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/brexit-banking-insurance-finance" class="govuk-link">guidance on banking, insurance and financial services changes</a> for more information on cross-border banking.</p>

<h3>Declaration of overseas assets</h3>

<p>If you live in the Czech Republic for more than six months in the current year, you will need to pay tax on your worldwide income here. This may include income from securities, insurance, annuities, and property. We recommend that you check with your local Czech <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.financnisprava.cz/en/" rel="external">tax office</a>.</p>

<h2>Pensions</h2>
<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/benefits-and-pensions-for-uk-nationals-in-the-eea-or-switzerland">guidance on entitlement to UK benefits and pensions</a> while you are living in the Czech Republic.</p>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad" class="govuk-link">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire in the Czech Republic, you can claim:</p>
