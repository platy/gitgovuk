<h2>Definition of <abbr title="high consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr>
</h2>
<p>In the UK, a high consequence infectious disease (<abbr title="high consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr>) is defined according to the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>acute infectious disease</li>
  <li>typically has a high case-fatality rate</li>
  <li>may not have effective prophylaxis or treatment</li>
  <li>often difficult to recognise and detect rapidly</li>
  <li>ability to spread in the community and within healthcare settings</li>
  <li>requires an enhanced individual, population and system response to ensure it is managed effectively, efficiently and safely</li>
</ul>

<h2>Classification of <abbr title="high consequence infectious diseases">HCIDs</abbr>
</h2>

<p><abbr title="high consequence infectious diseases">HCIDs</abbr> are further divided into contact and airborne groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>contact <abbr title="high consequence infectious diseases">HCIDs</abbr> are usually spread by direct contact with an infected patient or infected fluids, tissues and other materials, or by indirect contact with contaminated materials and fomites</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>airborne <abbr title="high consequence infectious diseases">HCIDs</abbr> are spread by respiratory droplets or aerosol transmission, in addition to contact routes of transmission</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>List of high consequence infectious diseases</h2>

<p>A list of&nbsp;<abbr title="high consequence infectious diseases">HCIDs</abbr>&nbsp;has been agreed by the UK 4 nations public health agencies, with advisory committee input as required:</p>

<p>*Human to human transmission has not been described to date for avian influenza A(H5N6). Human to human transmission has been described for avian influenza A(H5N1), although this was not apparent until more than 30 human cases had been reported. Both A(H5N6) and A(H5N1) often cause severe illness and fatalities. Therefore, A(H5N6) has been included in the airborne&nbsp;<abbr title="high consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr>&nbsp;list despite not meeting all of the&nbsp;<abbr title="high consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr>&nbsp;criteria.</p>

<p>**Based on the new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.who.int/news/item/12-08-2022-monkeypox--experts-give-virus-variants-new-names" rel="external">WHO</a> nomenclature, the monkeypox virus is comprised of 2 clades: Clade I (formerly Congo Basin (Central African) Clade) and Clade II (formerly West African Clade). Clade II consists of the subclades Clade IIa and Clade IIb, with the latter subclade referring mainly to the group of variants circulating in the 2022 global outbreak. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hcid-status-of-monkeypox"><abbr title="high consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr> status of monkeypox</a> for further details on status classification.</p>

<p>***No cases reported since 2004, but&nbsp;<abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome">SARS</abbr>&nbsp;remains a notifiable disease under the International Health Regulations (2005), hence its inclusion here.</p>

<p>The list of&nbsp;<abbr title="high consequence infectious diseases">HCIDs</abbr>&nbsp;will be kept under review and updated by the UK 4 nations public health agencies, with advisory committee input as required, if new&nbsp;<abbr title="high consequence infectious diseases">HCIDs</abbr>&nbsp;emerge that are of relevance to the UK.</p>

<h2>Status of COVID-19</h2>
<p>As of 19 March 2020, COVID-19 is no longer considered to be a high consequence infectious disease (HCID) in the UK. There are many diseases which can cause serious illness which are not classified as HCIDs.</p>

<p>The 4 nations public health HCID group made an interim recommendation in January 2020 to classify COVID-19 as an HCID. This was based on consideration of the UK HCID criteria about the virus and the disease with information available during the early stages of the outbreak. Now that more is known about COVID-19, the public health bodies in the UK have reviewed the most up to date information about COVID-19 against the UK HCID criteria. They have determined that several features have now changed; in particular, more information is available about mortality rates (low overall), and there is now greater clinical awareness and a specific and sensitive laboratory test, the availability of which continues to increase.</p>

<p>The ACDP is also of the opinion that COVID-19 should no longer be classified as an HCID.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) continues to consider COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), therefore the need to have a national, coordinated response remains and this is being met by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">government’s COVID-19 response</a>.</p>

<p>Cases of COVID-19 are no longer managed by HCID treatment centres only. Healthcare workers managing possible and confirmed cases should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/national-infection-prevention-and-control/" rel="external">National infection prevention and control manual for England</a>, which includes instructions about different personal protective equipment (PPE) ensembles that are appropriate for different clinical scenarios.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="high consequence infectious diseases">HCIDs</abbr> in the UK</h2>

<p><abbr title="high consequence infectious diseases">HCIDs</abbr>, including viral haemorrhagic fevers (<abbr title="viral haemorrhagic fevers">VHFs</abbr>), are rare in the UK. When cases do occur, they tend to be sporadic and are typically associated with recent travel to an area where the infection is known to be endemic or where an outbreak is occurring. None of the <abbr title="high consequence infectious diseases">HCIDs</abbr> listed above are endemic in the UK, and the known animal reservoirs are not found in the UK.</p>

<p>As of July 2022, the UK has experience of managing confirmed cases of Lassa fever, <abbr title="Ebola virus disease">EVD</abbr>, <abbr title="Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever">CCHF</abbr>,  <abbr title="Middle East respiratory syndrome">MERS</abbr> and monkeypox. The vast majority of these patients acquired their infections overseas, but secondary transmission of <abbr title="Middle East respiratory syndrome">MERS</abbr> and monkeypox have occurred in the UK.</p>

<p>In May 2022, cases of monkeypox (Clade IIb) without a history of travel overseas were reported in the UK. More information is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-outbreak-epidemiological-overview">epidemiological overview of this outbreak</a>.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="high consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr> risks by country</h2>

<p>For health professionals wishing to determine the <abbr title="high consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr> risk in any particular country, an A to Z list of countries and their respective <abbr title="high consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr> risk is available.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/high-consequence-infectious-disease-country-specific-risk"><abbr title="high consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr> country risks</a>.</p>

<h2>Monthly summaries of global <abbr title="high consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr> events</h2>

<p>UKHSA’s epidemic intelligence activities monitor global <abbr title="high consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr> events. These are published in a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-consequence-infectious-diseases-monthly-summaries">monthly summary</a>.</p>

<h2>Infection prevention and control in healthcare settings</h2>

<p>Specific infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) measures are required for suspected and confirmed <abbr title="high consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr> cases, in all healthcare settings (specialist and non-specialist).</p>

<p><abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> guidance appropriate for suspected and confirmed cases of Lassa fever, <abbr title="Ebola virus disease">EVD</abbr>, <abbr title="Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever">CCHF</abbr>, <abbr title="Marburg virus disease">MVD</abbr>, Lujo virus disease, Argentinian haemorrhagic fever, Bolivian haemorrhagic fever and SFTS, is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/viral-haemorrhagic-fever-algorithm-and-guidance-on-management-of-patients">ACDP guidance</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> guidance for <abbr title="Middle East respiratory syndrome">MERS</abbr>, avian influenza, Nipah virus infection, monkeypox and pneumonic plague, can be found in the relevant UKHSA guidance listed below.</p>

<h2>Specialist advice for healthcare professionals</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/imported-fever-service-ifs">Imported Fever Service (<abbr title="Imported Fever Service">IFS</abbr>)</a> provides 24-hour, 7-days a week telephone access to expert clinical and microbiological advice. Hospital doctors across the UK can contact the <abbr title="Imported Fever Service">IFS</abbr> after discussion with the local microbiology, virology or infectious disease consultant.</p>

<h2>Hospital management of confirmed <abbr title="high consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr> cases</h2>

<p>Once an <abbr title="high consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr> has been confirmed by appropriate laboratory testing, cases in England should be transferred rapidly to a designated <abbr title="high consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr> Treatment Centre. Occasionally, highly probable cases may be moved to an <abbr title="high consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr> Treatment Centre before laboratory results are available.</p>

<h3>Contact <abbr title="high consequence infectious diseases">HCIDs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>There are 2 principal Contact <abbr title="high consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr> Treatment Centres in England:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the Royal Free London High Level Isolation Unit (<abbr title="High Level Isolation Unit">HLIU</abbr>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary <abbr title="High Level Isolation Unit">HLIU</abbr>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Further support for managing confirmed contact <abbr title="high consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr> cases is provided by the Royal Liverpool Hospital and the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield.</p>

<h3>Airborne <abbr title="high consequence infectious diseases">HCIDs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>There are 5 interim Airborne <abbr title="high consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr> Treatment Centres in England. Adult and paediatric services are provided by 7 NHS Trusts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust (adult and paediatric services)</li>
  <li>Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, with a paediatric service provided by Imperial College Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust</li>
  <li>Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust, with a paediatric service provided by Alder Hey Children’s NHS Foundation Trust</li>
  <li>Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (adult and paediatric services)</li>
  <li>Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (adult service only)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Case transfer arrangements</h3>

<p>Hospital clinicians seeking to transfer confirmed <abbr title="high consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr> cases, or discuss the transfer of highly probable <abbr title="high consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr> cases, should contact the NHS England <abbr title="Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response">EPRR</abbr> Duty Officer. It is expected that each case will have been discussed with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/imported-fever-service-ifs">Imported Fever Service</a> before discussing transfer.</p>

<h2>Travel health advice for <abbr title="high consequence infectious diseases">HCIDs</abbr>
