<h2>If you were living in Sweden before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>Some parts of this guide only apply if you have been living in Sweden since before 1 January 2021.  You should read this in addition to the rest of the guidance in each section.â€¯</p>

<p>You should also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">living in Europe page</a> for information about citizensâ€™ rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<p>Follow the advice of the Swedish Government and your local authority. You should also read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/sweden" class="govuk-link">Sweden travel advice</a>.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a UK national in Sweden read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/sweden/coronavirus" class="govuk-link">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>You must tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/sweden/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">entry requirements for Sweden</a> and read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals.html" rel="external">Swedish Migration Agencyâ€™s guidance on entry permits</a>. If you plan to live in Sweden for more than 1 year, you must <a rel="external" href="https://www.skatteverket.se/servicelankar/otherlanguages/inenglish/individualsandemployees/movingtosweden.4.7be5268414bea064694c40c.html" class="govuk-link">register with the Swedish Population Register</a>. The Swedish authorities will issue you an ID number (personnummer).</p>

<p>You will not be able to register if you are still <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.skatteverket.se/servicelankar/otherlanguages/inenglish/individualsandemployees/workinginsweden.4.2cf1b5cd163796a5c8bb087.html">looking for a job when you come to Sweden</a> or you do not meet other requirements for residency.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency if you were living in Sweden before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>If you applied for your new â€˜uppehÃ¥llsstatusâ€™ residency document by 31 December 2021, your rights are protected by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights" class="govuk-link">Withdrawal Agreement</a> pending a decision on your application. You should continue the process to get your new residence document if you do not have it yet.</p>

<p>If you have a card or certificate for residence rights under EU law (uppehÃ¥llsrÃ¤tt), this is no longer valid (since 1 January 2022). Read the information further down in this section on making a late application for an uppehÃ¥llsstatus residence document.</p>

<p>If you have a card for residence under Swedish law (uppehÃ¥llstillstÃ¥nd), you do not need to apply for the new uppehÃ¥llsstatus residence document, but you have the option to. The new uppehÃ¥llsstatus residence document allows you to stay longer outside of Sweden without losing your residency rights. It also makes it easier for family members to come and live with you in Sweden.</p>

<p>If you have not had a response to your uppehÃ¥llsstatus application, you can <a rel="external" href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Contact-us/Log-in-to-My-page.html" class="govuk-link">contact the Migration Agency using â€˜My pageâ€™ on the Swedish Migration Agency website</a>.</p>

<p>You must <a rel="external" href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/British-citizens/After-the-decision-has-been-made.html" class="govuk-link">renew your uppehÃ¥llsstatus when it expires</a>.  Read the Migration Agencyâ€™s information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/Residence-permit-card.html" rel="external">how to renew a residence permit</a>.</p>

<h3>Appeal process</h3>

<p>If your application for a new uppehÃ¥llsstatus residence status is refused, you will be notified about the appeal process. Read the Swedish government advice on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/British-citizens/After-the-decision-has-been-made.html" rel="external">how to make an appeal</a>.</p>

<h3>Late applications</h3>

<p>The deadline for applying for a new residence status was 31 December 2021. The Migration Agency may accept an application for residence status after this date and will consider applications on an individual basis. Find out <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/British-citizens/How-to-apply-for-residence-status.html">how to apply for residence status</a>.</p>

<p>If your municipality has a municipal guide (medborgarkontor) and you are vulnerable and require assistance with your application, you can ask them for help.  Not all municipalities provide this service.</p>

<h3>Family members</h3>

<p>If you have been granted a new â€˜uppehÃ¥llsstatusâ€™ residence status, your close family members continue to be able to join you and settle in Sweden in the future. Find more information on who this applies to in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">Living in Europe guidance</a>. Read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/British-citizens/Permission-for-family-members-of-British-citizens.html" class="govuk-link">Migration Agencyâ€™s information on making an application for a family member</a>.</p>

<p>Nationals of certain non-EU countries may need a visa before travelling to Sweden. The Swedish authorities should issue family reunion visas free of charge.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-sweden#coronavirus" class="govuk-link">Coronavirus travel restrictions</a> may affect travel to and from Sweden.</p>

<p>You <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">can apply for or renew your British passport from Sweden</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/country/entry-requirements#passport-validity" class="govuk-link">Sweden travel advice</a> for passport validity requirements.</p>

<p>Always carry your passport when travelling within the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-area_en">Schengen area</a>. If you have citizenship of an EU or European Free Trade Association (EFTA) country, in addition to your British citizenship, you should enter and leave Sweden using your EU or EFTA passport.</p>

<p>If you stay in Sweden with a Swedish residence permit or long stay visa, this time does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.</p>

<p>If you visit other Schengen area countries outside Sweden, make sure you do not exceed the visa-free 90 days in any 180-day period. You are responsible for counting how long you stay under the Schengen visa waiver, and you must comply with its conditions.</p>

<p>Different rules apply to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#visas-for-short-trips-you-do-not-need-one-if-youre-a-tourist" class="govuk-link">EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area</a>. Check each countryâ€™s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Sweden before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>When you travel, carry your residence document (uppehÃ¥llsstatus) or frontier worker permit issued under the Withdrawal Agreement, in addition to your valid passport.</p>

<p>You must proactively show your residence document, or other evidence of residence status, if you are asked to show your passport at border control. If you have applied for, but not yet received, your residence document, show your certificate of application.</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you are a resident in Sweden, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the EU. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in the country or countries where you live or work. If a passport is stamped, the stamp is considered null and void when you can show evidence of lawful residence.</p>

<p>If you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement, you can enter and exit Sweden with a valid passport. You do not need any additional validity on the passport beyond the dates on which you are travelling.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-sweden">guidance on healthcare in Sweden</a> and make sure you are correctly registered for your circumstances.</p>

<p>Read the Swedishâ€™s government <a href="https://www.forsakringskassan.se/english" rel="external" class="govuk-link">guidance on the Social Insurance Agencyâ€™s website</a> (FÃ¶rsÃ¤kringskassan).</p>

<p>Travel insurance is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#insurance-if-you-live-abroad-or-go-for-work-or-study" class="govuk-link">not intended to cover healthcare costs if you live overseas</a>.</p>

<p>Many over-the-counter medicines in the UK are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tullverket.se/en/private/travelling/travellingwithmedicines.4.311bf4f016e69d6ea0d97b.html#:~:text=As%20a%20traveller%2C%20you%20can,other%20authorised%20issuer%20of%20prescriptions" rel="external">only available by prescription in Sweden</a>.

<h2>Working in Sweden</h2>

<p>If you are planning to move to Sweden and work, you may need a visa.
