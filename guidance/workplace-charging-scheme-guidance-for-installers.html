<h2>About the scheme</h2>

<p>The Workplace Charging Scheme (<abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr>) is a voucher-based scheme that provides eligible applicants with support towards the upfront costs of the purchase and installation of electric vehicle (<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>) chargepoints. After an applicant applies, installers claim the grant on their behalf.</p>

<p>It is available in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but not in the Channel Islands or Isle of Man.</p>

<p>The scheme is run by the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>) and administered by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>).</p>

<p>This guidance is aimed at installers. Guidance is also available for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/evhs-and-wcs-chargepoint-model-approval-process-for-manufacturers">manufacturers</a></li>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/workplace-charging-scheme-guidance-for-charities-and-small-accommodation-businesses">charities and small accommodation businesses</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>How the scheme works</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> is open to businesses, charities and public sector organisations that meet the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/workplace-charging-scheme-guidance-for-applicants#applicant-eligibility">applicant eligibility</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/workplace-charging-scheme-guidance-for-applicants#site-eligibility">site eligibility</a> criteria set out in the guidance for applicants</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/workplace-charging-scheme-guidance-for-charities-and-small-accommodation-businesses#applicant-eligibility">applicant eligibility</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/workplace-charging-scheme-guidance-for-charities-and-small-accommodation-businesses#site-eligibility">site eligibility</a> criteria set out in the guidance for charities and small accommodation businesses</li>
</ul>

<p>The grant covers up to 75% of the total costs of the purchase and installation of <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoints (inclusive of VAT), capped at a maximum of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£350 per socket</li>
  <li>40 sockets across all sites per applicant – for instance, if the customer would like to install them in 40 sites, they will have 1 socket available per site</li>
</ul>

<p>After applying using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workplace-charging-scheme-application-form">online application form</a>, successful applicants are issued with a unique identification voucher code by email, which can then be given to any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/commercial-chargepoints-authorised-installers"><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>-authorised commercial chargepoint installer</a>.</p>

<p>Once the chargepoint(s) have been installed, the authorised installer can claim the grant from <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> on the applicant’s behalf via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.claim-chargepoint-grants.service.gov.uk" rel="external">online installer service</a>.</p>

<p>The chargepoint installation must be completed and the voucher claimed within 6 months of the voucher’s issue date. Claims against expired vouchers will not be paid.</p>

<p>Installers must not charge applicants for the grant in advance of payment being made by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>. After <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> reimburses you for the value of the voucher, you must discount this cost from your customer’s final invoice.</p>

<p>If the customer applies for less than 40 sockets, they can submit additional applications in the future until they reach that limit. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/workplace-charging-scheme-guidance-for-applicants#linked-enterprise">Special rules apply for linked enterprises</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> reserves the right to terminate or change the rules of this grant scheme – including the grant level – at any time, although we will endeavour to provide up to 4 weeks’ notice. <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will honour any voucher codes that have been issued ahead of any changes to the grant or during any notice period given following the announcement of the scheme’s closure.</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>

<h4>Applicant</h4>

<p>A party who has declared an existing or future need for charging infrastructure. For the purposes of this scheme, an applicant can be any eligible business, charity or public sector organisation.</p>

<p>Applicants must meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/workplace-charging-scheme-guidance-for-applicants#t-and-cs">terms and conditions</a> of the scheme and have permission to install charging infrastructure at designated off-street parking facilities dedicated to staff and/or fleet use.</p>

<p>In the case of registered charities and small accommodation businesses (those with 249 employees or less), there is no restriction on who may use the parking, be it customers, guests, visitors, staff or others.</p>

<h4>Authorised installer</h4>

<p>A party that has been authorised to install <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoints by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> under the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> through the process outlined in  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/approval-process-for-ev-chargepoint-manufacturers">Approval process for chargepoint manufacturers</a>. Installers manage the installation of chargepoints at applicant sites.</p>

<p>The term ‘installer’ in this guidance means ‘authorised installer’.</p>

<h4>Authorised installer representative</h4>

<p>A party that has been authorised to sub-contract to installers the installation of chargepoints under the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>.</p>

<p>The authorised installer representative remains wholly responsible for ensuring that the installers abide by the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/workplace-charging-scheme-guidance-for-applicants#t-and-cs">terms and conditions</a> of the scheme. If an authorised installer representative’s installer fails to meet the terms and conditions, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> may revoke the authorisation of the authorised installer representative.</p>

<h4>Authorised chargepoint manufacturer</h4>

<p>A party that manufactures a chargepoint which is listed on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workplace-charging-scheme-approved-chargepoint-list"><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>-approved commercial chargepoint model list</a>.</p>

<h4>Staff and/or fleet parking</h4>

<p>Off-street parking that is designated to the applicant and is for their staff or fleet, and not for customer use. Applicants must be able to provide evidence of this on request (for example, details of a parking policy or photographic evidence).</p>

<p>If the primary use of the chargepoints remains staff/fleet use, you may allow local residents to use the chargepoints outside of office hours when they will not typically be used by your staff or fleet vehicles.</p>

<p>In the case of registered charities and small accommodation businesses (those with 249 employees or less), there is no restriction on who may use the parking, be it customers, guests, visitors, staff or others.</p>

<p>The parking facilities must be clearly associated with the applicant’s premises and be either on-site or a reasonable distance from the place of work.</p>

<h4>Customer parking</h4>

<p>Parking that is available to be used by the applicant’s customers. Customer parking is not eligible for the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr>.</p>

<p>However, if the applicant is a charity or a small accommodation business (those with 249 employees or less), there is no restriction on who may use the parking.</p>

<h4>Chargepoint socket (also referred to as ‘chargepoints’ or ‘chargepoint units’)</h4>

<p>Sockets that are used to charge an <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>. There are 4 modes of <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint socket, and mode 3 and 4 are eligible for <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr>. Each socket must have at least a 3kW supply undiminished by simultaneous charging.</p>

<p>Modes 1 and 2 (such as a normal 3-pin socket) are not eligible. For more information, refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/commercial-chargepoints-minimum-technical-specification">minimum technical specification</a>.</p>

<h2>Eligibility and technical requirements</h2>

<h3>Installer authorisation</h3>

<p>Installers must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/residential-and-commercial-chargepoints-become-an-authorised-installer">apply online for <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> authorisation</a> before they can install chargepoint units under the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Customer eligibility</h3>

<p>The scheme is open to applicant organisations that fulfill all of the grant eligibility criteria outlined in the guidance for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/workplace-charging-scheme-guidance-for-applicants#eligibility">applicants</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/workplace-charging-scheme-guidance-for-charities-and-small-accommodation-businesses#eligibility">charities and small accommodation businesses</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Applicant eligibility</h4>

<p>The applicant organisation must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be a registered business, charity or public sector organisation</li>
  <li>either:
    <ul>
      <li>be a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/workplace-charging-scheme-guidance-for-applicants#public-authority-definition">public authority</a>
</li>
      <li>have received – or have currently pending at the time of application – less than €200,000 of de minimis aid or less than 325,000 Special Drawing Rights awarded in accordance with article 364 of UK-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Trade and Cooperation Agreement in the last 3 financial years</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>declare a need for <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> charging equipment, or an intent to encourage uptake among their staff and/or fleet</li>
  <li>be located in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland (applicants in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man are not eligible)</li>
  <li>have dedicated off-street parking for staff and/or fleet use only (if the applicant is a charity or a small accommodation business with 249 employees or less, there is no restriction on who may use the parking)</li>
  <li>own the property or have consent from the landlord for chargepoints to be installed at all the sites listed in the application</li>
</ul>

<h4>Site eligibility</h4>

<p>Each site must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a minimum power supply of 3kW to each individual socket that is not diminished by their simultaneous use</li>
  <li>have no more than one socket installed for each accessible parking space</li>
  <li>be for staff and/or fleet use (if the applicant is a charity or a small accommodation business with 249 employees or less, there is no restriction on who may use the parking)</li>
</ul>

<p>If your customer’s primary place of work is also a residential property (their home), they can apply for the grant under this scheme as long as their address is listed as their place of business with Companies House or HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>).</p>

<p>The following sites are not eligible for the scheme:</p>

<ul>
  <li>locations outside England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland (including the Channel Islands and Isle of Man)</li>
  <li>parking facilities that are part of a domestic property (and it is not a primary place of work) – your customers may be able to apply to the <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint grant instead if they are looking to install an <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint in a residential dwelling</li>
  <li>where the site of installation is an address that has claimed previously under a previous <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> grant, including the Electric Vehicles Homecharge Scheme (<abbr title="Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr>) or Domestic Recharging Scheme (<abbr title="Domestic Recharging Scheme">DRS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>parking facilities that are solely for customer use (if the applicant is a charity or a small accommodation business with 249 employees or less, there is no restriction on who may use the parking)</li>
  <li>parking facilities not designated to the applicant</li>
  <li>parking facilities that have not yet been built – only existing designated off-street parking is eligible for the scheme; a confirmation letter (from, for example, your local council) does not oblige the applicant to proceed with the construction and <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>, therefore, cannot rely on it as evidence</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will not grant exceptions for locations that do not meet these eligibility criteria.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> cannot provide bespoke advice on eligibility. Before your customer applies for a voucher, you should check that they qualify for the scheme by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>discussing their individual circumstances and intended chargepoint models with them</li>
  <li>undertaking a survey of any prospective site(s)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chargepoint equipment requirements</h3>

<p>All chargepoint units must meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/commercial-chargepoints-minimum-technical-specification">minimum technical specification</a> and be on the <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>-approved <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/commercial-approved-chargepoint-model-list">commercial chargepoint model list</a> at the time of installation.</p>

<p>Learn more about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/approval-process-for-ev-chargepoint-manufacturers">approval process for chargepoint manufacturers</a>.</p>

<p>Ensure that the chargepoint model name is exactly the same as the one stated on the eligible list. Claims will be rejected if the model claimed is not on the list.</p>

<p>Chargepoints are listed at the request of their manufacturers. If a model is not listed, it is not eligible for grant. Contact the chargepoint manufacturer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to find out why your chargepoint is not listed</li>
  <li>for details on what is covered by a specific approval</li>
</ul>

<p>A customer may provide their own chargepoint if it is on the <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>-approved chargepoint model list and they have a manufacturer’s 3-year on-site warranty. However, such equipment will not be eligible for a grant under the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr>. In this instance, as an installer, you may only claim for the cost of labour and other parts provided for the installation.</p>

<p>You cannot claim against:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a previously installed or second-hand chargepoint – the chargepoint unit must be new</li>
  <li>installations made prior to voucher approval – applicants must apply for a voucher before you install any chargepoints</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation requirements</h3>

<p>Installations under <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> can only be completed by installers that have been authorised by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/residential-and-commercial-chargepoints-become-an-authorised-installer">Learn how to become an authorised installer</a>.</p>

<p>Installations must be completed and a claim made before the voucher expires. A voucher will be valid for 6 months (180 days) from the date of issue.</p>

<p>Installations must meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/commercial-chargepoints-minimum-technical-specification">minimum technical specification</a>.</p>

<p>Authorised chargepoint installers must confirm that installations will be carried out in accordance with current:</p>

  <li>all other applicable standards</li>
</ul>

<p>The installation must also consider the requirements of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000030217421" rel="external">BS 8300:2009+A1:2010 and the needs of disabled people</a>.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>If the customer encounters any issues within the warranty period, they should contact their chargepoint installer or manufacturer.</p>

<h2>Accessibility needs</h2>

<p>When installing <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoints, it is important to consider who may use them, particularly <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> owners who may be disabled or have mobility issues.</p>

<p>All installations taking place under the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> should consider the requirements of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://shop.bsigroup.com/products/design-of-an-accessible-and-inclusive-built-environment-external-environment-code-of-practice" rel="external">BS 8300-1:2018 (Design of an accessible and inclusive built environment – External environment. Code of practice)</a> and the requirements of disabled people or those with mobility issues.</p>

<h4>On-site audits</h4>

<p>The installer of the chargepoint equipment may be subject to audit to ensure they have complied with the relevant provisions in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/commercial-chargepoints-minimum-technical-specification">minimum technical specification</a>, which may involve a site visit.</p>

<p>Failure to provide all relevant, accurate evidence of compliance may result in further action against the authorised installer making the claim. <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> reserves the right to make final judgements on eligibility based on the evidence provided. This includes removing authorised installers who fail to install chargepoints according to <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> standards.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#audits">Find out more about audits and the evidence required.</a></p>

<h3>Ongoing data requirements</h3>

<p>All sites must be able to communicate usage data to a back-end management system to enable it to be sent onwards to <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>. The communication channels may include but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>general packet radio services (<abbr title="general packet radio services">GPRS</abbr>) or cellular networks</li>
  <li>other wireless means</li>
  <li>wired network connectivity – optionally using a virtual private network (<abbr title="virtual private network">VPN</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Problems with signal strength</h4>

<p>If using cellular or <abbr title="general packet radio services">GPRS</abbr> where the network capacity is not sufficient (such as low-quality network coverage via <abbr title="general packet radio services">GPRS</abbr>), installers must use additional means to boost the signal strength.</p>

<h4>Problems with data supply</h4>

<p>If data communication is not possible, you must declare this when submitting a claim on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.claim-chargepoint-grants.service.gov.uk" rel="external">online installer portal</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will monitor the number of installations from installers without data communications and reserves the right to request more information from any installers that are not communicating the required data. This may result in your authorisation being revoked.</p>

<h3>Notifying your distribution network operator of installations</h3>

<p>You must notify your local distribution network operator (<abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr>) of all installations you make so that they can evaluate the potential load on the grid and any network reinforcements. This notification must be compliant with the relevant <abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr>’s requirements.</p>

<p>If you do not notify the relevant <abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr>(s) of chargepoints installed under the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> and do not retain evidence of this notification, your authorisation may be revoked.</p>

<p>In your notification, you should either submit to each relevant <abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an online form per installation</li>
  <li>a list of installations (with relevant details) in a single spreadsheet</li>
</ul>

<p>Multiple notifications are encouraged.</p>

<p>The online form and multi-notification spreadsheet template, plus the regions each <abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr> covers and their contact details, can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.energynetworks.org/operating-the-networks/connecting-to-the-networks" rel="external">Energy Networks Association (<abbr title="Energy Networks Association">ENA</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<h2>How to redeem a customer voucher</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Make a claim under the Workplace Charging Scheme</h4>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.claim-chargepoint-grants.service.gov.uk" rel="external">You can redeem a WCS voucher via the online installer portal</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Overview of redemption process</h3>

<p>The following is a summary of the process authorised installers must follow to redeem a customer’s voucher and install chargepoints under the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr>.</p>

<p>1. Installer receives enquiry from applicant and checks their <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> voucher code is eligible via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.claim-chargepoint-grants.service.gov.uk" rel="external">online installer portal</a>.</p>

<p>2. Installer completes site surveys and quotes, and confirms sites are suitable for their customer’s intended chargepoint installations.</p>

<p>3. Installer installs <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/commercial-approved-chargepoint-model-list"><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>-approved chargepoint unit(s)</a> in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/commercial-chargepoints-minimum-technical-specification">commercial chargepoints minimum technical specification</a>, switches them on and verifies they are working safely and communicating data.</p>

<p>4. Installer completes online grant redemption on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.claim-chargepoint-grants.service.gov.uk" rel="external">online installer portal</a> before voucher expires, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>declaring installation costs</li>
  <li>providing photographic evidence of installation</li>
</ul>

<p>5. Installer <a class="govuk-link" href="#dno">notifies the relevant <abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr></a> in agreement with <abbr title="Energy Networks Association">ENA</abbr> and supplies the customer with a copy of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://electrical.theiet.org/bs-7671/model-forms/" rel="external">BS7671 Electrical Installation Certificate</a>.</p>

<p>6. The applicant will receive an email from <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> containing the information provided by the installer and confirming the grant level generated by the system.</p>

<p>7. Applicant checks the details in installer email are accurate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if they are inaccurate, the applicant has 7 calendar days to email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:workplacechargingscheme@dvla.gov.uk">workplacechargingscheme@dvla.gov.uk</a> and raise any concerns – <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> may then contact the installer with queries</li>
  <li>if they are accurate, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> pays the installer</li>
</ul>

<p>8. <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> processes an installer <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> claim in 7 working days, subject to any queries. The installer responds promptly to any queries.</p>

<p>9. Installer receives grant from <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> within 30 working days. If the installer has not previously claimed any grants from <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>, payment may take up to 3 months to process.</p>

<p>10. Installer retains copies of all customer details and required documents. If chosen for audit check, the installer sends <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> all requested documentation</p>

<h3>Information you need to provide in your claim</h3>

<p>During the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> voucher redemption process, you must provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the make and model(s) of chargepoint unit(s) installed. Ensure these match those stated on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/commercial-approved-chargepoint-model-list"><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>-approved commercial chargepoint list)</a> exactly</li>
  <li>the costs incurred (these will be used to compute the exact value of the grant, which will be equal to 75% of the installation and purchase costs of a chargepoint up to a maximum of £350)</li>
  <li>a photo of the chargepoint unit(s) with the serial number clearly visible (up to 5MB in size)</li>
  <li>a photo of the parking site with all the chargepoint units visible (up to 5MB in size)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Voucher code validity and when you should submit your claim</h3>

<p>As soon as you receive an enquiry from a <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> applicant, you should request to see their voucher code to confirm their eligibility.</p>

<p>You can check that a voucher code is eligible by checking the voucher code on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.claim-chargepoint-grants.service.gov.uk" rel="external">online installer portal</a> or by contacting <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:workplacechargingscheme@dvla.gov.uk">workplacechargingscheme@dvla.gov.uk</a>. We recommend you do this as early as possible.</p>

<p>Your customer’s voucher will contain a unique code that you will need to reference to make a successful claim. It will also provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their contact details</li>
  <li>the installation site(s)</li>
  <li>the expiry date</li>
  <li>the number of sockets and sites for which the voucher is valid</li>
</ul>

<p>The online redemption process will only start when you formally input the voucher code into the portal and submit your claim.</p>

<p>You must submit a claim by midnight on the date the voucher associated with the installation expires. Each voucher is valid for 6 months (180 days) from its date of issue.</p>

<p>Late claims, or claims without a voucher code, will not be paid.</p>

<p>For applicants that complete installations across a number of their premises, the maximum number of chargepoint sockets that can be claimed is 40 regardless of the number of sites. All installations under a single voucher must be claimed in a single claim. Once a voucher has been redeemed it cannot be re-used. If there are other sites linked to a redeemed voucher at which a chargepoint has not been installed, an applicant must reapply for a new voucher for these sites.</p>

<h4>If the installation (or part of it) cannot be completed by your voucher’s expiry date</h4>

<p>If all installation(s) listed cannot be completed within the 6-month period specified on the voucher, the applicant will need to withdraw their application and reapply for a new voucher. Vouchers are non-transferable.</p>

<p>If some chargepoints on the voucher have been completed by the expiry date but others have not, you can claim for the installations that you have completed, but your customer will need to reapply for a new voucher for the remaining installations not yet completed. In these circumstances, installations completed before the new voucher has been issued will not be eligible.</p>

<h3>Value of support</h3>

<p><abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> provides a grant equal to 75% of the purchase and installation costs of a chargepoint, capped at a maximum of £350 for each socket, up to a limit of 40 sockets per applicant.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr>’s capping system calculates 75% of the declared costs (inclusive of VAT) and will allocate a grant equal to whichever is lowest: 75% of the costs or £350.</p>

<p>Please remember to take this into consideration when agreeing a certain price with your customers. <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will not be held responsible if the final grant level is not in line with the estimations or quotes you provide.</p>

<h4>Maximum number of chargepoints per customer</h4>

<p>You may complete installations for a customer across a number of their premises. In this case, the maximum number of chargepoint sockets that you can claim is 40, regardless of the number of sites.</p>

<p>All installations under a single voucher must be claimed in a single claim.</p>

<p>Once a voucher has been redeemed, it cannot be re-used. If there are other sites linked to a redeemed voucher at which a chargepoint has not been installed, an applicant must reapply for a new voucher for these sites.</p>

<h3>Costs</h3>

<p>Detail of the costs incurred must be submitted by the installer and confirmed by the applicant in order for a claim to be successful. Checks will be made regularly on the details submitted.</p>

<p>Installers must not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>charge applicants for the grant in advance of payment being made by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>
</li>
  <li>inflate the costs of the chargepoints to benefit from a higher grant level</li>
  <li>use the grant to cross-subsidise costs incurred in other parts of its business</li>
</ul>

<p>Any evidence of non-compliance with the above will be acted on by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> – see <a class="govuk-link" href="#misconduct">penalties for improper conduct</a>.</p>

<p>The installer should provide an invoice to the customer showing the total cost of the installation (including any VAT charged) and the <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> grant that is offset against that total.</p>

<p>For enquiries relating to VAT, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/vat-enquiries"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Eligible expenditure consists of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cost of unit</li>
  <li>electrical components</li>
  <li>civil engineering works</li>
  <li>labour costs (for installation)</li>
  <li>hardware costs</li>
  <li>the VAT incurred by the customer</li>
  <li>site survey works (when leading to a completed installation)</li>
</ul>

<p>Where an additional smart meter or current clamp device is required, the capital cost of this is also eligible expenditure providing it is installed at the same time as the chargepoint.</p>

<p>Examples of ineligible expenditure include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>interest charges, bad debts, profits, entertaining</li>
  <li>project management and reporting costs</li>
  <li>administration costs</li>
  <li>inflation and contingency allowances (as an overall arbitrary percentage) additional to eligible costs – however reasonable inflation rates can be included in labour and material cost estimates</li>
  <li>new/additional land required for the proposed infrastructure</li>
  <li>electricity provided by relevant infrastructure</li>
  <li>ongoing back office data provision</li>
  <li>any other ongoing operating costs (for example, maintenance or communication)</li>
  <li>any warranty extension beyond 3 years</li>
  <li>transport costs</li>
  <li>marketing costs</li>
  <li>any other cost not listed as an eligible expenditure</li>
</ul>

<p>We have designed the scheme to be as simple for the applicant as possible. By authorising chargepoint installers and enabling them to claim on behalf of applicants, we are ensuring value for money for the taxpayer and reducing the risk of fraudulent activity by individuals.</p>

<p>If an installer enters administration, payment would be made by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> to administrators.</p>

<h3>How to appeal if your claim is rejected</h3>

<p>If your claim is unsuccessful, you may appeal by emailing the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:workplacechargingscheme@dvla.gov.uk">workplacechargingscheme@dvla.gov.uk</a> with reasons why you believe the decision should be re-examined. A manager at <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will then consider the appeal. The outcome of this appeal is final.</p>

<h3>If the applicant’s circumstances have changed</h3>

<p>If the applicant contacts you to inform you that their circumstances have changed since they originally applied, you must ensure they are still eligible to have a chargepoint installed under the scheme.</p>

<p>They may need to reapply for a voucher.</p>

<p>If this change of circumstances invalidates your customer’s application and we have reason to believe you were aware of this prior to installation, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> reserves the right to <a class="govuk-link" href="#misconduct">take any action it deems appropriate</a> to reclaim the grant.</p>

<h3>Grant payment processing times</h3>

<h4>First-time applicants</h4>

<p>First payment(s) may take up to 3 months to process following your first <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> claim.</p>

<p>This is because, when an installer redeems the voucher successfully for the first time, they need to be set up as a vendor on the Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>) finance system.</p>

<p>You may be asked to verify the bank account details you provided at the time you initially applied for installer authorisation, and while <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> aims to do this as quickly as possible, any inaccuracy in the information provided or delay in responding may result in a delay to your payment.</p>

<h4>Subsequent claims</h4>

<p>Claims are processed on a fortnightly basis (typically at the beginning of the month and mid-month), following the conclusion of the 7-day confirmation period, and we aim to pay the grant amount to installers within 30 working days of this date.</p>

<p>For instance, if you complete the online redemption process on 15 April, the voucher redemption details will be deemed accepted by the applicant after 7 days (22 April) and <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will aim to pay this voucher at the beginning of the following month (May).</p>

<p>Similarly, if you complete your claim on 24 April, the voucher redemption details will be deemed accepted by the applicant after 7 days (1 May) and <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will aim to pay this voucher after mid-May.</p>

<h2>Installer responsibilities</h2>

<p>Only <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>-authorised installers can claim the grant on behalf of the applicant.</p>

<p>For each installed workplace chargepoint, the installer must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure that the applicant meets the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/workplace-charging-scheme-guidance-for-applicants#eligibility">eligibility criteria for applicants</a> or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/workplace-charging-scheme-guidance-for-charities-and-small-accommodation-businesses#eligibility">eligibility criteria for charities and small accommodation businesses</a>
</li>
  <li>ensure that the installed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/commercial-approved-chargepoint-model-list">chargepoint model is approved by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr></a>
</li>
  <li>ensure that the installed chargepoint is tested to verify it’s fully functioning, can communicate usage data to a back-end management system to enable it to be sent onwards to <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> and meets safety requirements</li>
  <li>ensure that the voucher is redeemed via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.claim-chargepoint-grants.service.gov.uk" rel="external">online installer portal</a> within the expiry date</li>
  <li>ensure that the supply, distribution equipment, chargepoint cabling and installation meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/commercial-chargepoints-minimum-technical-specification">commercial chargepoints minimum technical specification</a>, and record and retain photographic evidence of this</li>
  <li>retain all documentation pertaining to the installation for a minimum of 3 years, including:
    <ul>
      <li>installation and commissioning confirmations and certificates</li>
      <li>photographs</li>
      <li>customer declarations, signatures and full address</li>
      <li>dates of installation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ensure the same chargepoint is not claimed for twice</li>
  <li>notify the <abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr> of the installation in writing</li>
  <li>issue a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://electrical.theiet.org/bs-7671/model-forms/" rel="external">BS7671 Electrical Installation Certificate</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Installers must not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>charge applicants for the grant in advance of payment being made by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>
</li>
  <li>inflate the costs of the chargepoints to benefit from a higher grant level</li>
  <li>use the grant to cross-subsidise costs incurred in other parts of its business</li>
  <li>apply for the voucher on the applicant’s behalf (such as by using installer’s name as the name of the business and listing the applicant’s address as one of the installation sites on the voucher application)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Penalties for improper conduct</h3>

<p>Where on behalf of an installer, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> reserve the right to withhold payment pending further investigation to ensure public funding is not being used incorrectly.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> reserves the right to withhold payment from the installer pending further investigation where there is reasonable evidence to suggest:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improper conduct on the part of the installer</li>
  <li>the installer was aware of changes in circumstances that invalidate the applicant’s eligibility under the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> and failed to inform <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will revoke your installer authorisation and notify your Competent Person Scheme (CPS) operator if you, or one of your authorised installer representatives, does not comply with the scheme’s requirements. For example, if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fail to <a class="govuk-link" href="#dno">inform the relevant <abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr></a> of a chargepoint installation</li>
  <li>fail to issue a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://electrical.theiet.org/bs-7671/model-forms/" rel="external">BS7671 Electrical Installation Certificate</a>

  <li>complete an installation that does not meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workplace-charging-scheme-minimum-technical-specification">minimum technical standards</a> required for the scheme</li>
  <li>do not conduct a site survey, or proceed with an installation when the survey identified that the existing supply or distribution equipment was not safe</li>
  <li>inflate costs to obtain a higher grant level</li>
  <li>cross-subsidise costs incurred in other parts of the business</li>
</ul>

<p>If there is any evidence of fraudulent activity or misuse of government funding by any party under the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr>, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> reserves the right to take whatever action it deems appropriate, including, but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>revising your grant level</li>
  <li>legal action to reclaim monies paid</li>
  <li>terminating the scheme</li>
  <li>revoking the authorisation of any installer or approval of any manufacturer under the scheme</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chargepoint audits</h3>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>, or its representatives, will conduct on-site audits of installed chargepoints to ensure the requirements of the grant are met.</p>

<p>If a chargepoint is selected for audit, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> or its representatives will contact the relevant party for further information. Information requested may include all documentation pertaining to the installation, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>installation and commissioning confirmations and certificates</li>
  <li>business declarations, signatures and applicant details</li>
  <li>dates of installation</li>
  <li>any photographs taken at the time of installation demonstrating that the existing supply, distribution equipment, chargepoint cabling and installation meet <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> requirements</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will seek to provide feedback to installers on any of their installations audited.</p>

<h2>How to change your authorised installer details</h2>

<h3>Adding sub-contractors once you have been authorised</h3>

<p>You may decide in time that you wish to add a sub-contractor to your authorisation.</p>

<p>If the sub-contractors you wish to use are not already <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> approved installers, you must email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Installer.Authorisation@dvla.gov.uk">Installer.Authorisation@dvla.gov.uk</a> to request permission to add the sub-contractors to your list.</p>

<p>To approve a sub-contractor, we need to see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the name and address of the sub-contractor</li>
  <li>their Competent Person scheme (CPS) name and their CPS membership number</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not use sub-contractors to install any chargepoint units for your company until you have received approval from the Installer Authorisation team.</p>

<h3>Updating your company details once you have been authorised</h3>

<p>If any of your company details change from when you were authorised, you must send these changes to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Installer.Authorisations@dvla.gov.uk">Installer.Authorisations@dvla.gov.uk</a> immediately.</p>

<p>This is to ensure our installer authorisation list is up to date and that you receive all communications sent from <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Changing your company name</h3>

<p>If you are changing your company name, email your new company details to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Installer.Authorisations@dvla.gov.uk">Installer.Authorisations@dvla.gov.uk</a> immediately. The authorisation team will carry out verification checks and will email you to confirm the changes have been made.</p>
