<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Lifetime <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> (<abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr>) managers must report details for all <abbr title="Lifetime ISAs">LISAs</abbr> you managed during the return period, including those that have been transferred in, and those that have been closed. You can exclude details of those transferred out in full, made void, or closed within the period described.</p>

<p>You should continue to report cash ISAs, stocks and shares ISAs and innovative finance ISAs to HMRC using the <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/isa-annual-returns-electronic-text-file-specification">electronic flat text specification</a> or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/annual-return-spreadsheet-template-for-isa-managers">HMRC spreadsheet</a> even where they’re held for the same investor. You must continue to report details of each <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> separately.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> return that does not conform with HMRC’s digital requirements will be rejected. In which case, a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager may be regarded as either having failed to make a return or as having made an incorrect return.</p>

<p>The following <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> forms will include information on <abbr title="Lifetime ISAs">LISAs</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>annual return (ISA14) — the statements of income for both stocks and shares <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> and cash <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> must include <abbr title="Lifetime ISAs">LISAs</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>annual return of statistical information (market value) ISA14(Stats) and ISA14a(Stats) — the valuations of both stocks and shares <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> and cash <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> must include <abbr title="Lifetime ISAs">LISAs</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>annual return of statistical information (subscriptions) ISA25(Stats) and ISA14a(Stats) — the number of <abbr title="Lifetime ISAs">LISAs</abbr> to which subscriptions have been made in the year and the total amounts subscribed in the year to <abbr title="Lifetime ISAs">LISAs</abbr> must be reported</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Every interaction with the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> service occurs in real time and gives either a successful or unsuccessful response.</p>

<p>These interactions allow <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers to report to HMRC, from the opening of a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> to its closure and every other reportable activity in between.</p>

<p>The management of <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> activities requires frequent and stringent digital reporting to HMRC. These requirements must be met to enable you to manage your <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> accounts correctly.</p>

<h2>Linking your account management software to HMRC</h2>

<p>You can send reports to HMRC by installing an <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> on your account management software which is linked to HMRC’s tax platform.</p>

<p>When HMRC approves your application to offer <abbr title="Lifetime ISAs">LISAs</abbr> to investors, you will then be able to link your account management software with HMRC’s Tax platform.</p>

<p>The HMRC <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> service is made up of several <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> (Application Programme Interface) endpoints that allow <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers to directly interact with HMRC using their own software.</p>

<p>Your software will satisfy your own business processes, however it must also be able to interact with all of the endpoints in the way HMRC specifies.</p>

<p>A detailed breakdown of these endpoints is available in the HMRC <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> specification — which is found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation" rel="external">HMRC developer hub</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> specification explains how the interactions between HMRC and <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers must occur and in what format data must be sent to HMRC.</p>

<p>As part of the developer hub, you must be able to access HMRC’s test environment to be able to test their software’s compatibility with HMRC’s service.</p>

<p>Once your software has been approved to interact with HMRC you can do this by calling a specific endpoint. Instructions on how to do this are on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation" rel="external">HMRC developer hub</a>.</p>

<p>The HMRC service uses <a class="govuk-link" href="https://oauth.net/2/bearer-tokens/" rel="external">OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens</a> as authentication.</p>

<p>Unauthorised software will not be able to interact with the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> service.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/software-developers">HMRC’s Software Developer Support Team (SDST)</a> can help you with your software development queries.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Endpoints</h3>
<p>Each endpoint in our service has a specific name to identify what it is used for. The appropriate endpoint must be used for each specific function otherwise an unsuccessful response will be returned to the <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager.</p>

<p>The service endpoints and their functions are set out in the following table:</p>

<p>The following sections detail how you must interact with each endpoint and what data must be submitted to HMRC.</p>

<h2>Creating a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> investor record</h2>

<p>When you create an investor record on the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> service HMRC will check the investor’s identity and confirm if a match is found. HMRC will check the investor’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first name</li>
  <li>last name</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>National Insurance number</li>
</ul>

<p>If a match is found then the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> service will return a response with an Investor ID number to your software for your records. The unique investor ID number must be retained.</p>

<p>An investor ID can only be created once by HMRC. The same investor ID could be used by several different <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> managers if the investor opens a different <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> each tax year.</p>

<p>If the Investor ID already exists then the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> service will send a response back to the <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager. If an <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager loses an investor’s ID, they can simply make this <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> call again and the service will respond.</p>

<h3>How to resolve the unsuccessful creation of a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> investor record</h3>

<p>If the information provided does not match HMRC’s records then we will not allow the creation of the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> investor record to progress.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> service will not explain why the investor’s details do not match.</p>

<p>To help prevent delays caused by data mis-matching investors must ensure that the personal details they provide to their <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> provider match their details held by HMRC.</p>

<p>If the personal details that HMRC holds are incorrect then the investor must update them first with HMRC</p>

<p>Investors can check the data that HMRC holds by accessing their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/personal-tax-account">personal tax account</a></p>

<p>Investors can also access their Personal Tax Account using the HMRC app on any electronic device.
You can advise Investors that guidance is available to check and update their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tell-hmrc-change-of-details">personal details with HMRC</a></p>

<p>Investors can also use the link <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.access.service.gov.uk/login/signin/creds" rel="external">‘Tell HMRC your name has changed’</a> in their personal tax account.</p>

<p>To change their personal details online investors will need to have some information ready with their employer’s details or self-employment details. Investors may be required to send proof of the changes made to HMRC at a later date.</p>

<h3>Find out about the most common data mismatches in the creation of a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> account</h3>

<p>When an investor’s details do not match the data held by HMRC, the reason could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HMRC holds a completely different set of details — a different identity</li>
  <li>the National Insurance number being reported to the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> service is not correct</li>
  <li>the investor may have provided an invalid temporary National Insurance number — a temporary National Insurance starts with TN</li>
  <li>the investor may have provided an invalid national insurance number from the Isle of Man that starts with MA</li>
  <li>the investor may have changed their surname name and has not told HMRC</li>
  <li>the investor’s surname with HMRC is spelled differently from the name given to their <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> provider</li>
  <li>the investor may have made a mistake and has provided their <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> provider with incorrect details — these should be checked with investors first before the investor contact</li>
</ul>

<p>Investors must provide correct personal details to their <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> provider and tell HMRC of any changes to the personal details.</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> providers cannot correct details held by HMRC for an investor. If an investor does not check that HMRC holds their correct information then a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager can refuse to open their <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> providers should explain to investors that their account will only be opened after they have checked their personal data with HMRC.</p>

<p>HMRC cannot pay a government bonus for an investor until they pass the HMRC identity check.</p>

<p>The most common reasons for investor details not matching with HMRC’s data are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>incorrectly spelt surnames</li>
  <li>double-barrelled surnames</li>
  <li>middle names and surnames are in the wrong order</li>
  <li>an investor has applied for a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> using a name that is different from their ‘known as’ name that HMRC uses in correspondence to the investor</li>
</ul>

<h3>How HMRC will check an investor’s eligibility for a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>HMRC will check the date of an investor’s first payment into their <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> against the investor’s date of birth.</p>

<p>This check confirms if they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>aged 18 or over on the day that they made their first payment</li>
  <li>under the age of 40 on that day that they made their first payment</li>
  <li>not shown as ‘deceased’ on HMRC’s records</li>
</ul>

<p>If HMRC’s checks show that the investor is not eligible for a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> for any of these reasons then an unsuccessful response will be returned for the account creation request.</p>

<p>HMRC cannot disclose any information about the date of death of an investor to a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> provider. <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers should try and contact the investor’s executors for confirmation that the investor has died.</p>

<h3>How HMRC will check an investor is compliant</h3>
<p>When an investor’s account data is submitted, HMRC will check if the investor already has a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr>.</p>

<p>If another <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> is found HMRC will check the date of first payment made into each account belonging to the investor. The <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> that the investor paid into first is the valid account. HMRC will automatically change the status of the investor’s second <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> to ‘VOID’.</p>

<p>When a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager receives an unsuccessful response back from HMRC they should contact the investor and explain why their account has not been confirmed with HMRC.</p>

<p>If the response was that an investor is not eligible for a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr>, then their account will need to be closed.</p>

<p>When an investor has been identified as having 2 <abbr title="Lifetime ISAs">LISAs</abbr> and they want to keep their account with you, they must close their <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> with their other <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager.</p>

<p>This may not be possible because their 30 day account cancellation period has expired, and their <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> with you will have to be closed.</p>

<p>When funds are transferred into a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> from a different type of <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr>, the date of first payment that should be reported to HMRC should be the date the funds were received by the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager.</p>

<p>The account ID used for every new account or fully transferred account that <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> providers report to HMRC must be a new unique account ID that has not been previously used on any other account.</p>

<p>When a customer opens a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> account following the transfer of funds from another <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr>, then the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> managers should wait until all the appropriate paperwork and funds have been received before reporting the account to HMRC.</p>

<p>A report to HMRC to create a new <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> will fail HMRC’s compliance checks if the investor’s previous <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> is still shown as open and has received payments from the investor in the same tax year.</p>

<h2>Transferring a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> account</h2>

<p>The process for transferring a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> is different from the transfer of other types of ISAs. When a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> is transferred the receiving <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager will report the transferred account to HMRC.</p>

<p>The exporting <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager does not report the transferred account to HMRC. When the receiving <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager reports the transfer to HMRC, then HMRC will update its records to show that the investor’s <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> has been transferred.</p>

<p>Following the correct <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> transfer process will enable investors to withdraw funds from their new account for a property purchase 12 months after the date that they paid into their original <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr>, before it was transferred.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> transferred to a new <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> provider will have passed HMRC’s eligibility and compliance checks and these will not be done again.</p>

<p>Bonus claims made and withdrawal charges reported to HMRC by the original <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager will remain linked to the investor’s original manager. This enables them to make any bonus claim corrections to HMRC.</p>

<p>All bonus claims or withdrawal charges after the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> is transferred must be reported to HMRC by the new <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager.</p>

<p>All types of <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> transfers that must be accurately reported to HMRC.</p>

<h3>Transfer a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Account in full</h3>
<p>The importing <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager must report to HMRC after accepting a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> account that is transferred in full.</p>

<p>HMRC will then update the previous manager’s Account ID to show its status is closed and a closure reason of ‘transferred out’.</p>

<p>The exporting <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager should not report the account as closed and must leave it with a status of ‘Open’.</p>

<p>If the exporting <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager reports that their account is closed before the transfer has been reported to HMRC then the original account will have to be reinstated before the transfer can take place.</p>

<p>HMRC cannot correct accounts reported as closed in error by a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> provider.</p>

<p>When a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> is correctly transferred, the date that an investor is eligible for withdrawing funds to purchase their first residential property transfers to their new <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager.</p>

<h3>Reporting a full transfer of current year <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> payments</h3>
<p>You can report a full transfer of current year <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> payments to HMRC in 2 different ways by the importing <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> account ID does not already exist with HMRC then the new account will be created and updated with payment status of active in the current financial year</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> already exists then the account will be updated with payment status of active in the current financial year</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In both cases the original Account ID will remain with a status of open but will be updated with a payment status of ‘Locked’ for the current financial year.</p>

<h3>Reporting a partial transfer of previous year <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> funds</h3>
<p>When this is reported to HMRC by the importing <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager the following will happen.</p>

<p>If an account ID for the new <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> does not already exist with HMRC, then the new account will be created and updated with the payment status depending on the account transferred from.</p>

<p>If the transferred account shows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>‘no payment present’ then the new account will also show ‘no payment present’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>payment status is ‘available’ then the new account will also show payment status ‘available’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>payment status is ‘active’ then the new account will be set to ‘locked’</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> being transferred to already exists then a response will be returned showing that a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> already exists.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Transfers and bonus claims</h3>
<p>When transferring <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> funds the exporting <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager must clearly indicate on the transfer form, which payments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>made by the investor still require a bonus claim to be submitted to HMRC</li>
  <li>have had a bonus claim submitted but the payment has not yet been received from HMRC</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Transfers and withdrawal charges</h3>

<p>When transferring funds the exporting <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager must report and account for any withdrawal charges that have already been deducted from the investor’s <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> to HMRC.</p>

<p>Withdrawal charges deducted can still be reported to HMRC after a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> has been transferred to another <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager.</p>

<p>HMRC will collect the withdrawal charge from the exporting <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager because they managed the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> when the investor made their withdrawal.</p>

<p>The date of the first payment made into a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> after a transfer has completed must not be changed. This can cause the original <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> to be voided by HMRC when it may still have some of the investor’s funds that have not been transferred.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<h3>Full <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> to <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> transfer</h3>

<p>Bonus claim made on 10/4/2018 for £375.00 and paid by HMRC on 24/4/2018</p>

<p>Customer opens and subscribes to a new <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> account on 6/7/2018 with <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager B</p>

<p>2018/19 payments = £1500.00</p>

<p>Bonus claim made on 10/8/2018 for £375.00 and paid by HMRC on 24/8/2018</p>

<p>Customer transfers all funds from <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager A to <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager B on 5/9/2018</p>

<p>In this example no report to HMRC is required because both accounts already exist and the current year payment is already present with <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager B.</p>

<h3>Transferring a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> or funds held in a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> between managers</h3>

<p>A successful transfer of a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> between managers is dependent on the data and the account or payment status all being correct.</p>

<p>If they are not then the report to HMRC of an account transfer will return an unsuccessful response.</p>

<p>The reasons for an unsuccessful transfer response include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an incorrect account ID has been provided by the original <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager instead of the account ID originally reported to HMRC</li>
  <li>an incorrect <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager reference has been provided by the original <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager</li>
  <li>an incorrect <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Investor ID reference has been provided by the original <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager</li>
  <li>a full account transfer has already been reported to HMRC</li>
  <li>the account being transferred is shown as closed because it has been cancelled or voided</li>
  <li>a possible a transfer of Previous Year payments between 2 Open <abbr title="Lifetime ISAs">LISAs</abbr> that does need to be reported to HMRC</li>
  <li>the payment status on the transferred <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> is shown as ‘locked’ which means that the account cannot accept or transfer current year payments</li>
  <li>one of the accounts has been incorrectly reported to HMRC as being closed with all funds withdrawn - if this is incorrect the exporting <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager will need to reinstate their account to allow the importing <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager to carry out the transfer - this can be done using the Create Transfer Account <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If the receiving <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager sees that the data supplied is incorrect then this should be checked with the previous <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager before the transfer is reported to HMRC.</p>

<p>The Transfer Account <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> can only be used to report the transfer of a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr>. It cannot be used to report the transfer of funds from another type of <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> into a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Closing or cancelling a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> account</h2>

<p>An investor can cancel their <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> within 30 days of the date of making their first payment. They can have their funds returned without incurring a withdrawal charge, but they are not entitled to receive a government bonus.</p>

<p>They can open another <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> account in the same financial year with the same or another <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager.</p>

<p>The cancellation of a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> account can still result in the investor’s account receiving a government bonus.</p>

<p>The government bonus may have been already claimed and paid by HMRC within 30 days of the account being opened.</p>

<p>If an investor cancels their account within the 30 day time limit the bonus received will have to be repaid to HMRC as part of the cancellation process. The bonus can be repaid as part of a corrected bonus claim.</p>

<h3>Investor incurring a withdrawal charge</h3>

<p>When investors close their account within the first 30 days but the account is not reported to HMRC as closed a 25% withdrawal charge will apply to the amount withdrawn.</p>

<p>When the account is reported as closed to HMRC the incorrect withdrawal charge will need to be refunded to the investor.</p>

<p><abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers can do this as part of a corrected withdrawal charge report to HMRC via the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>.</p>

<p>If a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> is cancelled by an investor within 30 days any government bonus and withdrawal charges submitted to HMRC after the 20th of each month will need to be reversed in full so that the investor receives all of their original investment back.</p>

<p>When a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> account has a pending government bonus or withdrawal charge that have been reported to HMRC, these will be automatically cancelled in the online service if the cancellation request to HMRC is successful.</p>

<p>‘Pending’ means a government bonus claim which has been successfully submitted by an <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager but has not been paid by HMRC. It also means a withdrawal charge reported to HMRC but the collection process has not started.</p>

<p>When an account is cancelled new bonus claims and withdrawal charges cannot be reported to HMRC for that account. Only corrections can be reported and will be processed by HMRC.</p>

<p>The date of closure of a cancelled <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> cannot be corrected if it is incorrectly reported to HMRC. <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers must ensure that the date of closure is correctly reported to HMRC.</p>

<h2>Closing a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> account</h2>

<p>If an investor closes a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> account more than 30 days after the date of first payment a 25% withdrawal charge must be deducted from the amount withdrawn from the closed account.</p>

<p>Investors are entitled to any bonus claim due to them before they closed their <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> and HMRC will process and pay these government bonuses in the normal way.</p>

<p>When a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> is closed, <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers can still make corrections to previous government claims or withdrawal charges relating to the closed account.</p>

<p>An investor who has closed a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> that they have made payments to in the current financial year cannot open another <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> in the same financial year.</p>

<h2>Updating an investor’s personal details</h2>
<p>An investor’s personal details held by HMRC cannot be updated using the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> digital service.</p>

<p>Investors must contact HMRC or use their Personal Tax Account to tell HMRC about any changes to their personal details.</p>

<h2>How to update the date of first payment</h2>
<p><abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers will need to report to HMRC a change to the date of first payment made by an investor.</p>

<p>This change could be because of an error, or a late first payment made into the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Changing the date of an investor’s first payment could result in the voiding of the account if the investor has a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> with another <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager.</p>

<p><abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers should only change the date of an investor’s first <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> payment if this is to correct an error.</p>

<h2>Reinstating a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>You may need to reinstate a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr>. An account can be closed and reinstated at any time.</p>

<p>The main reasons for reinstating a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the account was closed by accident</li>
  <li>a withdrawal of funds has left a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> account with zero balance that under the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> managers terms and conditions means that the account needs to be closed</li>
  <li>following a failed property purchase withdrawn funds need to be returned to the investor’s closed <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>A request to reinstate a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> does not require any additional data to be sent to HMRC.</p>

<p>HMRC will check to see if the reinstatement request can be processed. HMRC records the current status of an account and does not keep a history of a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> closing and subsequently being reinstated.</p>

<h2>Claims and charges on <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> accounts</h2>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> managers are able to submit monthly government bonus claims to HMRC.</p>

<p><abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers can claim government bonuses from HMRC after the normal reporting deadline when any investor identity or account errors have been resolved.</p>

<p>When an <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager needs to make a retrospective bonus claim for any reason they should claim the bonus in the normal way using the correct data for the original claim period.</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Bonus claims can be made to HMRC or corrected by an <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager within 6 years after the end of the original bonus claim period. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>anything which should have been included in the original bonus claim, but was not</li>
  <li>anything which should not have been included in the original bonus claim, but was</li>
  <li>any other error that occurred in the original claim</li>
</ul>

<h3>Claiming a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> government bonus</h3>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> managers must be able to submit a bonus claim for each of their eligible investors to HMRC.</p>

<p>HMRC’s online service will send a digital response back to your software.</p>

<p>When a successful bonus claim is made HMRC will send a transaction ID to be stored in your software that can be used for reference purposes.</p>

<p>Bonus claims can be submitted to HMRC at any time, but the deadline for making a monthly bonus claim to HMRC is the 20th day of the month following the end of the claim period. A monthly bonus claim for the period ending 5 May 2019 should be submitted to HMRC by 20 May 2019.</p>

<p>A bonus claim submitted after 20 May will still be processed by HMRC but the response from HMRC will be marked as a late claim.</p>

<p>An investor could receive bonus payments in any one year totalling £1,000.12.</p>

<p>The Bonus claim function <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> enables <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>claim a new bonus payment</li>
  <li>correct a previous bonus claim during the reporting period when it was initially reported</li>
  <li>correct a bonus claim after the claim reporting period has ended</li>
  <li>repay any overpaid bonus amounts to HMRC — HMRC’s priority order for reclaiming bonus payments is to reclaim money from the investor’s <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> account and then any remaining debt from the investor directly</li>
  <li>receive additional bonus payments arising from corrected bonus claims</li>
</ul>

<p>When retrospective bonus claims are submitted to HMRC the claim period must refer to when the payments were received from investors not the current claim period.</p>

<p>If an <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager needs to make a second correction to a bonus claim they should contact HMRC for advice before submitting a second correction.</p>

<h2>Withdrawal charges</h2>

<p>A 25% withdrawal charge must be applied when an investor withdraws funds for a non-Life event.</p>

<p>A withdrawal charge is deducted from the amount withdrawn from a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> account. The charge should always be deducted at the time when the investor withdraws funds from their <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> account.</p>

<p>There may be situations when the withdrawal charge can only be calculated after a withdrawal has been made for example when funds withdrawn for a failed house purchase are not subsequently returned to an investor’s <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr>.</p>

<p>When a withdrawal charge is incorrectly calculated and deducted, <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers can report a superseded withdrawal charge to HMRC to reduce the original withdrawal charge made or receive a full refund of an incorrect withdrawal charge.</p>

<h3>Reporting withdrawal charges to HMRC</h3>
<p>Withdrawal charges must be individually reported to HMRC for each of your investors, they can be done at any time.</p>

<p>Each withdrawal charge submission is processed separately and HMRC will send a transaction ID to be stored in your software to be used for reference purposes.</p>

<p>The monthly period for reporting withdrawal charges to HMRC ends the 20th day of the month following the end of the claim period for example a withdrawal charge report for the period ending 6 May 2019 should be submitted to HMRC by 20 May 2019.</p>

<p>The monthly period for reporting withdrawal charges to HMRC and the deadline for submitting the report to HMRC is the same as the period for claiming government bonus payments from HMRC.</p>

<p>A withdrawal charge report submitted after 20 May will be processed by HMRC but will be marked as a late report in the response from HMRC.</p>

<h2>HMRC’s processing of bonus claims and withdrawal charges</h2>

<h3>HMRC’s financial processing is split into several sections:</h3>

<p>Making payments to the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Government bonus payments paid by HMRC to an <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager</li>
  <li>repayment paid by HMRC to the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager of reduced withdrawal charges that has previously been collected by HMRC</li>
  <li>refunding full withdrawal charge to an <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager which have already been collected by HMRC</li>
</ul>

<p>Collecting debts from the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>withdrawal charges from an <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager</li>
  <li>reduced bonus payments already paid by HMRC from the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager</li>
  <li>a fully reversed bonus requests already paid by HMRC from the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager</li>
</ul>

<p>Collecting debts from the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> investor directly include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>withdrawal charges directly from the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> investor due to insufficient funds in the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager’s account</li>
  <li>reduced bonus payments directly from the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> investor due to insufficient funds in the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager’s account</li>
  <li>a fully reversed bonus request directly from the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> investor due to insufficient funds in the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager’s account</li>
</ul>

<h3>Government bonus payments to <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers</h3>

<p>Bonus payments are paid in a single payment by HMRC for each monthly claim period. Payments include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>new government bonus payment requests</li>
  <li>corrected government bonus payment requests when an additional bonus is due</li>
  <li>corrected withdrawal charges when part of an incorrect withdrawal charge needs to be refunded</li>
</ul>

<p>Monthly payments made by HMRC is an automated process and a single payment will be made for successful bonus payments that are due.</p>

<p>Bonus claims reported to HMRC after the end of the monthly reporting period will be not be paid until the end of the next monthly reporting period.</p>

<h3>HMRC’s payment to <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers of government bonus claims</h3>

<p>Following checking and any necessary correcting by HMRC, successful bonus claims will be paid within 14 days after the due date the claim was due.</p>

<p>Payments will always be made by BACS to the bank account provide by <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> managers when they applied to HMRC for approval for offer <abbr title="Lifetime ISAs">LISAs</abbr> to investors.</p>

<p>If HMRC receives a BACS rejection notification after issuing a bonus payment to an <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager, then HMRC will contact the <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager to confirm the bank details provided are still correct.</p>

<p>Any payment processing failure by HMRC’s will be investigated and HMRC will attempt to make the payment 3 times before informing an <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager there is a problem preventing their bonus claim being paid.</p>

<h3>Other payments that can be made to <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> managers</h3>

<p>If an investor successfully appeals to HMRC against an incorrect withdrawal charge HMRC will make a separate BACS payment to a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager’s bank account.</p>

<p>The payment will not be included with an <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager’s usual monthly bonus payment.</p>

<h2>Collecting withdrawal charges from <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> managers</h2>

<p>Withdrawal charges reported to HMRC by <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> managers will be collected as a single Direct Debit payment. The amount collected will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>new withdrawal charges reported to HMRC</li>
  <li>corrected withdrawal charges where a further charge needs to be paid to HMRC</li>
  <li>corrected bonus claims when an incorrectly claimed bonus needs to be repaid to HMRC</li>
</ul>

<h3>Collecting withdrawal charges from <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers</h3>
<p>The collection of withdrawal charges by Direct Debit is an automated monthly process.</p>

<p>HMRC processes all withdrawal charge transactions and prepares the direct debit for collection after the 19th day of each month.</p>

<p>The direct debit is collected 14 days after the 20th of each month.</p>

<p>During this period, <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers can check the total amount that will be collected by Direct Debit.</p>

<p>HMRC will issue an advance notice to an <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager’s liaison officer 3 business days before the Direct Debit that will be collected. The notice will confirm the amount that will be collected by Direct Debit.</p>

<h3>Collecting withdrawal charges from <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Investors</h3>

<p>After the reporting period ends on the 19th day of the month HMRC will process all debt transactions.</p>

<p>HMRC will split a withdrawal charge due between the <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager and the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> investor, if there’s insufficient funds in the investor’s account to pay all of the withdrawal charge.</p>

<p><abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers are only liable for withdrawal charges that have been deducted when a withdrawal was made or can be deducted from funds held in an investor’s account.</p>

<p><abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers are not responsible for paying a withdrawal charge to HMRC when the balance of an investor’s account is zero or the account has been closed.</p>

<p>When a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> investor is liable for paying a withdrawal charge, HMRC contact the investor about paying the withdrawal charge.</p>

<p>When an investor’s account has been transferred to a new <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager and the original <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager makes a correction that will result in a payment due to HMRC then they should show the ‘auto-recovery amount’ to be collect from them as zero.</p>

<h3>Corrected bonus or withdrawal charges</h3>

<p><abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers should correct any bonus claims or withdrawal charges as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If a correction is made to a bonus claim by a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager before it has been processed, HMRC will replace the original bonus claim with the corrected claim.</p>

<p>HMRC monitors the number of bonus claim corrections made by <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> managers and may ask a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> managers to explain why frequent corrections are being made to their bonus claims.</p>

<h2>Property purchases</h2>

<p>The purchase of an investor’s first residential property must be reported to HMRC. <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers must report to HMRC when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>funds are withdrawn from a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> for a first property purchase</li>
  <li>a conveyancer askes for an extension to the 90 day time limit for completing the purchase of an investor’s first property</li>
  <li>an investor’s property purchase has completed successfully or has failed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Releasing funds to an investor’s conveyancer</h3>

<p>When an <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager receives all the appropriate paperwork from an investor’s conveyancer requesting funds to be withdrawn from the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> they must report this to HMRC.</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> managers must be able to report all property purchase using funds in a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> to HMRC. Every submission will be processed by HMRC who will provide a response back to your software. Every successful submission to HMRC will result in a Life event ID being sent back to your software.</p>

<p><abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers can tell HMRC about a change to the amount withdrawn from a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> or the date of the withdrawal.</p>

<p><abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers cannot report a change to the property being purchased or an investor’s conveyancer to HMRC.</p>

<p>When a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager makes an incorrect report to HMRC of a release of <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> funds for a house purchase, then the outcome of the house purchase needs to reported to HMRC as ‘Failed’. Then a correct report should be made to HMRC as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Reporting an extension to the property purchase time limit</h3>

<p>There is a 90 day time limit for completing a property purchase using funds withdrawn from a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr>.</p>

<p>When this deadline cannot be met the investor’s conveyancer must contact the <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> account manager for an extension to the time limit to allow the purchase to continue.</p>

<p>There can be a maximum of a further 90 days extension to complete the property purchase.</p>

<p>No further extensions can be applied for and all funds must be returned to the investor’s account if the property purchase cannot completed within 180 days of the funds being withdrawn from the investor’s <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> managers should use the same life event ID that was returned by HMRC when reporting extensions to the time limit that have been granted for completing the investor’s house purchase.</p>

<h3>Notifying HMRC of the outcome of a property purchase</h3>

<p>When the purchase of a property using funds withdrawn from a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> is successful or unsuccessful then the investor’s conveyancer must inform the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager within 10 working days of the final outcome.</p>

<p>The life event ID that was returned by HMRC when the withdrawal of <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> funds was reported must also be also be used to report the outcome of a property purchase.</p>

<p>If HMRC is not notified that an investor’s property purchase has failed then future withdrawals of <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> funds to purchase another property will not be permitted.</p>

<p><abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers can report the following changes to property purchase notifications sent to HMRC:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the event date</li>
  <li>the purchase value</li>
  <li>the outcome</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers cannot report to HMRC changes to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the property details</li>

</ul>

<h2>First payment date</h2>

<p>The opening date of a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> is the first payment made when an account is opened by an investor. <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers report this date to HMRC when creating their investor’s new account.</p>

<p>Investors can open and contribute to a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> each tax year. An investor who has more than one <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> can only contribute to one <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> each tax year.</p>

<p>The date of first payment made in every tax year is reported to HMRC on a monthly bonus claim or on a report of an account transfer. This becomes the first entry in the payment table.</p>

<p>The date of the first payment made by an investor each tax year cannot be changed and will be checked every time a bonus claim is made to HMRC.</p>

<p>Only the date of the very first payment made by an investor when a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> was opened can be corrected by an <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager.</p>

<p>The ‘real time’ reporting of <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> payments to HMRC ensures that investors cannot contribute to more than one <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> in the same tax year.</p>

<p>The date of first payment made by an investor each tax year is held within HMRC’s records as follows:</p>

<p>A <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> payment status can have 5 possible options:</p>

<h3>‘Active’ payment status</h3>
<p>An account has an active status when it has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>received a payment for the first time</li>
  <li>received a contribution from the investor in the tax year</li>
</ul>

<p>When the first bonus claim is made in the tax year then, a new payment entry is created for that tax year with an automatic date of 06/04/YYYY. This means that the account for which a bonus claim is made has received a contribution from the investor and can accept further contributions during the tax year.</p>

<h3>‘Locked’ payment status</h3>
<p>An account has a locked payment status when it has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not received a contribution from the investor in the tax year but HMRC has been notified that the investor has contributed to another <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>when a bonus claim on another <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> is made to HMRC during the current tax year</li>
</ul>

<h3>‘Void’ payment status</h3>
<p>A <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> has a status of void when the account should not have been opened</p>

<p>Only if the account can be reinstated will the payment status be changed either to Available (it can accept funds) or Locked (it cannot accept any funds).</p>

<h3>‘Available’ payment status</h3>

<p>An account has the status of ‘Available’ when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a bonus claim made by another <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Manager was cancelled and repaid in full to HMRC</li>
  <li>an investor had other <abbr title="Lifetime ISAs">LISAs</abbr> at the time that a bonus claim on another account was cancelled</li>
</ul>

<p>When the bonus claim made on an investor’s <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> account with another <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager was subsequently cancelled and repaid in full to HMRC then the payment status of the account is changed from ‘Active’ to ‘Available’.</p>

<p>If an investor has other <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> accounts at the time that the bonus claim was cancelled then their payment status is changed from ‘Locked’ to ‘Available’. This can only be done if the first bonus claim is cancelled and repaid in full.</p>

<p>If a second bonus claim is successfully requested on the same <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> account then the payment status cannot be changed until the next tax year.</p>

<h3>‘Cancelled’ payment status</h3>

<p>An account has a status of cancelled when the account has been closed by a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager</p>

<p>If the status of an account is cancelled it cannot be reinstated. The investor can open another <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> in the same tax year if they are eligible for a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> and have not contributed to another <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> account in the tax year.</p>

<h3>First payment shown as 6 April each year</h3>

<p>The date of first payment into a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> each tax year is checked to identify which <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> was contributed to first by the investor. Using the 6 April as the date of the first payment stops any bonus claims being made on another <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> that the same investor contributes to in the same tax year.</p>

<p>The actual date of first payment into a new <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> each tax year can be any date.</p>

<h2>Submitting end of year <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> information returns</h2>

<p>HMRC collects <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> account information data from <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers through the annual completion and submission of the ISACOM100 return to HMRC.</p>

<p>Lifetime ISAs must not be included on the ISAComm100 return of <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> account information. Lifetime ISAs are reported monthly on the Lifetime <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> Application Programming Interface (<abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>).</p>

<p><abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers can view the account data submitted to HMRC to check its accuracy and make any corrections.</p>

<p>The normal deadlines for reporting this <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> information returns to HMRC are the same for <abbr title="Lifetime ISAs">LISAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>The annual reporting of <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> statistical information to HMRC is done on the appropriate ISA14a form in the same way as other ISAs.</p>

<p>Information about Cash only <abbr title="Lifetime ISAs">LISAs</abbr> and Stocks and Shares <abbr title="Lifetime ISAs">LISAs</abbr> should be reported separately to HMRC.</p>

<p>The market value of each account on the 5 April should include all government bonuses paid and received. Any pending government bonuses not received from HMRC should not be included.</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> providers can only report or correct a single submission for each account for each tax year.</p>

<p>There are 2 exceptions to this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if an original account submission to HMRC had a positive market or payment value that now needs to be changed to £nil, then an <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager needs to report a new submission to HMRC with the market or payment value showing zeros</li>
  <li>if an original submission has any values that are incorrect then <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers must correct the original submission with zero entries. This will delete the original submission made to HMRC</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example 1 — fully correct a submission to all zeros</h3>

<p>Original 2018 to 2019 submission:</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Cash market value = £4000.00</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Stocks and shares market value = £0.00</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Cash annual subs = £5050.00</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Stocks and shares annual subs = £0.00</p>

<p>Correct the original submission with all subs and market equal to zeros</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Cash market value = £0.00</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Stocks and shares market value = £0.00</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Cash annual subs = £0.00</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Stocks and shares annual subs = £0.00</p>

<p>Then submit a NEW original submission with all subs and market equal to zeros</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Cash market value = £0.00</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Stocks and shares market value = £0.00</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Cash annual subs = £0.00</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Stocks and shares annual subs = £0.00</p>

<h3>Example 2 — fully delete a submission</h3>

<p>Original 2018 to 19 submission:</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Cash market value = £4000.00</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Stocks and shares market value = £0.00</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Cash annual subs = £5050.00</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Stocks and shares annual subs = £0.00</p>

<p>Correct the original submission with all subs and market equal to zeros</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Cash market value = £0.00</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Stocks and shares market value = £0.00</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Cash annual subs = £0.00</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Stocks and shares annual subs = £0.00</p>

<p>Then do not submit a NEW submission for the same tax year — the correction will delete the original submission in this specific scenario.</p>

<h2>Viewing <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> data held by HMRC</h2>

<p>All data reported by <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> providers is retained by HMRC. Data is only updated following <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> activity reported to HMRC.</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> data reported to HMRC is stored in several data tables.</p>

<p>They are the <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>account (including the current year contributions and opening dates of first payment)</li>
  <li>bonus request</li>
  <li>withdrawal charge</li>
  <li>life event (death or terminal illness, property purchases and statutory submissions)</li>
</ul>

<p>HMRC creates new data for the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager’s bulk financial position (including bulk payments and bulk debts)</li>
  <li>investor’s debt position for each transaction reported to HMRC</li>
  <li>investor’s payment position for each transaction reported to HMRC</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this data is accessible through the appropriate <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>. The personal data of each investor is stored as part of HMRC’s taxpayer record and for data security reasons cannot be shared.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> account data</h3>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> providers can view the account data they submitted to HMRC when reporting each account. They can also see the account’s current status and the payment status for the current tax year.</p>

<p>This enables <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers to check the account status of a void account prior to making a bonus claim and the payment status of an account before accepting new payments from an investor.</p>

<h3>Viewing <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> bonus request data</h3>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> managers can view their bonus request data sent to HMRC. They can also see the data sent to HMRC to correct their original bonus claim submission.</p>

<p><abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers can check that their bonus requests are accurate and correct up to midnight on the 19th day of each month.</p>

<p>A corrected bonus claim creates a debt due to HMRC. If the amount due to HMRC exceeds the amount being claimed by a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager then it’s possible that this may result in no bonus payment being made by HMRC.</p>

<h3>Viewing <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> withdrawal charge data</h3>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> managers can view the withdrawal charge data they send to HMRC including any data sent to correct original submissions.</p>

<p>A corrected withdrawal charge submitted to HMRC may result in a bonus payment being due to an <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager from HMRC.</p>

<h3>Viewing <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> Life Event data</h3>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> managers can view the Life Event data submitted to HMRC including when reporting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>death and terminal illness</li>
  <li>the release of funds for a property purchase</li>
  <li>an extension to the property purchase completion deadline</li>
  <li>the completion or failure of a property purchase</li>
  <li>a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> End of year return of information for each investor</li>
</ul>

<p>This enables <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> providers to ensure that the data submitted to HMRC is accurate and correct at all times.</p>

<h2>Viewing <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> life event property purchase data</h2>

<p>All data regarding a property purchase reported to HMRC is stored for the appropriate Life Event ID’s returned under the ‘purchase fund release’ Life Event ID.</p>

<p>When a call is made to view the ‘purchase fund release’ Life Event ID HMRC will send a response and will confirm if the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>purchase extension 1 has been approved then this data will be included in the response (Life Event ID 0000000002)</li>
  <li>purchase extension 2 has been approved then this data will be included in the response (Life Event ID 0000000003)</li>
  <li>purchase result has been approved then this data will be included in the response (Life Event ID 0000000004)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>This table shows a property purchase withdrawal where the deadline has been extended twice and has been reported to HMRC. <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> managers can see all of the house purchase data reported to HMRC.</p>

<h2>Viewing <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> financial data</h2>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> bonus claims are always paid in bulk by HMRC.</p>

<p>A bulk bonus payment is made by HMRC when a bonus claim and all corrections requiring further payment are processed.</p>

<p><abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers must be able to accurately reconcile bonus payments from HMRC.</p>

<p>HMRC stores some of the original bonus request data within the financial system. This is stored along with any new information so that <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> managers can see each investor’s payment and which bulk payment it was part of.</p>

<p><abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers can call the Get Bulk payment or Get Bulk debt <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>’s to view their bulk payment information.</p>

<p><abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers must specify the date range that they want to view. HMRC will return the following bulk payment or debt owed data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>payment or debt reference number</li>
  <li>payment or debt amount</li>
  <li>payment or debt due date</li>
  <li>bulk payment or debt paid date</li>
</ul>

<p>When HMRC processes a bulk BACS payment a unique reference number is allocated to the payment. This payment document number is an 11 character reference that is included on the payment made into the <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager’s bank account.</p>

<p>When <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers submit new or corrected bonus requests to HMRC they must store the transaction ID returned by HMRC.</p>

<p>If a <abbr title="Lifetime ISA">LISA</abbr> manager is unsure if a bonus has been submitted to HMRC they can request the bonus again. HMRC will identify and not process a duplicated bonus claim. The transaction ID of the duplicated bonus request will be returned instead.</p>

<p><abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers can call the ‘Get payment details’ for a bonus claim or withdrawal charge <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>. They will need to include the Account ID and the Transaction ID for the transaction that they want to check.</p>

<p><abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers may receive a response from HMRC showing that the transaction:</p>

<ul>
  <li>was cancelled or voided because the account was cancelled or voided</li>
  <li>was superseded by another more recent transaction</li>
  <li>is pending and has not been processed yet</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bonus claims or withdrawal charges resulting in a payment to an <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager:</h3>

<p>HMRC will return a response showing the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bulk payment reference number</li>
  <li>amount of the bonus paid for the investor</li>
  <li>date of that bulk payment was paid</li>
  <li>due date of the bulk payment if it is shown as pending</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bonus claims or withdrawal charges resulting in a debt due to HMRC</h3>

<p>HMRC will return a response showing the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>payment reference for the debt to be collected by HMRC</li>
  <li>amount due to HMRC</li>
  <li>date the debt was collected</li>
  <li>due date if the debt has not been collected by HMRC</li>
</ul>

<h2>Appealing a decision</h2>

<p>When an investor’s government bonus claim is rejected or they incur a withdrawal charge, they have a right of appeal to HMRC against the decision. HMRC will send a response to <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> managers showing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a government bonus claim has been rejected</li>
  <li>a government bonus needs to be repaid to HMRC</li>
  <li>a withdrawal charge is due</li>
  <li>a withdrawal charge is due because there was a shortfall in the funds returned to an <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager following a failed first time residential purchase</li>
</ul>

<p>Investors must appeal within 30 days after the date that they receive notification of HMRC’s decision. An investor’s appeal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>must be made in writing</li>
  <li>must specify the grounds of appeal</li>
  <li>must include sufficient information to identify the investor making the appeal and the decision against which the appeal is being made</li>
  <li>must be signed, or authenticated in another way approved by HMRC, by or on behalf of the appellant</li>
</ul>

<p>Appeals must be sent to:</p>
