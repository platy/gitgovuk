<p>Safeguarding broadly means avoiding harm to people or the environment. Since early 2018, the FCDO has been focused on safeguarding against Sexual Exploitation and Abuse and Sexual Harassment (<abbr title="sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr>) in the international aid sector.</p>

<p>Our goal is to ensure all those involved in poverty reduction take all reasonable steps to prevent harm, particularly <abbr title="sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr>, from occurring; listen to those who are affected; respond sensitively but robustly when harm or allegations of harm occur; and learn from every case.</p>

<p>The FCDO’s work on <abbr title="sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr> looks at both the FCDO and the partners we fund with Official Development Assistance (ODA) to deliver development and humanitarian programmes around the world, often with vulnerable people.</p>

<p>In September 2020 the FCDO launched a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-strategy-safeguarding-against-sexual-exploitation-and-abuse-and-sexual-harassment-within-the-aid-sector">UK Strategy on safeguarding</a> against sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment in the aid sector that applies to all UK Official Development Assistance (ODA) spend. This strategy explains what UK government departments that engage in ODA will do to improve safeguarding standards internally, in partner organisations, and across the whole international aid sector. All UK government ODA spending departments signed up to the strategy.</p>

<p>This site provides an overview of the FCDO’s work and points to guidance for those working in the aid sector on how to safeguard their people and programmes.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>At the FCDO we use the UN definitions for SEAH:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>sexual exploitation: any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust for sexual purposes. Includes profiting momentarily, socially, or politically from sexual exploitation of another. Under UN regulations it includes transactional sex, solicitation of transactional sex and exploitative relationship.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sexual abuse: the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. It should cover sexual assault (attempted rape, kissing / touching, forcing someone to perform oral sex / touching) as well as rape. Under UN regulations, all sexual activity with someone under the age of 18 is considered to be sexual abuse.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sexual harassment: a continuum of unacceptable and unwelcome behaviours and practices of a sexual nature that may include, but are not limited to, sexual suggestions or demands, requests for sexual favours and sexual, verbal or physical conduct or gestures, that are or might reasonably be perceived as offensive or humiliating.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>FCDO’s safeguarding standards</h2>
<p>The FCDO expects all partners we work with to take all reasonable steps to safeguard the people they come into contact with (including staff and the communities in which programmes are delivered) from <abbr title="sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr>. The FCDO holds ourselves to at least the same high standards we expect of our partners.</p>

<p>Along with other OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donors, we adhere to 2 sets of international minimum standards on tackling <abbr title="sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/system/files/3_minimum_operating_standards_mos-psea.pdf" rel="external">Inter-Agency Standing Committee Minimum Operating Standards on Preventing Sexual Exploitation and Abuse</a>
</li>
  <li>the relevant elements of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://corehumanitarianstandard.org/files/files/Core%20Humanitarian%20Standard%20-%20English.pdf" rel="external">The Core Humanitarian Standard on Quality and Accountability</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>For partners under an accountable grant or MoU, these standards are reflected in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfid-enhanced-due-diligence-safeguarding-for-external-partners">Safeguarding against <abbr title="sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr> Due Diligence guidance</a>. All FCDO partners delivering a programme via an accountable grant or MoU will have their capability on safeguarding against sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment (<abbr title="sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr>) examined as part of the overall FCDO Due Diligence process.</p>

<p>For partners under a contract, the standards are reflected in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/750988/Supply-Partner-Code-August-2018.pdf" rel="external">Supply Partner Code of Conduct and Terms and Conditions</a>. The Supply Partner Code of Conduct will also apply to partners with whom the FCDO has an accountable grant from late 2019.</p>

<p>Overview of the 6 key <abbr title="sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr> safeguarding areas in the FCDO’s due diligence guidance.</p>

<p>The principles that FCDO is committed to applying in relation to safeguarding against <abbr title="sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr> and that we expect our partners to apply in their work and through their delivery chains are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>everyone has responsibility for safeguarding</li>
  <li>do no harm</li>
  <li>organisations have a safeguarding duty of care to beneficiaries and other stakeholders, staff and volunteers, as well as to children and adults-at-risk who may be directly or indirectly delivering or impacted by the programme and may be vulnerable to abuse</li>
  <li>act with integrity, be transparent and accountable</li>
  <li>all activity is done in the best interests of the child/at risk person in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Children Act 1989, FCDO defines a child as any individual under the age of 18 regardless of the age of majority/consent in a given country</li>
  <li>all children and adults shall be treated equally, irrespective of sexual orientation, gender identity and expression and sex characteristics (SOGIESC); religion/or none; race; ethnicity; disability; or any other protected characteristic as listed in the Equality Act (2010)</li>
  <li>organisations that work with children and adults at risk should apply a safeguarding lens to their promotional communications and fundraising activities</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to report a safeguarding concern to the FCDO</h2>

<p>If you are in immediate danger, call the police if safe to do so or your relevant security team.</p>

<p>Any concerns about sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment (<abbr title="sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr>) relating to FCDO staff or programmes should be reported to the FCDO’s dedicated Safeguarding Investigations Team via:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:reportingconcerns@fcdo.gov.uk">reportingconcerns@fcdo.gov.uk</a></li>
  <li>telephone +44 1355 843747.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are unsure whether to report a concern, then please contact us via the email address above for advice.</p>

<p>It is possible to report concerns anonymously and the FCDO will treat all reported concerns in confidence. We will consider whether onward referral is appropriate. In some cases this could be to the National Crime Agency (NCA), Charity Commission, police or other relevant authority.</p>

<p>The FCDO expects its programme partners to have mechanisms in place to prevent <abbr title="sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr>, to facilitate reporting and also to respond sensitively but robustly when cases are reported.</p>

<h2>The FCDO’s commitments on safeguarding</h2>

<p>The FCDO is holding ourselves to at least the same high standards we expect of our partners on safeguarding against <abbr title="sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr>.</p>

<h3>UK <abbr title="sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr> Safeguarding Strategy</h3>
<p>In September 2020 the FCDO launched a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-strategy-safeguarding-against-sexual-exploitation-and-abuse-and-sexual-harassment-within-the-aid-sector">UK Strategy on safeguarding against sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment in the aid sector</a> that applies to all UK Official Development Assistance (ODA) spend. This strategy explains what UK government departments that engage in ODA will do to improve safeguarding standards internally, in partner organisations, and across the whole international aid sector. All UK government ODA spending departments signed up to the strategy.</p>

<h3>Donor commitments from the Safeguarding Summit</h3>
<p>Twenty-two donors, including all UK government departments who spend Official Development Assistance, signed up to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/donors-commitments-to-tackle-sexual-exploitation-and-abuse-and-sexual-harassment-in-the-international-aid-sector">commitments</a> at the 18 October 2018 Safeguarding Summit. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safeguarding-summit-one-year-on-progress-reports">Donors agreed to report back on progress</a>.</p>

<h3>DAC Recommendation on Ending Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Harassment in Development Co-operation and Humanitarian Assistance</h3>
<p>In July 2019, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-5020" rel="external">The Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Recommendation on Ending Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Harassment in Development Co-operation and Humanitarian Assistance</a> was adopted. It provides a coherent framework for aid agencies and their implementing partners to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment (<abbr title="sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr>) and respond better if it does occur.</p>

<p>The Recommendation is a strong signal that <abbr title="sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr> in the aid sector will not be tolerated. The recommendation was developed by a small team co-chaired by the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO), Ireland and Austria and working with the DAC Secretariat. It has been endorsed by all 30 DAC members and will be monitored through the DAC peer review mechanism.</p>

<h2>Employment cycle initiatives</h2>

<p>The FCDO is supporting 3 initiatives focused on the employment cycle which aim to prevent perpetrators moving around the aid sector undetected and improve information sharing between organisations and with law enforcement.</p>

<h3>Project Soteria</h3>

<p>FCDO, in partnership with INTERPOL established Project SOTERIA, focused on the criminal aspects of sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment in the international aid sector. The project seeks to establish an advanced level of collaboration between law enforcement agencies and aid sector organizations in order to prevent sexual offenders from using their positions to access and offend against children and vulnerable adults. It aims to work initially in Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Nepal, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia .The project includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>capacity building for law enforcement: enhancing the capacity of law enforcement to use more effectively criminal record keeping to manage sex offenders as well as increase their awareness and understanding on the issue of sexual abuse in the context of aid work</li>
  <li>information sharing and notices: promoting the use of INTERPOL Green and Purple Notices to disseminate intelligence internationally and reinforce border management capacity to assess and use this information to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse</li>
  <li>criminal analysis and investigative support: developing a central understanding of the nature, location and patterns of sexual abuse and exploitation by aid sector staff with the ultimate goal to inform prevention and response measures</li>
  <li>assistance to the aid sector: building bridges for cross-sector collaboration between the aid sector and law enforcement communities to jointly address the threat</li>
  <li>threat identification scheme (TIS) pilot: offering the possibility to selected pilot aid sector organizations to send INTERPOL information on their newly-hired candidates to identify individuals that could pose a risk to vulnerable adults and children</li>
  <li>digital solutions: using a Global Knowledge Hub platform to provide a space to share non-operational, non-personal data; distributing the INTERPOL Baseline (list of hashes of Child Abuse images) to the aid sector and supporting its usage</li>
</ul>

<h3>Misconduct Disclosure Scheme</h3>
<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.schr.info/the-misconduct-disclosure-scheme" rel="external">Inter-Agency Scheme for the Disclosure of Safeguarding-related Misconduct in Recruitment Process within the Humanitarian and Development Sector</a> provides a framework for organisations working in the aid sector to share information about someone’s sexual misconduct during employment via a disclosure form. Signatories to the scheme are able to do this while respecting relevant legal and regulatory requirements. The sharing of this information has the potential to prevent perpetrators of <abbr title="sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr> from moving around the aid sector.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.schr.info/implementation-data" rel="external">Implementation data</a> on the Misconduct Disclosure Scheme.</p>

<h3>Aid Worker Registration Scheme</h3>
<p>The aim of the Aid Worker Registration Scheme is to close the loop on individuals who work in the sector but abuse others, whilst equipping those who conduct themselves appropriately with a trusted source of evidence that details their positive work history.</p>

<p>The steering committee for this project commissioned a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/aid-worker-registration-scheme-legal-review">legal review</a> to guide progress, which was published in July 2020.</p>

<h2>Safeguarding during COVID-19</h2>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is global and unprecedented in scale. In past epidemics safeguarding risks have increased and therefore it is vital that efforts to safeguard against <abbr title="sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr> should be seen as lifesaving, not optional. Sectors that are scaling up as part of the response such as health, humanitarian, social protection, education and infrastructure need to be especially vigilant to the risk of <abbr title="sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr> increasing and proactive in ensuring that it is a central component of the coordinated response.</p>

<p>The FCDO has developed guidance notes on COVID-19 for FCDO staff and implementing partners on how to prevent and address <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/884513/Guidance-Note.pdf"><abbr title="sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr> in programmes during COVID-19</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">187 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">4 pages</span>)</span> and how to ensure that safeguarding is embedded in <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/885678/RSH-helpdesk-guidance-note.pdf">programmes providing COVID-19 assistance </a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">224 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">5 pages</span>)</span>. It describes who is at increased risk of <abbr title="sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr> and provides practical suggestions for programme managers on what concrete actions they can take when working with partners to address <abbr title="sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr> in situations such as lockdown or rapid expansion of humanitarian action. There is further guidance signposted via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://safeguardingsupporthub.org/covid/" rel="external">Resource and Support Hub</a>.</p>
