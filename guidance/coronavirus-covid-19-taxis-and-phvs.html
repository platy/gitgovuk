<p>Follow this guidance even if you have been vaccinated. You could still spread coronavirus (COVID-19) to others.</p>

<p>This guidance only applies in England.</p>

<p>Passengers should be advised to plan ahead and ensure they understand and comply with the rules for the whole of their journey if they are crossing from England into one of the other UK nations. Operators should make themselves aware of the rules that could impact cross-border services and where possible inform passengers, or remind passengers to make themselves aware of these.</p>

<p>Check the guidance for the other UK nations:</p>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19">Scotland</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus" rel="external">Wales</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Drivers</h2>

<h2>Carrying out a COVID-19 risk assessment – drivers</h2>

<p>As a self-employed driver of a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/vehicles">vehicle</a> you should conduct a risk assessment to understand the risks and what you can do about them. You should think about how you work and ways you can protect yourself and your passengers.</p>

<p>PHV operators and taxi intermediaries must also <a href="#phv-operators-and-taxi-intermediaries" class="govuk-link">carry out a risk assessment in line with government guidance</a> for their workers.</p>

<p>Regular testing is recommended as part of a risk assessment. Everyone in England can receive regular tests and as a vehicle driver who comes into contact with members of the public you should consider getting tested regularly.</p>

<p><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/regular-rapid-coronavirus-tests-if-you-do-not-have-symptoms/">Follow the guidance regarding testing</a>.</p>

<p>It is also recommended that you consider getting vaccinated, or have a booster, if you have not already done so. <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/" class="govuk-link">Information about vaccines is available from the NHS</a>.</p>

<p>As part of the risk assessment you undertake, it may be decided to install a safety screen behind the front row seats to separate drivers from passengers in the rear of the vehicle. The decision on whether to use a screen rests with you or your operator/intermediary and the local licensing authority. If it is decided to fit one, guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-safety-screens-for-taxis-and-phvs" class="govuk-link">how to choose and fit a screen safely in a vehicle</a> is available.</p>

<p>To help control the spread of COVID-19, drivers should download and use the <a href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NHS COVID-19 app</a>.</p>

<h2>In the vehicle</h2>

<p>Before a passenger enters your vehicle, you should ask if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">have COVID-19 symptoms</a> – a fever, new cough or loss of smell or taste</li>
  <li>are self-isolating</li>
</ul>

<p>You can refuse service if they have.</p>

<p>You must continue to provide support to passengers with disabilities to safely enter and exit your vehicle. You must continue to assist passengers with disabilities with their luggage and mobility equipment.</p>

<p>COVID-19 spreads through the air by droplets and aerosols that are exhaled from the nose and mouth of an infected person.</p>

<p>Open windows when carrying passengers and/or use the vehicle’s vents to bring in fresh air from outside. You should not use the recirculated air option for the vehicle’s ventilation system when carrying passengers.</p>

<p>There is no longer a legal requirement to wear a face covering. The government suggests that you continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet.</p>

<p>Your licensing authority or operator may ask you to wear a face covering. You should follow their guidance if it does not affect your ability to drive safely.</p>

<p>When people choose to wear a face covering, it should fit tightly around their nose and mouth and contain multiple layers. Wearing the highest quality face covering available to them will provide greater protection.</p>

<p>When wearing a face covering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is important to wash or sanitise your hands before and after touching your face covering</li>
  <li>use a ‘black bag’ waste bin or litter bin to dispose of it – you should not put face coverings in a recycling bin or drop them as litter</li>
  <li>be mindful that a face covering may inhibit communication with people who rely on lip reading, facial expressions and clear sound</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparing your vehicle for the next passenger</h2>

<p>When a person infected with COVID-19 coughs, talks or breathes, they release droplets and aerosols which can be breathed in by another person. While larger droplets fall quickly to the ground, smaller droplets and aerosols containing the virus that causes COVID-19 can remain suspended in the air for some time indoors, especially if there is no ventilation.</p>

<p>Ventilation is the process of replacing this shared air with fresh air from the outside. The more ventilated an area is, the more fresh air there is to breathe, and the less likely a person is to inhale infectious particles.</p>

<p>Surfaces and belongings can also be contaminated with COVID-19, when people who are infected cough or sneeze near them or if they touch them.</p>

<p>Between every journey you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings" class="govuk-link">clean those parts of your vehicle</a> that you or passengers may have touched, for example, door handles, payment devices, protective screens, buttons, seats</li>
  <li>open doors and windows to ventilate the vehicle for 5 minutes</li>
  <li>wash your hands for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitiser</li>
</ul>

<h2>If you have COVID-19 symptoms or have been told to self-isolate</h2>

<p>You should not work if you have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms" rel="external">COVID-19 symptoms</a> or you have been told to self-isolate.</p>

<p>Further information on self-isolation if you have COVID-19 symptoms can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance for households with possible or confirmed COVID-19 infection</a>.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h2>Financial help for drivers</h2>

<p>If you are told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace, you may be entitled to a payment of £500 from your local council under the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme-claiming-financial-support/claiming-financial-support-under-the-test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme" class="govuk-link">Test and Trace Support Payment scheme</a>.</p>

<h2>PHV operators and taxi intermediaries</h2>

<h2>Carrying out a COVID-19 risk assessment – operators and intermediaries</h2>

<p>PHV operators and taxi intermediaries must also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-transport-guidance-for-operators/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-transport-guidance-for-operators#risk-assessment">carry out a risk assessment in line with government guidance</a> for their workers.</p>

<p>If you have fewer than 5 workers including non-drivers (dispatchers, booking agents etc), you don’t have to write anything down as part of your risk assessment.</p>

<h2>Financial help for PHV operators and taxi intermediaries</h2>

<p>Businesses and self-employed drivers may be eligible for financial support schemes. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/business-coronavirus-support-finder" class="govuk-link">Find out what financial support schemes you may be eligible for</a>.</p>
