<p>You may want to check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/italy/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Italy</a></p>

<p>You must <a rel="external" href="https://www.poliziadistato.it/articolo/17985b2d0db2288ab785808552">register as an Italian resident</a> (in Italian) if you want to stay in Italy for more than 3 months. You will get one of the following from the local town hall or comune:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an attestazione di regolarità di soggiorno</li>
  <li>a certificato di residenza</li>
  <li>attestazione di iscrizione anagrafica or attestazione di soggiorno permanente (if resident for 5 years or more)</li>

</h3>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> with a deal, the Italian government will implement the rights in the Withdrawal Agreement and will recognise the rights of all <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals legally resident in Italy before the end of the Implementation Period of 31 December 2020. On 21 December 2018 the Italian government made an announcement: <a rel="external" href="http://www.governo.it/articolo/il-governo-italiano-prosegue-la-preparazione-alla-brexit/10585">‘the Italian Government continues its preparation for Brexit’</a> (in Italian).</p>

<p>In the event of changes to residency rules or registration processes after the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available. You should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-italy">sign up to email alerts</a>.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals resident in Italy will need to get a new non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> residence permit before 31 December 2020. This will protect your rights, including access to healthcare, rights to work and access to social benefits.</p>

<p>The Italian government has passed <a rel="external" href="https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/gu/2019/05/24/120/sg/pdf">legislation</a> stating which measures will be put in place if the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal.</p>

<p>If you have lived in Italy for 5 years or more, you will be eligible for a permanent residence permit. If you have been living in  Italy for less than 5 years you will be eligible for a temporary permit, which will be valid for 5 years.</p>

<p>You will need to go to your local police station in person to get the new residence permit before 31 December 2020. Your current <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> residency certificate, temporary or permanent, will stay valid until you get your new non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> residency one.</p>

<p>If you are a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> national applying for Italian citizenship and you have the required 4 years residency in Italy before the date the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, then your Italian citizenship application will be considered on the basis of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> nationality if it is submitted before 31 December 2020.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Italy</a>.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Passports and travel after the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue  to travel freely in the Schengen area with your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, new travel rules will apply. You should have at least 6 months  left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added  to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></a>. You will be able to stay up to 90 days in another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA or EFTA country, within a 180 day period. You should retain evidence of travel (e.g. train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA or EFTA country, you will be able to transit through other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA or EFTA countries to reach your country of residence. We will update this guidance as more information becomes available.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>If you’re staying in Italy for more than 3 months, you need to register with the Italian National Health Service (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale (<abbr title="Servizio Sanitario Nazionale">SSN</abbr>)) through your local Azienda Sanitaria Locale.</p>

<p>You can register for free with the SNN if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have a work contract, are self-employed in Italy or are an immediate family member of someone who is</li>
  <li>you are an immediate family member of an Italian citizen</li>
  <li>you have been officially resident in Italy for 5 years or more</li>
  <li>you are unemployed, registered on the employment lists (liste di collocamento) or registered for a professional training course</li>
  <li>you hold a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> social security form, such as an S1 form for pensioners (see below)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are not eligible to register for free, you can pay an annual fee to receive state healthcare. You should contact your local Azienda Sanitaria Locale.</p>

<p>You can read the NHS <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-italy/">guidance on accessing healthcare in Italy and how to register</a>.</p>

<p>If you live in Italy and receive an exportable <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>If you are resident in  Italy, you should not be using a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to access healthcare in Italy.</p>

<ul>
  <li>you may use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland</li>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">read our travel advice</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update">advice on foreign travel insurance</a> pages</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are registered for public healthcare as a resident in Italy, and are travelling outside of Italy, you should carry your Italian health card (tessera sanitaria) with you.</p>

<p>You can read the NHS <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/">guidance on healthcare and studying abroad</a>.</p>

<p>You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check your prescriptions are legal</a>.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Healthcare after the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> with a deal, your current rights on access to healthcare in Italy will remain the same until 31 December 2020, as long as you remain a resident in Italy.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, your access to healthcare may change. If you are a permanent or temporary resident you should review the status of your healthcare cover.</p>

<p>The new Italian legislation on measures which would be put in place if the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal includes a commitment to continue social security coordination and access to healthcare until 31 December 2020 on a reciprocal basis.
We will update this guidance when more information becomes available.</p>

<p>You should take action now to confirm your residency status and decide what steps you need to take to ensure access to healthcare if the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal.</p>

<p>Your EHIC may not be valid in the event the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal. The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> has offered to maintain the EHIC scheme should the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leave the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, however this is reliant on Italy continuing to accept <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> EHICs.</p>

<p>You should read the NHS’s guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-italy/">healthcare for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals in Italy and how it may change after the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> has a double-taxation agreement with Italy to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

<p>You should read the guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal-information-for-people-living-in-the-eea">telling HMRC if you leave the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to live abroad</a></li>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> with a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Italy, you will still be able to add your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> social security contributions towards your Italian pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, we will seek agreement with the Italian government so that they will take into account periods of work in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> before the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> when calculating your Italian pension.

<p>If you are in Italy and your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> driving licence is lost, stolen or expires you will not be able to renew it with the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). You will need to apply to the DVLA for a ‘certificate of entitlement’ in Italian to be able to apply for an Italian driving licence.</p>

<p>Be aware that from the moment you start the process of registering your car in Italy you will not be able to use your car, until you get your new documentation and licence plates. For more information you should contact an <a rel="external" href="https://www.ilportaledellautomobilista.it/gms/ricerca/-1/Visualizza">Ufficio Motorizzazione Civile</a>.</p>

<p>You can read the European Union’s guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/vehicles/registration/registration-abroad/index_en.htm">car registration and taxes</a> in Italy.

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> driving licences will likely be considered as third country national licences.
