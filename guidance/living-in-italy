<p>You must <a rel="external" href="https://www.poliziadistato.it/articolo/17985b2d0db2288ab785808552">register as an Italian resident</a> (in Italian) if you want to stay in Italy for more than 3 months. You will get one of the following from the local town hall or comune:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an attestazione di regolarità di soggiorno</li>
  <li>a certificato di residenza</li>
  <li>attestazione di iscrizione anagrafica or attestazione di soggiorno permanente (if resident for 5 years or more)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="residency-after-brexit">Residency after Brexit</h3>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> with a deal, the Italian government will recognise the rights of all <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals legally resident in Italy before the end of the implementation period. On 21 December 2018, the Italian government made an announcement about its plans for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> residents if there is a deal: <a rel="external" href="http://www.governo.it/it/approfondimento/brexit/12733">‘the Italian Government continues its preparation for Brexit’</a> (in Italian).</p>

<p>If there are changes to residency rules or registration processes after Brexit, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/gu/2019/05/24/120/sg/pdf">Italian government has passed legislation</a> stating which measures will be put in place if the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals resident in Italy will need to get a new non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> residence permit before 31 December 2020. This will protect your rights, including access to healthcare, rights to work and access to social benefits.</p>

<p>If you have lived in Italy for 5 years or more, you will be eligible for a permanent residency permit. If you have been living in Italy for less than 5 years, you will be eligible for a temporary residency permit, which will be valid for 5 years.</p>

<p>After Brexit, you will have to go to your local police station in person to get the new residence permit before 31 December 2020. Your current <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> residency certificate, temporary or permanent, will stay valid until you get your new non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> residency one.</p>

<p>If you are a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> national applying for Italian citizenship and you have the required 4 years residency in Italy before the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, then your Italian citizenship application will be considered on the basis of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> nationality if it is submitted before 31 December 2020.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-for-travel-to-europe">apply for or renew your British passport from Italy</a>.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-brexit">Passports and travel after Brexit</h3>

<p>After Brexit, the rules on travel will change. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-for-travel-to-europe">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If there is a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. During this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></a>. You will be able to stay up to 90 days in another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA or EFTA country, within a 180-day period. You must retain evidence of travel (such as train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA or EFTA country, you will be able to transit through other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA or EFTA countries to reach your country of residence.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>If you’re staying in Italy for more than 3 months, you must register with the Italian National Health Service (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale – <abbr title="Servizio Sanitario Nazionale">SSN</abbr>) through your local health authority (Azienda Sanitaria Locale).</p>

<p>You can register for free with the <abbr title="Servizio Sanitario Nazionale">SSN</abbr> if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have a work contract, are self-employed in Italy or are an immediate family member of someone who is</li>
  <li>you are an immediate family member of an Italian citizen</li>
  <li>you have been officially resident in Italy for 5 years or more</li>
  <li>you are unemployed, registered on the employment lists (liste di collocamento) or registered for a professional training course</li>
  <li>you hold a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> social security form, such as an S1 form for pensioners</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are not eligible to register for free, you can pay an annual fee to receive state healthcare. Contact your local Azienda Sanitaria Locale.</p>

<p>Read the NHS <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-italy/">guidance on accessing healthcare in Italy and how to register</a>.</p>

<p>If you live in Italy and receive an exportable <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. You must apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate and register it with your Azienda Sanitaria Locale.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Italy, you must not use a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> for healthcare in Italy.</p>

<p>When you travel from Italy for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland, you can use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">read our travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update">advice on foreign travel insurance</a> pages</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are registered for public healthcare as a resident in Italy, and are travelling outside of Italy, carry your Italian health card (tessera sanitaria) with you.</p>

<p>If you are a student, read the NHS <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/">guidance on healthcare and studying abroad</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/italy-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners/list-of-english-speaking-doctors-in-italy">find an English-speaking doctor</a> in Italy.</p>

<p>You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check your prescriptions are legal</a> in Italy.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-brexit">Healthcare after Brexit</h3>

<p>If there is a deal, your current rights on access to healthcare in Italy will remain the same until the end of the implementation period, as long as you remain a resident in Italy.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, your access to healthcare may change. You must confirm your residency status and decide how you will ensure access to healthcare.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, and you are a legal resident in Italy on or before 31 October and you pay into the public health care system, through employment or voluntary contributions, you will be covered by Italian no-deal legislation which ensures continued access to healthcare.</p>

<p>The Italian no-deal legislation also includes a commitment to continue social security coordination and access to healthcare until 31 December 2020. This includes S1 holders and students.</p>

<p>This still requires a formal agreement between the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and Italian governments.  We will update this guidance when more information becomes available. You should consider registering with the public healthcare system or obtaining private health insurance.</p>

<p>In the absence of an agreement with Italy and you currently have your healthcare costs paid for by the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> government, we can help if you are asked to pay for treatment during the first 6 months after Brexit. To organise a payment, you must give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Your EHIC may not be valid if there’s no deal. The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> has offered to maintain the EHIC scheme if there’s no deal, however this relies on Italy continuing to accept <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> EHICs.</p>

<p>Read the NHS’s guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-italy/">healthcare for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals in Italy and how it may change after Brexit</a>.</p>

<h3 id="pensions-after-brexit">Pensions after Brexit</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> government will continue to pay a State Pension to those eligible in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> after Brexit. Your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> State Pension will be uprated in April 2020, 2021 and 2022 if you live in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA or Switzerland.</p>

<p>If there is a deal, and you work and pay social security contributions in Italy, you will still be able to add your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> social security contributions towards your Italian pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, we will seek agreement with the Italian government for them to take into account periods of work in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> before Brexit when calculating your Italian pension. We will update this guidance when there is a formal agreement on this.</p>

<p>If there is a deal, driving licence rules will stay the same during the implementation period.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> driving licences will likely be considered as third country national licences. To continue using your licence, you may need to re-take your test, including passing a theory test in Italian. We will update this guide when there is more information.</p>
