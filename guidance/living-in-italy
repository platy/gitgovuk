<h2 id="the-withdrawal-agreement">The Withdrawal Agreement</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-withdrawal-agreement-and-political-declaration" class="govuk-link">Withdrawal Agreement</a> sets out the terms of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>â€™s withdrawal from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and provides for a deal on citizensâ€™ rights. It sets out a transition period which lasts until 31 December 2020. During this time you can continue to live, work and study in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> broadly as you did before 31 January 2020.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Italy at the end of the transition period, you will be covered by the Withdrawal Agreement, and your rights will be protected for as long as you remain resident in Italy.</p>

<p>Any rights that are not covered by the Withdrawal Agreement will be the subject of future negotiations. Read this guidance page for more information</p>

<p>In the meantime, make sure you are registered as a resident in Italy. We will update this guidance as soon as more information becomes available.</p>

<h3 id="residency">Residency</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Italy before the transition period ends on 31 December 2020, you will be able to stay.</p>

<p>You must <a rel="external" href="https://www.poliziadistato.it/articolo/17985b2d0db2288ab785808552" class="govuk-link">register as an Italian resident</a> (in Italian) if you want to stay in Italy for more than 3 months. You will get one of the following from the local town hall or comune:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an attestazione di regolaritÃ  di soggiorno</li>
  <li>an attestazione di iscrizione anagrafica or attestazione di soggiorno permanente (if resident for 5 years or more)</li>
</ul>

<p>The rules on residency registration remain the same during the transition period. Read the Italian governmentâ€™s <a rel="external" href="http://www.governo.it/sites/new.governo.it/files/documenti/documenti/Notizie-allegati/governo/BREXIT/ANAGRAFE_vademecum_2020.pdf" class="govuk-link">guidance on residency processes for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals</a> (in Italian).</p>

<p>If you have already registered as a resident and have a residency document, you should obtain the new attestazione from your local comune. This new document will be proof of your rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>For more information about the new attestazione, read the <a rel="external" href="https://dait.interno.gov.it/servizi-demografici/circolari/circolare-n3-dell11-febbraio-2020" class="govuk-link">Italian Ministry of Interiorâ€™s circular</a> (in Italian).

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>If youâ€™re living in Italy or move there permanently before 31 December 2020, youâ€™ll have life-long healthcare rights in Italy as you do now, provided you remain resident.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-italy" class="govuk-link">guidance on accessing healthcare in Italy and how to register</a>.</p>

<p>After you have registered your residency, you need to register with the Italian National Health Service (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale â€“ <abbr title="Servizio Sanitario Nazionale">SSN</abbr>) through your local health authority (Azienda Sanitaria Locale â€“ <abbr title="Azienda Sanitaria Locale">ASL</abbr>).</p>

<p>You can register for free with the <abbr title="Servizio Sanitario Nazionale">SSN</abbr> if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have a work contract, are self-employed in Italy or are an immediate family member of someone who is</li>
  <li>you are an immediate family member of an Italian citizen</li>
  <li>you hold an Attestazione di Soggiorno Permanente</li>
  <li>you become unemployed after having worked in Italy, and register on the employment lists (liste di collocamento). This also applies if you register for a professional training course while you are unemployed</li>
  <li>you hold a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> social security form, such as an S1 form for pensioners</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not fall into one of the above categories you  may be able to register with <abbr title="Servizio Sanitario Nazionale">SSN</abbr> by paying an annual fee. This depends on the region of Italy you live in. You should contact your <abbr title="Azienda Sanitaria Locale">ASL</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="state-healthcare-s1">State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you live in Italy and receive an exportable <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. You must apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate and register it with your Azienda Sanitaria Locale.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-italy#s1" class="govuk-link">guidance on how to get an S1 form</a>.</p>

<h3 id="european-health-insurance-card-ehic">European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Italy, you must not use your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-issued EHIC for healthcare in Italy.</p>

<p>When you travel from Italy for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland, you can use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information, read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update" class="govuk-link">advice on foreign travel insurance</a> pages</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are registered for public healthcare as a resident in Italy, and are travelling outside of Italy, carry your Italian European health card (Tessera Europea di Assicurazione Malattia â€“TEAM) with you.</p>

<p>There will be no changes to your healthcare access before 31 December 2020. You can also continue to use your EHIC, as you did before, during this time.</p>

<p>You should also read guidance on:</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>The rules on travel will stay the same until the transition period ends on 31 December 2020. During this time you can continue to travel to countries in the <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a> or elsewhere in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> with your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> passport.</p>

<p>Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport from Italy</a>.</p>

<h3 id="passports-from-1-january-2021">Passports from 1 January 2021</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to Italy, and you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>You will need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or Schengen area countries. You may need to show a return or onward ticket and that you have enough money for your stay. You may also have to use separate lanes from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped for visits to these countries.</p>

<h3 id="entry-requirements">Entry requirements</h3>

<p>From 1 January 2021, you will be able to travel to other Schengen area countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.</p>

<p>To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by the country to which you are travelling.
