<h2>Book and plan your visit to Werrington</h2>
<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Now that regular COVID testing of people in the wider community has ended, you are no longer required to take a COVID test before coming to see someone for a visit, although we would still encourage you to do so.</p>

<p>We will continue to run social visits whilst it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>Visiting rules may change if there is an outbreak within the prison, this may include bringing back testing before visits for a short time to protect you, the person you are visiting and staff.</p>

<p>You can also contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/helpline" rel="external">Prisoners’ Families Helpline</a> on 0808 808 2003. You will not be able to book a visit using this number.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Werrington</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Werrington</h2>

<p>You may not be able to speak with someone at Werrington during their first few days. This is because it can take time to approve who they can be in touch with.</p>

<p>Young people at Werrington have phones in their rooms so they will always need to call you rather than you call them. As a parent or carer you will be given a phone number for your young person’s caseworker (during the first week) so that you can contact them if you have concerns.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>

<p>Young people at Werrington have access to phones throughout the units and in their rooms and can make calls during free periods from 7:30am to 8pm.</p>

<p>A person in Werrington can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>

</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>
