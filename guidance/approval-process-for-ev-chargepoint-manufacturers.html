<p>On 1 April 2022, the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (OZEV) reformed its grant schemes. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/government-grants-for-low-emission-vehicles#ev-chargepoint-grant">EV chargepoint grant</a> replaced the Electric Vehicles Homecharge Scheme (EVHS).</p>

<p>Chargepoints will now be approved for either residential or commercial use.</p>

<p>Chargepoints approved for residential use (which includes all chargepoints previously approved for EVHS) can be used for the following schemes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ev-chargepoint-grant-for-flat-owner-occupiers-and-people-living-in-rented-properties-installer-guidance">EV chargepoint grant for flat owner-occupiers and people living in rented properties</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Chargepoints approved for commercial use (which includes all chargepoints previously approved for the Workplace Charging Scheme) can be used for the following schemes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/government-grants-for-low-emission-vehicles#workplace-charging-scheme">Workplace Charging Scheme</a></li>

</ul>
</div>

<h2>General requirements</h2>

<p>To be approved by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> for installation, all chargepoints must meet a minimum set of technical requirements known as the:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/residential-chargepoints-minimum-technical-specification">Residential chargepoints: minimum technical specification</a></li>
  <li>Commercial chargepoints: minimum technical specification</li>
</ul>

<p>Approval is needed for all new models or changes to existing models.</p>

<p>Each model must have a unique name or identification that is easily identifiable and may be readily used by installers when applying for grants.</p>

<p>Any inconsistencies between the model listed on the <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>-approved chargepoint model lists and the model name supplied on the equipment may lead to grant applications being rejected and action taken against manufacturers.</p>

<p>To ensure equipment meets the minimum technical specification, we recommend that manufacturers consider getting third-party certification by a United Kingdom Accreditation Service (<abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>)-accredited laboratory, or equivalent, before applying.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Manufacturers may not use the OZEV logo, which is for government use only. They may, however, state that their equipment is OZEV-approved.</p>
</div>

<h2>How to apply for a chargepoint approval</h2>

<p>Manufacturers must apply to <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> using the chargepoint model approval form. This consists of a series of questions designed to evaluate if the model meets the relevant minimum technical specification.</p>

<p><a class="gem-c-button govuk-button govuk-button--start" draggable="false" href="https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/5XDESG/" role="button"> Apply for chargepoint model approval <svg class="govuk-button__start-icon govuk-!-display-none-print" focusable="false" height="19" viewBox="0 0 33 40" width="17.5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h13l20 20-20 20H0l20-20z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></a></p>

<p>If your application is successful, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will notify you and add the chargepoint model to our published lists:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/residential-approved-chargepoint-model-list">Residential approved chargepoint model list</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/commercial-approved-chargepoint-model-list">Commercial approved chargepoint model list</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For any queries on chargepoint authorisation, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ChargepointApprovals@dft.gov.uk">ChargepointApprovals@dft.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>Documents required</h3>

<p>The following documents are required for each model to be approved.</p>

<ul>
  <li>warranty document</li>
  <li>declaration of conformity certificate</li>
  <li>operating manual</li>
  <li>statements regarding the cybersecurity of the chargepoint</li>
</ul>

<p>The following sections describe the requirements for each of these documents:</p>

<h4>Warranty document</h4>

<p>To be approved by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>, the warranty document must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a statement that confirms that the minimum operational life of the chargepoint is 3 years from the date of installation</li>
  <li>a statement that confirms that the warranty is valid for a period of 3 years from the date of installation</li>
  <li>a statement that confirms that any on-site assistance, repairs and replacements are provided for free</li>
  <li>a statement that confirms that the warranty covers both parts and labour</li>
  <li>an explanation of the procedures for the customer to seek the manufacturer’s assistance, including contact details of the manufacturer (or the third party that provides assistance)</li>
  <li>a list of the evidence necessary for the customer to obtain the manufacturer’s assistance</li>
  <li>a list of the exclusions and caveats that make the warranty inapplicable</li>
</ul>

<h4>Declaration of conformity</h4>

<p>Each chargepoint model submitted to <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> for approval must be accompanied by an EC declaration of conformity certificate for CE marking, drafted in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32008D0768" rel="external">EC Directive 768/2008/EC Annex III</a> or by Declaration of Conformity for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-ukca-marking">UKCA marking</a>.</p>

<p>The EC declaration of conformity or Declaration of Conformity for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-ukca-marking">UKCA marking</a> must include a statement by the manufacturer that demonstrates that each of the chargepoint models for which the <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> approval is sought fulfils the requirements of the British standards and regulations referenced in the:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/residential-chargepoints-minimum-technical-specification">Residential chargepoints: minimum technical specification</a></li>
  <li>Commercial chargepoints: minimum technical specification</li>
</ul>

<h4>Operating manual</h4>

<p>The operating manual must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an index</li>
  <li>a safety information notice which summarises the risks associated to the installation and use of the chargepoint and explains how to prevent them</li>
  <li>a conceptual design and/or manufacturing drawing, with corresponding description and instructions, for the operation of the chargepoint</li>
  <li>a list of the buttons, light-emitting diodes (<abbr title="light-emitting diodes">LEDs</abbr>) and icons displayed on screen (if any) to explain the charging status of the chargepoint – this shall include a list of the potential errors and warnings and the actions necessary to address them</li>
  <li>step-by-step instructions for installers for the correct installation and set-up of the chargepoint</li>
  <li>an explanation of the charging modes available for users to recharge their electric vehicles</li>
  <li>if provided, a description of the set-up and operation of the back-end software and/or the associated smartphone application</li>
  <li>a summary factsheet or table that lists all the technical specifications of the chargepoint, such as rated power and current, sockets, dimensions and weight, operative conditions and protections available</li>
  <li>instructions on how to dispose of the chargepoint properly</li>
  <li>contact details of the manufacturer for users and installers to seek assistance</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cybersecurity statements</h4>

<p>Manufacturers must either comply with the cybersecurity requirements in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/1467/contents/made" rel="external">The Electric Vehicles (Smart Charge Points) Regulations 2021</a> or provide answers to the following questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How does the chargepoint ensure an appropriate level of encryption of the communications between the chargepoint and the chargepoint operator?</li>
  <li>How does the chargepoint operator ensure its communications and functions are appropriately encrypted?</li>
</ol>

<p>Manufacturers must provide a detailed description of the features that ensure communications between the chargepoint and chargepoint operator are secure, preferably referring to any relevant standards in their response.</p>

<p>Compliance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.elaad.nl/projects/cybersecurity/" rel="external">European Network for Cyber Security&nbsp;<abbr title="Electric Vehicle">EV</abbr>&nbsp;Charging Systems Security Requirements</a> is considered an appropriate level of cybersecurity.</p>

<h2>Product variants</h2>

<p>If, as a manufacturer, you want approval for a family of chargepoints, meaning, a group of chargepoint models characterised by having the same electrical architecture and covered by the same safety certificates, but having different housings, externalities or other features from that originally approved (or a base model), you can submit one application to cover that family.</p>

<p>To gain approval for product variants you should contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ChargepointApprovals@dft.gov.uk">ChargepointApprovals@dft.gov.uk</a> and provide the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the name of any chargepoint variant already approved by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the name of all variants seeking approval, including their unique model names to be listed on the:
    <ul>
      <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/residential-approved-chargepoint-model-list">Residential approved chargepoint model list</a></li>
      <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/commercial-approved-chargepoint-model-list">Commercial approved chargepoint model list</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the details of how these variants differ from each other</li>
  <li>an updated Declaration of Conformity to confirm that all associated certificates cover all the model variants listed</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will review applications and inform the applicant if individual applications are required.</p>

<h2>Manufacturer responsibilities</h2>

<h3>On-site warranty requirements</h3>

<p>It’s the manufacturer’s responsibility to ensure that a valid 3-year on-site warranty is provided to the applicant – either via the installer or directly – at the time of installation.</p>

<p>If the manufacturer plans to meet <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>’s warranty requirements through partners, resellers or installers, this must be explained in the warranty document.</p>

<p>The manufacturer is expected to honour this warranty by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing on-site assistance to applicants</li>
  <li>attempting to repair chargepoints directly at the applicant’s site(s) – should this not be possible or if additional work is required, manufacturers must either attempt to fix the chargepoint at their own premises or replace it at no extra cost to the applicant</li>
</ul>

<p>If the manufacturer requires the applicant to return parts of the chargepoint to them, the applicant is not liable for the costs associated with doing so.</p>

<h3>Required standards and penalties for misconduct</h3>

<p>Manufacturers must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>monitor for any changes to the minimum technical standards</li>
  <li>inform <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> if their charging equipment no longer meets the required standards</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> reserves the right to take whatever action it deems appropriate if there is any evidence of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>scheme requirements not being upheld</li>
  <li>fraudulent activity</li>
  <li>misuse of government funding by any party</li>
</ul>

<p>This may include removal of specific (or all) manufacturer’s chargepoint models from the approved chargepoint list.</p>

<h2>What to do when standards change</h2>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> requires that <abbr title="Electric Vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoints meet the latest versions of the standards specified in the minimum technical specification for equipment. <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> is not able to ‘grandfather’ approvals to earlier versions.</p>

<p>Manufacturers should therefore ensure they have a process to enable them to identify any changes to the standards listed and a process to assess whether this would affect their chargepoints.</p>

<p>If the versions of the standards referred to in the minimum technical specification change, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> may require a statement or evidence from a manufacturer confirming that their existing approved equipment meets the new standards. <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will contact manufacturers with precise instructions should the minimum technical specification change.</p>

<p>Where a manufacturer is unable to demonstrate that their equipment meets the requirements of an update to the minimum technical specification, it will be removed from the list of approved <abbr title="Electric Vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoints.</p>

<p>The removal of such equipment from the list may coincide with the withdrawal of an old standard, but <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> reserves the right to perform this at an earlier date.</p>
