<p>A Brexit deal has been agreed but needs to be ratified. The UK could still leave with no deal on 31 October 2019 if the UK and EU do not approve and sign the withdrawal agreement.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare-slovakia">Healthcare in Slovakia after Brexit</h2>

<p>If you are a UK national living in Slovakia, you should be ready for possible changes to your access to healthcare if there is a no-deal Brexit.</p>

<p>You should review your access to healthcare now. There may be a gap or permanent change in how you access healthcare if there is no deal and no agreements with Slovakia in place.</p>

<h3 id="if-youre-living-in-slovakia">If you’re living in Slovakia</h3>
<p>You need to make the best decisions for your circumstances and consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-slovakia#visas-and-residency">registering to live in Slovakia</a> – you can find more information on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.minv.sk/?brexit-2">Slovak Ministry of Interior’s website</a>
</li>
  <li>registering for healthcare under the local rules and legislation of Slovakia – if you’re a permanent resident, work or are self-employed in Slovakia, you must contribute to mandatory health insurance unless you’re exempt and the state pays on your behalf</li>
  <li>buying comprehensive health insurance while you’re applying for residency or if you’re not eligible for local schemes – you must obtain private healthcare insurance if you do not contribute to the mandatory health insurance</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you have all the right documentation and it’s up to date.</p>

<h3 id="s1-certificate-holders">S1 certificate holders</h3>
<p>The S1 certificate may not be valid if there’s a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Slovakia and may mean you have to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<h3 id="arrangement-with-slovakia-if-theres-no-deal">Arrangement with Slovakia if there’s no deal</h3>
<p>The Slovakian government has published legislation about the rights of UK nationals in Slovakia if there’s a no-deal Brexit.</p>

<p>If agreed, Slovakia would treat UK nationals and their family members as EU citizens until the 31 December 2020, as long as reciprocal arrangements are put in place for Slovakian nationals in the UK.</p>

<h3 id="studying-in-slovakia-after-brexit">Studying in Slovakia after Brexit</h3>
<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid after exit day if there’s a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Slovakia and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<p>If you’re already studying in Slovakia before the UK leaves the EU, the UK will cover your healthcare costs for the duration of your course.</p>

<p>Students starting courses after the UK leaves the EU should ensure they have comprehensive healthcare cover in place.</p>

<h3 id="get-help-paying-for-medical-treatment-after-brexit">Get help paying for medical treatment after Brexit</h3>
<p>During the first 6 months after Brexit, if you need medical treatment and you’re being asked to pay for it, the UK can help.</p>

<p>This may be through arrangements with the country you live in, or by paying your healthcare provider directly.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<h3 id="using-nhs-services-when-visiting-the-uk">Using NHS services when visiting the UK</h3>
<p>You should not expect to be able to use NHS services for free when visiting the UK if you’re living in Slovakia and are not currently eligible for a UK-issued S1 form or <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/">European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>You should take out appropriate travel insurance when visiting the UK, as you would when visiting any other country.</p>

<p>If you’re living in Slovakia before Brexit, you can use NHS services in England, Scotland and Wales without charge when visiting the UK after exit day if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a UK-issued S1 form</li>
  <li>have a UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>would have been eligible for the UK to fund your healthcare access if exit day had not occurred</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="returning-to-the-uk-permanently">Returning to the UK permanently</h3>
<p>If you return to the UK permanently and meet the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ordinary-residence">ordinarily resident test</a>, you’ll be able to access NHS care without charge.</p>

<h3 id="european-health-insurance-cards-ehic">European Health Insurance Cards (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</h3>
<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid if there’s a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Slovakia and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<p>Make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance if you’re planning to visit Slovakia.</p>

<p>Check your insurance has the necessary healthcare cover to ensure you can get any treatment you might need.</p>

<p>If you have any pre-existing health conditions, talk with your insurer about how to get the right cover, and how this affects your travel.</p>

<p>UK-issued EHICs will still be valid until the UK leaves the EU. Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> can also be used to access UK-funded treatment if your visit or treatment started before exit day until you return to the UK.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<p>The Slovak healthcare system is based on mandatory health insurance contributions.</p>

<p>If you’re a permanent resident, work or are self-employed in Slovakia, you must make mandatory health insurance contributions to 1 of 3 health insurance funds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Všeobecná zdravotná poisťovňa</li>
  <li>Dôvera zdravotná poisťovňa</li>
  <li>Union zdravotná poisťovňa</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="paying-for-healthcare">Paying for healthcare</h3>
<p>There are some services you must contribute towards.</p>

<p>Co-payments for additional healthcare services are set in law for the following additional services:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pharmaceuticals, medical devices, dietary food: co-payments for 60% of items</li>
  <li>prescription costs: €0.17 per prescription</li>
  <li>spas and other rehabilitation services: from €1.66</li>
  <li>24/7 first aid medical service: €1.99</li>
  <li>transport health service: €0.07 per km</li>
</ul>

<p>If you live in Slovakia, planned treatment is covered through statutory health insurance or through your private healthcare insurance.</p>

<p>You must first visit a general practitioner. If needed, they’ll recommend you to a specialist at an outpatient department.</p>

<p>If you need to see a gyneacological and psychiatric specialist, you do not need a referral from a general practitioner.</p>

<p>You must present your health insurance card provided by your insurer when visiting a doctor.</p>

<p>State health insurance policy fully covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>preventative medical check-ups</li>
  <li>urgent health care (in case of a sudden change of health conditions which directly endangers life or any of the vital functions)</li>
  <li>medical performance leading to the detection of a disease and determining the diagnosis, curing of the disease, mitigation of its effects, saving of life etc.</li>
  <li>compulsory vaccination</li>
  <li>urgent transport of the person to a medical facility and between medical facilities</li>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you live in Slovakia and receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an exportable UK State Pension</li>
  <li>a contribution-based Employment Support Allowance</li>
  <li>another exportable benefit</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>An S1 certificate helps you and your dependants access healthcare in Slovakia. If you have an S1 certificate, it will be valid until the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>It’s possible to apply for an S1 certificate until the UK leaves the EU. It’s important to have all the right documentation and that it’s up to date.</p>

<p>You may be eligible for an S1 certificate if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receive certain UK benefits, such as a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>are employed by a UK body or firm (you’re a posted or frontier worker)</li>
  <li>are a dependant of someone who has an S1 certificate</li>

<p>If you receive a UK State Pension, you can apply for your certificate via the Overseas Healthcare Service on +44 (0) 191 218 1999 (option 5).</p>

<p>For other exportable benefits, you may need to contact a different team depending on the exportable benefit. You can find more information under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">claiming benefits if you live, move or travel abroad</a>.

<p>Make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance if you’re planning to visit Slovakia. The government always advises UK nationals to take out comprehensive travel insurance when going overseas.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is not an alternative to travel insurance and you should have both when you travel abroad.</p>

<p>Emergency medical care is provided to anyone requiring urgent attention. You can expect to be charged in full for any care provided without an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> (called ‘Európsky preukaz zdravotného poistenia’ in Slovakian) enables you to access necessary state-provided healthcare in Slovakia at a reduced cost, or sometimes for free if you’re staying there temporarily.</p>

<p>Make sure you’re treated by a healthcare provider in the state system as you will not be covered for private healthcare with an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Remember to keep all receipts and any paperwork.</p>

<h3 id="pre-existing-health-conditions">Pre-existing health conditions</h3>
<p>You should buy medical travel insurance before visiting Slovakia if you have a pre-existing health condition. You must tell the insurance company about any pre-existing health conditions you have, so that you can get the cover you need.</p>

<p>The Money and Pensions Advice Service has information about <a rel="external" href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/travel-insurance-for-over-65s-and-medical-conditions">buying travel insurance for people with pre-existing medical conditions</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a pre-existing condition that will need treatment while abroad, ask your doctor in the UK for advice before you travel. Take any documents about your health condition or medicine with you.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is not an alternative to travel insurance and you should have both when you travel abroad.</p>

<p>If you’re travelling to have planned medical treatment, read the NHS guide about <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/going-abroad-for-medical-treatment/">going abroad for medical treatment</a>.</p>

<h3 id="dentists">Dentists</h3>
<p>Dental treatment is not covered by the state healthcare system unless it’s an emergency. Most emergency departments or health centres have a dentist attached that can deal with dental emergencies.</p>

<h3 id="hospitals">Hospitals</h3>
<p>You’ll need to be referred by a doctor for any hospital treatment. Only state hospitals provide treatment free of charge.</p>

<h3 id="prescriptions">Prescriptions</h3>
<p>With an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, people of working age are charged 50% and pensioners are charged about 10%.</p>
