<p>A Brexit deal has been agreed but needs to be ratified. The UK could still leave with no deal on 31 October 2019 if the UK and EU do not approve and sign the withdrawal agreement.</p>

<p>This page tells you how to prepare for Brexit and will be updated if anything changes. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/government/brexit">Sign up for email alerts</a> to get the latest information.</p>
</div>

<p>This content was originally published on the NHS website.</p>

<h2 id="brexit-healthcare">Healthcare in Switzerland after Brexit</h2>

<p>You should prepare for possible changes to your access to healthcare if there’s a no-deal Brexit and you’re a UK national planning to live in or <a href="#ehic">visit Switzerland after the UK leaves the EU</a>.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-currently-live-in-switzerland">If you currently live in Switzerland</h3>

<p>The UK has reached an agreement with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/swiss-citizens-rights-agreement-and-explainer">Switzerland on citizens’ rights</a>.</p>

<p>This means that if there’s a no-deal Brexit, existing healthcare entitlements will be protected.</p>

<p>The agreement protects the rights of UK nationals living in Switzerland, and Swiss nationals who are living in the UK, before exit day.</p>

<p>Current healthcare arrangements will not change for UK nationals who are resident in Switzerland before the UK leaves the EU, for as long as they’re living in Switzerland and covered by the agreement. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>students using a <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/">European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</a>
</li>
  <li>S1 holders, including UK nationals living in Switzerland on exit day who reach State Pension age after Brexit</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="uk-posted-workers">UK posted workers</h3>

<p>If you’re a posted worker with a UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or S1 certificate working in Switzerland before exit day, read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">government’s guidance about National Insurance if you go abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you decide to continue working in Switzerland and pay contributions there, your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or S1 may not continue to be valid.</p>

<p>If you’re a UK posted worker and you need to pay social security contributions in Switzerland after Brexit, consider buying into the state system if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>This will mean you can continue to receive healthcare on the same terms as a Swiss national.</p>

<p>Or you could think about buying comprehensive health insurance.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-move-to-switzerland-after-brexit">If you move to Switzerland after Brexit</h3>

<p>You need to make the best decisions for your circumstances and consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-switzerland#visas-and-residency">registering to live in Switzerland</a> – as with current arrangements in Switzerland, there are 3 types of permits you can get: short-term (less than a year), annual or permanent</li>
  <li>registering for healthcare in Switzerland – if you remain resident in Switzerland, you’ll need to pay into the state healthcare scheme</li>
  <li>buying comprehensive health insurance to cover you while you’re applying for residency</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you have all the right documentation and it’s up to date.</p>

<h3 id="studying-in-switzerland-after-brexit">Studying in Switzerland after Brexit</h3>

<p>If you’re a UK resident studying or about to study in Switzerland and you’re entitled to a student <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> issued by the UK, your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> will remain valid for the duration of your course, as long as you stay on it.</p>

<p>You need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enrol on your course before the date the UK leaves the EU</li>
  <li>enter the country you’re studying in before the date the UK leaves the EU</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="get-help-paying-for-medical-treatment-after-brexit">Get help paying for medical treatment after Brexit</h3>

<p>During the first 6 months after Brexit, if you need medical treatment and you’re being asked to pay for it, the UK can help.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<h3 id="using-nhs-services-when-visiting-the-uk">Using NHS services when visiting the UK</h3>

<p>You should not expect to be able to use NHS services for free if you move to Switzerland after Brexit. You should take out appropriate travel insurance when visiting the UK, as you would when visiting any other country.</p>

<p>You can use NHS services in England, Scotland and Wales without charge after exit day if you’re living in Switzerland before exit day and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a UK-issued S1 form</li>
  <li>have a UK-issued <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/"><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a>
</li>
  <li>would have been eligible for the UK to fund your healthcare access if exit day had not occurred</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="returning-to-the-uk-permanently">Returning to the UK permanently</h3>

<p>If you meet the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ordinary-residence">ordinarily resident test</a>, you’ll be able to access NHS care without charge.</p>

<h4 id="if-you-are-visiting-before-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">If you are visiting before the UK leaves the EU</h4>

<p>The Citizens’ Rights Agreement between the UK and Switzerland means that if there’s a no-deal Brexit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>existing healthcare entitlements will be protected</li>
  <li>your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> will be valid for the duration of your stay</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="if-your-visit-starts-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">If your visit starts after the UK leaves the EU</h4>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid if there’s a no-deal Brexit.</p>

<p>Make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance if you’re planning to visit Switzerland.</p>

<p>Check your travel insurance has the necessary healthcare cover to ensure you can get any treatment you might need.</p>

<p>‘If you have any pre-existing health conditions, talk to your insurer about how to get the right cover and how this affects your travel.</p>

</div>

<p>If you work in Switzerland, you’ll need to buy the mandatory basic healthcare insurance. This entitles you to healthcare under the same conditions as Swiss nationals.</p>

<p>The mandatory basic healthcare insurance in Switzerland covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>services provided by a doctor - all costs of services provided by doctors are normally covered, and doctors are required to tell you whether procedures they perform are covered by basic insurance</li>
  <li>hospital costs - hospitals should be chosen as per the list of hospitals kept by the canton (region) in which you reside; if you get treatment from another hospital, the costs and treatment of the general ward will only be covered up to the amount that would have been reimbursed if you had treatment at your cantonal hospital</li>
  <li>accidents - if you work 8 hours a week or more, your employer should insure you for work-related and non-work-related accidents under the Accidents Insurance Law</li>
  <li>medical transport and rescue - insurance covers half the cost of transport or rescue, but with a maximum cover of 500CHF for transport and 5,000CHF for rescue per year</li>
  <li>emergency treatment outside EU countries, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland - insurance covers costs up to twice the value of what you’d have been expected to spend in Switzerland</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="uk-posted-workers-1">UK posted workers</h3>

<p>If you’re a worker posted by a UK company to Switzerland, you may be entitled to health cover funded by the UK.</p>

<p>You can find out more from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC):</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you live in Switzerland and receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an exportable UK State Pension</li>
  <li>a contribution-based <a href="https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance">Employment Support Allowance (ESA)</a>
</li>
  <li>another exportable benefit</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate. An S1 certificate helps you and your dependants access healthcare in Switzerland.</p>

<p>You may be eligible for an S1 certificate if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receive certain UK benefits, such as a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>are employed by a UK body or firm (you’re a posted or frontier worker)</li>
  <li>are a dependant of someone who has an S1 certificate</li>
</ul>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="https://contactcentreservices.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/selfnhsukokb/AskUs_EHIC/en-gb/6696/application-forms-and-evidence/16477/s1-form-what-is-this-and-how-do-i-obtain-one">apply for an S1 certificate</a> through the NHS Business Services Authority.</p>

<p>If you receive a UK State Pension, you can apply for your certificate through the Overseas Healthcare Service on +44 (0) 191 218 1999 (option 5).</p>

<p>The existing healthcare entitlements of UK nationals living in Switzerland before Brexit will be protected. This is because of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/swiss-citizens-rights-agreement-and-explainer">Citizens’ Rights Agreement between the UK and Switzerland</a>.</p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>S1 holders who are living in Switzerland before Brexit</li>
  <li>UK nationals living in Switzerland at exit day who reach State Pension age after Brexit</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not have an S1 certificate, you can still apply for one until the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>It’s important to have all the right documentation and that it’s up to date.</p>

<p>For other exportable benefits, you may need to contact a different team depending on the exportable benefit.</p>

<p>Different exportable benefits can have different rules in terms of healthcare cover.</p>

<p>All foreign nationals have 14 days after they arrive in Switzerland to register with local authorities in the town they’ll reside in and apply for a residence permit. This does not apply to tourists.</p>

<p>The government always advises UK nationals to take out comprehensive insurance when going overseas.</p>

<p>Make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance if you’re planning to visit Switzerland.</p>

<p>The government always advises UK nationals to take out comprehensive travel insurance when going overseas. Your <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/"><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> is not an alternative to travel insurance and you should have both when you travel abroad.</p>

<p>Emergency medical care is provided to anyone requiring urgent attention. You can expect to be charged in full for any care provided without an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> enables you to access necessary state-provided healthcare in Switzerland at a reduced cost, or sometimes for free, if you’re staying there temporarily.</p>

<p>Make sure that you’re treated by a healthcare provider in the state system, as you will not be covered for private healthcare with an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Remember to keep all receipts and any paperwork.</p>

<h3 id="pre-existing-health-conditions">Pre-existing health conditions</h3>

<p>You should buy medical travel insurance before visiting Switzerland if you have a pre-existing health condition.</p>

<p>You must tell the insurance company about any pre-existing health conditions you have so you can get the cover you need.</p>

<p>If you have a pre-existing condition that will need treatment while abroad, ask your doctor in the UK for advice before you travel.</p>

<p>Take any documents about your health condition or medicines with you.</p>

<p>If you have a UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, this will be valid for the duration of your stay if your visit begins before the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If your visit starts after the UK leaves the EU, your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid if there’s a no-deal Brexit.</p>

<p>If you are travelling to have planned medical treatment, read the NHS guide to <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/going-abroad-for-medical-treatment/">seeking medical treatment in Europe</a>.</p>
