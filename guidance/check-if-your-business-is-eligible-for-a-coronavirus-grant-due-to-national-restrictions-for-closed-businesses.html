</div>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Your business may be eligible if it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is based in England</li>
  <li>occupies property on which it pays business rates (and is the ratepayer)</li>
  <li>has been required to close because of the national lockdown from 5 January 2021 onwards, or between 5 November and 2 December 2020</li>
  <li>has been unable to provide its usual in-person customer service from its premises</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, this could include non-essential retail, leisure, personal care, sports facilities, tourism and hospitality businesses. It could also include businesses that operate primarily as an in-person venue, but which have been forced to close those services and provide a takeaway-only service instead.</p>

<p>Eligible businesses can get one grant for each non-domestic property.</p>

<h3>Businesses excluded from the fund</h3>

<p>You cannot get funding if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you can continue to operate during the lockdown period because you do not depend on providing direct in-person services from your premises (for example accountants)</li>
  <li>you have chosen to close, but have not been required to close as part of national restrictions</li>
  <li>your business is in administration, insolvent or has been struck off the Companies House register</li>
  <li>you have exceeded the permitted subsidy limit</li>
</ul>

<div class="example">
<p>You must notify your local council if your situation changes and you no longer meet the eligibility criteria.</p>
</div>

<h3>Subsidy control and state aid</h3>

<p>Following the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, there have been no changes to the conditions of this grant scheme. Your local council will set out the eligibility requirements for the scheme.</p>

<p>We will publish further guidance on subsidy rules in due course.</p>

<h2>What you get</h2>

<p>The grant will be based on the rateable value of the property on the first full day of lockdown.</p>

<h3>National lockdown from 5 January 2021</h3>

<h4>First payment cycle, 5 January to 15 February 2021</h4>

<p>The first payment cycle covers 5 January to 15 February 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if your business has a property with a rateable value of £15,000 or less, you may be eligible for a cash grant of £2,001 for this 42-day qualifying restrictions period</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if your business has a property with a rateable value over £15,000 and less than £51,000, you may be eligible for a cash grant of £3,000 for this 42-day qualifying restrictions period</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if your business has a property with a rateable value of £51,000 or above, you may be eligible for a cash grant of £4,500 for this 42-day qualifying restrictions period</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You will also be eligible for the one-off <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-your-business-is-eligible-for-the-coronavirus-closed-businesses-lockdown-payment">Closed Businesses Lockdown Payment</a>, which your local council should pay together with the grant from the first payment cycle of this scheme.</p>

<h4>Second payment cycle, 16 February to 31 March 2021</h4>

<p>The second payment cycle covers 16 February to 31 March 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if your business has a property with a rateable value of £15,000 or less, you may be eligible for a cash grant of £2,096 for this 44-day qualifying restrictions period</li>
  <li>if your business has a property with a rateable value over £15,000 and less than £51,000, you may be eligible for a cash grant of £3,143 for this 44-day qualifying restrictions period</li>
  <li>if your business has a property with a rateable value of £51,000 or above, you may be eligible for a cash grant of £4,714 for this 44-day qualifying restrictions period</li>
</ul>

<h3>National lockdown between 5 November and 2 December 2020</h3>

<p>If your business has a property with a rateable value of £15,000 or less, you may be eligible for a cash grant of £1,334 for the 28-day qualifying restrictions period.</p>

<p>If your business has a property with a rateable value over £15,000 and less than £51,000, you may be eligible for a cash grant of £2,000 for the 28-day qualifying restrictions period.</p>
