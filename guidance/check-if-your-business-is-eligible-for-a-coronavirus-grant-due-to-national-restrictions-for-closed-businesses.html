<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Your business may be eligible if it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is based in England</li>
  <li>occupies property on which it pays business rates (and is the ratepayer)</li>
  <li>has been required to close because of the national lockdown from 5 January 2021 onwards, or between 5 November and 2 December 2020</li>
  <li>has been unable to provide its usual in-person customer service from its premises</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, this could include non-essential retail, leisure, personal care, sports facilities, tourism and hospitality businesses. It could also include businesses that operate primarily as an in-person venue, but which have been forced to close those services and provide a takeaway-only service instead.</p>

<p>Eligible businesses can get one grant for each non-domestic property.</p>

<h3>Businesses excluded from the fund</h3>

<p>You cannot get funding if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you can continue to operate during the lockdown period because you do not depend on providing direct in-person services from your premises (for example accountants)</li>
  <li>you have chosen to close, but have not been required to close as part of national restrictions</li>
  <li>your business is in administration, insolvent or has been struck off the Companies House register</li>
  <li>you have exceeded the permitted subsidy limit</li>
</ul>

<div class="example">
<p>You must notify your local council if your situation changes and you no longer meet the eligibility criteria.</p>
</div>

<h3>Subsidy allowance</h3>

<p>The new domestic subsidy allowance for the COVID-19 business support grants took effect on 4 March 2021. Applications made prior to that date are subject to the previous rules.</p>

<p>This scheme is covered by 3 subsidy allowances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Small Amounts of Financial Assistance Allowance – you’re allowed up to £335,000 (subject to exchange rates) over any period of 3 years</li>
  <li>COVID-19 Business Grant Allowance – you’re allowed up to £1,600,000</li>
  <li>COVID-19 Business Grant Special Allowance - if you have reached your limits under the Small Amounts of Financial Assistance Allowance and COVID-19 Business Grant Allowance, you may be able to access a further allowance of funding under these scheme rules of up to £9,000,000, provided certain conditions are met</li>
</ul>

<p>Grants under these 3 allowances can be combined for a potential total allowance of up to £10,935,000 (subject to exchange rates).</p>

<h2>What you get</h2>

<p>The grant will be based on the rateable value of the property on the first full day of lockdown.</p>

<h3>National lockdown from 5 January 2021</h3>

  <li>if your business has a property with a rateable value over £15,000 and less than £51,000, you may be eligible for a cash grant of £3,000 for this 42-day qualifying restrictions period</li>

<h4>Second payment cycle, 16 February to 31 March 2021</h4>

<p>The second payment cycle covers 16 February to 31 March 2021:</p>
