<p>This guide is for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality">British citizens</a> travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa or permit.</p>

<p>This information is provided as a guide only. You must always check the exact application process and document requirements with Spain’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://extranjeros.inclusion.gob.es/" rel="external">immigration authorities</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">consulate</a>.</p>

<h2>Entry requirements</h2>

<p>If you’re going to Spain to work (or any other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">EU country</a>, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#passports-check-if-you-need-to-renew">make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attending business meetings.</p>

<p>These are usually covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re going for certain types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.</p>

<p>Spain’s authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. It decides which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You must always check with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://extranjeros.inclusion.gob.es/es/index.html" rel="external">Spanish government</a> before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re working in more than one country you will need to check the entry rules of each country.</p>

<p>If you need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe">passport</a>, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.</p>

<h3>Visa and permit documents</h3>

<p>This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in Spain. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.</p>

<p>It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with Spain’s immigration authorities or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">consulate</a>.</p>

<p>You must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>translated</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">‘legalised’ (apostilised)</a> or notarised</li>
  <li>originals, or if copies are acceptable</li>
  <li>signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)</li>
  <li>dated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application</li>
</ul>

<p>Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa.</p>

<p>This guide uses the same terms used in Spain, so you know which ones to use when speaking to Spain’s authorities.</p>

<h2>Check if you need a visa or permit</h2>
<p>You can travel to Spain for the following reasons without a visa or permit for up to 90 days in a 180-day period:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attending business meetings or discussions</li>
  <li>attending seminars or fact-finding meetings</li>
  <li>attending conferences and workshops</li>
  <li>attending trade shows</li>
  <li>meeting clients or customers (including entertainment like eating at a restaurant)</li>
  <li>receiving classroom-based training</li>
  <li>leisure travel, such as holidays or visiting friends or family</li>
</ul>

<p>You must not receive any payment for these activities from a Spanish company or it could be classed as work.</p>

<p>These activities are covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">visa waiver</a>.</p>

<h3>Border checks</h3>

<p>At the border, you may be asked to show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets</li>
  <li>health insurance that covers your stay</li>
  <li>proof of accommodation for your entire stay</li>
  <li>enough money for the duration of your trip</li>
  <li>an invitation letter from your employer explaining your trip</li>
</ul>

<h2>Check Spain’s exemptions</h2>

<p>Certain types of work and activities do not require a visa or permit because they’re exempt.</p>

<p>All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.</p>

<h3>EU intra-company transfer (EU ICT) permits from other countries</h3>

<p>You do not require a visa or permit in Spain for up to 90 days in a 180-day period if you have an EU ICT permit from another country. Your employer needs to notify Spain’s immigration authorities.</p>

<p>You need to be able to show proof that you’re exempt to the authorities on request. This could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an assignment letter</li>
  <li>an employment confirmation</li>
  <li>a contract</li>
  <li>proof of required qualifications, such as diplomas and professional certificates</li>
  <li>CV</li>
  <li>health insurance</li>
  <li>provisional <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.exteriores.gob.es/Consulados/londres/en/Information-consular-services/Paginas/NIE.aspx" rel="external">NIE (foreigner’s identity number)</a>, if applicable</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to follow the Schengen <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">visa waiver rules</a>.</p>

<h3>Working in the audiovisual sector</h3>

<p>You do not need a visa or permit for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, if you’re an artist, technician or a professional:</p>

<ul>
  <li>working in the audiovisual sector</li>
  <li>completing artistic activities for the public</li>
  <li>recording a piece for the purpose of distributing it through mass media</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to be able to show proof that you’re exempt to the authorities on request. This could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provisional NIE (foreigner’s identity number), if applicable</li>
  <li>Social security cover certificate, if applicable</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have a family they can join you as dependants under this exemption, this includes your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>spouse or partner</li>
  <li>children under 18</li>
  <li>dependant children</li>
  <li>parents or guardians, if you’re under 18</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>If a minor is participating in an artistic activity, Spanish labour law requirements must be considered.</p>
</div>

<p>If you need to stay for longer than 90 days in a 180-day period, you may need to apply for a long-term visa or a residence permit for the audiovisual sector. You should check with the Spanish authorities on the best option for you.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#c-type">C-type EET visa if you’re working up to 90 days</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#d-visa">long-term D visa if you’re working for more than 90 days</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re staying for longer than 6 months, you will need to apply for a residence card once in Spain.</p>

<h3>Further checks</h3>

<p>If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">Spanish embassy</a>.</p>

<h2>Applying for a visa or permit</h2>

<p>This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit, but you’ll need to check the exact rules and processes with the Spanish authorities or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a>.</p>

<h3>Taking your family</h3>

<p>If you have a family they may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://extranjeros.inclusion.gob.es/es/InformacionInteres/InformacionProcedimientos/Ciudadanosnocomunitarios/Reagrupacionfamiliar.html" rel="external">join you as dependants</a>. It depends on the type of work permit you have.</p>

<h3>Visas and permits</h3>

<p>You must apply for a visa if you’re travelling to Spain because you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#c-type">carrying out short-term permit-exempt work</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#d-visa">carrying out long-term permit-exempt work</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You must apply for a visa, work permit and residence permit if you’re travelling to Spain, even for a short period of time, because you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#transfer">transferring to the Spanish branch of a UK-based company</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#employment">working for a Spanish company on a Spanish employment contract</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#services">providing services to a client in Spain</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#self-employed">carrying out self-employed work</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#investor">investing in or founding a company</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Short-term visa for exempt work</h2>
<p>You need a C-type EET visa if you’re carrying out <a class="govuk-link" href="#exempt">permit-exempt work</a> for up to 90 days. You must follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen 90-day in a 180-day period rule</a> when travelling on this visa.</p>

<p>The C-type EET visa takes approximately 15 to 45 days to get. It’s valid for 90 days in a 180-day period and you can’t extend it.</p>

<p>If you have a family they may be able to join you as visitors under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>You need to check with the Spanish authorities on the exact process. This is a rough guide to help you prepare.</p>
<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>You book an appointment at Spain’s consulate in the UK and submit a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://uk.blsspainvisa.com/visa4spain/" rel="external">C-type EET visa application</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spain’s consulate will review your application and issue you with a visa if you meet the exemption conditions.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Application documents</h3>

<p>Spanish authorities may request different documents at different stages of the process. Usually, they need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>completed C visa application form</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.exteriores.gob.es/Consulados/londres/en/Information-consular-services/Documents/Checklist%20%28Business%29.pdf" rel="external">C visa checklist</a></li>
  <li>passport valid for a minimum of 90 days beyond your intended stay</li>
  <li>recent passport-sized colour photo</li>
  <li>invitation letter or contract from the company in Spain detailing the work you’ll be carrying out</li>
  <li>a ‘no objection letter’ from your employer detailing the conditions of your employment, if you’re an employee</li>
  <li>trade licence, accountant’s letter or proof of taxes paid in the past year, if you’re self-employed</li>
  <li>proof you <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.exteriores.gob.es/Consulados/londres/en/Information-consular-services/Documents/Checklist%20%28Business%29.pdf" rel="external">have enough money to support yourself</a>, such as certified bank statements for the past 3 months</li>
  <li>proof of return travel</li>
  <li>proof of accommodation for your entire stay in Spain, such as hotel reservations</li>
  <li>proof of health insurance cover for your entire stay</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional documents for your type of work</h3>

<p>You may have to show accreditations or authorisations issued by the Spanish authorities, or other documentation, showing you’re carrying out exempt work.</p>
