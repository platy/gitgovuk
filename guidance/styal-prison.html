<h2>Book and plan your visit to Styal</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Now that regular COVID testing of people in the wider community has ended, you are no longer required to take a COVID test before coming to see someone for a visit, although we would still encourage you to do so.</p>

<p>We will continue to run social visits whilst it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>Visiting rules may change if there is an outbreak within the prison, this may include bringing back testing before visits for a short time to protect you, the person you are visiting and staff.</p>

<p>If you are unable to visit someone in prison you can still <a class="govuk-link" href="#keepintouch">keep in touch</a>.</p>

<p>You can also contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/helpline" rel="external">Prisoners’ Families Helpline</a> on 0808 808 2003. You will not be able to book a visit using this number.</p>
</div>

<p>To visit someone in Styal you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be on that person’s visitor list (only the prisoner can add you to or remove you from their visitor list)</li>
  <li>book your visit at least 48 hours in advance</li>
  <li>have the <a class="govuk-link" href="#entering-styal">the required <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr></a> with you when you go</li>
</ul>

<p>At least one visitor must be 18 or older at every visit. A maximum of 3 adults and 2 children can visit at one time.</p>

<p>The number of visits a person can have depends on if they are on remand or have been convicted. You can check this with Styal.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Styal</a> if you have any questions about visiting.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Styal</h2>

<p>You may not be able to speak with someone at Styal during their first few days. This is because it can take up to 48 hours to approve who they can be in touch with.</p>

<p>One supervised phone call is allowed on arrival in the First Night Centre. If a prisoner has restrictions in place they will not be able to make a call.</p>

<p>Women do not have phones in their rooms so they will always need to call you rather than you call them.</p>

<p>If you need to contact someone in Styal urgently, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">phone the switchboard</a> and ask to speak to the Duty Governor or Orderly Officer.</p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners can only phone you if you are named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in Styal using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies from the prisoner, depending on the rules at Styal.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>Include the person’s name and prison number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prison number, you can use their date of birth instead or you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-prisoner">find out their prison number</a>.</p>

<p>All post apart from legal letters will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>
<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>

<p>Prisoners are given a list of approved items that can be sent to them as gifts. <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Styal</a> for more information on what’s allowed.</p>

<p>Make sure to include the person’s name and prison number on the parcel.</p>

<p>Friends and families of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.
&nbsp;
For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>

<p>All parcels will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Life at Styal</h2>
<p>Styal is committed to providing a safe and educational environment where women can learn new skills and focus on their personal development.</p>

<h3>Security and safeguarding</h3>
<p>Every person at Styal has a right to feel safe. The staff are responsible for their safeguarding and welfare at all times.</p>

<p>For further information about what to do when you are worried or concerned about someone in prison <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/pages/category/need-urgent-help?Take=24" rel="external">visit the Prisoners’ Families helpline website</a>.</p>

<p>All safeguarding processes are overseen by <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.stopadultabuse.org.uk/home.aspx" rel="external">Cheshire East Safeguarding Adults Board</a>.</p>

<p>Styal also has a peer mentoring scheme. Trained prisoners give other women advice and tell them about agencies that can help them. Some also organise book clubs to help improve reading skills.</p>

<p>Mentors work towards a level 2 qualification in mentoring.</p>

<h3>Arrival and first night</h3>
<p>When people first arrive they stay in the First Night Centre for up to 48 hours before moving to their accommodation.</p>

<p>They are interviewed by an officer and are introduced to living in custody. The officer will explain the prison rules and they will be offered a hot meal, shower and a phone call to their family or partner.</p>

<p>After that, they will see a nurse who can help with any healthcare needs.</p>

<p>They will be given toiletries and be able to buy a grocery pack or a vape pack. They can borrow money from the prison if they have no cash on them when they arrive.</p>

<p>New prisoners will also meet the duty chaplain, mental health nurse and domestic abuse support worker during their first 48 hours to help with any concerns they might have.</p>

<h3>Induction</h3>
<p>Each person who arrives at Styal gets an induction that lasts about a week. They will meet professionals who will help them with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>health and wellbeing, including mental and sexual health</li>
  <li>any substance misuse issues, including drugs and alcohol</li>
  <li>personal development in custody and on release, including skills, education and training</li>
  <li>other support (sometimes called ‘interventions’), such as managing difficult emotions</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone also finds out about the rules, fire safety, and how things like calls and visits work.</p>

<h3>Accommodation</h3>
<p>Around 480 women live at Styal.</p>

<p>The accommodation is a mix of dormitories and individual rooms.</p>

<p>Styal also has a Mother and Baby Unit for women with babies up to 18 months. The unit is run by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.actionforchildren.org.uk/" rel="external">Action for Children</a> charity.</p>

<h3>Faith services</h3>
<p>The diverse chaplaincy team offers weekly services, personal development courses, bereavement support and a quiet space for personal prayer.</p>

<h3>Education and work</h3>
<p>The education at Styal is provided by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.novus.ac.uk/" rel="external">Novus</a> and includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>English and maths</li>
  <li>hairdressing and beauty</li>
  <li>functional skills</li>
  <li>IT and business admin</li>
  <li>painting and decorating</li>
  <li>horticulture</li>
</ul>

<p>Prisoners in the Mother and Baby Unit can take part in programmes that support the development of their child. There’s also a crèche so mothers can attend other education classes.</p>

<p>The library, provided by Cheshire County Council, has several computers for learning (without internet access) as well as a range of books, CDs and DVDs.</p>

<p>Prisoners produce a quarterly magazine called ‘Innit’ which received a national award for the quality of journalism in 2006.</p>

<h3>Temporary release</h3>
<p>Women at Styal can be considered for release on temporary licence. It depends on where they are in their sentence and a thorough risk assessment.</p>

<p>Women can be considered for childcare resettlement if they can show that they were the sole carer of their child before they came into custody and will be again on release. This also depends on a thorough risk assessment.</p>
