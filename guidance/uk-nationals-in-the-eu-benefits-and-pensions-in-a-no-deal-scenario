<h2 id="i-am-a-uk-national-living-in-the-eu--will-i-still-get-my-state-pension">I am a UK national living in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.  Will I still get my State Pension?</h2>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h2 id="will-uk-nationals-continue-to-get-their-state-pension-uprated-under-no-deal">Will UK nationals continue to get their State Pension uprated under no deal?</h2>

<p>The UK leaving the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> will not affect entitlement to continue receiving the UK State Pension if you live in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, and we are committed to uprate across the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> in 2019 to 2020. We would wish to continue uprating pensions beyond that but would take decisions in light of whether, as we would hope and expect, reciprocal arrangements with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> are in place.</p>

<h2 id="will-uk-nationals-continue-to-get-their-benefits-transferred-to-eu-countries-including-child-benefit-and-disability-benefit">Will UK nationals continue to get their benefits transferred to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries including child benefit and disability benefit?</h2>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h2 id="will-i-still-be-eligible-for-my-in-country-benefits-paid-by-the-host-country">Will I still be eligible for my in-country benefits paid by the host country?</h2>

<p>In the event the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, the UK will call on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and its member countries to continue their commitments to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> citizens and protect the rights of UK nationals living in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries.</p>

<p>We want UK nationals to be able to stay in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries that they live in when the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, and for their rights to employment, healthcare, education, benefits and services to be protected.</p>

<h2 id="i-live-in-the-eea-and-have-an-annuity-or-personal-pension-from-a-uk-based-firm-will-i-still-be-able-to-get-payments-from-my-annuity-or-personal-pension">I live in the EEA, and have an annuity or personal pension from a UK-based firm. Will I still be able to get payments from my annuity or personal pension?</h2>

<p>If you live in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">EEA</a> and have an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/personal-pensions-your-rights">annuity or personal pension</a> with a UK-based firm, your firm should have made plans to make sure you can still get payments from your annuity or personal pension, even if the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal.</p>

<p>If your firm needs to make any changes to your annuity or personal pension or the way it provides it, your firm should contact you.</p>

<p>If you have any concerns about whether you might be affected you should contact your firm.</p>

<h2 id="i-am-uk-citizen-living-in-the-eu-will-i-still-be-able-to-receive-my-uk-private-occupational-pension">I am UK citizen living in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, will I still be able to receive my UK private occupational pension?</h2>

<p>There is nothing in UK private occupational pensions legislation that prevents occupational pension schemes from making pension payments overseas. We do not expect that this will change as a result of the UK withdrawing from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="uk-and-ireland-agreement">UK and Ireland agreement</h2>

<p>The UK government has announced an agreement on social security with Ireland, guaranteeing continued access to State Pension and benefits for UK and Irish citizens and their qualifying family members when in the other’s state.</p>

<p>This means the rights of UK and Irish citizens living and working in each other’s state are protected after the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> – including transferring certain benefits like child benefit and disability benefits – if there’s no deal.</p>
