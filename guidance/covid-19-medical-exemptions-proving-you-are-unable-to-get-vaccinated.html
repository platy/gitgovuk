<h2>Why you may need to show your COVID status</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-covid-pass"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID Pass</a> lets individuals share their COVID-19 vaccination records or test results in a secure way.</p>

<p>You may need to demonstrate your COVID status to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>work or volunteer in a care home regulated by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) from 11 November 2021 
(although you can use your self-certification until 31 March 2022 if you self-certify by 24 December 2021 - see the section below called ‘If you work or volunteer in a care home’)</li>
  <li>be exempt from self-isolating for 7 days if you are a close contact of somebody with a confirmed case of COVID-19</li>
  <li>enter venues and events in England that require the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID Pass as a condition of entry</li>
  <li>be exempt from quarantine and completing a test on day 8 if you travel from a country that’s not on the red list</li>
</ul>

<h2>If you’re unable to get vaccinated against COVID-19 for medical reasons</h2>

<p>Some individuals are unable to be vaccinated and also, in some cases, tested, for medical reasons. You can apply for proof that you have a medical reason why you should not be vaccinated or why you should not be vaccinated and tested.</p>

<p>If you get this proof of medical exemption you’ll be able to use the domestic <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID Pass wherever you need to prove your COVID-19 status within England.</p>

<p>If you are exempt from vaccination only, you are encouraged to take a test before entering a venue, to protect yourself and others. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/test-results/" rel="external">show a text or email confirmation</a> of a negative test.</p>

<h2>The <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID Pass for people who are medically exempt from vaccinations</h2>

<p>All exemptions will be assessed by your doctor, specialist clinician or midwife. The outcome will be sent directly back to you. If approved, your domestic <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID Pass can then be used to prove your status.</p>

<p>The domestic <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID Pass will look and work the same for people with medical exemptions as it will for people who are fully vaccinated. The pass will not show that you have a medical exemption.</p>

<p>You’ll also get a confirmation letter which you should keep for your records. You can use the letter to prove that you’re unable to get vaccinated if you work or volunteer in a care home or are travelling from a country that’s not on the red list. The letter will say that you’re medically unable to get vaccinated. The letter does not explain the reason you’re unable to vaccinate.</p>

<p>It’s up to other countries to decide whether or not residents in England with a medical exemption can follow the same rules for travel as those who are fully vaccinated.</p>

<h2>Reasons you could get a medical exemption</h2>

<p>The possible reasons for exemptions are limited. Examples that might be reasons for a medical exemption are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>people receiving end of life care where vaccination is not in the person’s best interests</li>
  <li>people with learning disabilities, autism or a combination of impairments which mean that vaccination and testing result in distress and who cannot be vaccinated through reasonable adjustments such as an accessible environment</li>
  <li>a person with severe allergies to all currently available vaccines</li>
  <li>those who have had an adverse reaction to the first dose (for example, myocarditis)</li>
</ul>

<p>Other medical conditions could also allow you to get a medical exemption.</p>

<p>You can also get a temporary exemption which will allow you to use the COVID Pass if you have a short-term medical condition or are pregnant and choose to take this option.</p>

<h2>How to apply for and receive your COVID Pass when you’re unable to be vaccinated</h2>

<p>A carer can apply on your behalf.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Phone the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID Pass service on 119 to ask for an <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID Pass medical exemptions application form.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can also call to find out more information about <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID Pass medical exemptions.</p>

<p>The call handler at the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID Pass service will ask you some questions. 
You will need to give:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your name</li>
  <li>your date of birth</li>
  <li>your <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> number (if you know it)</li>
  <li>the name of your <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> and/or specialist clinician</li>
</ul>

<p>2. If you’re eligible to apply, you’ll get an application form by post.</p>

<p>You should not ask your <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> for an application form. If you do go to your <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> before you get your application form you’ll be asked to call the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID Pass service on 119.</p>

<p>3. Return your application form to the <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> or relevant clinician stated on the form.</p>

<p>Your application will be clinically reviewed by your doctor, specialist or midwife. Your <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr>, specialist or midwife may ask to speak with you if needed, but you won’t need to book this when you submit your application.</p>

<p>4. You’ll automatically get the results of your application by post once your application has been processed.</p>

<p>You don’t need to contact your <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> or the clinician reviewing your exemption unless they ask you to contact them.</p>

<p>5. If you get a medical exemption you can use the domestic <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID Pass wherever you need to.</p>

<p>The pass won’t show others that you have a medical exemption, just that you have the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID Pass.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/get-digital-covid-pass/">access your <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID Pass digitally – on the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> app or the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>You can also download it as a pdf.</p>

<p>To request a paper version of your pass, call 119.</p>

<p>Find out <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/covid-pass/" class="govuk-link">more about the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID Pass on the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>6. The clinical decision on your medical exemption is final. You can’t appeal the decision.</p>

<p>Receiving an exemption does not mean you are protected against COVID-19. You should self-isolate if you have any symptoms of COVID-19.</p>

<h2>Other ways to show your exempt COVID status</h2>

<h3>If you work or volunteer in a care home</h3>

<p>If you work or volunteer in a care home, you can temporarily <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/temporary-medical-exemptions-for-covid-19-vaccination-of-people-working-or-deployed-in-care-homes" class="govuk-link">self-certify that you’re medically exempt from vaccination</a>. This means that, for a short time, you can tell your employer yourself that you’re unable to vaccinate, without getting a doctor to say it, and you can keep working.</p>

<p>You must complete the self-certification form and show it to your employer by 24 December 2021. You can then use it until 31 March 2022.</p>

<p>From 1 April 2022, you’ll need to use the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID Pass to prove your COVID-19 vaccination status.</p>

<h3>If you’re pregnant</h3>

<p>Pregnant women can get the COVID-19 vaccination.</p>

<p>If you choose not to vaccinate, you can  use your MAT B1 certificate to show your COVID status - you don’t have to use the COVID Pass.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can apply for a short-term medical exemption so that you can use the COVID Pass.</p>

<p>Whether you use the MAT B1 certificate or the COVID Pass, your medical exemption will expire 16 weeks after you give birth. This will allow you to become fully vaccinated after birth.</p>

<p>The Royal College of Obstetricians, Royal College of Midwives and the UK Tetralogy Service consider COVID vaccination to be safe. They recommend that pregnant women get vaccinated against COVID.</p>

<h2>If you’ve taken part in a vaccine trial</h2>

<p>If you’re a resident in England and have taken part, or are taking part, in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials you can get a domestic <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID Pass to use in England and a travel <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID Pass to use abroad.</p>

<p>You don’t need to apply for a medical exemption. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-covid-pass#residents-in-england-who-have-taken-part-in-covid-19-vaccine-clinical-trials">more information on proving your COVID status after vaccine clinical trials</a>.</p>
